"How to deal with racism in shops and restaurants?","<p>I'm Israeli. I travel to the UK about twice a year. I generally try to be polite and pleasant around people, so very often a smiling waitress in a café or an assistant in a shop would ask me where I'm from. It's a safe question, right? Like the weather.</p>

<p>And then I say I'm from Israel. And the smiles drop. And the pleasant service with them. I've had checks handed to me before I asked for them and when I was still considering to order something else. I've had assistants in clothes stores suddenly becoming busy with another customer, or changing with another assistant.</p>

<p>How should I respond to such situations? I mean, refusing someone service because of who they are is the very epitome of racism.</p>

<p>My desired outcome would be waiters, assistants etc. not doing that. Do I confront them, ask something like ""Have I done something that upsets you? Why wouldn't you help me any more?"" Do I just give up, grin and bear it, the way my ancestors did for generations? Do I have other options available to me?</p>

<p>The one thing I'm not prepared to do is say I'm from somewhere else. I'm proud of where I come from, I will not hide it like I'm ashamed.</p>

"How to deal with avoiding someone I don't like","<p>Currently, as part of my work, I come into proximity with a lot of people (via getting food, to being at some company-wide meeting, or just at a mutual work friend's party), some of whom I do not like (as in, I do not like what their personality is like, so, it's not something they can actively change) and try actively to avoid, making sure to stay away from locations they're in and placing myself in environments which I know he will prefer to avoid (such as being with friends or in a location he never visits). However, owing to my work, from time to time I do encounter him, and he often asks the question, ""Is everything okay, are you avoiding me?"" (or questions to that effect).</p>

<p>In order to seem polite, I tell him that it's just coincidence we haven't seen each other for a while and that I've just been busy elsewhere for the time. Is this the correct approach? Or should I try to tell him that I am avoiding him or break it to him some other way that I do not enjoy his company?</p>

<p>(A bit more background:  I do not have to work with this person on a regular basis, and he is not a massive inconvenience to avoid, but when I do see/meet him it is awkward to try and think of a way out of this situation. I, myself, can get easily agitated by certain people and feel a lot of discomfort in their presence. It's not necessary for me to see him at all, but he feels as though we need to (no idea why, he just does). I'm a polite person, and hate deliberately causing someone discomfort, which is probably why I haven't shut him down since his first attempts to strike up conversation with me. We first talked after one party, and as I grew to know him more I found that I actually disliked his personality more and more.)</p>

"How can I communicate that failure to follow through on commitments bothers me?","<p>I live with my roommate, who is not a bad person in any way. However, it so happens he has issues keeping commitments. </p>

<p>A typical conversation:<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: Do you want to go to X place at Y time.<br>
  <strong>Him</strong>: Yes, no problem.<br>
  <strong>Me</strong>: Are you sure. If you are busy, no problem, I can go on my own.<br>
  <strong>Him</strong>: No, no it's not an issue. I will definitely go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now as it happens, he has a habit of oversleeping and he has a better mode of transportation than I do have. I do not want to disturb a person who is usually sleeping, and sharing a ride with him decreases travel time a lot.
Based on that two situation arises:</p>

<p><strong>Situation 1 - He does not want to go.</strong></p>

<p>If he does not want to go, he tells me at a moment where I am pretty much helpless. Using an inferior mode of transportation at the last minute is pretty useless - since I will miss the event anyway. I can not say him anything since it is his choice.</p>

<p><strong>Situation 2 - He want to go.</strong></p>

<p>Now even if he plans to go, it means he is awake and he is going to go. However, I will still be late due his lethargic attitude to be in time. I can not say no out of politeness and to avoid confrontation.</p>

<p>So, why am I interested in inviting him in the first place? I believe I am a social being and most of the time, I think that our interest might intersect. 
That's why if I do not invite him, I feel morally guilty. If I do invite him there is a very good chance that I might be affected in some way.</p>

<p>How can I communicate to my roommate that his repeated failure to follow through on commitments is bothering me?</p>

"Joining an existing group of friends","<p>Many times we try to blend in with some friend's friends. However, being accepted into that group of friends is not so simple, for a few reasons. </p>

<p>While hanging around that group does allow someone to familiarize with the group and also creates introductions, it does not mean that one is fully integrated into the group. It is not the same as being an active member of the group. Personally, I noticed that I don't get invited to their meetups, unless I specifically ask to join, which isn't the case for most of the members of the group.</p>

<p>This specific group of friends is not a diverse one. There is a very leveled plain in terms of background.</p>

<p>What can I do to make the rest of the group of friends more at ease with me, and possibly accept me into their group? </p>

<p>More specifically, what should I do so that they would invite me to meet-ups?</p>

"How to act with a grieving person at a party?","<p>A friend of mine celebrated his birthday a week after I graduated. I was seated on a table with a couple of mutual friends, and the host's neighbour. The neighbour is 18 and suddenly lost her father 3 months ago, leaving her all alone (the mother has died 10 years ago). </p>

<p>It was obvious that she is feeling out of place at that party, very subdued and sad. I didn't know how to react to that, and decided to wait it out and just act normal. My friends started the topic of my graduation, and I was quite elated during the conversation. </p>

<p>The neighbour was just sitting there with hanging shoulders, not participating, which made me somewhat uncomfortable. I wanted her to feel less excluded since she could obviously not relate to the situation, so in a lull of the conversation, I asked a simple ""how are you doing?"". It proved too much - she broke down and sobbed for quite some time. </p>

<p>It seemed to me that sitting together with excited people discussing a happy life event was distressing for her, that the contrast with her own situation increased her own feelings of sadness and loneliness. It was also awkward that I had not seen her since her father's death, so I had not had a chance to give her my condolences. </p>

<p>Could I have done/said something to make the situation less painful for her? Preferably without having to hide my own joy of the graduation, and the pleasure of spending an evening with friends. I am not talking of artificially cheering her up, just sparing her the extra discomfort she seemed to feel from my behavior. </p>

"How can I notice if someone is speaking with sarcasm or irony?","<p>I ask this question from a European country; consider your answers this way.</p>

<p>Some people are unable to differentiate serious talking, jokes, and irony or sarcasm. Specifically for the latter, as it's a very thin line between seriousness and joking (and the meaning of sarcasm and irony is also not always well-defined), how should I be aware of someone using irony and/or sarcasm?</p>

<p>Usually, people can notice it ""in their guts"", as if it was some sort of reflex. If I'm not wrong, then how can I ""adapt"" this reflex? If I'm wrong, then what should I consider?</p>

"How to ask cashier out for date","<p>I am 21 years old and living in a large city in Germany where smalltalk in local markets is not a common thing.</p>

<p>A new cashier joined my local food shop. She’s always at the checkout and never doing stuff like sorting products or cleaning the floor where I could actually ask her out. I am quite new to relationships, but the signs she gave me are promising.</p>

<p>My question is how I can ask for her number, or ask her out for coffee while she is only sitting at the checkout? I mean there are always like 5 people before and after me, and I think it would be awkward if we are changing numbers while customers are waiting behind us. Or even worse if I read the signs wrong and she rejects me? Since the store is just 5 min away from my place I visit regularly and don't want to leave a bad impression there.</p>

"What to do when meeting an online friend in real life for the first time?","<p>In a few weeks time, a friend from the Netherlands is coming over to spend a week with me in the UK. She is female (and I am male), we are both the same age, and are friends (there's nothing special between us). We have known each other for nearly a year now, and I am nervous as to how to handle meeting her. Is there a certain way I should act/behave with her when we first see each other? Are there things I should do during her stay?</p>

<p>I'm concerned about doing the wrong things and either appearing weird or to be too romantic (which I'd rather not do) but also not having loads of awkward silences during the meet up.</p>

<p>More context on our friendship: we have never met in person before, however, we frequently video call each other and play various online games, enjoying each other's company and also supporting each other often in times of need. We message all the time across various platforms and are extremely close friends.</p>

"What is the politest way to follow up on an ignored email?","<p>I send a lot of emails - some important and some not. I often get replies for the important ones promptly, but the less important ones can often be forgotten.</p>

<p>I understand this - I'm sure I do the same sometimes.</p>

<p>This specific case is me emailing a local politician. We spoke at an open village meeting and I emailed to ask for clarification about something he said. He hasn't replied. </p>

<p>When I need an answer, how should I follow up? I will sometimes forward the email I sent onto them again, with a short message like <em>""Hi, did you get a chance to take a look at this""</em> - and then it's obvious I've been waiting. Is this too passive aggressive?</p>

"When is it more suitable to say ""no problem"" versus ""you're welcome""?","<p>Most times, when I am thanked - I respond using <strong>no problem</strong> rather than saying <strong>you're welcome</strong>. I find it more habitual for me to say the former than the latter.</p>

<p>In terms of a societal standpoint, are there people out there who prefer one of the two answers? When is it best to say one answer over the other? Or is it just likable using both terms - or does the terms go better with certain situations?</p>

"Managing a bad temper in close relationships","<p>I've always had a short fuse. I've been quick to rise and lose my temper, but on the flip side I'm quick to get over it when others lose their cool. The problem is that others usually are not, especially if they are on the receiving end of it. </p>

<p>Having a short temper and saying things in anger is the number one cause of the relationship difficulties in my life, and it's caused more problems and heart ache than I could possibly set out to achieve if I was consciously trying to do so.</p>

<p>Most importantly, it can happen with family or close friends, when somehow a discussion leads to someone making an insult towards me (which I don't tolerate well) and from there it can escalate. There are definitely certain topics that will frequently lead to these types of escalations, as well as when I don't want to discuss something and the person persists. It can also happen when the other person argues with me - about who I am or my motive for saying or doing something - and their opinion is negative.</p>

<p>I have great difficulty expressing my irritation without it escalating between the other person and myself to a point I do not manage well emotionally.</p>

<p>What can I do to help circumvent or prevent my anger building to a point I lose my temper and say things I regret? What skills can I use to exit the discussion gracefully to find space to calm?</p>

"What to talk about with a person you meet through a mutual friend on the bus?","<p>It often happens to me, that I met some friend in the bus/tram/subway etc., but my friend is not alone, but with his/her friend (whom I don't know at all).</p>

<p>We are talking about something, my friend knows both of us, so there is no problem.
Then my friend gets off the vehicle and only this ""stranger"" and I remain. If we stop talking, it is awkward. 
But we don't know anything about each other (sometimes not even the name). We probably won't see each other ever again, and we would probably enjoy reading a book or playing with our smartphones much more than talking to each other.</p>

"How to converse about a topic you don't like or know about?","<p>I have friends who will engage conversations with me about topics that either <strong>I know nothing about</strong> or that <strong>I just don't care for</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My closest group of friends (which include around 6 people whom I talk to very often) talk about superhero movies and shows. They constantly ask me if I watched a certain movie or am caught up on a particular show?</p>

<p>I only like a select few shows and movies, but I don't care for the rest - and always feel lost when they all talk about the latest episode of a popular show. During moments like these, I feel out of the loop. </p>

"Help my mother to understand my choice when it comes to having children","<p>While my mother is usually extremely understanding of my choices in life, there is one choice on which she cannot agree, and it is my decision not to have children.</p>

<p>Each time the subject comes to the table, it leads to an argument as she loves having grandchildren (both my elder sisters are mothers, and she expects me to become a father down the line).</p>

<p>I have tried to explain to her my point of view :</p>

<ul>
<li>I can't stand children, and I don't know how to act towards them.</li>
<li>I wish to focus on my own life, goals, and hobby and don't want to spend time taking care of a child.</li>
<li>I do not want the responsibilities that come with being a father.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are my reasons not to have a child and my SO shares that point of view. </p>

<p>I have also tried to dismiss the subjet when it appears.</p>

<p>But each time a discussion starts about children, we come under fire and they usually give arguments such as ""you'll want children later"" or ""you'll love children when you have some"".</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>How can I get my mother to support our choice, even if she does not agree with it?</strong></p>

<p>We're in France and everyone concerned is French.</p>

<p><strong>Note :</strong> this question is close to the question <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2061/how-can-i-tell-people-that-my-girlfriend-and-i-dont-want-children-of-our-own"">How can I tell people that my girlfriend and I don't want children of our own?</a> but different.

"How can I prevent an appearance of micromanaging someone?","<p>I have a personality trait (desire to understand details and confirm them) that very often can be mistakenly perceived by people as micromanaging them (even though my intent in what I ask/say is purely centered on my mental details and NOT on what/how I want them to do).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: <em>notices that the person I gave the task to does it way X</em></p>
  
  <p>Me: ""I noticed you did it way X, curious why not way Y?"" {note that I'm 100% genuinely curious here; and <strong>not</strong> intending to tell them to do it my way}</p>
  
  <p>Taskee: ""Stop micromanaging me!"" (they may not say it outright but sometimes they say it later, so I know it happens often).</p>

"How to shut down regionalist remarks from coworkers and friends without being rude?","<p>I come from a land where regionalism is at its peaks. The moment I tell them that I am from a particular region, stereotyping and judgement begins. Mocking, sarcasm etc are all part of it. This is quite common at both the workplace and the apartment where I share with a few others. </p>

<p>On the contrary, I do not have affinity towards any part of the country. I do not get judgmental. I talk to everyone in the same manner. I am old enough to understand that this kind of mockery or coming to irrational conclusions is foolishly common. I only feel sorry for them that they are extending these views to everyone they meet rather than trying to know the person, individually. </p>

<p>A few incidents to cite.</p>

<p>When I am cooking a particular dish, there would be a taunting remark from my flatmate, as 'We don't use these kind of spices or this amount of spices'. </p>

<p>While I am watching a movie on TV or laptop, there would be a remark, 'I wonder how you understand this language so well.'</p>

<p>Or 'I have never seen anyone from your region getting dressed up like you. You are different from the rest. Where did you learn this from?' </p>

<p>It feels like I have to prove every single time I come across people from other regions. Probably that is what they expect me to do, i.e., give a reason or explanation to why I am being the person I am rather than accepting me for what I am. </p>

<p>If this is really relevant here, the answer is I am a natural at picking up things related to fashion, cooking or my diction. I do not have to struggle much about it. </p>

<p>Most of the times, I remain silent. I never answer nor do I tend to reply to such silly remarks. But, over the years, this has started to get overwhelming. I am sick of hearing those kind of statements. And at the same time I do not want to sound rude to them. </p>

<p><strong>How can I shut down regionalist remarks without being rude?</strong><br>
I do not want to burn any bridges, since these people are coworkers, roommates or family. But I would really like these comments to stop.</p>

"How to rebuff probing questions when introducing my girlfriend to acquaintances as a friend?","<p>I come from India, where the culture is a little more conservative than in the West. I am a woman dating a woman (Let's call her D), currently in the US. My girlfriend's roommate's parents recently came to visit her in the US, and I was over at her place. Since I knew they were coming, I pitched in to help with the cooking/cleaning activities and hung out with them too, since I often hang out at my GF's house and her roommates (Let's call them A). </p>

<p>While her parents were very nice to me and conversing, they wanted to know how I knew D. In Indian society, dating is still a little new, and one would not generally introduce one's significant other to a friend's parents even in a heterosexual relationship.  I was introduced as her friend. Her parents, however, were confused as to how we met and ended up being good friends, since we both go to different schools here in the US. I brushed it off by saying that we had common friends and had attended a few science events. </p>

<p>They returned the next weekend, and I hung out with my girlfriend again, as I do over weekends. We all had breakfast/lunch at home. They all wanted to go shopping after, and I was planning to head home, not wanting to intrude on their activity. However, my girlfriend wasn't feeling very well, so I decided to stay at her house with her while they (roommates and parents) all went out. </p>

<p>D's roommate told us when they came back, that the parents had a lot of questions about how exactly I know D, why I spend so much time at home with her, whether I come everyday when I live far away, and whether D has a boyfriend. This made both of us a little uncomfortable, especially when D's roommate asked us to come up with names and some story for how we know each other.</p>

<p>How do I gracefully indicate that while I respect them, they are not our parents and really have no business having to know the details of where and how we met and how we know each other, or have a problem with how much time I spend with D? In general as well, when I don't want to go into the whole 'D is my girlfriend' and have to deal with potential homophobia or shocked faces, how do I get people to be satisfied with 'I'm a friend of D's' and not have to answer detailed questions of how and why?</p>

"Would it be unseemly or worse to ask a Japanese acquaintance if I could name my cat after him?","<p>This question is now moot, because the cat died several years ago at an advanced age, but I have always been curious as to whether it would have been OK or horribly rude or somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Years ago, I attended a conference in Japan, and a young Japanese professor (clearly destined for a great future and who is now well known in his field) was very attentive to the people from the US who were attending the conference, and greatly enhanced our enjoyment of the conference and Japan.  </p>

<p>A year later, my husband and I adopted two rescue kittens, and after a weekend of cudgeling our brains for names, decided to name the male after the professor, whose last name was Kit-----, because we could then call the male Kiti for short.  We named the female <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diary_of_Lady_Murasaki"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lady Murasaki</a>, Saki for short.</p>

<p>If the professor had been in the US, I could have easily found a mutual close acquaintance to sound out the professor's likely reaction to the question, and, if positive, asked in a way that put no obligation on him to say yes.  But I didn't have mutual acquaintances in Japan, I didn't want to risk a misunderstanding, and at that time I was senior to him.  I did the right thing in not asking; that's not the question. </p>

<p>The question is: would it have been intrinsically offensive to ask a Japanese to name a cat after him?  Or would it just depend on how much he liked cats?</p>

<p>I am hoping for an answer from someone familiar with Japanese culture.  I know that there is a cat, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Bobtail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Japanese Bobtail</a>, that is very popular in Japan, but I don't know if Japanese culture has any position on naming a cat after a person.  As I've already said, it may depend simply on how a particular person feels about cats.   </p>

"What is the etiquette for asking a dog owner before I pet their dog?","<p>Dogs are what I see mostly out on my day to day activities and I see some tied up outside shops and I'll pet them, I'll also pet some in passing i.e. just stroking them as I walk past and sometimes as they're walking past me (if they come over towards me and sniff my shoes or something). After I've pet them the owner will indicate if they don't want anyone petting them or not i.e. ""Ah sorry, she's really shy!"" if they shy away, or ""She's not good around people"" or simply call their dog over/pull the lead or something like that and they won't say anything normally if they don't.</p>

<p>I'm not a dog owner so it may seem obvious to some. I'm very laid back and would let people pet my dog without asking me if I had one (depending if the dog enjoyed being stroked). Which made me wonder, should I always ask a dog owner before I pet their dog? </p>

<p>I've never had any problems with this previously, any angry owners or anything. (Which is why I'm asking) They generally just walk off with the dog, but I'm thinking more about someone who has a dog. Is it more polite for me to ask than for me to not?</p>

<p>Would the other person be waiting for some type of monetary retribution? If not, could I myself offer such reward? Would it not be considered rude? (in the sense that the other person is doing me a favour out of kindness and not out of financial gain).</p>

<p>Context is United Kingdom.</p>

<hr>

<p>PS: for those interested in the actual outcome, I met the person, and made the gesture of opening my wallet while telling him ""please accept this small gift in return"", to which he denied immediately, saying that it was not a problem at all. I preferred this than actually having my money ready in my hand, to reduce the awkwardness of me pushing money to the OP and the OP pushing it back to me.</p>

"How to deal with wife's ex coming to our house over finances-related issues?","<p>We live in Berwyn, IL, and commute to Chicago (well...my wife does, I work in Berwyn). I'm a transplant from Los Angeles, been here for 8 years now.</p>

<p>Anyway, last Monday night, my wife's ex, a guy called John* showed up at our door, he said he'd found our address through a WHOIS (my wife has her own websites), and he told us he was a cop in the NYPD and was in full uniform, said he couldn't cope on a cop's wage and was asking for a loan of $50,000 to help get his life back on track. He was very polite, told me he needed to see my wife about something. </p>

<p>My wife Jenny* was civil towards him, told him straight off the bat that he wasn't getting a loan, and it seemed fairly civil.
I was there the whole time, decided since he was polite, and it concerned my wife, not to interfere.</p>

<p>Jenny told me how he explained to her that although he liked his job as a cop and was Manhattan-born and bred, he felt his cop's wage wasn't enough to live on and wanted a loan towards buying a penthouse (my wife told me this over dinner later that nite).</p>

<p>He left that same night.</p>

<p>However, he returned again this Tuesday when I was in work, and my wife told me about this.</p>

<p>Why would an NYPD cop come all the way to near Chicago to beg his ex-girlfriend for money, and also, why in his cop uniform as well?</p>

<p>I don't know what to do for the best... do I tell his employers or do I let my wife sort it out for herself; she's actually asked me for advice on what to do.</p>

<p>What is the appropriate response in this situation? Is there even one?</p>

"Should I demand to be treated equally to my siblings by my relatives?","<p><sub> Inspired by a related question: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3086/how-should-i-handle-disagreeing-with-my-sisters-cash-cow-milking"">How should I handle disagreeing with my sisters cash cow milking?</a> </sub></p>

<h3>First, my situation.</h3>

<p>I have a good education (tertiary education) and a decent and very demanding job. I'm almost 30 and I make enough money to live with my girlfriend in a quite comfortable way. I'm definitely not rich though, I drive an old car, I could afford to eat out at a restaurant maybe once a month and unfortunately, I have to pay a good amount of money each month for health related issues. </p>

<h3>Second, the situation of my brother.</h3>

<p>He's over 30, has a not-too-bad education (HS) and a different lifestyle, where he prefers to work part-time and spend most of his time doing ""fun"" activities.</p>

<p>Some years ago he moved with his wife to a family property in a very remote place that was basically unused. My parents offered him to let him stay there and also pay for his bills and help him financially for some small maintenance works since he takes care of the property. </p>

<p>About one year ago their first child was born. This was a very happy moment, well received by all the family, me included of course. The problem then was that my brother and his wife basically didn't have enough money to pay for a child. My sister in law decided to become a stay-at-home-mom and my brother refused to work more hours. </p>

<p>My parents and relatives decided to start helping him financially in a much more consistent way. Basically, they gift him some money every month and pay for every necessity related to the child. When I tried to voice my concern about this whole situation with them, their answer was that of course he should try to make more money but that in the end the important thing is that he should be happy and that somebody takes care of the child in the best way possible. I think it's important to add that now his wife is pregnant again.</p>

<p>Personally, I always thought that this situation was somehow acceptable and that it was not my problem since I was not directly involved in any way. Basically, my opinion was that my relatives have a right to do whatever they want with their money.</p>

<p>My girlfriend in the last period is getting a little bit concerned of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>That my brother will grow so dependent on these handouts that one day, when my relatives will be gone or unable to help him, we will need to take their place.</p></li>
<li><p>That anyway I should be concerned about been treated differently by my relatives. She thinks it'a situation too much unfair. Also, as I wrote I'm not super well-off and I have often high medical expenses so it happens quite frequently that I am short of money. She's also worried that one day I may basically get no inheritance (not that there is much go get anyway..) because of the behavior of my relatives, especially parents.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've never asked and rarely accepted money from my parents and relatives, but I'm starting to question if I did a smart thing at this point.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Should I be concerned about the money of my parents and relatives as if they were somehow ""my"" money?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I be concerned about been treated unfairly by my parents and relatives?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I be concerned about the risk of getting the responsibility of helping them out in the long-term?</p></li>

"How can I approach my friend about why he's ignoring me?","<p>I (F 20) have a close friend (M 21) that hasn't been responding to any of my texts for about three weeks. The last time I saw him was at a party at a mutual friend's house three weeks ago. I don't recall anything out of the ordinary happening at the party that would explain why he's not responding. Usually, he's not great at responding but usually responds eventually. I would estimate that only 10% of my texts went unanswered. But I've texted him 10 times in the past three weeks with no response. I texted him pretty mundane things about sports, or sent him memes, in line with usual conversation that we have. I also texted him to make plans twice, and even called him but he didn't pick up.</p>

<p>About two weeks ago, I texted a mutual friend of ours to ask if she'd heard from him since it was weird he hadn't responded to me. She was actually with him at the time and I asked her to ask him if he was mad at me or something, and he apparently said that he wasn't, that he loves me and is just bad at responding. But he still hasn't responded since then.</p>

<p>I haven't ran into him in person since the party, but it's possible I will because we go to the same university and have some of the same friends. But there's no routine event I'll see him at or anything like that. However, I'll most likely run into him within the next couple weeks.</p>

<p>How can I ask him if there's a reason why he's ignoring me? And if I do, should I try it over text or just wait until I see him in person?</p>

"Is it rude to ask someone where they are from originally?","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This question is different from <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/is-it-rude-to-ask-tourists-where-they-are-from"">this excellent one</a>, since it is not about tourists. The differences will become clear later on, I hope.</p>

<p>I will, as usual, use fake names (Alice and Eve this time) and also name places (L. A. and New York), that do not need to coincide with the actual cities.</p>

<p>Alice is a US citizen, born and raised in the US. Her name is very uncommon, though. And her appearance doesn't match ""Average Jane's"" entirely.</p>

<p>Eve is nice and open-minded and looks more like your ""Average Jane"".</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I met with Alice and Eve, who didn't know each other before, in New York. I do know both, so I was the common denominator. It was nothing formal, just a nice evening at home.</p>

<p>After some introduction, like where I met Alice and Eve for the first time, a dialogue between Eve and Alice ensued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eve: Where are you from?</p>
  
  <p>Alice: I'm from Los Angeles. My whole family lives there.</p>
  
  <p>Eve: I love L. A.! But where are you from originally?</p>
  
  <p>Alice: <em>(short pause)</em> Also L. A., I was born there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eve didn't seem to notice anything, and they went on. After hearing the question, I looked at Alice to see her reaction, and, although it was subtle, I do think that she wasn't glad about ""Where are you from originally?"". Also, she seemed a bit more reserved afterwards. On a sidenote, Eve also told a lot about herself, it was not a one-sided questioning.</p>

<p>At the end, Eve said, that it was a nice evening and Alice was great, but maybe a bit distanced. I said, that I felt that question to have been rude. She disagreed, noting how I was being over-sensitive and how she loves foreign cultures. She just had wanted to get to know her better and was genuinely interested.</p>

<p>Now, Alice was polite and said that she had enjoyed the evening and how Eve was a nice person. She didn't complain, but I doubt she would have, fearing it may hurt me. I also didn't want to pressure her for the sake of my couriosity. So I just gave her the chance to voice her opinion, in case she wanted to, and decided to ask the community here.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is it rude to ask someone <strong>""Where are you from originally?""</strong>. Is there maybe a better way to phrase the question?</p>

<p>Please note, that this is not about proving me and my reasoning right. I'm genuinely interested in how such a question is perceived. And this is, in contrast to the other question, not about tourists or the like. While Eve didn't know Alice, there was no reason to suggest, that she was, e. g., a tourist. And there may be cases, where just the name is very uncommon.</p>

"How to respond to ""When are you getting married""?","<p>My question is similar to: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1894/"">How can I respond when someone asks me when I&#39;m going to get married to my girlfriend?</a></p>

<p>But <strong>my case is pretty different</strong>. I am a teacher and hence can't avoid public and receive this question from a lot of people from my home to university. Here are some of the points to give you the idea of embarrassing situations I receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't have any GF/relation and they come up with even worse things like suggesting Ms. XYZ as ""<em>Hey, What about her?</em>"" (completed with a wink) and they ""move on"" after ruining my whole day?</li>
<li>The ""aunts"" of the family start enjoying by teasing me. Their first step is: ""Should we start finding a girl for you?"". But once I politely refuse, next trap is even deadly one as they start enjoying over ""Who is the one you have hidden from all of us that you are deferring the Wedding?""</li>
<li>I live in Pakistan where such a jokes/teasing about the wedding are common (but I don't like them one bit) but because of that, I don't want to be harsh on anyone.</li>
<li>I saw answers to the related question but I can't make excuses like ""I have already talked to my GF"", or ""I am too young"" (at the wrong end of 20's which is not young at all for a marriage here), etc.</li>
<li>The toughest part is my politeness being mistaken as ""he is also enjoying it with us - see he is about to blush"" while from inside I wonder on them for wasting time on a repeated useless question (once I got married, you all will know. No?)</li>
</ul>

<p>So how can I respond in a polite way which would let the other person know that I am seriously not interested in this topic? </p>

<p>""Once I got married, you all will know"" doesn't work too much as they still keep pushing me - even suggesting XYZ.</p>

"Is it rude to ask how much a new neighbour paid for their apartment?","<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> 
<strong>Is it rude to ask how much a new neighbour paid for their apartment? My view is that it isn't, because it's information that's probably their favourite topic of conversation right now, and also in the public domain.</strong> </p>

<p>Recently, some new people in my apartment building moved in. Unfortunately, they appear very friendly, and have already telegraphed a degree of interest in developing some form of non-transactional relationship with me.</p>

<p>Two days in a row now we have both given each other friendly hellos and acknowledged one another's existence but not actually stopped to introduce ourselves. The worst type of faux-relationship you can have with someone is the one that consists of hellos without ever stopping to talk. I have decided that I will not be that person.</p>

<p>So next time I bump into them I intend to actually make an effort. Not a huge one, but an earnest one nonetheless. </p>

<p>Presently, I am self-indulgently trying to come up with possible topics of conversation. For example, they were sanding the floor the other night which means they bought the place, which means I might pretend to not have already looked up the sale price and to casually ask if they bought it or are renting, then ask how much they paid. </p>

<p>I am aware of the typical sensitivities regarding questions that pry into matters relating to finances e.g. income, personal expenses, etc but I don't think that such graces apply if these things are publicly available </p>

<p>For example, I find the following unlikely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I hear that's very competitive to get accepted into. Tell me, how
  much does a year at this elite boarding school for toddlers cost?"" </p>
  
  <p><em>""We'll, that's none of your damn busine--""</em></p>
  
  <p>""Actually never mind, they have a price list on their website""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally speaking, is my perspective on this reasonable? If it's of any relevance, I will not be deploying any offense-taking countermeasures such as the classic ""if you don't mind me asking""  gambit.</p>

"How to ask for redress of a grievance that ""ruins"" a long held family tradition in way that does not ruin things?","<p>Until now, my family and I had a tradition of making waffles and eating them on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>The devices used to make said waffles were two 70s era electric waffle makers. Suffice to say that waffles are not considered ""legit"" for the tradition unless they are made with these waffle makers or the equivalent vintage devices.</p>

<p>An important person at church is a teacher at a local high school and teaches culinary arts, and asked to borrow the waffle makers. We agreed after letting her know that these waffle makers fulfill this important traditional role in our holiday festivities, so it cannot be said that she did not know how important they were to us.</p>

<p>A great deal of time passed before we learned that she had accidentally donated the waffle makers some time ago.</p>

<p>I know that I am forced to accept that these items are gone. I will not be loaning items to this person again. And meanwhile, I am looking for replacements at thrift stores, and perhaps I will find some in time.</p>

<p>So that's not the issue.</p>

<p>The issue is that the borrower, after informing us of the loss of the items, and having been informed of their importance prior to borrowing them, has made no gesture other than a verbal apology. </p>

<p>I am rather upset about it, and unfortunately when I am upset about something, going up and talking to the person tends to make that person never want to talk to me again. ""Learn to be calmer!"" would be great advice, to which I would ask ""Great! How?"" I have exactly the same response to the advice ""Get over it!""</p>

<p>I feel there should have been some effort on her part to acquire replacements, or at least some offer of remuneration.</p>

<p>And let us say that I do demand some sort of redress. Then it was grudgingly done, only to shut me up.</p>

<p>The long version of the question is:</p>

<p><strong>How to ask for redress of a grievance that ""ruins"" a long held family tradition in way that does not destroy the relationship yet also assuages my disappointment and anger?</strong></p>

<p>(I think I'm hosed here....)</p>

I do not consider this a duplicate question as the linked question doesn't cover my specific request of how to talk about Halal issues (they talk about everything but...). I'm merely asking for examples - I don't even know how to use the term ""Halal"" or if I should even use it.  Is it the same as/similar to ""Kosher"".

"How to safely phrase ""I wish to broaden my cultural horizons while taking an interest in yours.""","<p>There seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about the following exchange between two people, the first wishes to broaden their cultural horizons while expressing an interest in the acquaintance's heritage.</p>

<p>This genuine interest; however, is betrayed by the imprecision of the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Hi! I'm ______, nice to meet you.""<br>
  <strong>Shy</strong>: ""Hi, nice to meet you too. I'm ________.""<br>

  <strong>Shy</strong>: ""CurrentCity""<br>
  <strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Oh."" (surprised the listener failed to understand)<br>
   ""I mean, where are you <em>originally</em> from?""<br>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The intent of re-asking the question is to say:</p>

<p>I'm asking based on your facial features, style of dress, or manner of speech; i.e. noticeably different, or similar to my own. ""Outgoing"" could have said:        </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any countries, languages, customs, or styles of fashion or music or literature, that I might already have a keen interest in, that you have been influenced by or possibly have insider information about, that could lead to many lively and fulfilling conversations between the two of us?</p>

<p>I would like to know if there is a simpler way of expressing the above: a clear way to express the full intent behind the question in a way that is both unambiguous and conversational. In such a way that the listener may respond: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Outgoing</strong>: ""Oh yeah, so where are you from?""<br>

<p>They were very understanding, or at least tried to be, but it was still really awkward talking to them about LGBT+ issues... I obviously thought about the possibility of mixed reactions. I've done this before and know that some people don't respond well initially. </p>

<p>What I didn't really expect or know how to deal with was the well-meaning, but somewhat tone-deaf response. These two family members are rather open-minded people, I guess you could say they're rather socially/politically liberal.</p>

<p>I guess I got the sense that while they mean well and are trying to be supportive, they're comfortable talking <strong>about</strong> LGBT+ people, but don't have much experience talking <strong>with</strong> LGBT+ people.</p>

<p>It was mostly just language things. Like switching back and forth between using a person's dead name and current name, mixing up pronouns, misunderstanding and misapplying some terminology, and stuff like that. </p>

<p>To be absolutely clear, I know that they mean well. They're not trying to offend anyone. They really wanted to understand where I'm coming from and what being queer means for me. They just don't have much experience with communicating with a queer person about LGBT+ issues.</p>

<p><strong>Again my question is, how do I correct some of these language problems without making them uncomfortable talking about these issues?</strong></p>

<p>I love them and I know they still love me, that's why they're talking about this stuff and asking questions. It just gets uncomfortable talking with them about it when a lot of what they say comes out badly... And I know that sooner or later I'm going to be introducing them to a partner, so it would be nice if they didn't inadvertently say something awful, and I'm fairly certain that they'd rather not make those missteps either.</p>

"How to handle unexpected expenses during a road trip?","<p>I took part in a 10 day road trip across several European countries, with a group of friends and acquaintances. We traveled with several cars, and were sharing the fuel costs. I took part several times with mostly the same group (we organize it every year), and this was the first time I was the driver, and used my private car. I had three others riding in my car with me. They were more like acquaintances or distant friends, not my closest friends. I had much closer friends in the whole group, but they were driving their own (full) cars.</p>

<p>Half a day and a few hundred km after the start my car broke down in such a way it needed several days of repairs. I left it at a service station, continued the trip with a rental car, and we picked my repaired car up on our way back. (note that my car was not in a bad shape at all, so this event was totally unexpected)</p>

<p>However, that rental was really expensive. We didn't have many options to choose from on a Friday afternoon, and the cars were all high-end models with large daily rates. None of us knew anyone in the vicinity to borrow a car from, so this was the only solution to continue our journey. It's important to note that the accommodations were already payed for, which was not a negligible sum either.</p>

<p>Near the end of the trip, one of my three passengers volunteered to pay 1/4 of the rental costs, saying that it was nice from me to continue the journey (As I could have just returned home with public transport but didn't), and it would be fair for all in my car to contribute, and that I already had to pay a lot for the repairs anyway. The other two, however, took everything for granted, and didn't contribute anything. Their point was, that I agreed to take them with me if they pay for their ratio of the fuel.</p>

<p>How to handle such problems? I took part in many similar trips, and we never faced any expensive difficulties. We also never made official contracts, it's just matter-of-course that for very short trips in and around our town we don't handle any finances, and for long trips we share the fuel costs. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Talking about exact monetary contracts in case of accidents and other unforeseen events might seem awkward in a casual setting. Would it really be normal to show up before the trip with a long list of possible but highly unlikely scenarios and debate which costs should be shared and which shouldn't, and then when it happens, argue and rules-lawyer about which category it really belongs to?</p></li>
<li><p>Just dropping them off then and there, and letting them find a bus or train home (while making them lose a lot of money for the already payed-for overnight stays, event tickets, etc.) would have been rude and unfair in my opinion, and it would have driven my costs even higher, with less people to share the fuel costs with. Just cancelling the trip might have been somewhat less rude in my opinion, but I didn't want to cancel it for myself.</p></li>

"How to get my father back and open his eyes over his girlfriend?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My dad has had a girlfriend for 8 years now. She's 37, my father 45, I'm 25. We are French. I was 17 when they started dating. Naturally, I was very happy for him. After 6 months, she moved in. She seemed to be nice and everything was going great.</p>

<p>With time, I started to see that she was kind of a control freak. Everything my dad does was never good enough and she would systematically redo what he did. Then, she started with me. For example, my dad and I have RLS and if we shook our legs while eating, she would be mad. Or when we were talking, she complained that we were too noisy for her to write a text.</p>

<p>I started to be very uncomfortable at home and I locked myself in my room most of the day, playing video games. One day, my dad kicked me out of the house, thinking I was a video game addict. After 3 months, we got in touch and the problem was solved, without really talking about it.</p>

<p>After those events, I moved out in my own house and got a job, so everything was great.</p>

<p>I'm totally independent as I left the family house 5 years ago. I now live with my boyfriend 120 miles away from my father. I'm not sure I'm able to talk to him in private because as I said, she's always on his back, reading texts, intercepting phone calls from me. </p>

<p><strong>The argument</strong></p>

<p>In June, my dad, my step-mother, my boyfriend and I went to a music festival. Even though she hated the type of music, she wanted to come rather than be away from my dad for one week.</p>

<p>The second day, she had a tearful, dramatic argument with my father over a road trip issue. While she was outside, my dad told me something like ""She must question herself over time, everyone turning their back to her"". So I thought he might be aware of the problem.</p>

<p>On Sunday, she stared at me and said ""You think I'm unbearable huh?"" out of nowhere. I said ""Yes"", knowing that if I lied, she was going to scream at me anyway (clearly, she wanted to argue). She started to scream and berate me. I just smiled even though I was very angry. My dad was there, impassive.</p>

<p>Later, I messaged my dad and we argued. I finally told him all the things I have in my heart about her. He told me to grow up (what?). I explained I only spoke out of respect for him and his love, and I have never been mean.</p>

"How to tell a person who is interested in me that a relationship is not an option?","<p>I have this workmate for almost 2-months now, who is an all-out person. I mean, she's not afraid to tell any of her feelings towards another person. Now, she told me she likes me. I told her, which I usually don't do because I'm an introvert, that I like her too but added to her that maybe I just got infatuated. Yesterday, we hanged out (her treat and I'm not used to it, I'm feelin like a beta) and made few talks about each other. We're both unfortunate with our past. She always tell me things I like to hear, like she's the person I'm hoping and wishing to be with.</p>

<p>Honestly, I really like to be in a relationship with her, but also don't want to for some few reasons. For sure my parents will not allow it if I insist. I like her but I don't want to let it go further. It will just hurt both of us.  </p>

<p>I already told her before that I'm not yet into a serious relationship and I never told her anything that is sure about my feelings toward her. I just said that maybe this is just infatuation. She's not stopping despite of that.</p>

<p><strong>So how can I be more assertive when telling her that a serious relationship is not an option?</strong></p>

<p>I don't want her to get hurt, but I need to end it now, I just don't know how. <strong>I would love to stay friends with her</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Thank you @Federico and @JonahBenton for the answers and everyone in the comment box. Here are the answers to the questions you guys left to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just for clarification, are the three sentences starting with "" For
  sure .."" to "".. hurt me and her."" three separate reasons or or is it a
  sequence as in ""My parents will not allow it. Because of that I don't
  want to let it get further. I fear that this situation will both hurt
  me and her if it were to go further.""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, a sequence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Has she actually said that she wants a relationship with you, or are
  you just interpreting that from other things she said/did? If it's the
  latter, what things?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She didn't actually said that but by the way she told me things like ""<em>I love you. If you will have your own company soon, please hire me. Only me. And make me your wife. Blah blah blah</em>"" and ""<em>What do you want? Just tell me, I'll give it to you. You know I'm willing to do these things, again, to you. I like you. (She means that she's willing to do again the good stuffs she had done with her ex)</em>"", I guess she wants to be in a relationship with me. Or maybe I'm just assuming?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""her treat and I'm not used to it, I'm feelin like a beta"". What does
  the word beta refer to here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean beta, as someone who is more dependent in a relationship. She acts as the alpha and she likes to control me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you add a culture or location tag? There are many cultural and
  possibly legal issues to workplace romance that vary across cultures
  and countries.</p>

<p>Hmm. That's a thing I don't like to disclose. We're both asian with religious parents.</p>

<p>And here's what I did last night.</p>

<p>I texted here because I have a confession and I want to talk about it personally but she insisted me to tell right now so I told her everything. </p>

<p>I told her that I like her but to be in a relationship is a no. I told her my reason that it is because my parents. I told her what happened to me before to just emphasize my point, that what is happening between us will not work just like what happened to me before. She misinterpreted it at first but finally understand after some few chats.</p>

<p>She accepted my rejection but said anyway that we can just let these feelings be felt. She said that she will still do things for me, things will never change tomorrow. And this ""tomorrow"" is now. A little awkward is present between us but her treatment is still the same. </p>

<p>Well, I agreed with her, to just let these feelings to be felt but I keep remembering her that there's no future for us. Yes, it had hurt her last night but it's the best I can do.</p>

"How can I ask an unfamiliar coworker to eat more quietly?","<p>I work in a cubicle farm.  Recently, someone who I believe may be a new employee moved into a cube a row away from mine.  I've not been introduced to him and we are antisocial engineers so I really don't know who he is.  All I know is that every day whenever he eats something he slurps and smacks and makes the loudest, most disgusting noises when he eats.</p>

<p>We don't have a lunch room, so everyone eats at their desks.</p>

<p>Most of the time, I've just been putting on headphones.  But I personally do not like wearing my over the ear headphones while I myself am eating.  </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to get him to quit slurping?  Since I don't know him, passive aggressive responses are acceptable.  I don't have any friends in the immediate area, so saying something that the slurper can overhear is not really an option.</p>

<p>Just saying ""It's OK"" doesn't feel right for me, since if everything is OK, there would be no reason to excuse him. But I also don't want to come across as strange or be impolite/rude.</p>

"Dementia: How to cut off useless advice to a caregiver from well meaning people?","<p>My husband has moderate dementia.  The exact cause has been variously diagnosed, but it is probably not Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>I haven't broadcast the fact, but, of course my friends and some of my closer acquaintances know, and the therapists.  I am constantly getting unhelpful advice, such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must make time for yourself. You can't be there 24/7.   </p>

  support group.   </p>
  
  <p>The county has programs that can help.  Click on [website]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This advice is unhelpful because <strong>of course</strong> I know I need time for myself (I am not an idiot); (2) I am not a groupie sort of person and I do not want even more of my time consumed by this illness; (3) county programs have income cutoffs, which make me ineligible, as anyone who knows me ought to know.  And the unhelpful advice becomes tiresome when it comes for the nth time. </p>

<p>There is more that is unhelpful (safety is the number one priority; you can deduct medical expenses), and questions about the stage (does he know where he is?) really betray ignorance.  (If he didn't know where he is, why would he be at home?)    </p>

<p>How can I civilly cut off discussion of these obvious points and convey what would really would be useful, which is (a) stimulating conversation about anything else but and (b) an occasional casserole because as everyone knows, I loathe cooking?   Or is (b) really out of line? </p>

"What is ""holding space"" and how do I do it?","<p>I recently came across an article titled <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/mans-guide-to-holding-space-slake/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>A Man's Guide To ""Holding Space""</em></a>, which was linked in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/3607/21558"">an answer to this question</a>. I had never heard the term before, but recognised some of my own patterns of behaviour, both in the original question, and in the article (especially the tendency to try and fix a problem I am told about).</p>

<hr>

<h2>What <em>is</em> holding space?</h2>

<p>According to <a href=""https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/mans-guide-to-holding-space-slake/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Holding space is not:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Just Listening</li>
  <li>Trying to fix, solve or provide alternative points of views for your partner</li>
  <li>Disconnecting or diminishing your partners emotional experience</li>
  <li>A one way conversation</li>
  <li>Being disconnected from your own experience</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It then goes on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think of it this way; when you hold space, you are creating a container for the other person’s emotions to come up, be seen without the interference of your own and be released.</p>
  
  <p>Holding space is like creating a metaphorical bucket for someone to emotionally and verbally vomit into.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand the concept of holding space as being sympathetic, emotional support for someone when they have emotions which are troubling them and which they may not fully even understand themselves. I've certainly been there myself—wanting someone to ""be there"" for you. </p>

<p><strong>Is this short summary roughly correct?</strong> The description above sounds an awful lot like ""just listening"" to me, which the article expressly states not to do. <strong>How can ""holding space"" best be described, without being self-contradictory?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2><em>How</em> can I hold space?</h2>

<p>When holding space for someone, the focus should (obviously) be on them. The article suggests what to do keep the focus on the other person,</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Give them permission to share, permission to trust their instincts/intuition and trust their internal wisdom;</li>
  <li>Create the space for them to make decisions or take actions that might be different than your own.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However it provides no guidance on <em>how</em> to do these things. I also don't necessarily agree that it is always a good idea to let someone do these things.</p>

<p>To give a personal example, the person might have extremely low self-esteem, and so their internal wisdom may tell them that they are to blame for a situation, or that they are fat, or stupid, or result in a number of other harmful conclusions. It is my instinct to try and nip these thoughts in the bud (e.g. ""You're not stupid"" or ""It's not your fault""), but doing so invalidates the <em>feeling</em> the other person has.</p>

<p>Speaking of validation, the article makes it painfully obvious that validation is important,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Validation, validation, val-i-da-tion</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What kinds of things can I say to someone that will achieve the multifaceted goal of <strong>keeping the focus on the person</strong> I am holding space for, and simultaneously <strong>validate their feelings</strong>, but <strong><em>without</em> encouraging negative, self-deprecating thoughts?</strong><br>
<strong>What if they happen to have low self-esteem, does this change things?</strong>  </p>

"How to mend relations with someone I realize I have been mean to for four years?","<h1>Premise</h1>

<p>I do not feel good whenever I have strained a friendship, or any interpersonal relationship, and can find no recourse to mend the friction. The main reason being (and it is admitedly selfish), I want the most recent memory of me in someone else to be a positive one not a negative one. </p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>One such example was this person I was in a religious club with for four years.  The majority of our interactions were within this club.  She was a very good logistical manager and was generally positive to people, even if it meant overlooking other issues that were always blaringly obvious to me.  I was on setup crew.  I was (and still have vestiges of), for lack of a better term, a nit picky prick and always aimed to ensure things were done well.  I manifested this abrasive behavior in the form of <code>is this taken care of?</code>  <code>do you have this down?</code> and asking relatively ancillary questions which (as I understand now) would drive many people insane. It almost seemed like she was starting to develop a shield around me, as we it almost became impossible to carry on a conversation outside of the club. Another factor was that before my current girlfriend, I had a crush on her was relatively forward about asking for a  coffee date, and posted on a ""crushes"" page (which was meant to be a joke page) about her. She then rejected me over FB messenger (unrelated, but more details don't necessarily hurt) and completely ceased communication outside of the context of the club. Throughout the whole four years I was still very focused on logistical details of the club and (maybe because of projecting stress on to ""whoever is in charge"") the abrasive behavior continued.</p>

<p>Every now and then she comes back for several events in which the club is gathered, the most recent of which was College Graduation. The whole ""invisible wall"" thing is still present and I can't even get a hi response. She went up and said hi and hugged a friend (who was also my friend) right next to me, but then treated me as if I didn't exist. In the grand scheme of things the whole matter probably doesn't mean much, but I personally don't like ""leaving a bad taste in someone else's mouth"". </p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>My main goal is to relieve her of the negative feelings she has when we meet. We don't really need to become friends, Just no longer ""enemies"".
I'm looking for a way to convey to her that she no longer needs to put up a barrier between us.</p>

<h3>An Example</h3>

<p>Dutch trains have special silent compartments (Dutch: <em>stiltecoupé</em>), where people are supposed to keep quiet — no conversations, no music, no conversations on the phone.</p>

<p>Sometimes, while sitting in such a compartment, people who don't know or don't care, start talking. I can approach them and politely ask them to be quiet, please, since they're in the silent compartment.<br>
While most people will comply, some won't and will either ignore me or give a rude reply.</p>

<h3>The Question</h3>

<p>How do I follow up? It's not just in the situation described above, it could be neighbourhood kids trying to cut large branches (they brought a <em>saw</em>) off the tree in front of my house (not <em>my</em> tree but a municipal tree), for instance.</p>

"How do I deal with my friend's abusive partner who I've cut contact with?","<p>I've been friends with a girl, who I'll call Samantha, since high school. Four years ago, Samantha started a relationship with a lesbian, who I'll call Alex. </p>

<p>(Alex is a genderfluid person and prefers they pronouns, but identifies as a lesbian. This does not relate to the question itself, just a guide about how to talk about them.) </p>

<p>I've known for several years that Alex has been emotionally and financially abusive to Samantha. I have rescued her from situations before, and Alex knows, but I appeared to move on. I continued to talk to them and be around them.</p>

<p>After months of debate that I've supported her with, Samantha ended the relationship and gave Alex time to gather their things and leave. Alex even posted on Facebook that they'd hit Samantha and were being broken up with as a result. It was the most permanent break up I could imagine. I cut off all contact with Alex on social media afterwards and have not spoken to them since.</p>

<p>As the weeks passed, Samantha talked to me less and less, even though I checked up on her frequently. Alex continued to live there. I feared for the worst. </p>

<p>Then the worst happened: they're back together. </p>

<p>I love Samantha so much and want her out of this relationship. I know I can't do that, but I want to be as good a friend to her as I can. How do I hang out with her now? How do I still be her friend and around her? Alex knows that I want nothing to do with them, and I have not unblocked them. I hate them and have hated them, but I've been nice to them for Samantha's sake for all these years. Now, though, things are much different. Samantha believes/knows I cannot be around Alex any more. </p>

"Etiquette for a person who has already queued once","<p>I was at the front of a queue of 5 or 6 people waiting for train tickets, at a station in London, England. It was a similar length when I joined, and had taken about 10 minutes to reach the front.</p>

<p>A woman approached me asking if she could go first as she had queued up already to get a form for a discount railcard. I guess the person in the ticket office had continued serving other customers while the woman had filled the form at another position along the long counter.</p>

<p>She took it for granted I would say yes, and stood in front of me. This annoyed me, more than it should have done, perhaps because I'm British and predisposed to petty little angers. I told her to go to the back of the queue.</p>

<p>The person in the ticket office became free to serve the next customer, and what ensued was an unseemly pushing match at the counter as I tried to proffer my money for my monthly ticket, and she her form. I won, but I feel bad about it. </p>

"How to deal with someone attempting to “push buttons” and pick fights during casual social gatherings?","<p>So the context of this question is as follows: I attended a friend’s art opening a week or so ago. It was a pleasant, low key affair and a few of the people in attendance tangentially were connected via a common arts organization we all volunteer at. This art show was a group show completely disconnected from this arts organization; simply a common group of friends.</p>

<p>Also, no drinking is happening so alcohol cannot be blamed.</p>

<p>As the opening proceeds I run into someone I met at one point—about 1 to 2 years ago—at said arts organization and he introduces himself to me, I introduce myself to him and say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I met you a few years ago. I’m not too sure you remember, but we did.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some reason he seemed to be excessively offended by me mentioning that and responded.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh, I don’t remember you… But we met a few years ago?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I reply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yes…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he says again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, I don’t remember you… But you remember me right? I guess you know better than me, right?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then this awkward back and forth goes on an on for a few rounds and it feels a bit uncomfortable to aggressive on his part.</p>

<p>The conversation changes, and then this is where it gets weirder.</p>

<p>As the night progresses, no matter what the topic, if we were together he would endlessly say: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh, I met Jake before. In the past I guess. I don’t remember. But he said so.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This goes on and on so much other people are looking at the other guy quizzically as well. I’m trying to “grin and bear” it, but it’s painful. I didn’t want to confront this guy in the middle of the opening because that would have ruined our friend’s event. And given this guys odd behavior, who knows how bad that could have been.</p>

<p>It even spiraled to the end where I said, “Gotta go! Nice meeting you!” And everyone is nice and polite… Except for “that guy” who is aggressively shaking my hand and repeating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Well, it was nice to meet you… But we apparently met before and I don’t remember you from then. But still, goodnight!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While some of this might seem comical, a lot of the interactions were just straight out passive aggressively weird. Real sense of hostility. No real humor to deliver or intonation. My sense is he knew he was at a sensitive social event and was “testing limits” for his own enjoyment. Other people seemed to sense this as well.</p>

<h3>So when all is said and done, could there have been a way to politely get this guy to stop being a jerk at this event?</h3>

<p>How would it be possible to stop someone like this without making a scene? Is the solution as simple as a, “Hey… Let’s talk…” followed by leading said person to a quiet place—even outside of the venue—to confront them?</p>

<p><strong><em>Please note that the fact this happened in the context of an art opening with colleagues from an art organization has little bearing on this behavior. The person in question is not trying to be “witty” or cool but was genuinely aggressive.</em></strong></p>

I know she's been under a lot of stress for that reason and her personal situation until now, and we've had quite an increase in amount of arguments for the last few weeks as she seems to have difficulties coping with her stress. 
I tend to be patient and stress is not really something that affects me, although I do understand what it's like. I'm always trying to get her to talk to me of what truly is on her mind, and I know she's doing great efforts there. </p>

<p>So now she just called me while I'm working, and asked me to unfollow that girl I've travelled with on a few occasions (ridesharing).
So far I've cut short to the discussion and told her we'd talk about it after work.</p>

"Dealing with somebody who's ignoring my very existence","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I have a group of friends, and we've known each other for about 7 years now. We once all were colleagues. One of these friends, Alice, has an autism spectrum disorder. This friend got fired from our workplace. During the period when she was in between jobs and had limited money available, we all adapted our activities to fit her circumstances (e.g. no going out to town, but inviting her and everyone else to our homes for home cooked dinner).</p>

<h3>Incident</h3>

<p>After she found another job, I declined to go to one of her parties because she insisted on having a barbecue with food from the caterer she was now working for. I declined and explained that because I was going back to school full-time, this meant I could only work Saturdays, and so I did not have the money to spare for an expensive barbecue party (it is normal in The Netherlands that when organizing a barbecue, people pay per person). </p>

<p>This friend got very mad, apparently because I had ruined her party plans with my declination. My co-workers tried to mediate, but to no avail. She wouldn't, and still won't, say what is bothering her to either me or other co-workers. </p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Since this all happened, I have never again been invited to her parties. But her behavior at parties of mutual friends where we were both present is bothering me a lot.</p>

<p>She is completely ignoring me and my existence. Sometimes to the extent of just talking over a conversation I'm having with one of our mutual friends, like I don't exist. </p>

<p>It's not just not talking to me, she is actively showing that she is completely ignoring me. Other friends have noticed this as well, and we have tried multiple times to find our why she feels she has to do this. </p>

<h3>Already Tried</h3>

<p>I and other friends have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking her directly what I did wrong to deserve such treatment. She never gave a reason, so we asked her to stop treating me different from everybody else if she can't give a reason/reasonable talk about it.</li>
<li>Asking her to have a one-on-one talk with me. This just gets ignored as well, doesn't matter if I ask or a co-worker. She even ignores it when we are both in the same room, and other people can hear me making the request.</li>
<li>Gently pointing out her behavior towards me (""Why are you talking over me?"") when it is clear she is ignoring my existence. This usually results in her trying to start a shouting match, and leaving the party shortly after. This has also failed to show a reason for her behavior or start a reasonable discussion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>I would love to talk this out with her, to make these parties a fun happening again for both of us. But at this point, <em>I'm thinking</em> that my 'normal' process of resolving a conflict (confronting somebody about a problem, asking what is wrong, how I could help to improve the situation and having a reasonable talk about it) is not going to work because of her autism. </p>

<p><strong>How can I effectively approach somebody with an autism spectrum disorder that is acting as if I don't exist, so that she will treat me in a normal way again?</strong></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I am not talking to her at parties, or approaching her. But she still seems intent on ruining the party for me, by ruining the conversations I am having, hijacking them and then pretending I don't exist, acting like they just started a conversation with another person that was not having a conversation to begin with. </p>

<p>I am looking for advice on how to address that specific behavior, I am fine with not talking to her, but I am not fine with the way she is treating me. She is actively seeking these situations herself, not just trying to avoid me.  </p>

<p>Alice has an autism spectrum disorder. I don't know if her behavior is caused or exacerbated by that, but her behavior is disruptive regardless. </p>

<p>I only mentioned the autism spectrum disorder because I know it can cause issues with interpersonal skills, and might be the reason why I have been unable to resolve this conflict in a 'normal' way, using 'neurotypical' interpersonal skills. So <em>it is something I want to take into consideration when dealing with the situation/approaching her about the situation</em>, so as to not inadvertently hurt her too bad. </p>

"Long-Term Relationship and 'a specific hobby'","<p>I've been a part of a happy long-term relationship over the past 4-5 years, and we've been engaged for some of that. The relationship started when I moved to a new town, so I left a lot of my life behind, including a certain hobby, a competitive card game (not gambling). We're currently pretty settled, we have a few pets and live together in the same house.</p>

<p>The 'hobby' has a reputation for being an expensive one, but I'd always been stingy with it and didn't spend anywhere near as much as others often do. I wouldn't need to spend money to return to it, as I still have my old decks.</p>

<p>Fast forward to about a year ago, as I started to feel more and more comfortable and settled I brought up the idea that I might pick the hobby back up again. The response I got was at best mixed, and the ensuing argument ended up with my partner saying how they just ""hate"" the hobby, citing the associated expense and the fact that I'd changed a lot since I last did it. Honestly I don't consider myself to have changed at all since I regained an interest (passion?) in the hobby. If there is a more fundamental or reason than that then it's never been mentioned. I feel like I don't understand the problem they see. These feelings seem to have been exacerbated by the fact that I'm now out-of-work, and while I wouldn't spend anything financially on the hobby given that fact, I receive responses like 'I'm not happy to be paying the rent if you're going to waste your time on [hobby]' if it is brought up again.</p>

<p>As a result of them making me feel bad about it, I've essentially been committing time to the hobby in secret, while they're at work etc. I feel incredibly guilty for more-or-less lying to them like this, but I feel that I should have a right to pursue something that makes me happy and being secretive about it seems to make us both happy.</p>

<p>Subsequent times when the hobby has just randomly come up in conversation, my fiancée has been extremely derogatory, but I didn't say anything other than nodding my head essentially, as I didn't want to re-open the issue even though this was making me feel pretty awful.</p>

<p>Essentially I have no idea what to do. If I'm frank and honest with them then I'm afraid it will all end, and I feel that we're so good together and settled. I feel like I don't want to have to cut out a thing that I really enjoy because of my partner's seemingly irrational hatred, since it would also cut off a significant portion of my friendships from where I first lived.</p>

<p>I feel so guilty for how I'm acting because of this, and just want to have an honest relationship again, but I'm afraid that will never happen again with them.</p>

<p>It feels like just cutting myself off from the hobby would fix everything, but it's a social hobby and I find it somewhat difficult to start friendships in other ways.</p>

<p>How can I have an honest conversation with my partner about my hobby, to understand why they hate it and express why it is important and beneficial for me?</p>

<p>In Thai culture in general, senior members must have a high capability and experience to help and support junior level. I understand this point. However, in software engineering which is fast changing, no one expects to know everything. </p>

"Relationship with alcoholic cross country?","<p>I am struggling to figure out how to have a productive relationship with a friend struggling with alcoholism cross country.</p>

<p>We were both part of a large and strong friend group in college. After college, the group scattered across the country. In general, the group communicates occasionally but we quickly pick up our strong bond when we get together for events.</p>

<p>He has struggled with alcohol since before college, but over the last few years alcoholism has come to dominate his life. He has also been using various drugs some times. He has been to in-patient rehab several times and has seen several therapists/psychiatrists on and off outside of rehab. He is living with his parents, but has a terrible relationship with them. They enable his drinking as a moral challenge for him to overcome by sheer force of will.</p>

<p>I want to continue my relationship with him but I'm not sure how best to do that. Resources <a href=""https://americanaddictioncenters.org/alcoholism-treatment/how-to-talk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a> focus on how to stage an intervention to get them to rehab. That's not what I'm looking for- he acknowledges alcohol dominates his life but I can't send him to rehab. Other resources recommend more simply expressing your concern and support. This is helpful, but not the basis of a relationship. Continuously sending that type of message just seems condescending. I've tried focusing conversation on the dealing with his alcoholism, but that usually leads him to depression. I've also tried tried focusing on other things, but that has become increasingly hard as he really has nothing else in his life anymore.</p>

<p>Our group of friends is lucky enough to be able and willing to spend substantial amounts of money to help him, but less than appears would be required to send him to inpatient rehab. This could include visiting him or helping him pay for living arrangements away from his parents.</p>

<p>What are the best things I can do to support my friend dealing with alcoholism cross country? In response to comments about this being to broad, what are conversation topics and communication strategies that will make my friend feel supported?</p>

"How can I convince my roommate to switch from a wired connection to wifi?","<p>I share a small room with my brother, and recently he got a desktop computer (he was using a laptop beforehand).</p>

<p>The room's layout is such that my table is right next to the door, while his table is on the other side of the room, directly opposite the door.</p>

<p>Since it was a new computer, he had to redownload all his games and programs. Initially he was using the computer's internal wifi card, and I suggested hooking up a LAN cable from outside temporarily to download his games quicker. I now regret it, because he now insists on leaving the LAN cable connected to his computer permanently.</p>

<p>This brings up a number of issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>The LAN cable runs from the living room all the way to my room. It is not hooked to the wall or the ceiling, just trailed on the floor without being secured in any way. This is a tripping hazard for people walking in the corridor outside.</li>
<li><p>The cable is led into my room by jamming it through the gap between the sides of the door. More often than not, opening/closing the door will result in the door being jammed since it is not a flat LAN cable. We turn on the A/C at night and leave the door closed, so every time someone enters/exits the room the door gets jammed pretty often.</p></li>
<li><p>My work table is next to the door, and when I pull out my chair to sit down / get up, it runs over the LAN cable, and jams the wheels of the chair as well. This has forced me to sit in an awkward way where my chair and body is facing in a slant direction towards the table in order to avoid the cable, which is not very comfortable.</p></li>
<li><p>There is only one bedframe for one person to sleep, and every night at bedtime someone (usually me) has to move a mattress from another room into my room for the other person to sleep. The cables running from outside complicate this a little because I have to lift / toss it around to avoid snagging the cables. Previously I could simply push/drag it along the floor as there was nothing blocking the way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried repeatedly to convince him to unplug it and just use wifi, but he seems pretty damn adamant about it. Here's what I tried - </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ask multiple times, with increasing exasperation each time, ""Please unplug the LAN cable and just use wifi."". He either says ""later"" nonchalantly or ignores me.</p></li>
<li><p>Reason with the reasons stated above to convince him. Ignored or retorted with ""how do you even jam the door like that??""</p></li>
<li>Reason that his in game ping is not going to be affected by a noticeable amount. Not convinced.</li>
<li>Compromise with a suggestion - ""If you really want a LAN cable, drill a hole in the wall and install a network switch, <em>please</em>."" Ignored.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only option I have left is just unplug the cable while he isn't home but I really fear this would lead to conflict. Since young he always had power over me and I really can't do anything if he remains stubborn about a particular issue. But this is one issue that is causing me considerable amounts of inconvenience that I can't just let it go.</p>

"Long Response Times Before Texting Back","<p>I am a male in my mid-twenties. A female friend of mine sent me a text saying that one of her friends (female) came across my profile and thought that I'm ""really cute"". I joked around with my friend for a bit and then she sent me a link to her friend's FB profile, suggesting that I add her and get to know her because she wanted to get to know me. For context, she's also in her mid-twenties but in college (I've finished school and work at least full-time).</p>

<p>I added her and by the end of the night, and after a little flirting, we exchanged phone numbers.</p>

<p>It's been about a week since then and it has been nonstop ""texting tag"" (think <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_tag"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">phone tag</a></em> but with texting). The thing is, I understand being busy and not breaking up the time to text someone back. Especially in early stages of getting to know someone, you dont want to seem clingy and strangers aren't a priority. In general, I don't text friends during work hours, while at the gym, doing errands, etc. But when I settle in after work or the gym, with Netflix or some other menial task going, I'll proactively engage in texting buddies back and having texting conversations.</p>

<p>Every time I text her, I won't get a text for a few hours. Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Text her (9:00PM) : Response (11:30PM) (2.5 hrs)</li>
<li>Text her (7:00AM) : Response (10:45AM) (3.75 hrs)</li>
<li>Text her (11AM): Response (7:00PM)     (8 hrs)</li>
<li>Text her (7:05PM): Response (11PM)     (4 hrs)</li>
</ul>

<p>It's like at least 2 hours need to pass before I'll get a response, regardless of the time of day I text her. I'd have asked her out for a simple coffee or lunch but she lives a few hours away.</p>

<p>So I proposed that we have a chat on the phone, if she'd be up for it. She sent smily faces and we both agreed on Thursday night. Thursday night rolls around and she apologizes to say that she's out with friends and then asked when I'd be asleep. I replied that ""It's no big deal. I go to bed around 11PM"", and that she can call whenever. 10:30PM rolls around and she texts me to say that she's tired and going to sleep. She then asks when would be a better day for her to call. I told her no worries and said she could just call whenever is convenient for her. </p>

<p>She hasn't offered up an alternative time to call or called me back, it's been a few days (including the weekend, a great time to call someone!). My experience and intuition tells me that she's either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Playing games.</li>
<li>Trying to seem non-clingy by having dramatically long average response times of essentially half a day.</li>
<li>Not interested.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not insulted, and as a proactive individual I understand that people get busy, but it's been my experience that when people are sincerely interested in someone, they'll actively keep communication and make a slight effort to reach out. I know that I always make sure, regardless of my busy schedule, to make a woman know that I'm interested and that she's got my attention. I'm not saying texting back every hour on the hour, but at some point in the day, like before bed, holding a conversation over texts for at least 15-20 minutes. She's definitely flirting with me, lots of good signs in her texts, but in past similar situations, I've been patient with girls like this for weeks just to find myself in the friend zone situation and things fizzling out.</p>

<p>Are my expectations too high? Am I reading things wrong? Should I make a joke about the reply times in order to see what's up with her? Should I keep engaging in texting her and hoping she'll take the time to call me? </p>

I have to take my dog out for walks, or sometimes I just go for walks alone, and usually the street is a pretty desolate place. However, on occasion, I do come across other walkers.

The other person looks at me for a second, and I look at them, and then we look away and pretend not to notice each other for two minutes until we pass each other, where we suddenly look up and wave to each other and then continue on our way.

"How can I tell my friend I don't like the state of our friendship?","<p>A little background:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm attending a large university in an English-speaking western country</li>
<li>I live at an international campus residence which has about a hundred international resident students living there</li>
<li>I befriended an Asian girl who was always eating alone during dinner time. She could not even speak a word of English but because I spoke her native language we could communicate and got along just fine.</li>
<li>We talked for up to 2 hours every day during dinner time</li>
<li>We hung out from time to time, watching movies, going on short trips, playing games, etc. either the two of us, or with my other friends</li>
</ul>

<p>Lately, I've become discontent with the state of our friendship. From reflection and looking at our chat history, she has never asked me to do something with her (i.e. hang out); it's always been me asking her to do something. She also never messages me first. In the rare instances she does message me first, it's only because she needs help with something like her computer, English, etc.</p>

<p>I stopped messaging her for about a month thinking maybe I was always asking her to hang out and not giving her a chance to ask me, but no contact from her.</p>

<p>Today, I was at the library eating and looking down. I looked up, and there she was. No ""hello"", No ""how are you?"", just ""Can you help me with this? Just 1 question"". I helped her and then tried to make small talk with her but she said she had to go back to studying and went off.</p>

<p>She has other friends apart from me and she does hang out with them (concerts, BBQ, etc.) but I'm not sure if her friends are always the ones initiating events as well.</p>

<p>The problem:
I feel like I am being used. She never initiates conversations or asks me to hang out. If she does initiate a conversation, which is very rare, it's because she needs help. When we are at dinner, we typically have great conversations and she's always smiling and fun to be around with. I'd like her to be the same way outside dinner.</p>

<p>What I would like:
I'd like her to ask me to hang out and do things together or at least not always be asking me for help.
Note that I'm NOT interested in a romantic relationship. I would like to be (good) friends and leave it at that.</p>

"How to tell a non-muslim friend that ""Inter-faith Marriage not gonna work""?","<p>I had a pretty religious (Christian) friend from the UK (of the same age as me - late 20's) and we often used to talk about Quran and Gospel (she had knowledge of both and so did I) and it leads to often very interesting discussions and new questions. </p>

<p>She told me about her boyfriend who was an Arab Muslim and actually he was not as religious but pretty stern at Beliefs. Both wanted to marry each other but their parents were against this marriage; one day I asked her couple of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suppose you got married to him, <strong>will your kids believe in One Allah or Trinity?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>She replied that ""<strong>they will believe in Trinity</strong> - though <strong>he doesn't agree with me here</strong> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_view_of_the_Trinity"" rel=""noreferrer"">says its polytheism</a>"". I thought that this marriage (maybe I am wrong) is not going to work but to confirm, I asked a couple more questions and they confirmed that there is a deadlock between two.</p>

<p>I wanted to bring her out of this situation, so being not only a friend but as an inter-faith discussion as well, I suggested her to revise her decision to marry a Muslim as it's not going to work but she did mind that ""I am interfering in her personal life"" - while I had no intention whatsoever to interfere in her personal life but just to give her advice as per Beliefs conflict.</p>

<p>I wanted to convey but that you should discuss religious differences and how to raise your children should be before getting married. Sadly, I lost a friend in the process - she never talked with me again.</p>

As it's not possible to measure new maid's working quality without giving then work or see them working, we are allowing both of them to work in our house in different time. If new one works good, then we will say no to old one. But, only working for 1 day every maid decline to work ( even if we offer them extra money) After that, new maids do not pick up calls! To know the truth, we called them several times. FYI, we found 7 new maids in 45 days. After talking They all have common. Everyone says that their husbands are not allowing to work. And they have talked to our old maid.</p>

<p>What's the reason? Why do they not want to work here? I strongly believe that our old maid told them something bad about us or not to work here. FYI, our old maid is an angry person.</p>

<p>1) We behave very respectfully with them 2) All of our maids live within 500 meters. We go to those place and search new maid by asking people if anyone know someone who wants to work. 3) I strongly believe that old one does not want to lose her job. She already knows that we are about to say no to her. 4) Here, maids have a good network. They keep words to each other. I am not the only one in Dhaka who facing this problem. 5) Talked with several persons (approx 20 in Dhaka) and found 5 of them faced these issue. How can I get out of this syndicate?</p>

<p>About the number 5, All of them live in a rented house. 3 of them solved this issue by complaining land owner. 2 of them can't solve the problem. FYI, I live in my own house.</p>

"When should I offer my seat on public transport?","<p>In the United Kingdom, when is it appropriate to offer your seat to someone on a train or bus?  Okay, if someone is in distress by standing through disability or otherwise it seems clear enough. However, I am of a generation that manners dictated that men generally, and younger men particularly, should also offer their seat to women (especially ones who are heavily pregnant), and to the elderly (whatever that means these days). </p>

<p>Is it still appropriate to make the assumption that such individuals should be offered a seat? If so, how can this be done without coming across as patronising? </p>

"How can I tell my mom to not cause herself so much stress when I'm visiting?","<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I visit my parents about one time per month, for one to two days. Sometimes I manage to visit them twice, in rare cases I have to skip a month. So we see each other in person regularly (and, for sure, during some holidays, but this is about the shorter visits.). They know that I can't visit them more often. They live about 3 hours away, and I've been out of the house for around 4 years now.</p>

<p>While my dad is pretty relaxed about it, my mom then tries to have everything in perfect condition and planned exactly to my tastes (e. g. musing about the whole week and asking me what I would like to have for dinner or taking care to get me a little present). She also ensures to take care of me in other ways, e. g. by buying me useful items I may need.</p>

<p><sub>She is not a helicopter mom and never was. So don't get a wrong picture of her. She is also not interfering with my day-to-day life (from afar) - it really just concerns her preparations for my visits.</sub></p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>I appreciate her efforts very much, but I'm sometimes a bit indecisive and also don't want them to plan everything according to my wishes. 
It causes her more stress than I would like. Sometimes she even mentions that in passing - something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mom: I couldn't get X done because I had to do Y for you and then ...</p>
  
  <p>Me: I told you that you needn't have done Y for me.</p>
  
  <p>Mom: It's fine! I'm always glad when you visit us!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mom: This week was very stressful for me. There was ... during the week,
  then your visit over the weekend. And now I still have to do ...</p>
  
  <p>Me: I'm sorry that I caused you more stress. Why didn't say anything?</p>
  
  <p>Mom: Oh no, it's nothing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I know that she causes her too much stress even if she doesn't say anything.</p>

<h2>What I tried</h2>

<p>Usually, I try to tell her that she doesn't need to make such a fuss about it, when she asks me (""It's not necessary that you ..."", ""I don't know, just like how you would do if I didn't come ...""). I fear that I come across as nagging - especially if I approach it from the angle of how I feel about it - and she answers that I needn't worry and that she is always happy when I visit. My dad is of no help in this issue.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>My goal is for her to treat my visits as if I was still living there - like nothing overly special. After all, I visit my parents to see them, to spend time with them and to talk to them. And I would like her to be able to enjoy it without unnecessary stress.</p>

<p><strong>How do I go about telling my mom, that I appreciate all she is doing for me during my visits, but that she needn't cause herself too much work and stress?</strong></p>

<p><sub>Once I even got the idea to surprise them (I had made sure beforehand, that it wouldn't interfere with their plans), but it caused her even more trouble.</sub></p>

"How to be accountable for your actions but not responsible for others' needs?","<p>In <a href=""https://www.cnvc.org/about/what-is-nvc.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nonviolent Communication</a> and other communication frameworks, there's the concept of having <strong>responsibility for your own feelings and needs</strong>. In other words, if you want something from others, it's your job to ask for it. If they're not willing to help you, you should find another way to get your needs met instead of trying to manipulate or force them into satisfying your request.</p>

<p>At the same time, there's also the moral concept of having <strong>accountability for your actions</strong>. If you do something that hurts someone, you are accountable for that pain. If you're willing and able to stop hurting them, you have a moral obligation to try and do so. However, this seems to be in conflict with the first concept: by being accountable for hurting others, you are (in a sense) taking responsibility for their feelings and needs.</p>

<p>How should one reconcile these things? If something you're doing is painful to someone else but isn't otherwise wrong or harmful, should you hold yourself accountable for the consequences? Or is it their responsibility to deal with it on their own, making whatever requests they wish? How do you decide which principle wins out?</p>

<p>Examples of this sort of conflict:</p>

<ul>
<li>You and an ex-partner frequent the same bar. You know they find it unpleasant to be around you but they haven't asked you to stop. Should you adjust your behavior?</li>
<li>You're going through some depression and are engaging in self-destructive behavior that your friend finds hard to watch. Should you hide it from them, or trust that they will make a request if necessary?</li>
<li>You're going to a family gathering where relatives have conservative ideas about proper dress. You only feel happy in more permissive clothing. Should you wear something you dislike to avoid offending people?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm looking for answers that offer a general approach to resolving these dilemmas, not solutions to a specific one of these examples.</p>

"How to manage an ex-flatmate who refuses any communication at all?","<p>As I moved to Graz a couple of months ago I took a room in a shared flat with three other people. About a month after that one of them decided to leave, because she wanted to move to a friend of hers about 500m away from us. She looked for new people and we interviewed a few and found a really awesome person, who is living with us for about a month now. </p>

<p>Everything is fine except that the ex-flatmate still got a couch and several other pieces of furniture still in our flat. The plan was that she would take the stuff out about a week later. By now this should have been two weeks ago. </p>

<p>On top of that she had the flat account(bank) onto which we all put money and she gave it to the landlord. She also paid our heating and electricity provider. </p>

<p>Now the problem is that we simply cant reach out to her. She is like dead. We all write her, or call her and she sees it, according to WhatsApp, but she simply does not reply. She also said two weeks ago that she tries but can't reach our landlord to tell them everything new. However, one of us called the landlord last week and reached him on the first attempt, just for us to hear that the rent for this month hasn't been paid, even though we all already gave the money to our ex-flatmate! They also told that they do not even know that she moved out or that we already have had a new flatmate for a MONTH now.</p>

<p>We are really angry now and yesterday for the first time I wrote directly and honestly a huge message to her explaining all her faults and that something like that CANNOT happen and is unacceptable. And she read it but still does not reply.</p>

<p>My question now: What other approaches can we as flatmates do to resolve this? To reach her and get her to come to us, as she also needs to sign stuff. And what should we do if the person simply does not react at all? What CAN we do? </p>

<p>This is pretty tricky as it is really important to get her furniture out and more importantly that we get her to pay the rent and to transfer who pays our heating and electricity provider.</p>

<p>My main goal is to interact with the person to be more cooperative. I thought that being direct and maybe a bit aggressive will rattle her out of it but that didn't seem to work. How should we approach her?</p>

<h1>Clarifications</h1>

<p>We of course already made another bank account from which all further payments will go. The only problem is the money we ALREADY gave her for this month, and that electricity heating and internet runs on her name.</p>

<p>Actually yes money is a very important topic in the story, but as we know her and actually don't expect her to steal our money (she lived for 1,5 years with some of them and was actually always a nice person). We are just confused why she would play dead and get her to get in contact with us. We also have no obligations to take legal actions against her. Only if its really necessary but we really don't think that this will be the case, because as mentioned earlier, she was always a nice person.</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>I have not yet taken any action because I wanted to wait to see some answers before taking further action. But as of now she contacted me back after my rather direct last message yesterday. She apologized and stated that she had in fact personal problems and that she is willing to meet up this week and that she paid our landlord today. Problem seems solved for now and I must give problems to all those that thought of the person may be having personal problems.
Might have been wiser for me to approach this differently as I know how it is when being knee deep in problems. I will read all answers again and mark this one as solution that was closest to the matter at hand, and which gave me the most insight on how to solve something like this in general.

"How do you ask your father not to get angry when he sees a male teacher is teaching his child?","<h2>Dealing with a father that gets angry when a man teaches his child in additional courses</h2>

<p>I’m 18 years male. Currently, I am pursuing 12th( the final year of High school) year education and very close to final exams. The reason I’m asking this, is because, I had an issue 3 years ago in grade 9, that on a winter, my mother hired a man to teach me math in additional course, and sooner later my father found about this and he got angry at my mother, and he made a huge scandal over nothing. </p>

<p>That man was only teaching me math. Big deal. If you were a father, would you get angry at this very small thing? I thought it’s normal for someone to be learned by anyone.</p>

<p><strong>What I tried?</strong></p>

<p>I tried to have a discussion with him, and I asked him, “why did you got angry?” And he replayed, “I don’t like another male to teach my child, I allow only female!!!” And I told him, “But you told me that a person can learn from anyone” and he said, “close the telephone and think what I mean”. </p>

<p>Then I ignored him( out of anger) and started to think he’s kinda jealous that someone is able to teach me math while he isn’t. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do you ask your father not to get angry when he sees a male teacher is teaching his child math instead of a female? </p>

<p>I need to know how to speak with him so that next time he won’t need to get angry over nothing. Instead of being happy that I’m learning, he’s angry. This isn’t faire.</p>

"What is the etiquette for smalltalk in a workplace when the context and person is always the same?","<p>Every single day at 3:45 PM Bob rings the doorbell at work. Every single day I answer the door and hand Bob a small amount of paperwork. Every single day there is about 10 seconds as Bob flips through the paperwork checking that everything is in order and occasionally (1/50) make some note or request at the end of the 10 seconds. <strong>Normally</strong> the polite thing to do would be to make some idle, friendly smalltalk until he confirms that its all good and I lock the door and go back inside. However, we have been making the same comments for almost a year and because of this I feel the etiquette may be different to the usual.</p>

<p>It is important to my colleagues and I that we have a polite, friendly and professional relationship with Bob. A few things have come up over the past year (e.g. I know Bob has one son and one daughter and he knows I play recreational table tennis) but in general 10 seconds is not long enough to properly get to know someone. Conversations can sometimes resume the next day but that is a moot point because I have no interest whatsoever in getting to know Bob.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell Bob seems equally happy not to engage in any conversation that would take extra time and just stick with being polite in the minimalist sense of the word. But it is not exactly clear to me what that means in our scenario. It is hard for me to believe that proper etiquette would be to repeat the same pleasantries 100 times (they are certainly <strong>not</strong> pleasant by this point) but saying nothing (which to be honest is what I feel like doing) seems like it could be misinterpreted as stand-offish and having good professional etiquette takes priority.</p>

"Coping with different spending philosophies in a marriage","<p>I am British, in my mid-twenties, and in a pretty well paying job. My wife is Chinese, a few years older than me, and while having a moderately well paying job previously is currently is a student. We've been married for four years now, and she has no savings of her own, and as such she relies on me for her finances. We live in the UK, and generally our marriage is in good shape.</p>

<p>I was brought up in a middle-class family -- not poor, but I still certainly couldn't have everything I wanted as a kid. This has led me to always seek justification before spending. That's not to say I won't splash out on expensive items -- I will, but I have to be confident that there's a good reason for spending the money first. For example, I sim race a lot and so have a fairly expensive wheel and pedal set, but I felt this was justified as I was spending a lot of time on this activity and thought (correctly) it would increase my enjoyment.</p>

<p>My wife has a different way of thinking about money. She enjoys shopping and buying new things, but she thinks much more about the quality of items rather than the price. This would be fine in a field I'm comfortable with and understand the quality difference -- for example, when buying a new computer -- but in fields like jewellery and clothes, I find it very hard to quantify the benefits of spending a lot more in order to get higher quality. My wife correctly complains that I am only comfortable spending money based on my own thinking process, even if she is the one the purchase is for. This results in arguments when the item is not something I know enough about to quantify the benefits of.</p>

<p>I've suggested giving her a budget each month for spending with no restrictions on what's purchased with it, but she says that this would still stress her out as now she would always have to put money in the equation when deciding what to purchase. The truth is that I <em>do</em> earn a lot of money for my age and we save a lot of money as it is, so I could likely afford these items, but I find it hard to bring myself to spend money that I don't understand the justification for spending. Asking her what she would do in my position if the roles were reversed, she says she wouldn't impose any restrictions on me, which may well be true, but I'm uneasy going that far.</p>

<p>I don't want our differences in spending philosophy to affect our relationship, but I also am concerned about the ramifications about giving someone free access to my finances, even my own wife. We've discussed that we would keep our finances separate many times in the past, and I already percieve that I allow her more financial leeway than I generally allow myself.</p>

<p>Am I being unreasonable? What haven't I tried that might be helpful?</p>

  <p>My colleague: No.</p>
  
  <p>My colleague: Look, that guy asked me if he can eat my hamburger.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way which you can speak to others in such that others won’t need to tell to others about what I told them or asked them?</strong> It’s really disrupting me and annoys me that they act like it is so weird. I wish there would be a way to put an end to this kind of situation. </p>

<p>For example, when you see someone eating something and you would like to how how it tastes, how do you ask your colleague in such a way that they wont tell others what you asked?</p>

<p>The reason I asked my colleague about this, is because I felt taste for it to eat, because I wanted to try how does the hamburger tastes different from shaorma.</p>

<p>Before one of my colleagues invited me and other one with her in one desk, so that we can talk in a break time, and she allowed me to eat from what she eats and she didn’t repeat it to others.</p>

<p>This doesn't seem like a weird request to me. I ask my mother or my sister sometimes this. And according to my logic, it is polite to ask someone. If that person says, no, then I respect their wish. Sharing food is one of the ways you can build good relationship.</p>

"How to deal with person offloading their indecision on their host under guise of kindness?","<p>Hard to come up with a succinct title for this question, but a few sentences should clarify:</p>

<p>My partner and I are hosting a relative of my partner for a 2 week visit. There's a reoccurring issue which is escalating. <strong>We'll ask the relative if they want to do something we expect they'd enjoy - sometimes activities they specifically voiced interest in - and the relative declines the activity based on reasons why <em>we</em> wouldn't want to do it or why they don't want to put <em>us</em> through the trouble. That's what I mean by offloading their indecision on us under the guise of caring about our preference.</strong> If they actually listened to our preference, they wouldn't put the fault or reasons on us for why not to do various activities.</p>

<p>For example, let's say this relative expressed interest in going out to dinner as we plan for the day. We'll agree, but then when it's time to go out to dinner and we discuss where to go or get ready to go, this relative will implore us to stay home - ""Oh, you both seem tired, wouldn't you rather stay home?"" or ""There's no need for us to go out and spend money, we can just stay home and cook, you two don't need to go out of your way for me."" We'll patiently confirm we <em>want</em> to go out, and that the issues this relative raises are nonissues for us. We'll ask if <em>they'd</em> prefer to stay in and we can be flexible, but their response is always about <em>us</em> and never about <em>them</em> (e.g. ""Oh, I'm fine to go out or to stay in, but we should stay in because you two ___________"").</p>

<p>As noted, this has escalated. It occurs in minor events throughout the day, and it can be difficult to carry on in our usual routines or do the activities this relative expressed interest in doing. There is always an excuse about us and avoiding their own preference. We tried patiently accepting this behavior as an indicator of their preference, but then they contradict themselves by noting boredom or suggesting activities (which they'd later resist).</p>

<p>My partner tried to address this to their relative sincerely, pointing out that this behavior is rejecting positive experiences as if it were <em>our</em> fault or preference, but in reality those are often nonissues and it's as if this relative is 'putting words in our mouth' so to speak. They tried to be kind, but had lost their patience with this reoccurring behavior. As has happened when confronting this relative about anything that may be a fault or weakness of theirs, they became very dramatic and portrayed themselves as the victim of my partner's meanness. (They're not an easy personality to work with but are a relative we care about nonetheless.) This has created an uncomfortable situation and maybe an early end to this visit (on the relative's request, not ours - we'd prefer an amicable remainder to their planned stay and enjoying activities together which we all looked forward to). So whether for now or future encounters, I wonder: <strong>How to deal with person offloading their indecision on their host under guise of caring for assumptions of the host's preference?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Edit following up on initial answers: Thanks for the replies all. We already tried what was suggested often, which is basically 'calling the bluff' and either not going out if they resist doing so, or go out anyway and invite them along. It mostly works...they'll come enjoy dinner with us, but in the end of the night still follow up with the ""I'm only looking out for you"" stuff. E.g. if they said ""no need to go out, you both are probably tired"" then after a satisfying dinner if we yawn they'd say ""What did I tell you? You're both so tired, we shouldn't have gone out."" That further strains our patience.</p>

<p>After my partner confronted their relative about this behavior, then tried to make peace by going to do the activity with or without the relative but calmly inviting them first. That contributed to this relative dramatically feeling like the victim and wanting to go home (which is an expensive change of flight schedule in this case). So to conclude...seems most agree 'calling their bluff' is the way to go for this type of behavior, but in this situation, there are other issues (overdramatic, feeling like the victim, rash decisions) at play.</p>

<p>Regularly, loud people are not too bothersome of an issue as to not being able to enjoy a meal, and you can even crack a joke at their expense, but this person was being rude to their own fellows, made me cringe from how she talked to one of them.</p>

"How to handle a close but unhealthy friendship that cannot be ended?","<p>Alice and I met when we were both nine year old. We had a very close and intense friendship for years. However, due in part to mental health issues from both of us, this friendship is now very unhealthy for me, and I believe it isn't healthy for her too.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Alice suffers from severe anxiety problems (including social anxiety) and is a highly sensitive person (extremely). She might have other mental disorders, I'm really not sure.
Six years ago, she had a depressive episode with dissociative identity disorders. She had this other personality (let's call him Bob) that was terrifying for me : Bob would insult me, threaten me <em>and Alice</em>, giving me full responsibility of the situation, etc. Bob was aware of Alice, but Alice would not remember her episodes as Bob. She only knew about them because we talked about it. On the other hand, when Bob was quiet, Alice would rely totally on me for her well-being, calling me at any time of the day or night when she wasn't feeling right, being very jealous of my other friends, and often accusing me of not being there for her.</p>

<p>It was a traumatizing experience for me too and I suffered from depression myself. I'm still in therapy, and there is no doubt that this experience with Alice had a impact on my mental health.
Hopefully, Alice got psychiatric help and she got better. I haven't heard from Bob again and I don't think I will again.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today : Alice is in a not-so-good situation in life right now, and she is very stressed about it. Probably related to her high level of permanent stress, she have very worrying (physical), life-threatening, health issues. I tried my best to support her, and to keep my own problems to myself. Still, she's slowly turning back to the behaviors she had six  years ago (excluding identity disorders) and talking with her in these situation is very stressful for me (strong negative emotions, panic attacks...). They are specially difficult to handle because I do not have the time to speak with her a lot ; we live in different cities and it is not possible at the moment for me to visit her ; and mostly because it brings me back to this period and I just emotionally break down in seconds. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I cannot and do not want to end the friendship. I really think she needs me right now more than ever. I know she is aware of and <em>cannot stop the behaviors that are stressful to me</em>. I know only a professional might ""fix"" it and I'm just asking on how to make this situation easier for both of us.</p>

<p><strong>How can I end or handle discussions that are too stressful for me ?</strong> I explained to my friend why her behavior was ""too much"", now <strong>how can I help her to improve the situation ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What I have tried</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I talked with her about the things that bothered me in the most honest and gentle way I could. She understood it, though she didn't change her behavior much, and I don't think she really can at the moment.</li>
<li>I tried to ask her to <em>stop</em> a conversation, or to change topic to something less stressful. She understood my distress but didn't change the subject, or returned to it a few sentences later.</li>
<li>I tried ""taking breaks"". Telling her from time to time that I was very busy/that I couldn't talk to her now, and having a few days to myself before going back to her. It works while I'm don't speak to her, but it didn't make the conversations easier the next time they appeared and doesn't feel like a solution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not the only one that is having trouble with her. We share two other good friends, and both of them told me they can't take it anymore. They are not as close to her as I am, but she doesn't have a lot of friends and she cares deeply for them. I'm afraid that if they leave, it might have a strong impact on her.</li>
<li>She is getting psychiatric help.</li>
</ul>

"How to convince father to accept decision without holding a grudge later on?","<p>So I got this situation going on:</p>

<p>My sister is going to get married and doesn't want my father to escort her to the altar. She wants me to do it. My father has been told that he shall not escort her, and since then he's been holding a grudge and has been threatening to ""sabotage"" the wedding so my sister won't have any fun at it.</p>

<p>The relationship between my father and us (his children) is not the best. Even now he often ruins family meetings for at least 1 person without really noticing, and seems to be pretty thin-skinned.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How can I solve this situation with the following goals?</strong></p>

<p>Goals in order of importance</p>

<ul>
<li>Have my father attend the wedding without sabotaging it.</li>
<li>Have my father accept her decision without holding a grudge.</li>
<li>Not threaten him in any way to force the points above.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>To answer a few questions that are not clear:</p>

<p>Q: Does he have an idea about why your sister doesn't want him to walk with her to the altar?</p>

<p>A: I am not sure if he knows all the reasons, but the biggest seems to be his look. My sister told me that she want someone good-looking to accompany her. because of this there is no way my sister would want him to accompany her.</p>

<p>Q: Does he feel the same as you, i.e. does he think that he has a difficult relationship with you and your sister?</p>

<p>A: I think he knows that the relationship is not very good, but I doubt he realizes that his actions are sometimes counter-productive.</p>

<p>Q: What arguments have you tried?</p>

<p>A: I haven't talked to him since then and I don't know what my sister used as arguments (if they even talked about it thoroughly).</p>

<p>Q: What arguments are you planning to use?</p>

<p>A: I thought about telling him that it's my sisters wedding and that it is her decision and I fully support her. Sadly I have no idea how I could get him to actually accept it and not act out on it.</p>

<p>Q: What should answers take into account?</p>

<p>A: The main goal of any answer would be the goals stated above. I am happy with any input that can help me achieve all/some of the goals.</p>

<p>Q: What not to advise because it won't work?</p>

<p>A: To tell you the truth, I have absolutely no idea. I only barely talk with my father (like once every 2-3 months for a few hours). He moved out more than 10 years ago and since then I have no participation in his life and don't know what's going on or how he changed (I am a bit introverted).</p>

"How to decline additional help when friend won't take no for an answer","<p>A friend of mine has a business idea. He asked if I knew how to make (smartphone) apps, and I said yes. I recently graduated and currently have some spare time for a side project and could see this being valuable experience to present in an interview, even if the business doesn't prove to be profitable.</p>

<p>I met with my friend a few times to discuss the business and the app he wants for it, and at first things seemed reasonable, though now he wants me to help with side projects and the actual running of the business. I told him I said I could help make an app, not be his e.g. account etc. He just argues ""we need to start small"" and ""it's nothing complex"". He has also been messaging me and acting like he's my boss and has gradually been increasing the work load. </p>

<p>I find him enjoyable to hangout with, we both have the same taste of music and enjoy going to venues together. But I really don't appreciate how he's acting as if I agreed to do all this work and isn't listening to my concerns. It's really getting annoying, he's texting me ""are you at work?"" and when I reply ""yes"" he replies ""does everything I sent you make sense?""</p>

<p>I've been ignoring his texts and call or telling him I'm busy but he doesn't seem to want to take no for an answer. How can I tell him I'm not going to build his business for him and still remain friends? How can I avoid arguing with him?</p>

<p>We live in North America and my friend is Filipino. I noticed some people are very good at wording things and making the situation very difficult for their request to be decline, and I've noticed Filipino can be like this.</p>

<p>If this were professional work there would a long legal contract specifying the exact nature. Normally with friends, is it really necessary to state before starting ""I have the right to stop helping you at my sole discretion and may become busy with other work""?</p>

<p>Edit for answers given: I know if I ask to get paid he would just say ""when this takes off you will get lots of money"". Of course there's no guarantee of it taking off.</p>
"
"How to deal with unreasonableness","<p>My attitude is that one cannot reason with someone who, for whatever cause, is being unreasonable. If that party has got it into their head that they are right, even despite blatant contrary evidence, no amount of justification will change that. Indeed, empirically, it usually makes matters worse. However, agreeing or submitting to their whims -- whilst an easy option -- is clearly not a good solution as it undermines yourself and sets a precedent for increasingly wild allegations. I therefore feel that, as one cannot ""win"" in this situation, the best option is to remove yourself from the situation entirely: i.e., don't ""play"".</p>

<p>However, this is not always possible. For example, if your significant other is being unreasonable, what does one do? One can listen and try to empathise with their position as much as you like, but it rarely works; meanwhile, your own position is marginalised, which causes increasing frustration. Changing the subject -- which is basically ""not playing"" -- can work, if whatever's being discussed is trivial enough, but for everything else, it's not going to fly. Asserting your position, as I describe above -- especially with logic -- definitely doesn't work, no matter how sympathetic you are!</p>

<p>Short of becoming an absolute stoic -- and I guess training yourself to not become defensive is partly a solution -- what techniques can you use to quell an unreasonable or non-evidence based argument when you're forced to engage?</p>

"How to talk to moms letting their kids play in the streets","<p>I drive down a street everyday to get home. I use this specific street because there’s a four way stop and it really helps me avoid traffic accidents down it and I just feel safer using it. There are no dividing lanes, shoulders or sidewalks.</p>

<p>Today a mom waves me over and accused me of speeding through their street every day, and says they are afraid their kids might get run over.</p>

<p>The other times I’ve come down the street if there are kids, I always stop to make sure they are out of the street before I go. (Personally I wish they didn’t let their kids play on the streets but I’m not a parent and don’t know their point of view)</p>

<p>I always go 20 mph, there is always a police officer monitoring people's speed around here. If I was speeding, he would catch me.</p>

<p>I don’t really know if they just want me to stop coming down this street (again, I mostly use it because I feel safer at the 4 way stop it leads to) but I have a feeling they are going to try and get their kids to purposely block the road or something if I continue coming down the street. </p>

<p>Is there a way I can talk to them so I can continue going down this street or I probably have to find a different path for now on? </p>

<p>[<strong>Edit 1</strong>] about the street, it’s in a residential area. The street is 1 turn away from the highway.</p>

<p>[<strong>Edit 2</strong>] Conversation with the mom went like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mom: You need to slow down, we have babies and the speed limit is only 20 mph. </p>
  
  <p>Me: Yeah it's 20mph. </p>
  
  <p>Mom: ""It's <em>only</em> 20 mph."" (I think she assumed I couldn't speak English???) </p>
  
  <p>Me: I know that. (drives away)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And update, I've been going through the road a little slower when I see children there (10-15mph) otherwise if there's no kids (ie, it's raining usually the kids don't play outside) I just go the 20mph... so far. I still get some evil eyes from the parents when I use the street, but hopefully it's ok.</p>

<p>I do live in this neighborhood and even grew up here when the speed limit was 25mph. And we have had neighbors kids / neighbors play bad pranks like cover our car lights in black paint and put nails in our tires before which is mostly what worried me if the situation escalated, but luckily they seem reasonable?</p>

"How to ask someone to follow security protocol without sounding rude or commanding?","<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>My workplace uses key fobs to enter our building in all 4 locations except the entrance that opens up to the front desk. These locations are distributed fairly evenly on each side of the building. Recently, security is investing effort into ensuring no one is ""piggy backing"" off of anyone else's key fob to get into the building. </p>

<p>It's my understanding that historically these efforts have long been taken lightly, as the company is fairly small and everyone tends to know each other (meaning there's a general assumption that we all know who we can let in, and that even if we did, surely it would be quickly discovered that they didn't belong here).</p>

<h2>The Issue</h2>

<p>I don't personally feel our building security is at great risk, but I'd like to appease both parties (security team and friendly coworkers) and avoid being caught in an awkward confrontation, in which I could get reprimanded.  </p>

<p>Because of this, I feel it's better to just follow the rules altogether.  The problem is that I don't feel comfortable with any approach I've thought of on my own.</p>

<p>My instinct is to say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you mind scanning your key fob since they've asked us to not allow each other in anymore?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but I've always backed down from saying anything at fear of receiving an eye roll by my peers, as no one else seems to take this seriously.</p>

<p>Additionally, I'm terrible with faces.  It's difficult for me to tell the difference between a stranger and 75% of the people that work in this building with me, even though I see them all frequently and most of them know me by name. Because of this, I feel like it would come off as rude to admit I don't recognize one of them.</p>

<p>While I'm usually able to avoid this situation by pacing my steps differently from others approaching the door, I'd like to be prepared for the next situation in which I'm unable to do so.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best way I can ask someone to follow this security requirement without sounding like a stickler?</strong></p>

"What to do if I find a woman already waiting for an elevator?","<p>When I try to get on an elevator, sometimes a woman is already waiting for the elevator. There is no other person around there.</p>

<p>Then, after the woman recognizes I'm also going to get on, she suddenly walks away and starts to wait for the next one. It is clear that she misses it not because she recalls something to do but because she is definitely avoiding me. </p>

<p>I understand that women feel frightened to get on the same elevator with a male stranger alone. I also understand that it is not uncommon that these women have encountered one or more bad experiences in the past. </p>

<p>That being said, I'm not sure what, as a male, to do if a woman is already waiting for the elevator before I reach it. Specifically,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How should I reach the elevator? </p></li>
<li><p>Should I speak to or greet the woman or just keeps silent? I feel in both cases women get fearful...</p></li>
<li><p>If the woman starts to walk away, is there anything I should do or just let her stay away? </p></li>
<li><p>If the woman gets on the same elevator, how can I relieve her of the fear? (at least I know I should push the button first to let her know at which floor I'm going to get off...)</p></li>
<li><p>And is there anything I should specifically take care of in these cases?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Although an extremely courteous man might see the woman off alone and then wait for another elevator, all unnoticed by the woman, I feel that is too much to do as a stranger. </p>

<p>If the location of the case where a woman walks away is relevant, this only happened in Japan. The situation was everywhere; in one case, it was an apartment (the entrance is locked and only residents can enter); in another case, it was inside a normal building; in another case, it was an elevator in a metro and in this case there was one more person (elderly man) but nonetheless the schoolgirl walked away when she recognized me, although she was going to get on the same elevator with the elderly...</p>

<p>And for those who don't know, Japan, especially Tokyo, has no such small talk culture as you see in North America, and if a stranger talks to someone, it is usually deemed a pervert.</p>

"How to deal with situations where Asian girls don't like me (Asian male) but want to talk with White guy I'm with?","<p>I'm an East Asian guy living in East Asia (multiple countries), and sometimes when I'm with a white guy, lets' call him Bob, for example in a cafe, canteen, or even on the street, a few girls approach us. In most cases the girls are friends or acquaintances of Bob, but sometimes they are just strangers.</p>

<p>When the girls approach us, they start to talk with Bob, and I'm fine with just waiting for a minute. But in many cases, they want to talk longer, and I generally get bored so I go away alone or use my phone. But this does not always work, since often I can't go straight away, like sitting at a cafe or waiting for the next class in my classroom.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is the girls are uninterested in me and they only want to talk with Bob. Usually when both of us had the first eye contact, the girls on purpose look away, as if they saw nothing. I'm totally fine with the girls not being interested in me so I use my phone while they are there.</p>

<p>What annoys me most is that Bob starts to force me into the conversation or introduce me to the girls, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is (insert my name), my friend/classmate/neighbor!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I know the girls aren't interested in me, and so it is very uncomfortable to be introduced in such a way, in which case the girls usually grudgingly nod a little, or smile bitterly.</p>

<p>Another case was when Bob abruptly asks my opinion about the topic, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How about you? What do you think? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I respond, the girls treat it as if I issued nothing, and all of them return back to their own conversation. These situations are very uncomfortable for me, and I rather want to be alone, without being disrupted, but Bob constantly wants to force me into the conversation.</p>

<p>What I find even more annoying is that Bob refers to something I have in common with one of the girls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(To the girl) Do you also use it?/Are you also that? Then it's the same as him! (pointing to me...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least I'm sure he does not have any ill intention nor desires to mock me, and instead he just wants to include me as he likely thinks I feel isolated. </p>

<p>How to tell Bob I don't like to join the conversation as I think the girls are not interested in me? How can I get Bob not to mention me or force me into the conversation? </p>

<p>Preferably I want to tell him in advance, before it happens again.</p>

"How to avoid participating in a team-building trip without causing bad feelings for coworkers?","<p>I've been in this company (and team) for almost 10 months now. Everything was O.K.: project, team, team-leader etc. But our TL (team leader) got a better offer from another company and of course, he accepted it. For few weeks we had no TL, but we managed somehow to keep working at the project, everything was cool and I'm quite sure we could keep it that way.</p>

<p>But, as every team needs a TL, we have been assigned one (he is the leader of 2 teams now) and he and his first team decided to have a team-building trip for 2 days somewhere close to a mountain. Of course, now that we are his team, he invited us to join. It was very nice of him and all my coworkers accepted to join.</p>

<p>I don't have something else planned for that weekend, it's organized by company so expenses would be from my behalf very low, it's not that I don't like my colleagues, I do, but I don't want to go for a few reasons.</p>

<p>Since the other team will be there and they are about 30 people (compared to us, 6) I won't feel good. I don't want to meet new people, or make new friends. I'm comfortable with my friends and my colleagues (to whom I get along quite well). Also, there will be drinking, drunk people, smoking and loud music (things that I can't stand).</p>

<p>The thing is that I've avoided until now a few team-building trips or hang outs and had reasons (except the ones above). I also did it this time (and want to do it further) but now... there was quite a wonder for the TL and team, so they started with questions. My final answer was that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have things to do and I wouldn't give up on them since it will be harder for me to do it later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were surprised of my decision (probably of my reason too), especially the TL.</p>

<p>Now, my question is: <strong>how do I avoid going with them in team-building trips or hang outs without causing bad feelings for my coworkers</strong>?</p>

<p>I wouldn't like to be tagged as the ""asocial-guy"" or make them think ""He doesn't want to hang out with us"". I want to make them understand that it's not that I do not like them or something like that. It is O.K, and even a pleasure for me to work with them or to chat when we're in break, but I just don't want to go in team-building.</p>

<p>So, how to I avoid the team building trips, but assure my colleagues it's nothing personal? I would like them to accept me as a ""don't want to come"" person, but without having bad feelings towards me (if that's even possible).</p>

"How to communicate to my aunt that she made an honest mistake when buying food for a family meal?","<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>My aunt bought some houmous thinking it was vegan when it wasn't. How do I tell her she made a mistake without upsetting her?</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>The other day, I was at a family dinner. My aunt didn't mind making it a vegan meal. </p>

<p>She bought houmous thinking it was vegan. My little sister pointed out (to me, privately) that it wasn't vegan because there was some white cheese inside (she knew because she had helped to transfer the houmous from the box into a nicer container. I didn't ask her if she actually did read the ingredient list but she wouldn't have known there was ""white cheese"" in it otherwise. I wasn't very surprised because I have seen houmous with cheese in it in the past).</p>

<p>Later during the meal, my cousin asked me if I had checked that the chips were vegan because, sometimes, there are eggs in it. I hadn't (I didn't know they put eggs in some chips), my little sister ran to see if they were, they were. </p>

<p>My aunt got mad at my cousin (her son) and said that she had checked the chips and that she also had checked the houmous and there weren't any eggs in it so both were vegan.</p>

<p>I didn't say anything to my aunt (because I didn't want to upset her further). I just double checked with my sister that the houmous wasn't vegan (she was sure that there was cheese in it, I believed her).</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>My aunt bought the houmous thinking it was vegan (because it had no eggs in it) but it wasn't, as there was cheese in it. Now she might make the same mistake in the future. I don't want this to happen but I also don't want to hurt my aunt (she is a very sensitive person).</p>

<h1>What I tried</h1>

<p>Nothing. When she told my cousin she had checked for eggs, it was a very bad timing to tell her that the houmous was, in fact, not vegan because of the cheese.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p><strong>How to communicate to my aunt that she made an honest mistake when buying the food for this family meal, without upsetting her?</strong></p>

<h1>Notes and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm the only vegan in my family but my other cousin (my aunt's daughter), who wasn't there that day, is vegetarian.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though my little sister is not a vegan nor a vegetarian, she is very supportive of me and will always be on my side when it comes to veganism.</p></li>
<li><p>My aunt knows the difference between vegan and vegetarian (she had put vegan cheese on the lasagna and she buys me rice milk when I stay for the night). I think she just didn't notice the cheese in the ingredient list (I, myself, had the same problem a few time when I start becoming vegan).</p></li>
<li><p>I'm 23 and my sister is 17.</p></li>
<li><p>I never saw the ingredients list but I trust my sister.</p></li>

"How to voice my concerns to a friend with mental health issues?","<p>I'm looking for advice on how to deal with a complicated situation I'm going through. This is my last semester at college, and the only course I have left consists of developing a single, final project. Projects are either proposed by teachers, or by students themselves, in which case it needs to be approved by the teachers themselves. Suffice to say, teacher proposed projects are sparse, so most students usually propose one themselves.</p>

<p>A friend of mine (let's call him Joe) and I proposed a project that's been accepted, based on an idea that he had. I recently started working, so I don't have as much time to dedicate to the project as Joe does, but I'm really excited about it and wouldn't mind putting any and all free time I have into it, however sparse it may be. But the issue is, Joe is going through a depression. Every time we get together to work on the project, he acts uninterested and unmotivated. Which is totally understandable, given his situation.</p>

<p>My concerns are that, if Joe is unwilling (or should I say unable) to make at least the same effort as I, I don't think the project will succeed. I've tried to make him feel excited about it, to no avail. At the same time, I don't want to give up on it, for two reasons. First, I really like the project, and I fear that I might not have a chance to change and do another one this semester. Second, he's my friend and I care for him, and I want him to want to do it, as I think it would help him cope with his depression. Continuing the project without him feels like ""stealing"" his idea, so I'm not going to do that.</p>

<p>I'm really conflicted here because I really want to finish college this semester, not a year from now, but at the same time I want to make it with him, and with his idea. But I don't think it's possible if he doesn't somehow cope with his problem. 
My question is: how can I voice my concerns in a way that doesn't make him feel bad, running the risk of him just giving up on the project? How can I ask him if he really wants to do it? I just want to know if I can count on him. </p>

"Does it go against netiquette to give constructive feedback on Facebook?","<h3>Story</h3>

<p>I'm a participant in several arts and crafts groups on Facebook. Some of them have a 'be nice' rule stated in their group rules. This rule often states that when people post their craft asking 'what do you think', you're only allowed to say 'looks good!' or not react at all. </p>

<p>Last week, I joined a new international group. I don't know where the moderator there is from, their profile is very protected, but there are members from all over the world. After about 2 days there, I saw a post that went something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you think of X? It's supposed to be a gift, but I'm unsure about its quality. I'm unsure about the colors I picked (I'm always no good at that!) and the fact that I used so many different kinds of yarn. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, the doubts expressed in this post were genuine. Although I was new to the group, I had been practicing the craft for a while and had been picking color schemes and yarns for my own crafts for even longer. I thought the thing looked sort of messy and some of the colors were obviously clashing. <strong>So, I checked the group rules to see what their rules on feedback were</strong>. There wasn't anything that explicitly told me that I could only comment if I could say 'Looks good'. </p>

<p>So, I <a href=""https://www.wikihow.com/Give-a-Feedback-Sandwich"" rel=""noreferrer"">sandwiched my feedback</a>, complimented the maker on their technique and expressed an interest in learning some tricks from them. I then gave some advice on how to pick colors, and on what to keep in mind when picking different kinds of yarn. I ended with a compliment to the creativeness of the craft. </p>

<p>This was well received by the maker, we continued our chat via private messenger and I gave her more advice on how to pick colors, provided her with references to sites that can help with such things. I told her my favorite kinds of yarn, and we exchanged some pictures of other crafts we did. She also showed me some tricks with regard to the craft we were originally discussing. </p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>The crafter and I took our leave on Facebook, and I went to bed. Only to wake up the next morning with a stern message from a group admin saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I removed your post. We want people to be nice. That means you can't criticize other peoples crafts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I apologized, stated that I didn't see the rule in the group rules and thus thought it was okay to provide constructive feedback, but that I wouldn't do it again. </p>

<p>The reply that came to this message is still puzzling me today, because how am I going to get better at my craft and share my experience/knowledge if it is true?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We shouldn't have to put such things in a group rule. It's common sense and good manners!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't push it further, but since I don't want to make another huge faux pas in other groups, my question is: </p>

<p><strong>Does it go against netiquette to provide constructive feedback in a Facebook group? If not, how do I explain so to the moderator and ask them to put something up in their rules so other people won't make the same mistake, without a risk of getting kicked from the group?</strong></p>

One roommate (21m) goes through toilet paper like water (like we're talking 8 rolls in like a week or two). But basically me and my other roommate/childhood friend (22m) don't know if we should like confront him or just start using our own toilet paper or just keep buying copious amounts of toilet paper (we go through like a roll/month each)...like what do you say?? I'm thinking I should just suggest we all buy our own toilet paper but I don't know how to say this without it being weird.</p>

"Etiquette regarding borrowing of power tools","<p>Based on television shows, it seems borrowing tools from neighbors is a potential minefield. I need to power wash my front and back porches and the siding of my house. My neighbor has a power washer that he uses to do this on his house 2 times a year. In the ideal world I would borrow the power washer every year or two (I don't care if my siding and porch are a little dirty).</p>

<p>Details that may be relevant: I live in a highly urban area of a major US city in a block of row homes. I have no space to store a power washer, but the neighbor has a shed in his back yard. I see the neighbor regularly (he likes to sit on his porch) and we happily chat for a few minutes. We have been into each other's houses a few times.</p>

<p>Can I ask to borrow the power washer and if so how? I would plan on using it for a few hours and returning it clean and dry, is there anything else I should do? Is payment in beer (he drinks beer on his porch) appropriate?</p>

"Going to a strip club for a friend's bachelor party. Is it common practice to inform my girlfriend?","<p>One of my friends I know from college is getting married next year. As tradition dictates, a bachelor party is being organised and I have been invited as well. Two people are in charge of planning the activities for the evening and among other things, us going to a strip club is being discussed. Although strip clubs are socially accepted for the most part, I can imagine you don't like the idea of your partner spending an evening with scantily clad people of the opposite sex.
Even if your relationship is healthy and unfaithfulness was never an issue.</p>

<p>I can imagine informing her just to make sure no concerns are raised. I can also imagine we should trust in each other on pure principle. You might say ""yes of course, trust is one of the most important parts of a relationship"" and I agree. But my objective here is to not hurt any feelings.</p>

<p>My question is this. <strong>Is it common to tell my girlfriend in advance that we might go to a strip club? If so, why (or why not)? How do I inform her then?</strong></p>

<p>Some points on my situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have absolutely no intention of being unfaithful to my girlfriend</li>
<li>I have never been to such an establishment so I have no idea of how it works and what to expect</li>
<li>The goal is to have a good time with friends and not to ogle at strippers (JustCarty and user2851843 mentioned this and I agree so I included this point)</li>
<li>There seems to be a bit of confusion about my intentions. I'm not trying to actively hide this from my girlfriend. I'm wondering if such matters should be specifically discussed with one's partner because, in a good relationship, you can trust each other not to engage in cheating and/or unfaithful behaviour</li>

<p>We were at a party for a mutual friend and as we were standing in a circle, talking to each other, she started talking about her kids' field trip. I was semi listening, semi listening to the other conversation next to me. When she showed the picture of two toddlers, I asked her if one of the kids had down syndrome.

"How can I ""chill"" about my position on game rules without looking like I'm just ""taking my ball and going home""?","<p>My friends at work and I meet up for lunch to play short card and board games.</p>

<p>Lately, we've had enough people to play a card game every day. (Not like poker or such, packaged card games). This is great! It's usually a huge stress relief for me, and a lot of fun!</p>

<p>But one of the newer guys, who seems to get agitated easily and get pissy quickly, makes jokes about my enforcing the rules of the game (however convoluted they may be) whenever someone asks about rules of the games. Admittedly, I make jokes on occasion as well, so I haven't been letting it bother me.</p>

<p>Until today. Today during a game, one of the players started clearing ""out"" cards off the table mid game and preparing for the next game<sup>&dagger;</sup>. This is <em>explicitly</em> against the rules of the game, but I refrained from making a scene about it at the time. I figured it really usually doesn't affect the game, though this was the first time he'd done it, so why make a scene? I could just point it out after.</p>

<p>Well, this time, his clearing the ""out"" cards did affect the game. With one card left each for two players, one player used his turn to call a card that had been played out. (All the cards of that type were out.) He had no way to know this, because the cards were all taken back and were being shuffled. Normally, not a big deal. However, to mix up the game, we had houseruled a little. We had removed two cards from the deck before we started.</p>

<p>Luckily, the player that had picked up and shuffled the cards knew for sure what the burn cards were, and everything was fine. But, the first player lost the game because he had no way of knowing the card he was calling was out, not counting the burn cards. The second player stopped to ask how many of that card had gone out already, so he was able to win in that move.</p>

<p>In the moments of this incident happening, I pointed out that this <em>was against the rules</em> and it impacted the game. I'm a stickler for rules for the most part, though I'm all for house rules if everyone has a say in whether we play them or not. (We put it to a vote, usually).</p>

<p>When I was pointing out this being against the rules, a lot of the group gave me these looks like it really didn't matter. The gentleman that makes jokes probably made another joke, but I was so bothered by the looks that I excused myself to go grab my lunch.</p>

<p>My immediate instinct was two fold:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Apologize on Slack because I <em>think</em> part of the looks was my tone. I may have sounded too aggressive or hostile, though that was not my intent. I don't know for sure that this was the case, but I will still apologize for it because these are my friends.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain that if the group wants me to not care about the rules so much, I can do that. That's fine! I've got no problem with it... But if we go this route, I no longer feel comfortable offering up my own games to play.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>First thought, naturally, no problem. I'll be doing that regardless. The second thought, however... It feels like ""taking my ball and going home."" The others don't seem to care as much about how closely we follow the rules. Again, I'm fine with this! As long as we all agree to how closely we're following them, or as long as I don't know them that well. I know the rules for all of my games pretty damn well, mainly so I can teach them to the group when we play.</p>

<p>I want to express to my friends that I'm cool with being more lax on the rules, but I'm not comfortable with being more lax with the rules on my own games (Mainly because I know them so well I'm not sure I could be more lax...) though I'm more than open to compromises that are suggested. I don't, however, want to come across as petty or ""my way or the highway"" when/if I bring this point up.</p>

<p>How can I express this without sounding petty?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Further context:</strong></p>

<p>We are all IT professionals in a State job, but in different departments. We're all in the same building. I am the only female of our group, most days. I'm also one of the better players.</p>

<p>The easily agitated player is one of the older men. The age ranges are from (guessing because I haven't asked any of the older guys) probably 40/50ish to 22. I'm on the lower end of that, with only two of the guys younger than me.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub><sup>&dagger;</sup> For clarity, the game was <em><a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup"" rel=""noreferrer"">Coup</a></em>. In it, you get two of five types of card, there's a set number of each type in the deck. You can claim to be any card in the deck, but if another player calls you on a lie, you lose a card. If they call you and you're lying, they lose a card. Lost cards are flipped face up and remain so on the table. We also had a house rule to remove two cards from the deck before starting.</sub></p>

"Have I lost my best friend because I told him I liked him?","<p>So I met a guy at work a nine months back, and over time we became really good friends. Initially, he had a huge wall up, and wouldn't open up at all, but over time, as he began to trust me, he let it down bit by bit, till I became one of his closest confidantes about all things emotional.</p>

<p>When I met him, he was in a friends with benefits relationship, but he had feelings for the girl. Over time, it blew into a full- fledged relationship. In the meantime, I, being the absolute idiot that I am, developed warm fuzzy feelings for him. Of course, I didn't act on them, but they were very much there. As time passed we became closer and closer friends, but I moved to a different city for work, and most of our conversations were over text, sometimes over call. A month back, his girlfriend dumped him and he was heartbroken. He kept trying to get her to accept him back again, but she gave him a hard no. All this while, he'd talk to me and I'd listen to keep his mind of things. Two weeks back, he found out she was cheating on him all along, and he was shattered, and talked to me for a whole three hours, while in tears.</p>

<p>Well, before all this happened, I posted an article on my blog about having a crush on someone. It was an introspective article that focused on how I felt, no sappy descriptions of the guy or anything. So he chanced across it a week back, and kept pestering me about who it was. I held back to the very best of my ability, and this went on for two days, until he finally asked if it was about him, and I said yes. I wouldn't ever have told him at such a low point in his life if he hadn't straight out asked.</p>

<p>He was incredibly taken aback, and his first response was, 'This is fucking cringy for me, I don't know what to do,' followed by a whole lot of 'ME? Really? But we're so different'. Anyway, the conversation ended on a fairly normal note with him telling me we'd still be close friends and to not regret having told him. The next day, he told me he was always there for me if I was sad, and it felt really wrong to him when I cried. For a week, we carried on like we used to before and everything looked like it would be fine, till he suddenly stopped cold and left my text unanswered and stopped talking all together.</p>

<p>Should I just give him his space or ask him what's up? I feel incredibly guilty and confused.  </p>

<p>EDIT: It has only been 3 days, but this silence coming from a person who used to talk to me a lot, every single day, still feels like a long time. The goal is to stay friends with him because I really like him even just as a friend because he's really fun to hang out with and caring as well. I wouldn't want to intrude if he needs his space, but I don't know whether he needs space, or just doesn't want to be friends anymore or even if he is ready to talk about this. I just don't want to make him more uncomfortable than he already is.</p>

"How to say I want to stop having sex unless the relationship becomes serious?","<p>I'm from a conservative culture, but now I'm living in a culture where having sex within the first few dates is a norm. I have been able to cope with that, because the early non-serious stage of relationship doesn't last long, and the alternatives (being alone or dating religious people) are not an option. </p>

<p>But now I've been in a relationship around 5 months, and having sex. I don't want to end it but talking about getting serious hasn't been easy. I don't want to push him too much, but having sex in this uncertain stage this long is starting to affect my self-worth. I want to stop having sex until he wants it to be serious, or otherwise end the relationship.</p>

<p>By serious I mean being generally committed to each other, making an effort for a future together, not necessarily moving together or getting engaged instantly, but both agreeing that those things will happen at some point. We agreed on being monogamous shortly after starting dating, but for me that doesn't indicate serious commitment since talking about the future has been a little of an issue.</p>

<p>Basically I want to say ""no sex before you know if you want to be serious"", but how do I say that in a productive way and not seem manipulative? If I appear too accusing, maybe he'll think, ""If I agree now, will this become a recurring behavior she uses every time we disagree about something?""</p>

<p>Please note that this is a culture-specific question (from a Nordic country, if that matters) and practices from more conservative cultures may not be applicable. E.g. ""nobody thinks that, he simply has to agree"" is not a productive way to solve this problem. </p>

<p>However, I periodically read accounts online from restaurant servers that talk about how annoying it is to be asked to split a check. I like to think I'd be good at spotting that annoyance, but I know that in the US servers feel the need to always seem cheery and accommodating.</p>

"What is the most respectful way to respond when invited into a prayer circle or other religious activity I don't believe in?","<p>I live in a part of the United States where Christians are a strong majority.</p>

<p>I frequently find myself in social situations that involve everyone being asked to join in prayer.  I'm not religious, and I'm not Christian, and the prayers are invariably explicitly Christian.</p>

<p>As discussed in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/259/2185"">this question</a>, I am fine with being politely silent and still during the prayer. What that question doesn't cover, however, is <em>to what degree is it respectful for me to participate or not participate</em>?</p>

<p>The events sometimes involve family and extended family.  Other times the events are not family related at all, and instead are people who know each other as friends or coworkers (but typically the social gathering is outside of the context of work).</p>

<p>I don't like to discuss my beliefs, because I've seen a lot more hostility, intolerance, and bigotry based upon people not being Christian than in other areas I've lived in, including from people I had considered friends, and family members.</p>

<p>Some of these events are recurring, so I know that there will be a prayer of some sort ahead of time.  Other times, I have no idea that this will happen until everyone is called to gather. </p>

<p>These aren't events where I'd normally <em>expect</em> a religious component; we're typically at someone's house having dinner, and not in a church, or at a wedding or other ceremony.</p>

<p>Most times these events involve the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The organizer calls for everyone to gather</li>
<li>Everyone holds hands with the person on either side</li>
<li>Everyone bows their head</li>
<li>Everyone (?) closes their eyes</li>
<li>The organizer leads a prayer.  Sometimes this is a common prayer that is recited out loud by everyone.  Sometimes it is a prayer recited just by the organizer, but then when it ends everyone says ""Amen!"" out loud.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to be respectful, but to me, pretending to believe in their religion would be disrespectful.  </p>

<p>I generally hold hands with the people around me (even though this makes me uncomfortable), but I don't know if I should bow my head, close my eyes, or say ""Amen!"".  I feel like I shouldn't do any of those three things, since my understanding of them is that they are all indicative of respect for God and Jesus, and I can't respect something I don't believe in.</p>

<p>I <strong>do</strong> want to respect the people around me, however.</p>

<p>I also feel conspicuous and uncomfortable by not participating fully (although I feel far more uncomfortable just by being asked to participate).</p>

"How should I deal with my friend's anger issues?","<h1>The Situation</h1>

<p>Almost every day I'm spending time with my group of friends, among them one I will call John. Together, we often play videogames. When playing, John gets very easily upset by things others would brush off, and he gets very vocal about it.</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to bad ping, John gets hit by a shot when he was already around a corner. While others would let out a sigh or a disappointed ""Oh crap"", John begins to yell ""<strong>What the?!</strong> I was already around the corner! This f***ing game is so broken! I was already safe, I shouldn't have died!"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further, he almost always portrays any perceived injustice as specifically against him. It's not just bad net-code or wonky hitboxes - he acts as if the game <em>specifically</em> and <em>exclusively</em> treats him bad and nobody else.</p>

<p>As one might imagine, over the course of several hours, these outbursts begin to dampen the fun quite a lot, and sometimes lead him to ""rage-quitting"" and leaving the group for the day (which in turn might force us to abandon a game we all enjoyed because we are too few people).</p>

<h1>What I tried so far</h1>

<ol>
<li>I attempted to reason with him at first. For instance, I explained him that wonky hitboxes cause him to miss an enemy just as often as it causes the enemy to miss him. John was very resistant to such explanations and in turn claimed that others never miss <em>him</em> and that he is the only one affected negatively by it. Of course, this is just one example, but you get the idea.</li>
<li>I attempted to just ignore him and hope he would calm down by himself. This usually doesn't work, as he just keeps on going and on about how he is the victim of everything, about how everyone else is supposedly cheating and so on and so forth. It is just so draining to hear him ranting and complaining all the time and it just drains the fun out of everything for me.</li>
<li>I attempted to speak to him about how his outbursts and rants affect me, but he argued he can't help himself when he feels treaten unfairly. The rest of the conversation then ends up as shown in <strong>1.</strong>.</li>
<li>I attempted to calm him down by saying things like ""It's just a game, calm down"", with varying degrees of intensity, ranging from a relaxed and friendly tone to something more akin to ""Shut the f*** up! You've been ranting non-stop for one and a half hours now!"" (which was not very calming in retrospective). As one might imagine, the results ranged from ""No improvement"" to ""And then things got so much worse"".</li>
</ol>

<h1>What I considered trying</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I considered directly telling him that his temper is a massive problem for me (and at least ""very annoying"" according to others in our group) and that he has to get a grip on himself if he wants to keep playing with us.</p>

<p>I don't think that this is a good idea, because he might believe I don't want him in our group - which is not true. I do want to play together with him, just without all the temper tantrums. Further, I'm afraid John might think I am not allowing him to be upset at all. I don't mind him benuig upset once or twice, or saying ""Oh f***!"". But to me, there is a difference between being upset once for 2 seconds and a 90-minute rant about how the world treats you and only you unfairly.</p></li>
<li><p>I considered asking him to play really hard and frustrating games with low down-time, such as ""Hotline Miami"" or ""Super Meat Boy"". The idea behind this is that when failing over and over and over, he would have to learn how to deal with his frustration and hopefully be more relaxed when playing with us - similar to how people say the best way to cure a fear of flying by flying a lot.<br>
I don't know if this idea has any merit. He might just quit the games when getting too frustrated instead of building higher tolerance against frustration, or they might not have any effect at all on him.</p></li>

"Conversation with a person who is stressed out because of a facial tic","<p>Recently I ran into an acquintence in a coffee shop. Our usual routine is to crack a few light-toned jokes or share some stories (Usually that person is quite a conversationalist and we talk about 5-15 minutes.)</p>

<p>That day the person had a slight facial tic and it seemed to stress them out, and during our conversation it considerably intensified. Seeing that the person was uncomfortable, I cut our conversation a bit shorter than usual. </p>

<p>It seems that for some strange reason people think that a tic makes the situation awkward. I see no reason to treat it differently than a common cold - an inconvenient condition that will probably pass with rest, and if not, then perhaps with medical treatment if needed.</p>

<p>What I am interested is, what is the polite way to communicate in this case with people with whom are on friendly terms but not that close?  Acknowledge it and ask if everything is ok? Ignore it? Look somewhere else while talking? Say something like 'relax, comrade, everyone has bad days'?</p>

"How to ask a female colleague to spend time with me?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I met this colleague (let's call her Alice) at my new job that I started recently. We work in different teams, so I don't get to meet Alice every day, although I do see her in the corridor or the pantry during breaks. I usually smile at her and greet her. But, I never had the opportunity to have a conversation with her since she would be out with her colleagues or on the phone and I wouldn't want to intervene. </p>

<p>I have noticed that she tends to not talk very much with her male colleagues in the office unless spoken to, hangs out with her female colleagues most of the time. She is not comfortable acknowledging me when she is with other people, so I don't greet her when she is with people or when I am around people myself. </p>

<p>The timings of our break from office work are quite different, hence I am not able to talk to her consistently, I don't want to coincide my break timings with Alice's, as that is not something I am comfortable doing and would make my intentions blatantly obvious.</p>

<p>I am in India.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I am interested in asking her out eventually, but before I do that I would like to get to know her a little bit (find out if she is taken :) ) and warm her up to me.I may have to go to her work station to ask her, which brings me to my question.</p>

<p><strong>How can I ask Alice to spend time with me?</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT from Comments</strong>: Would like to point out that I want to keep this interaction between us completely casual, so she wouldn't think much of it.</p>

<p>I have had prior interactions with Alice  , but they were very short greetings with a ""How are you?"" , since we pass each other in the corridor . I just would like to invite her to have a longer conversation with me.</p>

<p>I would like to clarify that , I am not trying to ask her out after these short interactions previously mentioned , because I fully well know the outcome and  <strong>I am aware  its completely inappropriate .</strong> </p>

<p>What I am trying to get at , is how I can have longer interactions with Alice at work , where it is harder to approach people. Also , only if I feel that we share common interests , will I proceed to ask her out.</p>

"Resolving a conflict resulting from a disagreement of how a situation was handled","<p>Riley and I are close friends, and have decided to go to a movie together while inviting a common acquaintance, Taylor, who knows Riley but whom I don't know very well. The movie theater has assigned seating, and unfortunately we couldn't be seated together, so someone would have to sit by themselves on the other side of the theater. Upon entering the theater Riley suggested that we play rock-paper-scissors and the loser has to sit by themselves. This took me by surprise, as I assumed that since we are close we would sit together. However, I did not object to the suggestion, but ended up losing, and watched the movie by myself. </p>

<p>This upset me, and after the movie went to confront Riley about it. In my mind, Riley should have sat with the closer friend. In Riley's mind, it was a fair thing to do and doesn't understand why I am making a big deal about it. Now that both parties are upset about this, what can we do to resolve this conflict? Also, what can we do to avoid similar situations escalating in the future?</p>

"Asking people to step up in a volunteer organization","<p>Something I've noticed in just about every organization that I've been a part of is the old adage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In any organization 10% of the people do 90% of the work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems particularly true in volunteer organizations, where people aren't being paid, and things are considerably less organized. To some degree, this is to be expected when you're relying on volunteers, you can't really force anyone to do anything, so you end up with a passionate handful handling the less fun work and more or less running the show.</p>

<p>I say ""running the show"" very loosly. These people aren't really ""in charge"" they just happen to be the people who show up reliably and participate consistently. They end up making more decisions simply because they bothered to show up and make their voices heard more often.</p>

<p>This tends to cause obvious problems...</p>

<p>In a volunteer organization where everyone pretty much has an equal say, some people end up having more say than others simply by being present more. But of course newcomers and very occasional volunteers tend to see a core group making all the decisions among themselves. This creates conflict.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what if anything can be said or done to avoid that conflict or that perception?</p>

<p>My thinking tends to be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, speak up if you want to be heard. Show up to the meetings and participate. You can't really blame us for taking care of stuff without your input if you're not here, or giving input.</p>

<p>This tends to entrench negative feelings. And worse leaves us with a number of people wanting to play <a href=""http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Captain_Hindsight"" rel=""noreferrer"">Capt Hindsight...</a> Basically those that have nothing to contribute during the decision making process, but lots of criticism after a decision is made or an action taken.</p>

However, I've asked him <strong><em>casually</em></strong> (although I did specifically mention that I would pay him his going rate, no more, no less) before if he would be interested and he said ""No"" in a very casual way.</p>

<p>I understand that he has no obligation to do this work and that I should respect his decision not to do work for me, but this seems to be a win-win for the both of us and I'd really like to convince him of this.</p>

<p>I also understand that situations like this can lead to awkward interactions. Dealing with significant sums of money, having to put time aside between us to work ""professionally"", and the risk that I don't like the work he's done could be reasons behind him denying the casual request.</p>

<p>The main drivers that make me want to specifically work with him are:</p>

<li>His style is something I desire</li>
<li>He has done free/work as a student for me before which the work I am commissioning would be based off of</li>

  <p>The month of June was chosen for LGBT Pride Month to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which occurred at the end of June 1969. As a result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact LGBT people have had in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm planning on trying to take a couple of days off from work in order to attend a few Pride events. The main one being a parade that a friend will be marching in, in remembrance of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pulse nightclub shooting</a> where her partner's little sister was killed. I wasn't working where I currently work at the time, so my supervisor isn't aware of this.</p>

<p>Requesting time off where I work is always a little dicey. We run on a skeleton crew, so there usually isn't an extra set of hands to help when someone needs to take time off. To further complicate matters, I work in a county that doesn't offer explicit workplace discrimination protection for LGBT folks, and those protections wouldn't apply even if we had them because I work for a religious non-profit. I can technically be fired for being queer, although I think that's somewhat unlikely.</p>

<p>I'm ""out"" with a few close friends at work, but unfortunately my immediate supervisor isn't one of them. He's made some unkind/homophobic remarks in the past, so I've been hesitant to talk about my life outside of work with him. (One of those unfortunate things about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(sociology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">passing privilege</a> is that you get to hear what people really think.)</p>

<p>I've been considering just flatly coming out at work for months now, just because I'm tired of having to lie and avoid certain conversations. Namely conversations like ""what did you do on your day off?"" or ""what are your plans for the holidays?"" or ""why haven't you moved closer to work yet?"" But I'm also thinking that coming out in the context of asking for time off, probably isn't ideal. There are some differences between this and, say, asking for time off for an interview.</p>

<p>There are rules for extended leave, a week or more, but a single day or two is more discretion based. This would be unpaid leave, but they often try to force the use of paid time off in order to make sure it's all used by the end of the year.</p>

<p>I could of course put in a request for the days off without offering any reason at all, but requests like that tend to be denied. The supervisor always asks why I'm asking for time off in order to gauge how important it is...</p>

<p><strong>I guess I'd like to hear from other folks who've had to walk this line in their workplace. How have you managed to successfully navigate these situations? Is coming out the only way to do this without lying?</strong></p>

"How to answer on question about hobby which is not something I like?","<p>My girlfriend runs an Instagram fashion profile. She shares photos of her and her clothing sets. She asked recently:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you enjoy photographing me? What do you think about this?</p>

<p>And here's the  problem. What I think about fashion at all is that firstly I do not quite understand it (it's not that I don't pay attention to my look), secondly I think it is somehow not necessary (whole this thing about expressing your status with clothes, judging by apperances annoys me). I think clothing should be neat and apropriate to situation. I do not like to pose and when others do this, they seem somehow falsely to me. I do not like all this specifically fashion-blogs, they seem blank to me.</p>

<p>I do tolerate fashion as a hobby. I do want to support my girlfriend in her passion. Photographing her with her phone (which we usually do) is not something I really enjoy, but when she borrows better camera from her friend I do like to play with it (but rather in terms of device, catching lights etc.). I do this because she enjoys that. </p>

<p>What I answered last time was something like:</p>

  <p>Fashion is not for me, I do not quite understand it. When you give me a better camera I enjoy photographing you, but still fashion seems a little blank to me.</p>

"How can I recover from an accusation of racism at work?","<h3>The context</h3>

<p>In February last year I started a new job.  I started the same day and in the same position as another person we'll call Ed.  Our offices are across the hall from one another.  I'm a white woman, he's a black male.  We work in a large office that is Vietnamese owned.  It's a melting pot, but mostly Asian. I like a lot of the people there, and I love the nature of the work I do there.  </p>

<h3>The conflict</h3>

<p>I just learned that he has been telling people behind my back for the last year that I was a racist and made racist comments to him.  This is completely fabricated.  Our work areas don't overlap and I did stop having casual conversations with him 10 mos ago because he was always bringing up race issues, which I feel are inappropriate topics of discussion at work. This is one allegation, a year ago, he didn't bring it to management when it happened, it was a combination of his actions in the office and other people's comments that caused it to surface.  There have been no other incidents or claims against me from anyone else in the year I have been there. The HR Director that brought the situation to my attention would not disclose who was involved so I can't be 100% sure of who he made these claims to, but I feel like based on their actions, I have a pretty good sense of at least some of the people he's involved. </p>

<h3>What I've done so far</h3>

<p>With the coworkers I have relationships with, I have told them it's not true, and I could understand why they would be mad at me if they believed it was. They appreciated that, and I feel like those bridges are still there.  If I was in their shoes, I would distance myself as much as possible from this situation, and I believe that's why no one told me about this for a year and I don't fault them for that, even though some of them knew about it from the beginning.  </p>

<h3>My question</h3>

<p>How can I recover from this in my workplace?</p>

<p>I would like to stay where I'm at if possible, and would like the situation to be resolved but I feel uncomfortable bringing this up with anyone. I see a couple options, but I'm not sure which strategies might be most effective to resolve the situation, or how best to implement them. For example, would it be productive to address the matter with him directly?  Would it be helpful to say something to coworkers that I've never talked to and that I don't have a relationship, who may have only heard his side of the story?  (With some of these people it would literally be a first conversation.)  I don't want them to have the impression I'm trying to keep this going, I'd like to move past this as quickly as possible.</p>

"How to deal with someone who won't leave me alone?","<p>My partner works in a book store. Because of the way the company is set up, she mostly works alone (95% of the working day).</p>

<p>She has a regular ""customer"" (I use quotes because he never buys anything) who will come in and hang around trying to talk to her. She's been working in book stores for a long time and knows how to deal with people like this pretty effectively, but this guy just won't give up.</p>

<p>She's tried variously:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using short answers,</li>
<li>Telling him she's busy, or doesn't have time to talk,</li>
<li>Ignoring him and going about her work,</li>
</ul>

<p>among other tactics. But this guy just doesn't get the hint. He'll follow her around the store, continuing to talk, if she's serving an actual customer he'll even stand to the side, wait for her to finish, then carry on.
This usually goes on for over an hour, and regularly only stops after she's <em>closed the store</em>.</p>

<p>She's had plenty of creepers who are inappropriate or threatening who'll step over the line, and when that happens she's not afraid to be assertive to get it to stop (and it works), but this guy never pushes it that far, so it's never got to that stage. He's basically benign, but just won't get the message.</p>

<p>How can she get him to stop talking to her when all this has failed?</p>

<p><strong>Is there a firm (and polite, if possible) way to tell the customer to stop bothering her?</strong></p>

<p>Bare in mind this is a shop where she works alone. She can't shut the door, go out to the back room and wait (she'd have to be there for literally an hour), or deflect him onto another staff member.</p>

<p>While we can't rule out the possibility, there is no reason to treat this as if he is romantically interested, that is to say he hasn't made any advances.</p>

"How do you tell a Facebook friend that they might be on the autism spectrum?","<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>How do I tell this Facebook friend that they might be on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"" rel=""noreferrer"">autism spectrum</a> without being too intrusive?</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I have this Facebook friend that I care deeply about and with whom I interact often.</p>

<p>This person cares a lot and is very compassionate. They don't know it but all the links and messages they posted really helped me and changed me <em>a lot</em>. And, today, I believe I am a better person because of them.</p>

<p>It's also this person that helped me realize (thanks to the article about autism they posted) that I'm on the autism spectrum. And, I <em>strongly</em> believe that, at the time they were posting those links, they were wondering if they were on the spectrum themselves.</p>

<p>They never posted that they discovered that they were in the spectrum and, giving that they share a lot about really personal matter on Facebook, I believe they would have posted that.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Not knowing that you are on the autism spectrum is fine unless it makes you suffer. Two days ago, this person posted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I didn't understand what he was saying [..] I see that he thinks I'm stupid. Maybe I'm stupid. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's usual for people on the autism spectrum to not understand what a neurotypical person is saying because we (people on the autism spectrum) don't have the same way of thinking. It's like speaking in a foreign language where there are cultural differences involved. </p>

<p>I believe that, if my Facebook friend knew that they were on the spectrum, they wouldn't have thought they were stupid. It's easier to accept oneself when you know <em>why</em> you are so different. At least, it was easier for me.</p>

<p>That is the reason why I want to suggest to this person that they might be on the spectrum.</p>

<h1>What I have tried</h1>

<p>Nothing (yet).</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How do I suggest to this Facebook friend that they might be on the spectrum?</p>

<h1>Note and clarification</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>I never saw this person ""in real life"" and don't plan to but, based on what they have been posting for the last 5 years, I think there is a really good chance that they are on the autism spectrum.</p></li>
<li><p>Wondering if you are on the autism spectrum isn't the same thing as taking it seriously enough to ask for a professional diagnostic. And I know from experience that having someone apart for yourself who also believe you are on the spectrum can help take this possibility more seriously (it helped me, even if I still waited two years after that before asking for an actual diagnostic).</p></li>
<li><p>We don't have any mutual friend.</p></li>
<li><p>This friend have, in the past, posting things that show interest in knowing <em>why</em> they were the way they were and <em>why</em> they were soooo tired all the time (for people who don't know, tiredness can be an indication that someone is on the autism spectrum).</p></li>

"Handling the question ""what did you do for the weekend?""","<p>Another week, another Monday and another same old unpleasant question (at least for me) - What did you do for the weekend? </p>

<p>A couple years ago I moved to another country in western Europe from South-East of Europe. As you might be familiar, the culture is a bit different between these two regions, but that mostly depends of a person's adaptability and how strong he is holding to his values (religion and tradition).</p>

<p>So, from this point on, I would like to exclude those dimensions of differences between people, and focus on other dimensions (mentioned bellow).</p>

<p>Now, very often at work I've been asked by my colleagues <strong>""what did you do for the weekend""?!</strong> I find myself in very uncomfortable position answering this question because of several reasons.</p>

<p>First, for the sake of simplicity let's consider that I am some form of introvert, geek and hard-working person. This means that most of my weekends I am spending on learning and working on something
(sometimes related to work, sometimes very different from it).</p>

<p>Second, I am seeing this question as a way to express to others what they did, by replying to it and then asking back what they did.
I do understand that this is very basic way to create ongoing discussion, but I also know that I am often being judged by doing what I want and not ""enjoying life instead"" (by their definition).</p>

<p>On other hand, I feel very comfortable speaking about very wide range of topics like economics, technology or anything which is not really personal (seems logical for introvert, right?).
Another thing why not speaking about personal things matters to me, is because I found that mostly in my line of job, if I keep personal relationship out is the best for everyone.
Very often my ideas at work, threatened some positions around me, and they acted defensively on it. So, I have difficult time to keep the balance between sharing personal life, and competing with the colleagues at the same time.
To be also clear, I am not rude at all while I am working my job, but very often I am stating facts citing resources and addressing the real problems. I am also not a solo player, in fact very helpful to those who want me to help. And also I am aware of <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/18300/how-to-handle-office-chitchat/18346#18346"">this</a> question, but I didn't find the answers satisfying.</p>

"How do I tell students at a school I volunteer at to stop flirting with me?","<p>

<p>Occasionally, I head out to volunteer to teach robotics programming at an all-girls school in my area. For context, I'm male and age 20, and the students are adolescent females in 7th and 8th grade (13-15 year olds).</p>

<p>When I head out to teach, most of the students there treat me professionally, with a teacher-student relationship. I usually act ""fun"" with the students, as if I were another kid with similar interests. However, a few attempt to flirt with me, asking me about my relationship status or complimenting me on my appearance. (The flirting is completely verbal and not physical in any way.)</p>

<p>I understand where they're coming from; they're adolescent teenagers who don't normally see younger males (though the school does have male teachers and staff, but they're much older). For my part, I don't have any ""embellishments"" or any specific features that would render me ""attractive"" in my society, but one student has commented that I look ""younger"" than my age.</p>

<p>When one of these students starts to flirt with me, <strong>how can I make it clear that this isn't the right time or place to make such comments or questions and that they should be treating me professionally</strong>? The director of the program has told us to lie about our relationship status (i.e. to say ""I have a girlfriend"") in response to such comments, but I'd prefer not to lie to accomplish my purpose.</p>

<p>Additionally, the top answer there isn't really a way I wish to handle this situation. I can't ""stop flirting with my students"" because I am not. Also, I don't wish to say things like ""that's not relevant to this discussion"" because I'm a volunteer, not a teacher, and the attitude I wish to show to my students is that of a ""fun"" person who's also knowledgeable; saying direct things like ""that's too personal"" is too direct for my purpose. The other answer there completely contradicts this as well.</p>

"Best way to tell colleague that chat is not a channel for direct response?","<p>Me and colleague X communicate in English, but we're both non-native English speakers from very different countries. X's English is not very great and we sometimes have trouble understanding each other. My company uses Slack and Skype to send messages between coworkers and we all have a phone on our desk.</p>

<p>I have certain deliverables to give to Person X and there's a clear time frame I always stay in. Sometimes X has questions about my deliverables and he can ask them to me.</p>

<p>Using Slack or Skype is encouraged because with meetings, other deadlines etc we are not always able to immediately pick up the phone. However, X expects me to respond directly and will keep pinging me for several minutes. </p>

<p>Even though I have my <strong>status set to offline or busy</strong> because of a meeting, this is what the conversation will look like:</p>

<li>I need to ask a question to you.</li>

"How to gently and compassionately stop a stranger talking to you about their problems?","<p>I recently dropped my wallet while shopping, reached out among local lost-and-found groups on Facebook, made contact with someone who found it and made arrangements with them to meet up so they can give it back to me.  There was nothing of value in the wallet so there's no issue there, but I do want the wallet itself back.</p>

<p>The issue is, the person in question has apparently decided that I'm her new friend.  Now that she has my phone number, she's been sending me long texts and voicemails telling me way more about her life than I need to know.  I feel like our contact should have been as simple as 'Thank you for finding my wallet, where and when can we meet?'; 'X street at 2 o'clock?'; 'Perfect, see you then'.  I get the impression that she is someone with a lot of problems - abusive relationship, serious illness in the family, etc, and that she has been dying for someone to talk to.  But she has also mentioned that she's already seeing the proper authorities/supports about these things so it's not like I can give her a useful phone number either, I think she just needs a buddy.  </p>

<p>I'm not without compassion and certainly don't want to do any damage to someone who is clearly quite vulnerable, but I never volunteered to be this person for her and she's a total stranger to me.</p>

<p>On the phone I can be noncommital or express a quick note of sympathy but quickly change the subject back to making arrangements to hand over the wallet (which I have to do many times, she is very quick to bring the conversation back to her problems).  But we're due to meet in person tomorrow so how do I stop her talking my ear off, again without doing her any damage because she is clearly in a bad place, but also without volunteering to be her new support system?</p>

<p>For cultural context, Ireland is a place where kindness towards strangers is highly valued, where cutting someone off when they're talking is considered very rude (and similarly you're expected to notice when the person you're talking to is politely trying to get away, which this person does not), and using phrases like 'sorry you have this problem but it is your problem' may well get you stoned in the street!!</p>

"How to respond to rejected sympathy?","<p>I am in a growing friendship. I hope we call it a strong friendship soon. It's mostly based on a common goal, but also a commitment of support. This is not in a professional context at all, this is a personal friend. There is no romantic or financial involvement either.</p>

<p>My friend has unveiled to me the truth behind a mystery I've always wondered about, and it is a bit of a tragedy in their past. The truth was simultaneously shocking in how awful it was, but unsurprising as it very much fit into place with everything else I know about them.</p>

<p>After my friend finished explaining, I feel like the openness bodes well to our commitment, but the facts were still very grim. I expressed my sincere sympathy for the tragedy by saying ""I'm so sorry""</p>

<p>They are one of the strongest people I know though. Perhaps their reaction shouldn't have surprised me. My friend's reaction was bordering on offense, and they expressed that they don't want my pity.</p>

<p>Now certainly I meant nothing negative with my expression of sympathy. It was not to look down on them, or frame them as hopeless. It was just sincere sympathy for the very sad thing that had happened. At best, I can shrug this off, pretend the interaction didn't mean much... and that's what I did, for now. But at worst, I feel like (1) they don't care if I care, (2) they are not interested in even the lightest possible support (even though that is the basis of our friendship), or (3) I find my own self bordering on irritation in response to their irritation. The irritated part of me asks ""Why would someone reject sincere sympathy like that?"" </p>

<p>If it was immediately after I asked and they supplied the information, I don't think there's an issue, but I often out of my room without my phone, so <strong>there's always substantial gap</strong> between when they answered and when I have the time to reply with ""thanks"".</p>

"How to endure a holiday with a friend I've drifted apart from?","<p>I’ve been friends with someone for a long while. We've taken a few trips together over the years.</p>

<p>I feel like we've drifted apart, although I may be the only one that feels this as I actually think they've ceased caring about much at all to do with me. Their attitude towards me is such that it reminds me of a yo-yo... one day they'll be the person I have grown accustomed to and can talk to for hours and comfortably spend time with, and the next they'll be someone who ignores my messages, stares at their phone during meals together and makes no attempt to socialise with me past the bare minimum. Even our conversations over instant messaging have drastically diminished. Furthermore, whilst some shared interests remain, others have steadily drifted apart, even down to something as inconsequential as music tastes. I will often try to indulge them in new interests, but the same courtesy isn't quite afforded to me so I prefer not to discuss my interests with them after one or two times, as a general rule of thumb.</p>

<p>Essentially, whilst I dedicate considerable time thinking about this friendship (truthfully my only close relationship, and theirs too, as far as I know), somewhat resentful that we don't socialise like we used to, and wondering about their well-being (is it personal struggles of some kind - i.e. depression? - that has so dramatically changed their personality or regard towards me?)... they don't seem to share the concern or make any move to act in any way that would redeem recent behaviour.</p>

<p>In short, I think it's time to move on, as I'm investing more in this friendship than they are and it's, I think, emotionally damaging to me. There are many many examples of situations and circumstances I could describe but the overall gist is that I feel taken for granted and underappreciated. I'm wasting my time trying to connect with someone who doesn't seem interested, but somehow, in certain capacities (like travelling together for a month to a foreign destination and leaving me to plan the trip that they suggested in its entirety!) they still expect some level of loyalty and consideration from me.</p>

<p>Cancelling the trip is not an option and I still very much want to go but I'm afraid of what attitude I might face during the trip. In our last trip together (a short holiday interstate), I felt that within a very short time, their attitude was that of someone who would rather be anywhere else. Petulant and reluctant, often expressing that they'd rather go back to the hotel than explore a new activity. It wasn't a pleasant experience and I'm somewhat fearful that the same might happen on this considerably larger trip.</p>

<p>How would I deal with this? If we find each other disagreeing on the day's activities, or if I want to do something but am getting the ""vibe"" from them that they would rather not - I don't want that to spoil my enjoyment or make me miss out on experiences that I could have, only because they have fallen into a sullen mood where they spend most of the time looking at their phone looking bored and disinterested in my company, let alone any scenery surrounding us. I'm unsure how to deal with this without causing hostility between us, which would be quite unfortunate when in a foreign country with nothing but ourselves for company!</p>

<p>I'm socially anxious as well, I've had situations in a previous recent small trip where they would refuse to do something as simple as take a photo at a landmark, either with me or even of me, and I lacked the confidence to feel comfortable using my selfie stick or to ask another person. These were isolated incidents, often in heavily crowded attractions (they're not a fan of crowds) but seeing as I never know what attitude to expect from them nowadays... that's a very likely scenario to happen. 
Personally, I have resigned myself to knowing that I have to build up the courage to get the outcomes I desire in these situations, but I don't want to do it in a way in which my frustration or unhappiness will be apparent to them, so as to not create animosity. </p>

<p>Basically I feel like I’m between a rock and a hard place. I want to enjoy my trip but am going to be travelling with someone I don't feel I can necessarily rely on or draw any enjoyment from - in fact, there's the possibility they could taint certain aspects of it. How do I navigate this diplomatically so as to step on no toes, or the least amount of toes? I want to look forward to this trip but the uncertainty of our relationship is causing me anxiety instead. </p>

<p><strong>Suggested TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>How would I negotiate the situation when my long-term friend is acting sullen and uninterested in our activities or is exhibiting an attitude that is sullying the mood? I don't want to miss out on opportunities or experiences but also don't want to antagonise them or create an even more uncomfortable situation...</p>

"How to decline giving personal information until you recieved some in return","<p>I need to move and find a new home to rent. The city I live in is having a housing crisis (as declared by the mayor). I think many landlords take advantage of this. I know that they’re just trying to protect themselves from being ripped off but a lot of landlords are overly pessimistic and skeptical.</p>

<p>A lot of the advertisements I see require a self-biography, contact information, references and more in the initial email. I don’t feel comfortable giving all this out to a stranger before I even have their phone number, let alone viewed the home.</p>

<p>One time I got a call from a private number saying that I had applied to his rental the other day. He asked a lot of rather invasive questions, like wanting to know the address of where I worked and where I was from. I don’t really feel comfortable telling this to someone I don’t know. How can I communicate this without damaging my chances too badly of getting the home? I find housing ads through sites like Craig's List or kiji, so the initial point of contact is an email. I started including that, I get a lot of spam phone calls (which is true now that I’ve been giving out my phone number so regularly) and ask that the person first replies with a text so I know who it is and can answer the call.</p>

<p>Just today I went to view a home and the first thing the landlord does is asks to see my ID. She then quickly takes out her phone and takes a picture of it. This is actually illegal, where I live landlords can inspect ID but not make copies of it. It’s very common where I live that laws like this be ignored, but usually landlords make copies of ID just before the lease is signed, having her do this on the first viewing really upset me. In this particular case what can/should I have said? I’m still thinking of sending her a message along the lines of ""thanks for showing me the place. Just so you know it’s not actually legal for landlords to copy tenants ID, and I found it really premature for you to do this before I even saw the place"". </p>

<p>In the general case, what can I say to show I would like this to be a bi-partisan process?  I hate it when I reply to an add to only be given ""please a give self-bio, your employers phone number, if you’re single etc."" I can see things like a self-bio but giving references to a stranger over the internet isn’t something I’m comfortable with. </p>

<p>I’m looking for a script I can use in such situations. How does this sound?
""I realize you asked for more information, like references. Do you think I could see the place or get your phone number first? I realize you want to make sure you’re renting your property out to reliable people, I just don’t feel comfortable giving out this information over the internet to someone I never met"". </p>

<p>Just to make clear, things I've been asked before I even get the other person's name are</p>

<ul>
<li>self biography</li>
<li>what I do for work</li>
<li>address of where I work</li>
<li>how long I worked there</li>
<li>where I currently lived and how long I lived there</li>
<li>references</li>
<li>ID such as driver's license</li>
<li>sleep schedule</li>
<li>eating habits</li>
<li>how much time I spend at home</li>
<li>sexual orientation</li>
<li>where I'm from</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these are reasonable, even when requested in initial email. Some of them, not so much.Quite a few are simply illegal, for example discriminating against someone based on their gender.  </p>

"If I want a child to stop a behavior, should I talk directly to the child or to the parents?","<p>Consider a case where a young child is doing something that directly impacts me, and most everyone would consider it reasonable to want them to stop. Here are a few real examples of things they've done in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pawing through my purse</li>
<li>Repeatedly and loudly talking in a theatre</li>
<li>Kicking the back of my seat</li>
<li>Pushing me out of the way to look through a window or use an arcade game</li>
</ul>

<p>I get that young children do not fully understand boundaries and being polite. I have no desire to teach them a lesson, make a scene, scold them, or anything like that. I simply want them to stop the behavior that is directly affecting me in a negative way with as little effort and drama as possible. </p>

<p>Sometimes the parent notices the behavior and immediately fixes the problem for me, which is perfect, but often that doesn't happen. In that case, my current approach is the same as it would be with an adult: I politely ask them to stop doing whatever it is they are doing. In the case of something  blatantly rude, I might be a bit more forceful (""hey, quit going through my purse!""), but it's not ever filled with fury or malice or anything like that. </p>

<p>I feel like this is reasonable, but it often prompts parents or even bystanders to object to me speaking directly to the kid, because ""it's the parent's job to parent."" I don't understand this sentiment at all; I'm enforcing my own (entirely reasonable) boundaries against a stranger, not ""parenting"", but it seems to be a common sentiment. I'm not sure if this is caused by the way I'm addressing the kid or if it's the very act of speaking to a child I'm not the guardian of. </p>

<p>I have occasionally tried talking directly to parents instead, but generally they tell the kid to stop, which they do for a minute, then start right back up again without any further intervention from the parent. At that point, I feel uncomfortable asking them repeatedly to do something about it or talking directly to the kid, so I'm stuck dealing with it. </p>

<p>So talking to the kid is generally effective, but sometimes causes a scene, which I'd like to avoid. Talking to the parent usually doesn't cause a scene (though they sometimes get huffy about it), but it is often ineffective. </p>

<p>What's the best method to get a youngish child (under 8) to quit doing something to me with a minimum of fuss? Alternatively, what's a response that will quickly shut down the ""don't parent someone else's kid"" complaint? </p>

<p>Note: I meant this to only include children who are complete strangers to me, but including the case where you know the family is okay too.</p>

"How can I better moderate my speaking volume in conference calls?","<p>My natural speaking volume is on the louder end of the spectrum.  In in-person conversations visual cues, even just seeing the other people, help me to regulate it, though I can still mess up when I'm not paying enough attention.  (Lifelong struggle here.)  And on a phone call with one other person I can match my volume to what I hear, and use the volume control on the speaker to set that at a good volume.  My problem is with group conference calls.</p>

<p>I was just in a call with two other people where one was much quieter than the other (a not-uncommon problem).  My speakers only have one volume setting, so for to hear the one at all the other was loud.  I didn't realize until afterwards, but I was matching the loud person's volume, which meant I was bothering a coworker who sits near the conference room.  Because the other people didn't have video, I couldn't make use of visual cues and the quiet person never said ""hey, could you tone it down?"" to either of us.</p>

<p>What techniques can I use to keep my own speaking volume at a reasonable level regardless of the variations in volumes among other speakers on a call?  I'd like to prevent the problem, not apologize to coworkers for it later.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>My whole life, people have put me on a ""genius"" pedestal, and while it was a fun ego-booster when I was a kid, today it's more of a curse than a blessing. I don't see myself as a genius, but others do. The problem with that, as you might imagine, is that they'll assume I have solutions and answers to a lot of their problems, even if I'm completely ignorant/indifferent to the subject. What makes matters worse is that often it's about something related to some subject I'm known to understand well. So when I try to address that I don't know about the matter, people sometimes become infuriated/frustrated as though I ""don't want to help"" or am doing it ""grudgingly"". What they don't seem to understand is that <strong>I do want to help, I just don't know how</strong>. I try to help when I know, and when I don't, but it's within my reach, I do look up how to help, but they see it as me ""not wanting to share the knowledge that I have"". This usually happens in my family, but sometimes friends also have high expectations from me. Most of the time, the same people make such accusations multiple times, in spite of me telling them about my lack of knowledge for the Nth time.</p>

<p>One example where this happens: I'm a full-time programmer, and also work on all sorts of computer-related projects in my spare time. However, I don't know a thing about hardware stats/brands, or how to do stuff on Facebook (I don't have a Facebook profile). Yet, people often respond with ""how come you can do X, Y and Z on a computer but not know how to pick a piece of hardware?"" or ""you know how to X but you don't know how to Y on Facebook? At least admit you don't want to help!"". Keep in mind that it's not that I don't <em>want</em> to help them - be it a tech-related issue or otherwise. It's just that I <em>cannot</em> help them because I'm not informed enough on the subject. People asking me for help don't bother me - when I do know, I help however I can.</p>

<p>Another example (since the IT example got more attention than I actually intended): someone asks me about some math-related problem, or about a word, expression or sentence in English I've never seen before. If at any point I state that I don't know how to solve it or what it means, I'm met with accusations such as ""of course you know, you studied English for N years"" or ""you're super smart, of course you can solve this simple problem"". The fact that I might know something relatively more complex makes it even hard to defend my case, because if I can solve this complex equation, then surely I can calculate this simple interest formula. <strong>I do look up solutions</strong>, but even still it's frowned upon, as if I were ""pretending not to know"" and ""excusing myself by grudgingly searching it"". The mentality is flawed on many levels and I fail to comprehend how one comes up with such notions, but that is already beyond the scope of this question.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p><strong>How can I respond or act when accused of knowing something I don't, when admitting ignorance is not enough?</strong> Ideally, I'd like to be able to assert to people that I am in fact ignorant on some subjects. If that proves to be too difficult, then minimizing conflicts against people's expectations would be my desired outcome.</p>

<hr>

<h1>What I have tried</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stating I don't know about the subject because I never looked into it:</strong> doesn't work most of the time, will just get dismissed as me being ""unwilling to help"";</li>
<li><strong>Stating that, while I don't know about it, I can look into it/see what I can do:</strong> often will just result in an angry ""if you're going to grudgingly do it then don't even bother"", which I don't know how to respond with, since I'm clearly showing willingness to help regardless of my knowledge of the subject;</li>
<li><strong>Pretending I know about the subject:</strong> doesn't work, backfires easily, and I don't like lying;</li>
<li><strong>Arguing with the person, trying to convince them I don't know everything:</strong> doesn't work with some people, apparently I'm too smart not to know everything there is to know in this entire universe or something;</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring the person accusing you of withholding knowledge:</strong> works most of the time, but is just as stressful as arguing.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of people understand I might not know something, but still, some individuals (a couple of them easily come to mind) still cannot fathom how I might be ignorant about something I ""obviously"" should know about. I tried sarcasm, long and in-depth explanations, rudeness, or just outright playing deaf, but the problem keeps reoccurring.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> There seems to be an ongoing theme in comments and answers advising me on how to avoid helping people, or how to have people help themselves, or how to ignore them. These would make (or have made) great questions, but it's not related to my issue: addressing people about a misconception they have about me, in that ""if I know A then I must know B"" when, in many cases, that is not true at all.</p>

"How to switch conversation from language to language in peers?","<p>I have a mixed group of friends from different countries (JP, CH, US.) I found it difficult to keep the conversation when inviting them to my house (I live in the U.S.) Certain people do not like me to speak English with them and they will not respond. Other people do not like me to speak my native language for obvious reason. I try to hang out with them in different sessions but can't avoid some occasions. </p>

<p>What is the proper way to handle this situation if you are an English speaker and non-English speaker? How to switch multiple languages in one conversation casually?</p>

"How do I treat my friends to something without it being awkward?","<p>There are some things I love doing with my friends that I know they cannot afford to do on a regular basis. In particular, I love going out for a big sushi dinner every once in a while. This type of meal is often cost prohibitive for my ""big eater"" friends as a single roll/order of sushi can often be $10 for something that isn't particularly filling.</p>

<p>So, being the friend I am who also loves to spend time and eat with my friends, I often offer to treat my friends to the meal. However, this usually creates a bit of friction between me and a few of my friends who are averse to being treated. Responses are usually things like ""Oh you don't have to"" followed by them not wanting to go, them begrudgingly agreeing, or thinking they'll ""owe me one"". From one friend in particular, I feel as if he thinks this is a way of me asserting a form of financial dominance over my friends which is far from the truth.</p>

<p>For reference, during the dinner, there is zero tension from what I can tell and most people feel a lot more free to order what they want and try new things; it seems to be a genuinely fun experience for everyone once the whole cost aspect is gone.</p>

<p>Also, I usually (attempt to) treat my friends to something like this once every two months or so. Between these dinners, we often get together to do inexpensive things that everyone can afford to do frequently, so it's not like this is the only thing we do together.</p>

<p>Sometimes I've phrased this event as a celebration when I can (""Let's go out and celebrate your new job, Chadsworth! Sushi's on me!"") and it's worked fine. However, it'd be pretty obvious if I always found an excuse to make it a celebration.</p>

<p>When I offer my friends this, I do this in a rather casual, no pressure way. I simply send them a group message (not as part of an existing group chat, a new one) saying something along the lines of ""Hey guys, want to grab sushi on Friday? My treat."" I don't pressure them to go or badger them about not wanting to go. Their sometimes negative reactions are either immediately upon receiving the request or based on something else someone said.</p>

<p>Also, for reference, although I'm usually the only one in my friend group who typically offers to treat people to anything, that doesn't mean the dynamic of me within my friend group is that of the giver (me) and the takers (my friends). My friends do their own nice things fairly often that I cannot do such as hosting events at their home (which I cannot do) or offering to give rides to people (such as myself) frequently. This is one way that I do like to give back to my friends and I'd like them to interpret this in the same way that they'd interpret getting a ride or having someone host at their house, because that's exactly how I see it.</p>

<p>How can I treat my friends to this somewhat expensive (~$200-300 among 3-5 people) dinner and avoid/mitigate awkward interactions?</p>

<p>I'm mostly looking for good ways to pose the event to people and ways to mitigate potential misunderstandings/misgivings over the offer.</p>

"How can I tell someone I don't like the way they speak?","<p>I can't stand ""cutesy voice"". That is, people who put on a high pitched squeal when they talk, who choose to say things like ""wuv"" over ""love"" or say things that are dark in a cute way. It's made worse if these people act as though <em>they always speak this way</em> when they don't, or they affect the mannerisms of an anime or something. Generally I just tolerate it because I choose not to be in the company of someone who's willing to infantalize themselves just because, but I always think of those people as dumb, even if they aren't. I am a generally easy-going, relaxed person. I do not get physical often, and I communicate my feelings when I feel comfortable doing so. (For context, I grew up in a place where physical violence is a common although looked down upon occurrence. I'm also a small female, and I am stressing that I didn't want to get physical because I'm accustomed to things like this becoming quite physical for no reason.)</p>

<p>The other day I was out with a friend of mine who is an artist, helping set up/sell her items. She was set up next to a woman who wasn't selling as much. This woman was talking, constantly, in ""cutesy voice"". And I know that this is not ""just the way she speaks"" because she didn't always speak that way, she just lapsed in and out of it. She put on the voice with customers, or when she was asking for unreasonable favors and almost always followed up with a high pitched laugh that was also being faked. Sometimes she would have a full on conversation in her normal voice and then go ""Oops! Teeheehee! I'm so silly-willy!"" and switch to cutesy voice. It didn't seem like she was doing it because she was being forced to, and it did seem like she had to remind herself to do it.</p>

<p>I asked her at the time if she could stop doing it. I don't remember the exact phrasing, but it was along the lines of, ""Do you mind not talking to me like that, please?"" She responded by agreeing to stop, and then she would maybe go one line without the voice. Then she would go, ""Oops!"" And go back to cutesy voice. I also ignored her, but the set up of the event means that artists get called away a lot. We do have to talk to each other (""can you watch my table,"" ""can you get lunch for me"" ""I'm going to the bathroom"" etc.""). My friend is called away fairly often because she does a lot of work with the organizers. So often, I'm at the table alone. I like working at this event, so I want to resolve this without leaving the event completely.</p>

<p>I'm not bothered by her talking to her customers this way but she will often ""forget"" I asked her to not use cutsey voice to me after talking with a customer. I sort of can forgive that, except that yesterday she barely sold anything. She would still go back to cutesy voice even though there was no reason to ""reset"" back to it.</p>

<p>I just dealt with it by ignoring her or only answering questions that weren't in cutesy voice, but at the end of the day I had a physical hatred towards this woman.</p>

<p>My hatred of cutesy voice <em>does not mean</em> that I don't want people to use it. I mean I don't, obviously, but they don't <em>have</em> to care about my opinion. However I would like to not reach a point where I hate someone because they use that voice, I feel like that's a bit unfair. I do want to somehow tell them to cut it out when they're talking to me. It's awkward and patronizing and traps me in a conversation I don't want to have. I'm not sure if I can politely say to someone like this to not address me that way without being rude. I have no idea how to breach this topic with people who talk to me like that.</p>

<p>There is a <em>very</em> high chance that my friend will need help and I have to talk to this particular woman again and I just want to be able to tell her to stop doing it so that I don't spend the rest of my day hating someone who isn't doing anything but getting on my nerves and tapping into my pet peeve. <strong>How can I tell someone not to talk to me using a voice they're putting on that annoys me?</strong></p>

<p>I accidentally edited this out but: when my friend was at the table and was talking with this woman, I often had to walk away. Also, there were times when she made unreasonable requests, like that we buy her lunch or that we just leave the table-- she would always request this in cutesy voice.</p>

"How can my cousin restore harmony between his Indian mother and American mother-in-law?","<p><sub>Someone asked me in a comment, what is my role in all this? Good question. I am not at all close with Aunt but I am close with my cousin (son of Aunt) and he needs help to keep his mother and mother-in-law peaceable. Unfortunately, he is a member at Stack Overflow under his real name and he feels vaguely disloyal to his mother to ask this question here himself. Call it Indian Sentiment, but it's all right because I have sent him the link and he will read all your advice himself, to help him act as an effective mediator and quickly resolve this interpersonal conflict!</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>My aunt has gone to the USA to visit her son who emigrated in 2007 and has recently married an American girl (not of Asian origin) whose family belongs to California. My cousin and his wife live in LA and her parents live nearby in the same city.</p>

<p>Aunt entered straightaway into a misunderstanding with her daughter-in-law's mother, and this rather famous type of Indian traditional rivalry was precipitated by an incident involving a cat whose name is not Kitty.</p>

<p>My cousin had got married in India in 2015 and the bride's parents did not bring their cat. So my aunt was aware of it but had not yet met this pet. She has no experience of cats and nor do I -- most cats in India are feral and very independent beasts and Aunt's sole previous pet was a little dog named Roger (name changed to Tinky after a famous sportsperson of the original name rose to justified greatness in the mid-2000s; Tinky is now 15 and lives with Aunt's daughter in Bangalore.) </p>

<p>Incident: When Aunt visited her in-laws in LA she pounced upon their cat and gathered it up into her arms saying O Kitty Kitty -- the cat apparently spat in her face (which may be an exaggeration that Aunt isn't incapable of) and scratched her nicely. Do cats resent being called 'Kitty'?</p>

<p>Now Aunt and her daughter-in-law's mother are embarked upon the Second Cold War. Aunt blames them for 'snaring her son' for whom she had been lining up prospective brides in India; and the son's mother-in-law (who might as well be called Alice) considers my aunt a reckless and stupid person who doesn't even know how to approach a pet. She has no negative attitude to my cousin's marriage but finds his mother a handful. Her husband Tom does nothing but play golf. Aunt blames Alice for her getting scratched:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indians consider a guest as next to gods but this person allowed her cat to scratch me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The scratch is deep and I have seen its picture on whatsapp. It is healing well enough. The cat has ignored my aunt after this incident.</p>

<p>(Related question: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3429/should-i-always-ask-a-dog-owner-before-i-pet-their-dog"">Should I always ask a dog owner before I pet their dog?</a>)</p>

<p>@Kat has asked in comments: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do Aunt and Alice need to interact at all? Is there some reason they can't just avoid each other? – Kat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason is that Alice and her daughter (my cousin's wife, code name Jane) live close to each other and Alice &amp; Jane keep dropping in at each other's houses, <em>which is a good thing</em>, except it brings about frequent meetings between Aunt and Alice. Moreover Indians tend to see their son's mother-in-law as a significant relation and there's apparently much covert criticism of Alice by Aunt (and some comments in the opposite direction) that puts my cousin on high alert. </p>

<p>Jane is luckily the calmest person and ignores all the nonsense. But my cousin is tearing his hair out because he has to get through 5 months before Aunt's visa expires, and Uncle her husband is so abstract as to be useless in this inter-cultural crisis. He has been busy visiting his own Indian friends now living in the USA while Alice and my aunt trade veiled insults and embroil my cousin and his wife in serial controversies. </p>

<p>I don't know or blame Alice in any way but my aunt can be a quite unreasonable person. I think she is upset to have zero 'Indian style authority' over her American daughter-in-law nor any customary Indian superiority often enjoyed by being the groom's parent. I am sorry to say that my aunt is showing no initiative to resolve the misunderstanding.</p>

<p>So I need help again from the Interpersonal experts: how to help my cousin resolve his mother's problem with Alice and bring Aunt into harmony with her in-laws?</p>

"Is it appropriate for me to give relationship advice to my friend's girlfriend?","<p>I have a friend, let's call him ""Bill"". He has been one of my closest friends for many years. He has been dating this girl, let's call her ""Natalie"" for almost a year now. Natalie is also a very close friend to me, due to the fact that A) I knew her long before they were dating, B) she's very close friends with <em>my</em> girlfriend, and C) I spend a lot of time with the two of them.</p>

<p>But now I'm in a little bit of a weird situation. Natalie will frequently complain about Bill <em>publicly</em> to other people, even in front of him. From really small minor things, <em>""His new facial hair is horrible. I can't wait for him to shave""</em>, to larger things, like <em>""The way our relationship started was really awkward because he was too dumb to just ask me out""</em>. At first, this was just minorly annoying, but it's starting to concern me a little bit because it's becoming a more common occurrence. To be clear, Bill has never complained about this to me, so I don't know what his feelings on it are. But I imagine that if I was in his shoes, I would feel very embarrassed and hurt. I'd expect my significant other to have my side, rather than publicly mocking me. </p>

<p>I'd like to mention this to Natalie, and actually, recently <em>my</em> girlfriend has been asking for me advice because she wants to bring it up as well. But the thought of talking with her makes me (and my gf) extremely uncomfortable. </p>

<p>She might feel hurt or resent us for correcting her. Not that she's a petty person, but because I'd imagine being chastised by your close friends would be rather difficult to take. Or maybe she'd feel like she's done a bad job of respecting Bill, or that she's ""a bad girlfriend"", I don't know.</p>

<p>But the bigger reason I'm uncomfortable mentioning this to her is because I'm not sure if I'd be overstepping my bounds. I don't want to come across like I have it all figured out, and I'm going to step in and dish out the perfect advice to fix everything. Or that how they do their relationship is my business, or my problem to worry about. But they're both very close to me, and I want them to be happy.</p>

<p>This leads to my question:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Would it be out of line for me (or my gf) to bring up this issue with her? Is it really any of our business? And if it is something you'd recommend talking with her about,</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most tactful way for one of us to approach her? I really want to be careful to display an attitude of ""I want to help you, and I think this would be beneficial for you in the long run"" rather than ""You're screwing up and you need to get your crap together"". And how could I bring it up without potentially hurting Natalie's feelings?</p></li>

"How do I determine if a girl I am seeing is open to a relationship?","<p>About 1.5 months ago I got to know a girl that lives 5 minutes away from me.</p>

<p>We wrote for 1-2 days, then met. The first two times just talking with each other and then, at a concert, making out.</p>

<p>Long story short. We have been kinda ""dating"" now for the past 1.5 months. Sometimes going out together with friends. And mostly me going to her place in the evening to spend the night together. (If relevant we already did everything from making out to sleeping with each other a couple of times).</p>

<p>She can sometimes be a little hot headed, but I really like her and I believe vice versa. The thing is that she seems very locked at telling emotions or saying things like ""I love you"" (like in the non-relationship style ""hab dich lieb"" in German. The not so serious version) and very rarely says that she really likes me, although when I am with her she is a cuddle beast, so to say. Let's say, she <strong>shows</strong> the affection that she seems unwilling to spell.</p>

<p>Now what really bothers me a bit is that I have no clue how this will continue as we are in the same position as we were a month ago. Not in a relationship, but openly ""being together"" if that makes sense? So we show that we are ""with each other"" in public with friends, family (my brother, cousin who live in the same town) and she is talking about me and us openly with her parents as well. That confuses me a bit. </p>

<p>She has also hinted that she does not want a relationship, but because she is a person that cannot express emotions that well, I don't know if that is really meant seriously or not. (She said that when we had a small fight, nothing dramatic.)</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>How could I determine if she was ready and/or open to a relationship through talking to her using IPS, <strong>but not</strong> asking directly as I believe that she would deflect the question. <strong>And</strong> has someone been in a situation like this and how did you resolve it? I don't believe that I am just a ""friend-with-benefits"" because we spent countless nights just cuddling and watching films and most importantly talking. (I believe that leans more towards a relationship than ""friends-with-benefits"".)</p>

"How to handle being at the same events as my partner's ex-lover?","<p>10 months ago I was out of the country for a period of three months for work reasons.

My partner has not told any of these friends/colleagues, even those who he is closer to, about his affair. My partner's ex-lover knows that I know about the affair.</p>

I have previously enjoyed these events and know his group of friends/colleagues well, but since my partner's affair I feel very anxious that I will be unable to deal with the presence of my partner's ex-lover. This is not just due to my generally feeling uncomfortable around this person, but also because I am not sure how to act naturally in front of the group of my partner's friends/colleagues in this context. </p>

<p>Later, we were doing ""<strong>être</strong>"" perfect tense verbs (Mrs Vandertramp<sup><a href=""https://frenchcrazy.com/2012/06/dr-mrs-vandertramp.html/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></sup>) and she excluded (rester).

"How can I politely tell a family who invited me for dinner that I'm still hungry?","<p>This is about a friend's family and what would often happen during dinners
(mom in her 50's, dad in his 60's).</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>One time, the mom had cooked 1 packet of ravioli for 5 people, and she urged me to get the right amount (we all had to count how many pieces we got).</li>
<li>Some other time, she had made some kind of soup and asked me to leave some for later in the original container after serving myself (last). There were exactly two tablespoons left but she insisted on having leftovers! </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Comment while serving myself or right as I was about to put a bite of food in my mouth</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don't have to finish it all/eat it all up if you don't want to </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(and other variations)</p>

<p><strong>Holidays</strong></p>

<p>The family was even ""tighter"" about offering seconds of dessert (usually pies) or sending with me and my friend some for later though they would send leftover turkey.  </p>

<p><strong>At restaurants, while deciding what to order (<em>they were paying</em>)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can share a meal...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you like to split [name of dish] with me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To clarify</strong></p>

<p>I'm not overweight (I was actually quite thin back then), so I don't think they were trying to hint I needed to lose weight. Except for my friend who was overweight at the time, the rest of the family was normal weight. The mom did worry a little about gaining weight but she didn't need to. </p>

<p>Money wasn't an issue (upper-middle class family). There was plenty of food in the fridges and freezers just they were reluctant to use it or use it all up (?). </p>

<p>During my stay, I never felt comfortable enough to use their kitchen to make food other than sandwiches but I would always help with the dishes and cleaning. </p>

<p>When I told my friend about this, the response was,  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That's how my parents are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My mom is just weird</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and so on. </p>

<p><strong>Long story short, the majority of times I would be invited for dinner (and during my stay), I'd be feeling hungry, unsatisfied and I'd end up ordering takeout a bit later.</strong></p>

<p>It felt really awkward to say that I was not full, I needed to eat more etc.,  so instead I mentally prepared myself that I was just not going to enjoy eating during dinner. So when my patience was exhausted, I decided to eat at home prior to visiting so I didn't feel as hungry while waiting to eat. </p>

<p>More often than not, having dinner with my friend's parents felt like a chore and was draining when it should have been fun. </p>

<p>I'm actually used to having the opposite problem (politely rejecting more food) with certain relatives at dinners or holidays (Mediterranean background).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How could I have politely told the mom that I'd like to have been able to eat as much as I wanted to OR that I was still hungry because I didn't have enough food OR that I couldn't enjoy food if I had to worry so much about portions, without coming off as unappreciative?</p>

"How can I talk to my Partner about what she would rather do?","<p>I feel like I can't correctly ascertain what my significant other would rather do. We have had a rocky relationship as she is rather introverted, while I'm more needy, and while we talked and determined to pursue a more healthy relationship with both of us trying our best to help the other party, I have recently come to this issue.</p>

<p>When talking about meeting with my significant other, sometimes she will not be open about her feelings on meeting up or not, and when later confronted she will cite a fear of making me feel bad as a reason to not doing so; so she accepts reluctantly when it would not be the most convenient to her to do so, but later won't stop talking about how inconvenient it is for her, both previous to the appointment, and during it.</p>

<p>It makes me feel guilty, as I do not wish to inconvenience her, but when I offer to postpone the appointment or give up on it, she will reject and tell me to carry on with it, but won't modify her behaviour. I get very confused since I am getting mixed signals and I don't know how I should act.</p>

<p>I have tried to make it clear that, while I feel it's a pity we can't meet, it doesn't make me feel bad, and I understand and respect her boundaries, but judging by her attitude, I find it clear she won't believe me on this and I don't understand why.</p>

<p>If it helps provide context, I have Asperger's syndrome.</p>

<p>She will consistently tell me that I always get sad when she tells me she doesn't want to meet up, and while it's true I did in the past, I've been changing that issue, but after telling her I don't do that anymore, she cites times when I express discontent over not being able to meet up (""Oh, well, that's a shame :'("") as a reason to tell me how I'm feeling, and when I tell her I was merely expressing shame over not being able to meet up, I'm in no way feeling bad.</p>

<p>For further clarification, this was a conversation we actually had last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ME: This week I'll only be able to meet on Tuesday, because of so, so and so. </p>
  
  <p>HER: Oh, I actually had an appointment that day... </p>
  
  <p>ME: Oh, well, that's a shame. </p>
  
  <p>HER: Would you like me to cancel it? </p>
  
  <p>ME: No, that's okay, I don't want to bother you. </p>
  
  <p>ME (5 minutes later): On a second thought though, if it won't bother you, I'd actually like to meet you. </p>
  
  <p>(Afterwards...) </p>
  
  <p>HER: So.. you'd like me to cancel it for sure?</p>
  
  <p>ME: Well, I'd like to meet you, yes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Afterwards, pretty shortly before meeting she proceeded to tell me I had forced her to cancel her appointment and how she hadn't liked that at all.</p>

<p>So my question is:</p>

<p>How can I find out what she really wants when she is telling me to meet up, but keeps sending mixed signals? More specifically, how can I confront her and make it clear that this issue is damaging me, but without making her feel bad about it?</p>

I was the only non-relative invited (and by her specifically), and she thought it would be nice if I could meet her extended family for the first time.</p>

<p>Given that it was such short notice, and that I had planned to spend some time with my parents later that evening, I told her I could only spend 30 minutes to an hour there, even though I certainly wanted to go. She felt that it would be rude for me to stay for such a short amount of time, and said it would be better if I didn't go at all.</p>

<p>In the end I decided to go to the barbecue and stay for about two hours, after talking with my parents. I had absolutely no desire to be rude, and as it turned out, I was well-received by my girlfriend's family. However, I was still a little unsure about what I should have done.</p>

<p>I'm a college student in the United States, and we've been dating for two years. I already knew her parents, and I had briefly spoken to some of her other relatives, but I didn't know them well. Under these circumstances, would it have been rude for me to just spend 30-60 minutes at the barbecue, explaining the reason to my hosts? I think it was certainly safer for me go, but would doing otherwise have been a breach of etiquette?</p>

"How to respond to questions at family holiday gatherings without making the asker uncomfortable about my sexuality?","<p>Tis the season for social obligation... </p>

<p>Unfortunately for some this leads to some awkward and uncomfortable situations. </p>

<p>How do you navigate family holiday parties when many family members are uncomfortable with queer people?</p>

<p>Personally I've been finding it more and more uncomfortable to go to my extended family's large holiday gatherings.</p>

<p>It wasn't so bad when I was still married and I could just <em>play it straight</em>, and pretend to be what they expected me to be. But nowadays many, if not most, know that I'm not straight, which makes things more complicated. Some would be convinced that I'm going to burn in hell. Some don't want their kids to hear that sort of thing. Some are accepting, but awkward. Some are really cool about it. It's a big family. </p>

<p>I'm definitely not planning any sort of large scale coming out, or starting a fight about it, but it's awkward to tiptoe around even basic ""what have you been up to?"" or ""have you been seeing anyone lately?"" sorts of questions without lying or withholding. Like I've been dating someone who I can't bring to the family gatherings, who has her own holiday family train wrecks to attend... </p>

<p>It ends up feeling a bit like being caught between a rock and a hard place. Be honest and risk a family meltdown, or lie and not have a real relationship with the family. </p>

<p>I know many of my friends avoid the issue entirely by spending the holidays with their chosen family, often because they don't have a choice, but I don't want it to have to be that way.</p>

<p>I know that simple avoidance of uncomfortable questions and sidestepping questions about my relationships and personal life is an option, but I'd rather not. Many of them want to have a genuine relationship with me and I want to have a genuine relationship with them, we're family after all.</p>

<p>So how do you navigate family holiday gatherings as a queer person?</p>

"Keeping a potential music teacher a possibility for future learning?","<p>I was looking for a singing teacher to give me private singing lessons. I emailed and left voicemails for a lot of teachers I found online. Only 2 bothered to even reply. I went with the first teacher to reply because she was the only person (at the time) to reply as well as having a great teaching style and being a very awesome teacher to learn from. I'm about 4 months into taking private singing lessons with her and I love it and have made a lot of progress.</p>

<p>The 2nd teacher replied to my email about a couple months after my initial email to her. I had heard glowing reviews about her as a teacher from her students. She is <em>extremely</em> accomplished as a singer. I would like to take lessons from her in the distant future after extensively learning with my 1st teacher (maybe after a year or so?) to get a sense of what different teaching styles there are.</p>

<p>I feel that giving myself input from multiple sources would be amazing for my growth as a singer. If you don't have multiple points of reference for how different singing teachers teach, you wouldn't know whether 1 teacher does something well that other teachers don't. It's nice to be able to compare so that you know what works for you and what doesn't work for you as a student. I don't want to take 2 sets of singing lessons in parallel because it would be too big a commitment for my daily life, which is why I want to learn from the 2nd teacher in the future.</p>

<p>I feel that being honest and saying, ""Hey, I already have a teacher now, but I want to take lessons from you in a year or 2"" won't work <sup>[1]</sup>. <strong>How do I tactfully put the 2nd teacher on hold so that I may take lessons from her in the distant future while keeping the relationship cordial since  I am delaying potential student-teacher lessons for a long time?</strong>  </p>

<p><sup>[1]: It seems out of line &amp; presumptuous to essentially be asking someone, ""Hey, I want you to keep me as an option very far in the future when you may not even know what your teaching situation or life situation will be at that time.

"Should food containers be returned to the donor?","<p>In the event of bereavements and health emergencies, many people are given meals by friends and more distant relatives.  While there is little (or no) question as to whether objects such as casserole dishes or Tupperware containers be returned (that answer being yes), how about disposable or reused containers? </p>

<p>After a recent ""family crisis"" we were given such gifts of kindness.  I dutifully washed receptacles and returned them, with a sincere thank you message.  This include a foil ""take away"" (""carry-out"") tray and a reused plastic ice cream container.  When these items were returned, the original giver looked bemused, and unsure what to do with them.

"How should I respond to verbal abuse when not directed at me?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I recently met this couple through my boyfriend. The husband is from southern Europe (Bob) and his wife is from Tibet (Lisa). Bob met Lisa in Nepal during a trip to India some 20 years ago, and got her to go with him (through Nepal) to Europe and marry him. 
We are talking about a young woman who had never left her village, and who was really close to her dad. Mom had either died at birth or when Lisa was really little. She has a sister who also lives in Europe but they don't talk or can't talk often. And so Lisa ends up marrying Bob. They now have a teenage daughter. Bob and Lisa were living happily ever after (?) until:</p>

<p><strong>Special Circumstances and Consequences:</strong></p>

<p>To my understanding she had been an illegal immigrant for quite some time before she was able to have the appropriate paperwork and travel documents (also mix up because of Tibet being under occupation?) and even after being married to a citizen for over fifteen years. This whole time (and for reasons I haven't completely understood or told the truth about), she had not been able to go back to her village and unfortunately her dad passes away. 
Dad never visited his daughter either all these years (could be over 15 years).</p>

<p>Since then, Lisa's health starts to gradually deteriorate. I haven't been able to ask what her exact diagnosis is but she has to take anti-psychotic medications. </p>

<p><strong>Additional Circumstances:</strong></p>

<p>Bob is a farmer and they constantly travel from city to farm so they don't stay in the city much. Lisa helps at the farm (whether she is able to or not, I'm not sure).</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> </p>

<p>I think the husband is overwhelmed about his wife's severe illness, because every time we hang out, whether it's at their place or farm or my place, he almost always says something nasty to her either because she can't wash the dishes well or clean or teases her about her appearance (gained weight-at some point had lost almost all her teeth-from medication?) and then he apologizes to her and kisses and hugs her. This seems like a pattern-him yelling, cursing at her and then apologizing for getting angry. 
Unfortunately, apart from taking medications, Lisa seems to be self-medicating by drinking beer and smoking. Even though Bob seems to care about her he lets her smoke and drink even if he initially yells at her for asking for beer. She had actually tricked me into buying her beer a few times. 
When he talks to her that way (he is either sarcastic or angry) I try not to laugh back,  but I just stay silent or leave the room temporarily</p>

<p>I wish I could say something appropriate when he does that in my presence, without offending him or making him angrier and less likely to listen.</p>

<p>Lisa can have regular conversations (when on medication) and from time to time she mentions how much she loved her dad, remembers things from childhood, and tells me how she wishes she never left her village. </p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How should I respond to verbal abuse I'm a witness of? (My boyfriend doesn't want conflict so I am also trying to respect that)</li>
<li>Is what is going on none of my business and I should just let it go?</li>
<li>How can I start a conversation about the fact that they both need extensive professional help which means that they would have to leave the farm alone in order to get the help they need? (Looking for suggestions or ideas about relevant conversations)</li>
<li>How should I respond to Lisa every time she confesses things to me about the situation without making Bob upset? </li>

"How to improve my ways when teaching my wife","<p>My wife studied basic-to-midlevel (by school standards) programming in upper secondary school, but then she didn't go further than that, and slowly lost the grip of it and didn't think about it for years. A few months after we started dating, she said she would like me to teach her (I'm a professional developer), and I was happy to say yes. </p>

<p>A bit of background: I have a Master's Degree in Electronic Engineering, and I'm used to studying and learning things in a variety of fields. I'm far from what you would call a workaholic (""study-holic"", maybe?), as my will is not strong enough to make me study and work to the point of fatigue; but I've always made up for it with the natural gift of curiosity. If something is interesting or intrigues me, then I get absorbed into it, and I won't stop it working on it (or thinking about it) until I'm satisfied with my results. </p>

<p>On the other hand, my wife pretty much stopped studying after upper secondary school. She started university, then switched to another one the next year, but dropped out of both. She had a very unsupportive boyfriend at the time, who kept telling her that she wouldn't make it and that it wasn't important anyway (he also had some very retrograde ideas about the role of women in the family), which, together with similar discouragement from some of her school teachers, led her to serious confidence issues. I worked hard to help her overcome it in the four years we've been together, and the results definitely show up, but she's not what you would call a strong and confident woman yet. She definitely has great qualities, but she can't fully accept the idea that ""she can do it"". </p>

<p>Further background info: I've always been a quick learner, and I've often been the one who ""tutored"" his schoolmates when studying together. This went on through university, even officially for a short time (I've been a teacher's assistant for a course after getting my bachelor), and when I started working (never in the academy) I've been occasionally tutoring university students. I've had decent-to-great results with my ""pupils""; however, I've never received formal training in education, and the only reason I would say I'm a teacher (which I'm really not) is because I ""taught people"" in the past. </p>

<p>Now to the main issue. Our home-made programming course isn't really going great. My wife definitely made progress, and managed to grasp fairly advanced concepts, but she has a very hard time putting them into practice. She is weak even in basic code-writing skills, which makes it ultimately pointless that she understands more advanced concepts. What bugs me is that what she easily accomplishes today, she may completely screw up tomorrow, for no apparent reasons. Moreover, she is not used any more to studying (we're both 34 and we've been out of school/university for more then ten years), and when difficulty arises her lack of self-confidence shows up and drives her into a downward spiral. </p>

<p>I realized more than once that I was making mistakes in my teaching. I'm a fairly advanced developer and I always try to learn new techniques, which means I'm used to overcoming learning curves; however, this also means that I had become fairly disconnected from the reality of a beginner, who may find it difficult to work with concepts that I would call extremely basic. I've done my best to ""reset"" a few times, to start back from the basics, to not give anything for granted, and to let her take her time to take concepts in. </p>

<p>However, things are not really going as expected. For example, we've had good ""lessons"" in the last two weeks, she seemed to really move forward, I decided not to advance and to suggest exercises that are a bit of ""more of the same"", in order to help her build confidence. Last night, she got stuck, so I guided her for a short while, but she quickly lost it, said she wasn't understanding, she kept interrupting my explanations and she concluded ""you could just write it yourself then"". </p>

<p>My biggest problem is that I don't know how to handle such a situation. She kind of panics, she reverts back to her ""I can't understand"" self-blaming and self-despising self, which in turn makes me nervous and gradually angrier, to the point where I lose it too and we end up fighting. I'm aware it's a personal issue for me: I've tutored both guys and girls that occasionally went down that same road, but I always stopped that before it reached a critical point. I can't manage to do that with my wife: I take it personally, both because she can't stop panicking and let her mind take control again, and because she isn't listening to <em>me</em> (or, to put it another way, <em>I</em> am ineffective in helping her). </p>

<p>When that happens, especially when it's something like ""you did it yesterday, why you can't do it now?"", I end up saying that she's not being committed, that maybe that night is not a good night for her, that she should stop and pick it up when she feels more willing to put efforts into it; she replies that I'm being harsh, that I was teaching badly that night, and that I've been scolding her too much ""for every mistake"". </p>

<p>To clarify: I love her a lot, she loves me a lot: we fight, but we never question our feelings for each other. I know this sounds cliché, but I get angry because I love her, and I only wish to see her happy with herself, to show her she can do way more than she thinks. </p>

<p>So, to sum a very long post (sorry about that, but I thought the situation needed thorough explaining): <strong>what can I do to handle a situation where she apparently refuses to listen while I try to teach her and help her?</strong> </p>

<p>Please, don't suggest things like ""you should be more patient"", ""she should be more committed"". We know it's true: we're trying to, but it's not working. I would greatly appreciate actionable advice, like ""try to do this"" or ""avoid doing that"". Thank you for your understanding. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Many thanks to all of you. I got a lot of helpful advice; my wife and I haven't had another lesson yet, but we talked about it and we're willing to pick it up again next week with new energy and better understanding. You gave me great tips in many different regards: teaching in general, teaching programming in particular, and a bit of much-needed psychology (and reality checks, too). I'll do my best to put it all to good use. </p>

"How can I better control my desire (or need) to send long messages?","<p>As far back as I can remember, my first Hotmail emails, T9-word texts, even handwritten letters—these events ages 10 to 16—I felt I communicated differently from others. In high school I kept private journals, sometimes filling up several pages in an hour, though in retrospect nothing of importance.</p>

<p>In college, adhering to social norms became much more of a priority, and I struggled to keep texts and emails brief. I invented all kinds of rules for myself—word limits, then limits that varied by category, and of course, sleeping on it. My friends lovingly joked to others: You know you're Andrew's friend when he sends you a 5,000-word email. But I was always ashamed and tried to introspect causes. Was it an overblown, irrational fear of being misunderstood? Like an unsatisfiable tick that I was leaving out some essential detail? Or a personality flaw? Like, narcissism about my words?</p>

<p>Post-college, my ""system"" became more organic. I'd feel a ""red flag"" while typing a message, and usually delete it on the spot. Gradually this habit reinforced itself as each time I realized everything was fine even without sending a message. If I tried again later, the ennui of trying to recreate the original message would win out, so I'd naturally compose shorter and shorter messages.</p>

<p>Now on my way to my 30s, I'm happy to say these habits have solidified, and I almost never send messages I'm embarrassed about. EXCEPT... when I'm under great distress, like after a breakup, during a heated disagreement, or some stressful project or event. I revert to my old ways, feel out of control, and feel childish and confused afterward. My communications during these times also tax my friends / significant other, worsen or complicate an already-bad situation, and make further attempts to communicate burdensome or simply undesired.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to mitigate this issue at the ""root""?</strong> I can't seem to rely on my developed habits (deleting the message then rewriting later; or simply delaying and editing) when in situations of distress.</p>

"How can I tell someone that I am glad to be leaving them without sounding petty?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>After this year, I will be going to a different school than the rest of my friends and so I am writing them cards. There is one person in the group who I especially don't like, and I would rather be honest and tell them that I am glad to be moving away from them. The situation between us is quite complicated but I will try and summarise it below. Be warned - it might sound petty!</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: I was dismissive of her when I was younger, we didn't speak for a while and in the recent past we have been fighting. She would be rude to me and push me around, clearly pointing out that she'd rather be near anyone but me. I spoke to her but she didn't stop doing this, which made me resentful. We finally agreed to just act as friends because we didn't want to spoil the peace for the rest of the group.</strong></p>

<p>I only spoke with her briefly when I was younger, but I remember being quite dismissive of her (I forgot her birthday and also made fun of her music tastes once), so I think that she had a bad impression of me from the start. I didn't speak with her properly for a long time after that because we had no classes together and weren't particularly close. I do admit that I shouldn't have been so dismissive of her when we were younger, and that if she doesn't like me, then I have part (or most of) of the blame as well.</p>

<p>A (long) while afterwards, she made this unspoken rule that only she could sit next to her 'best friend' in the group when we sat at a table to eat lunch. I didn't really have a problem with this, until it turned out that the person she stopped from sitting next to them was always me, and she never pushed anyone else away from a seat like that. I kept telling her that I didn't like her doing this, but she ignored me and would literally push and shove me off the seat if I ignored her and sat down anyway. 
I spoke to her over WhatsApp about this and they told me they did it because I'm 'the weakest', and therefore the easiest to push away. </p>

<p>A few months later, I was eating nearby her and I suddenly choked on my food. I coughed and realised that I was completely unable to breathe, cough up the food or speak at all, but she refused to come and help me. What she said to me was that 'they were busy talking and didn't notice', but another friend told me that she had said she <em>had</em> noticed and just 'didn't care and didn't want to help'.</p>

<p>Finally, we all have a group chat on WhatsApp which all of us use. However, she would write personal secrets and then specifically say that she didn't want me to see their message, encouraging others to 'spam' messages so that I wouldn't see it. 
I did see the messages, and I told her that I had no problem with them not wanting me to know her secrets, but pointed out that literally saying that she didn't want me to see it was very rude, especially because this was the entire group's chat and so I would obviously find out. I told her that if she wanted to talk about their secrets with a group of friends that didn't include me, they could always make a separate group and discuss it there. She ignored me and kept posting messages I 'wasn't meant to see' in places that I could see them.</p>

<p>I was so annoyed by these incidents that for a few days I acted harshly towards them, but it by now we have an 'unofficial truce' where we act like we are friends. I still think they dislike me, and I still generally dislike them, but to be honest, once I leave I will be glad that I don't have to act like we are friends just for the sake of our other friends.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>Since we have the 'unofficial truce' (called so because we never discussed anything further but seem to have agreed that openly fighting was not the best idea), I'm not sure if it's appropriate to tell her that I really dislike her and am glad to see the end of my time with her, instead of writing a fake message that I'm sad to leave her even though I'm not. </p>

<p><em>This is especially because I am not 100% sure that she still dislikes me.</em>
Since they have acted nicely towards me after the choking incident (which I have reciprocated), and when I asked her if they disliked me, she replied 'no' but I always get the feeling that that's not entirely true. </p>

<p>If I do write all of this out in a card and tell her what I actually think, then I am worried that she will tell our mutual friends and I will be hated by the rest of the group. I don't want to drag the rest of the group into this conflict, but I think that the rest of the group would just ask me to get over it and they would support her. Currently, the group doesn't know that we dislike each other. </p>

<p><strong>How am I meant to tell them that I am glad to be leaving them? How am I meant to tell them this considering the views of the other people in the group? And finally, how do I come across without sounding like a petty grudge-holder?</strong></p>

<p><em>EDIT: What I want to do is to write her a message that is neither the generic 'I'll miss you, sad to leave' nor me literally telling her that I hate her, since I don't. Instead, I just want to tell her that I am not really close to her and still have some degree of dislike for her, but I am glad that we decided not to get others involved and decided to be more peaceful about it. Also, I would apologise for how dismissive I was of her when we were younger.</em></p>

<p><em>The reason I don't want to not give her a card is because that would be rude. The group of friends I am talking about is small, and it's a given that everyone gets a card. Finally, and this is quite a selfish reason, but writing that card would help me to move past this.</em></p>

<p><em>EDIT 2: In the end, I wrote her a short message based off Cronax's answer. Thanks for everyone's replies.</em></p>

<p>When it comes to politics I prefer to take the role of a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS796US796&amp;q=devil%27s+advocate+meaning&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjBzezBmcTbAhUIbK0KHRK3AVQQBQgkKAA&amp;biw=718&amp;bih=774"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""devil's advocate""</a> instead of firmly entrenching myself into one political party's ideas.  I do not like to disclose my own vote to people because of hostility from others who voted differently, so I keep it to myself.</p>

<p>With the current situation going on in Canada for the Ontario elections, with the Liberals not getting the 8 required seats to keep official party status, many people who supported them have brought it up in general conversation.  I never explicitly ask people their views, but they end up telling me anyways.  When I have brought up issues that I feel might have caused the Liberals to perform poorly, I am met with hostility and accusations of supporting ""an evil party"".</p>

<p>I have already tried explaining that I do not necessarily agree with the opposition, but people ignore it and continue to attack my character.</p>

<p>I feel overwhelmed and some of my relationships with people I truly enjoy talking to have been strained because of this issue.  I would appreciate being able to continue to talk about politics with people, and this issue may come up in the future except with different parties, so I would like to know what I can do for the next time.</p>

<h1>My Question</h1>

<p>What strategies can I use to stop people from assuming I am against a certain party (and therefore a ""bad person"") when I bring up counter arguments against them, <strong>without stating my personal political view?</strong></p>

"I'm 24 with a 4-year-old son. How to handle uncomfortable questions from people?","<p>I'm 24 years old and I have a 4 year old son who was conceived by accident. I don't know about other countries but that's definitely not usual in mine (Spain).</p>

<p>My son's mother and I broke up about three years ago but we get on well and are respectful of each other. I'm happy in life and don't have the feeling my life was ruined when my son was born. On the contrary, I don't regret it. I have a good job I like, MSc-level studies, good friends, and a wonderful family. I believe I'm doing an excellent job raising my son.</p>

<p>However I still feel very unconfortable when some people ask me certain questions. This has become quite usual with people I don't have a close relationship with - some coworkers, business partners, some neighbors, etc.</p>

<p>I'm really happy talking about my son and don't mind answering questions <strong>about him</strong>, such as ""How old is he?"", ""What school does he go to?"", or ""how does he behave with other children?"". But I don't feel comfortable when the questions are <strong>about me having a son</strong>. Like: ""How come you've got a son?"". And once I was directly asked ""<strong>Why</strong> do you have a son?"".</p>

<p>Guess what? Turns out the second kind of questions are the most usual ones from people I don't have a close relationship with.</p>

<p>I don't think these people should be asking such questions in the first place. I firmly believe they wouldn't ask them if I was 30+ years old.</p>

<p>What's the best way to let them know those questions are inappropriate and make me feel uncomfortable, while at the same time not making them feel uncomfortable as well?</p>

<p>By ""deal with"", I mean how can I make them understand this is my choice whether it is religious or cultural, and I will not be convinced by them so could we stop and change the subject.

"How to keep contact with one half of a couple if the others makes you very uncomfortable?","<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>I am in a ""let's occasionally do some Star Trek Themed Roleplay via IRC""-group that includes a couple I have known for ages. The group has one more member, but he is totally unaware of the past history.</p>

<p>Due to personal issues, me easily submitting to stuff and them occasionally being very dominant and being in a ""two against one""-position against me there came a phase when they really hurt me... a lot. Hard words where exchanged, I wasn't on the best of my behaviour either, feelings were hurt, the whole thing.  </p>

<p>She apologized, we had some talks, I am fine with her.</p>

<p>He, on the other hand, went way too far, and still has not apologized or even mentioned anything about being sorry! </p>

<p>I tried to apologize. Admittedly, I may have added a few ""but..""'s at the time, I am not sure of how exactly I put it. I am not really sure if he ever realized it <strong>was</strong> an apology, because he was still very subtly nasty to me by ignoring me. I tried to reach out, but there was the point at which the wall of ice he had set up just was too much.</p>

<p>On three separate occasions, in an attempt to defend his girlfriend, he basically said: ""You will regret acting like this, I do have ways to make sure of that!"". I was actually terrified the first time he did that. Another time he did that, I called him out at it, asking him what he thought he actually could do! This ended with his girlfriend telling me to stop talking to him like that.  </p>

<p>Now, I know I overreacted, but still: he was aware how terrified this kind of talk made me the first time, he actually was hurt when hearing I took it that seriously, because it implied he would actually hurt me, and he thought I was terrible for ever feeling that way!  </p>

<hr>

<h3>Current situation:</h3>

<p>I cannot really talk to him about it, she refuses to get involved in that topic, and ever since I have been too worried to ever complain about anything during roleplaying, or mention anything that might spark disagreement. I would love to get that out of the way, but don't know how. </p>

<p>Our only contact is currently taking place via chat. I actually avoided meeting her on two occasions when I was in their area, even though I would have loved to see her again, because I worried she might bring him along.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Question:</h3>

<p>My wish is to have a relaxed relationship with <strong>her</strong> again, being able to talk about just anything, as it used to be. My main fear is that if there ever is any dissent between us again, he will <strong>again</strong> push himself in, and attack me verbally for daring to have what should be a harmless, short-lived argument with her. How can I approach <strong>her</strong> about my fears without her striking out at me for daring to have any mistrust towards her SO? She loves him very much, but I would very much like to stay out of his sight forever.</p>

<p>I would be fine with leaving the RP-group even, but I admit I am worried she would not understand my reasons. So... what do I tell her, and how do I explain without her being angry and hurt?</p>

"Why is a shy or reserved person often perceived as cold or arrogant; also, how can such an impression be mitigated?","<p>It is my personal experience in India that someone who is shy or reserved is often perceived as arrogant/ cold/ selfish, though that may be a very inaccurate assessment. It has happened to me because I am somewhat reserved by nature, but unfortunately I have instinctively developed this same misconception at least twice myself when somebody was reserved with me. Later I realised that I had no reason at all to interpret their reserve as arrogance. My friends who live abroad say that this is a common perception in many cultures.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the basis of perceiving a shy or reserved person as cold or arrogant?</em></strong></p>

<p>Also, how can such an impression be mitigated without putting on an act or actually changing one's personality, which is not at all natural and also very difficult?</p>

"How should a person be told to apologise when he thinks he isn't wrong?","<p>A few days ago, in a Zoology class, one of my classmates was caught reading the Zoology textbook when the teacher was explaining. Although he wasn't reading anything that he wasn't supposed to, the teacher got mad at him for not paying attention and asked him to leave the class. He openly declined to leave the class, saying he wasn't wrong to have read the relevant textbook. The teacher then picked up his books and calmly walked out of the class.</p>

<p>Some students (not including the boy in concern) went and apologised on behalf of our friend, but the teacher was unhappy and sent our principal to ask the boy to leave the class, saying that either he stays, or our teacher stays. The boy in concern (let's just call him Jon) still declined, saying that he was not in the wrong for just having read the textbook.</p>

<p>As a result of the stubbornness of Jon, we all missed our Zoology class, for which we all messed up on our exam, held one day after the incident.</p>

<p>Was it right for Jon to have done this? What should we have told him, to perhaps convince him to apologise to the teacher? Please let me know so that a repeat of this situation can be prevented further.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am from India, and this incident did take place in India.
The class in concern was an 11th-grade class, with ages ranging from 15 to 17, and the class strength was around 20-25 students. </p>

<p>According to traditional Hindu culture, the teacher is to be given utmost importance and is to be respected even more than God, as it is he/she who helps us realise God in the first place. However, this was an old tradition, at a time when teachers were among the most skilful people in the country. Now, the situation is different. The highly skilled personnel now work at places like Google, or Apple, and people from among the remaining become teachers. I want to clarify that I'm not commenting on my teacher's ability here, but just speaking about teachers in general.</p>

"Elevator awkwardness, collegue makes self deprecating comment","<p>Yesterday I was taking the elevator down from the 5th floor to head out for lunch.  A co-worker who works on the 6th floor was already in the elevator.  I know that she works for my company, but I don't <em>know</em> her past that.</p>

<p>While in the elevator she out of nowhere says ""<em>It seems like I always get the freight elevator.  I know a I am a big girl, but is someone trying to tell me something</em>""?  I responded with a uncomfortable laugh, and replied ""<em>Yeah, me too</em>"".  The situation made me feel very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>After thinking about it, I though that next time my best bet would be to ignore the comment.  But in this particular case, because she knew who I was, I didn't think I could without being rude and nor could I get away.  And <strong>the look on her face</strong> made me <em>think</em> I did not do such a good job in this scenario.</p>

<p>In the future, how could I handle a situation like this where someone is making a self deprecating uncomfortable comment and <strong>I don't have the ability to get away</strong>?  I would prefer to make the situation easier on <em>me</em> as I am not the most social person, <strong>and</strong> the other person if possible as a secondary goal.</p>

<p>There is this particular guy who always comes early but is from the next tutorial group that shares the same tutor. We have met a few times as the seating arrangement in class is pretty much fixed and he is always waiting for me to pack up. He has started a conversation a few times like ""How do you find this module?"" and I kept making my conversations short, firstly because I should get going in my situation, secondly because I do not really know this guy as a friend or even an acquaintance, thirdly it's because I'm an introvert who often finds continuing usual conversations difficult, much more for awkward ones with strangers. We didn't even exchange names but he always talks as if we know each other. The only commonality we share is perhaps having the same tutor and having the same seat, in different time slots.</p>

"How can I tell if family members consider my unvaccinated kids a threat?","<p>My wife and I made a conscious decision to not vaccinate our children.  I'm not sure how they found out about it, but it apparently is a cause of nervous tension between us and them and apparently, we discovered, they don't bring their young children around to family get-togethers because of us.  </p>

<p>We homeschool our kids, don't send them to day care and our pediatricians are not pressuring us to vaccinate them (although they think it's a good idea).  Also, we've never went out of our way to tell people that we don't vaccinate the kids.  I'm not entirely sure how they found out (possibly via mother-in-law).  We talk about natural medicine and home births and midwives, but we don't talk about not vaccinating. </p>

<p>This is my wife's family mainly so I'm just going along for the ride here, I'd rather not get too involved, but I'd like to ease the tensions.  Or at least find out for sure if it is vaccines that are the existential threat in this case.  There have been too many coincidences (instances where relatives go to one party, but not to another party where we are, or instances where they show up without their kids) to make it seem like it's just an assumption, but nobody wants to talk about it. The relatives who do avoid us are mainly work the medical field or schools and therefore are seemingly very in-the-know about the schedule for vaccinations.  They don't like talking about Catholicism, homeschooling or natural medicine or midwifery much either, so maybe we don't have a ton in common, but it seems like vaccinations are used as a scapegoat for their absence. </p>

<p>I don't want to argue with people over the propriety of vaccinations and we're not staunchly against them. My assumption is, if our children are healthy, they can't get anyone sick, so why avoid us?  How do I find out what their reasons are for avoiding us and ease those problems? </p>

"How do I respond to a person that says they are everyone's scapegoat?","<h2>TL;DR:</h2>

<p>My dad is an un-diagnosed very likely covert narcissist and at the last counseling meeting, he declared that he felt that everyone made him the instant scapegoat. (which isnt't true, because from my perspective, it's self-inflicted). <strong>How do I respond to that statement, and let him know that I have no intention of truly harming him?</strong></p>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, my dad's behaviors reflect that of an <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201601/7-signs-covert-introvert-narcissist"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">covert narcissist</a>. 
Disclaimer: I am not diagnosing him, he fits the description very well.</p>

<p>Ever since the divorce 8 years ago, the relationship between us has not been pretty. Many mean words were exchanged, and I considered going no-contact (cutting him out of my life) many times. </p>

<ul>
<li>He feels everyone is not listening to him enough, but in my perspective, everyone's <em>had enough</em> listening to him. </li>
<li>He has been wanting counseling for a long time, but left things up to me as if I needed more help. This has been discouraging, and not at all supportive of my mental well-being.</li>
<li>He continually states that he suggested counseling first, even though I've been going all those 8 years and he has gone for maybe half that or less. I do not know for sure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What has been tried.</h2>

<p>During the meeting, I directly told him that it was a big, big assumption of his that everyone has this sort of negative feeling against him. He talked around that and basically didn't really respond to it. He really can talk himself out of these kinds of situations, narcissists in general are very smooth talkers. I suggested he go to counseling, he said he doesn't understand what to work on until I tell him in family counseling. (Saying he will not go to individual counseling because he's learned all he could about himself) He's manipulating the situation to fit what he desires. </p>

<ul>
<li>During the counseling, the counselor only acted as a mediator, not as a family counselor. This was previously agreed on. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>How do I respond in disagreement to his statement of ""Everyone makes me the instant scapegoat!""? My goal is to assert that I am <em>not</em> trying to make him a scapegoat for my issues.</strong></p>

<p>(everyone, including myself, while I am in front of him) I would rather remain cool, calm, and collected, and civil, while directly stating my belief. I want 
 to assert that I am not automatically making him the scapegoat of my issues, but also recognizing that he needs to continue to own his mistakes and accept responsibility. It seems like this is a method of his to avoid responsibility.</p>

<h2>Notes and clarifications</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am a 25 year old female that is married and not living with my dad</li>
<li>My parents divorced 8 years ago, my mother has remarried (happily) and my dad is still dating. </li>
<li>Family drama history is extensive, my dad has started spats and he is isolated from his family (siblings, my mom's family, etc), because not many people want to talk with him</li>
<li>Last but not least: <strong>I care about him still, and want a healthy relationship.</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>I will not accept answers that tell me more about narcissists, how they behave, why they behave, whether to cut him out of my life or not (that's not the question), and anything that is not explaining how to respond to the statement the next time he tells me in front of a counselor.  </p>

<p>Earlier I used to listen to him but he never has talked about work. He always talks about himself, how varied his interests are and how we can never do what he does.

<p>My initial approach was to just say ""Hey, how have you been?"" But now I'm not sure if I should even talk to her again or if I should just let old relationships be set aside.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: We broke up because of misunderstandings in showing proper affection. The misunderstanding led to unfortunate argument exchanges and it was bad enough that we didn't speak for 2 years. We both ""hated"" each other but at the same time still deeply cared for each other... I'm not sure how this is scientifically stated, but that's the best way I can explain it. </p>

<p>My goal is just to be her friend again, because we were best friends before dating. As a friend, I just want to be in good terms again. So that at least when we see each other, we can say hi, or catch up since it's been so long. But am I looking to hang out with her on a regular basis again? Probably not.

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aren't you ashamed you have a flag of the country ruled by a dictator and killer? (Not even joking, even though questions like that are rare, it sometimes happens)</p>

Some of my relatives took offence to my ignoring or slow (as in, a few months later) response to their calls/emails. Thus I was recently confronted a few times with questions along the lines of ""Why won't you reply, do you hate us?"". The thing is, I know those people well enough, and I know they share the common prejudice against mental disorders. They nearly put me into a mental asylum once already, and I'd rather avoid that. On the other hand, outside of that topic we are on good terms, and I'd rather not cut off ties by answering ""Yeah, I hate you, even if only for half of a year"". So far I've been stalling with refusing to answer and promising to be more responsive in the future, but a) that doesn't satisfy them and b) that's not a promise I can fulfil.

<p>I occasionally play video games at night, and noticed that I was experiencing high latency. This lag makes these online games border line unplayable which is very frustrating. Perhaps my isp is to blame and not my roommate?</p>

<p>Over the weekend they were gone and I had no issues with my connection. Given how consistent it was prior to them leaving, and the return of the lag after they came back, I am pretty certain it is my roommate that is causing this issue. I want them off of my personal wifi.</p>

<p>My employer in the Emergency Department (who is also a family friend) will give me a back-handed compliment several times a year. They seem to come out of the blue and always take me by surprise. They usually take the ""I don't know why, but..."" form. Examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know why, but that patient had a lot of nice things to say about you.<br>
  I don't know why, but they really want you to volunteer there again.<br>
  I don't know why, but they were very impressed with you and want you to go back (when I did a stint for the hospital filling in for a doctor in one of their satellite offices.)  </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know why, but Alice really respects you, and looks up to you as a role model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These comments hurt me personally and leave me confused. In my defense, I am considered to be a very good doctor; the nurses ask for me when they or their family members are sick, and the Nursing Supervisor told my boss - I don't know under what circumstances - that she thought I was an outstanding clinician and made the most challenging diagnoses.

"Two friends and their wedlocked affair","<p>I currently live in a house with 3 other people, my girlfriend Julie, and 2 friends Bob and John. Outside of our household, we have a friend named Jane, who is our only friend that is married in our group currently. Bob and Jane are brother/sister respectively.</p>

<p>About a year ago, John and Jane started having an affair. It made everyone a little bit uncomfortable at first, but we sided with Jane because she was having some troubles in her marriage and told us that she plans to break it off. If we fast forward to now, she still hasn't broken off her marriage. Her husband was told a long time ago that Jane cheated on him, by Jane herself - but he does NOT know that it has been ongoing for so long. Her husband has made some mistakes in their relationship, which has hurt them before - but never anything like this. He does not deserve this treatment (As I believe no one does). Jane and her husband are also currently in the process of selling their home to buy their ""dream home"" for Jane, so she can have horses that she always wanted and lots of land. We are uncomfortable with this because we believe she does not deserve this as she has not been faithful.</p>

<p>Anyways, me, Julie, Bob, and our other mutual friend Sandra are planning on telling Jane's husband about it on Thursday, as we have been very uncomfortable, and we decided we weren't going to sit around and wait for something to happen anymore.</p>

<p>We have already told Jane's husband that we want to have a ""Boy's Night out"", to try to avoid Jane being there while we talk to him - but as of writing this, Jane messaged Bob, and asked him why we invited her husband out to a ""Boy's Night"", and it eventually came out the plan to tell him. Jane told him that it isn't our place to tell him and that she will never forgive him (Us when she finds out all of us are involved and decided together) - we are willing to risk that, as all of us refuse to sit back and let this happen anymore. As Jane knows the plan, we assume that John now also knows because we are sure they are talking to each other about it.</p>

<p>One thing that can happen now is Jane telling her husband before we have a chance. I kind of like that this happened actually because it gives her a reason to come clean and tell him herself which I think will end much better than if a group of people that are really just acquaintances tells him about it first.</p>

<p>But if she does not tell him first, we have to deal with John. As I said, John lives with me in my home along with Bob. There is no contract for him living with us, it's just a verbal agreement that he pays a 4th of the rent and utilities/bills. What I'm really worried about is retaliation as me, Bob, and Julie are directly involved and all live with John. Today when I get home I plan on taking pictures of all my expensive things, in case he tries to retaliate, break stuff, and then leave without saying anything. As he does live there full time and does have belongings in the house, I don't think it would be right for me to change the door lock code to prevent him from getting into the house to try to avoid this, so one question I have is how to avoid retaliation that will cost actual money to fix. I understand that there may be retaliation in the form of being ignored, hated, etc., but this does not concern me as I have already accepted it. Another thing is possible retaliation from Jane - if John knows the door code, so will Jane.</p>

<p>Another question that I have is, what is the best way for us to tell Jane's husband? We currently have a time set at 6:00 PM on Thursday to meet him for a ""Boy's Night"" at a local restaurant - our whole friend group minus Jane will be there to back each other up. This includes me, Julie, Bob, and Sandra.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention, Jane, and her husband also have a daughter who is around 2 years old. This is another reason we believe we have to do something, she is spending all of her time with John, cheating on her husband while her husband takes care of their child, and is about to buy a house (Serious financial debt) for her - we want to do something before he spends that money.</p>

<p>My distinct question is: How can we tell Jane's husband about Jane's affair?</p>

<p>My goals would be to keep everyone calm and peaceful, and avoid any expensive retaliations from negatively affected parties.</p>

<p>Answers that also contain a way to keep everyone on good terms would also be very greatly appreciated, we are all friends after all, but I know this may not be possible and is not a requirement to the situation.</p>

"How do I deal with some of my mean classmates?","<h2>Flashback</h2>

<p>Today when I entered in class, I came late due to the fact that I’m in flow that I stayed on telephone. And when I came to school, I asked Chemistry teacher to annulate my absence, and an ugly( inside) girl told me, “get out of here!” and that made me be very angry at her that I wanted to beat her, but I couldn’t beat her,nor spoke bad, such as “f@&amp;k you, asshole!”( out of anger). And she looked at me with ugly face, and that really irritated me a lot.</p>

<h2>CLARIFICATION</h2>

<p>What I’m trying to say is that, that girl, my class mate was mean to me and she behaved in such that she really irritated me. But not the teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do I deal with such mean people that next time, not to repeat it again? How can I make her changed her mean attitude? </p>

<p>Because, with some, she’s nice, only with me. Should I become very angry at her and act upon my anger? </p>

<p>How can I make in such that others won’t need to talk to me in such that it really gets me mad?</p>

<h2>What’s my goal?</h2>

<p>I’m want to know this so that I can stop doing whatever mistake I’ve done in past, so that in future, Mss. Ugly girl will not talk to me in the way that makes me to be angry at her. I want to have a good relationship as brother and sister( by helping each other in need, walking together etc…). Do you know what I mean? I only want to have all my class mates as my friends, not enemies. Because, my only enemy in my class, is that ugly girl. And by ugly, I mean unclean from inside.</p>

"How can I make peace with my younger brother","<p>Personally, I am a 21-year-old male, and my family consists of my mum, dad and a younger brother aged 17.</p>

<p>To provide an overall context of my family before I talk about the problem.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Analysis of involved characters</h1>

<p>(Might contain certain levels of bias)</p>

<p><strong>Myself</strong></p>

<p>Extremely academically driven, willing to work hard for the grades (Mainly interested in the field of Mathematics but not a prodigy in it, doesn’t fair well in linguistic subjects like global relations or possibly literature)</p>

<p>Freshman in a Computer Science course (Enrolled because it’s the course that my entry points could enter yet prospects are believed to be good, slight interest in programming though zero knowledge in tech trends and not IT savvy at all, and the belief that Computer Science is a subset of Mathematics and my skills might be relevant)</p>

<p>Not fairing well academically (50 percentile for all modules taken this semester, maybe due to lack of adaptation to new undergraduate life and employing of wrong study techniques from my previous education system or the major is filled with talents)</p>

<p>Lacking of all practical skills (Financial literacy and value assessment, handyman skills that every independent man should possess and interpersonal skills between people (I’m an introvert that just gets nervous talking to anyone)</p>

<p><strong>Younger brother</strong></p>

<p>Totally not academically driven, puts in the minimum effort yet still expects the rewards to be high and then rants about it later on. Simply put, happy-go-lucky.</p>

<p>(When one is lagging behind on the syallabus, and still intends to try for a good grade, of course the logical thing to do is to put in extra time for the subject. However, when my brother meets with this scenario, it seems like he doesn't put in that effort as I always catch him napping for more than 8 hours a day and assume he isn't the sort to wake up during wee hours to study since he's generally a sleep lover. He would just pray hard that the untouched topics, which is apparently a huge chunk, doesn't appear in the exam. After the end of the exam, he still harbours high expectations about his exam outcome and rants about it when the actual results are out, when he knows clearly he didn't even put in the minimal effort like what anyone would have done to deserve a good grade.)</p>

<p>Recently did very badly overall for all modules in a major examination in high school and wanted a change in specialisation to Engineering just because he thinks everyone there can graduate easily without much effort and has a lot of job prospects, even when he once said he dreaded it.</p>

<p>Is extremely tech-savvy compared to me, might be a better Computer Science candidate as opposed to me</p>

<p>Better financial literacy, better handyman skills, maybe better interpersonal skills? (He can talk a lot with other people including strangers, but I find his topics to be directed only towards making fun of/devaluing the other person and he just keep repeating the process and the other person happens to always be the tolerant kind)</p>

<p><strong>Dad</strong></p>

<p>Main breadwinner of the family through an active job, hence is too busy to take care about family problems and usually intervenes only when he deems necessary (For the current problem to be stated, he doesn’t find the need to intervene directly)</p>

<p>Very good financial literacy and handyman skills, since he was previously an engineer before switching to a managerial position elsewhere and was brought up under a family situation which forces everyone to be independent.</p>

<p>No emphasis on grades, but wants everyone to possess the same independence level as him.</p>

<p>Usually asks my younger brother “How to” problems regarding technology devices.</p>

<p><strong>Mum</strong></p>

<p>Obtains income from a passive source, leading a carefree life which involves seeking shopping and other entertainment venues.</p>

<p>Fairly good financial literacy, but depends on my dad for almost anything.</p>

<p>Like my dad, no emphasis on grades.</p>

<p>Like my dad, usually asks my younger brother “How to” problems regarding technology devices.</p>

<hr>

<h1>The Problem which snowballed after a decade long</h1>

<p>My family lives in an Asian society where education seems glamourizing. Since young, even though my family doesn’t really actively compare our grades, from my perspective my brother seems to somehow be really bothered by the difference in our academic abilities, and also perhaps some small privileges I might get as the older brother. This is just a single possible scenario, it could also be the complete opposite: He's full of himself. I will just talk about the former case for now.</p>

<p>I recall an event when he first turned 12 and was about to transition into a new school. He consulted my mum about some academic matter, and of course my mum asked me to join the conversation since I have been through the same transition phase. I just gave my opinion on the corresponding matter and tried to help. Back then when he still bothered talking, he explicitly said I'm nosy and should just mind my own business. Now that I think back from his perspective, maybe he thinks ""I'm devaluing him"".</p>

<p>In his later year of growing up, he has become quite cold towards me or even bear some sort of grudges towards me, avoiding to ask help from me as much as possible even when he clearly needs it. He doesn’t even look me in the eye whenever I talk to him and keeps all conversation as short as possible, and if he had to take something (maybe pepper or instant noodles) of which happens to be more convenient by asking me to do it, he would rather do it himself. Sometimes I could unintentionally hear him hissing bad remarks behind my back as a way to vent his frustration after he got some kind of unfair share of a deal from his perspective.</p>

<p>At first the problem didn't really bothered anyone in the family and everyone just continued being involved in their own lives, until concerning relatives or friends start questioning such weird behaviour. </p>

<p>Some recent examples include a monthly gathering over dinner with my cousins. My brother would always wait for me to sit down first, and intentionally choose to sit at the seat furthest away from me. My cousins will always question me when my brother is away for awhile like what happened recently, and I would find it awkward to reply. </p>

<p>Gradually, he closes his heart away from the entire family since I always raise my problems directly to them and they would gladly resolve it, and maybe my brother hates my “robbing of attention” and simultaneously feels that my parents need him more than the other direction and hence instills a mindset of “being superior compared to everyone else”.</p>

<p>To my parents, they don’t see my brother as having as much problems as compared to me (though I don’t completely deny that), so this should rule out the possibility that the cause of my brother's intention of closure is actually that I'm comparatively better than him according to my parents(In fact it's the complete reverse). If it was the other scenario, I cannot even reason why he's showing such signs.</p>

<p>They also think I, as the older brother, should be responsible for resolving the “decade long Cold War” between us (which clearly I’m not good at doing) and they don’t seem to be doing anything to help make that bridge happen. This is one of the things that they have been nagging me to do and it’s getting really annoying.</p>

<p>I don’t deny I don’t have my own problems too.</p>

<p>How can I have a discussion with my brother in order to ""make peace""?</p>

"How to avoid short answers when talking to my family?","<p>I am a 30 year old programmer, and I feel like becoming more and more a ""program"" myself.</p>

<p>When talking with friends or families, except for a certain group of friends with whom it's always fun and games, I don't ask much and I don't tell much.</p>

<p>So, when I'm being asked things, I just use short answers and if they want to know more, they have to ask more, like in the example here</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Person: Did you see the soccer game yesterday?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Um, nope</p>
  
  <p>Person: Why? What were you doing?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Playing games, as usual</p>
  
  <p>Person: What games?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Game 1, game 2 and game 3</p>
  
  <p>Person: Yes, as usual indeed...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the main problem here is, I don't know when I began to act like this, but I just don't tell anything unless being precisely asked to, like an SQL query, and that behavior makes me more and more socially awkward, and annoying for my family as well.</p>

<p>When it is questions about my job, it is like in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3213/how-to-deal-politely-with-people-asking-about-your-job-but-unable-to-understand"">this question</a>, but what is worse, my job is just boring lines of code and I have nothing exciting to tell them.</p>

<p>How can I revert back to a more social behavior?</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> - I am mostly asked questions by my aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews and nieces as my parents already know how annoying it is to try to start a conversation with me, as our talks lead to absolutely nowhere</p>

<p><strong>Edit from comments and answers</strong> - My bad, my soccer game example is not a very good one as I enjoy soccer (like I would have prefered if they told me their highlights of the game instead of asking me what I was doing instead), but I just have my video games at a higher priority in my hobbies - plus, I didn't switch on my TV for a long time (over 10 years?)</p>

<p><strong>Edit for more clarification</strong> - No one asked for this (hey, I can do it when I'm writing) but as a context, most of them tend to investigate on my private life as I am now the only single person among my cousins (and still am) - In case you wanna know, my everyday life is waking up, preparing for work, going to work, at work, picking up my mother when she finishes work, going home, having dinner (sometimes asked questions during dinner), spending about ten minutes on social medias to know if my pals are preparing some weekend plans, playing games, and go to sleep... And if my friends have some plans, either my parents don't need me at home and I'm able to attend the plan, or I stay at home, hanging out with my parents and playing games</p>

<p><strong>Another note</strong> - I live in a developing country, I am part of an association who wants to promote esports in the country, and I am a leader of a certain community who plays a certain game that I enjoy playing at</p>

"How to explain to my girlfriend that I enjoy certain video games?","<p>I would like to ask for advice about my current situation, my girlfriend (26) and I (31) have been together for 2 months now and we really have lots in common and always have a great time together but! I am an IT guy so I am into technology very much and currently own a Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>I really quite enjoy some video games (like Hand of fate 2, dark souls, doom, etc..), it is a way to entertain myself, to clear my head a bit after work and I do not play much at all, around 6 hours per week and some weeks I do not play at all.</p>

<p>The thing is, she despises video games from the bottom of her heart, her position is quite radical. I do not get why, when I try to explain why I like to play her answer is something like ""<em>-video games are for freaky and creepy nerds-</em>"" and that's it! I cannot discuss any further about it, she just doesn't hear me at all.</p>

<p>I could just sell my console and not play anymore, but I would like to first try to make her understand me, since she does not give me any reasonable answer about it so I would like to ask for some advice:</p>

<p><strong>How can I explain to her that it is something I enjoy?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>To add some more details about it, our relationship is pretty new and this is the first major disagreement we have had so far.</p>

<p>I have tried so little to be honest because she just does not want to listen, like really, she just says things like ""<em>no no, that's for creepies, for smelly nerds</em>"" and stuff like that, I have tried to explain to her:</p>

<ul>
<li>That it is no different from watching series or movies (which she
does).</li>
<li>That I only play in my spare time when we do not meet normally after
work and would never prefer to play instead of meeting her or doing
something together.</li>
<li>To explain that it helps me to clear my mind after work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I actually tried to show her and explain a video game once and after 20 seconds she told me ""<em>are we going to do something else?</em>"" and that was it, I just turned it off.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised because our communication is very good actually, we have discussed important matters openly in a very productive way, but with this topic she gets just too aggressive.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your answers.</p>

"How to handle emotional expectation about an animals death, I do not fulfill?","<p>I just experienced a difficult situation and I did not know how to react. My SO and me have a pet hamster that showed some worrying behavior and might have to be put down. She is very attached to him and she started worrying and crying intensely. While I like the hamster, I am not really emotionally attached. What made the situation worse is that she always projects the future negative while I project it positive. So for her he was already dead and for me he just had a small thing that a vet would be able to fix in no time. </p>

<p>While I don't know the future, but when he eventually dies I can see questions coming up like why are you not sad? Did he mean nothing to you? 
How can I prepare for this event and also show her that I care <strong>about her</strong> and her wellbeing. </p>

<p>I saw <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2944/appropriate-reactions-to-people-who-recently-lost-their-pet"">this question</a> which is great and gave me some further reading. But most advice is written for outsiders and not really shared pets. Also the main point is listening to the person. While I did that in the above mentioned situation for most she was just crying and not saying anything, which makes listening hard. I also did not really know what to say, I thought of the obvious also mentioned in an article in the question of what not to do: ""Like you could get a new one"", but did not say it.</p>

<p>The main problem is that I have the feelings of an outsider but the role of an insider(since the pet is shared) which makes anything I say like ""I am so sad about this"" fake or ""My condolesence"" too distant.</p>

<p>What I tried so far is just holding her and not saying much. I just said ""That it will be fine"" but this definitely won't help when he actually dies. Is there something more I could do than just physical contact, that could help her with her emotions?</p>

"How do I reveal to my father that his father is not his biological father?","<p>I've been using DNA testing to supplement my genealogical research and have made the rather startling discovery that the man whom I knew as my paternal grandfather was not in fact my father's biological father.</p>

<p>I first tested myself and my father on 23andme, with the expected result that my father was my biological father. I then tested my paternal grandmother, again with the expected result that she was my father's biological mother. However, when I started exploring my father's non-maternal matches, I could not tie any of them into my grandfather's side of my tree. This was when I started suspecting a non-paternal event of some type.</p>

<p>I recently became confident in my suspicions when my cousin (my father's niece) uploaded her AncestryDNA results to gedmatch. She matched as expected to my father's maternal phasing, but not at all to his paternal phasing. Additionally, she matched strongly to a third cousin on my (non-biological) grandfather's side of the family, so I think I can rule out another non-paternal event in her ancestry.</p>

<p>By researching the trees of some of the genetic matches to my father and finding crossover, I believe I have a good theory on who his biological father might actually be.</p>

<p>Both non-biological and potential biological grandfathers are deceased.</p>

<p>I believe my father has the right to know that his biological father is not the man he knew as his father, but how do I tell him? Do I tell him privately or with the rest of my family present? Do I prepare a presentation to try to prove it if he is resistant to the idea? Do I tell him my theory on who I believe to be his biological father?  Do I contact the biological father's other family?  Also, my paternal grandmother is still alive but suffering from dementia - do I bring this up with her, especially assuming it was a secret she may never have wanted to be revealed?</p>

"Is my overthinking bad or good? How to support an emotional girlfriend?","<p>I'm sorry to give this exhausting question, but I want to be sure I state every important detail. This question has 2 parts, both, I feel, have something in common.</p>

<p>To give some background about myself, I am a big extrovert - it's quite okay for me to just start talking with girls at train and go out with them to be friends later on. I am now at university and while on college, I have friends next door which I visit every day when I am alone in my dorm room (mostly because I am just not a type of person who feels comfortable to be alone for more than couple of hours). I am a programmer - programming since 11, now being 22. 119 IQ points in Mensa test. I am not afraid to ask and I like to know the details. Any problem bugging my mind is bugging me until I get to know the answer.</p>

<p>It all started at elementary school already. I was really not afraid to ask - for most of the other students - stupid questions. For me they didn't seem stupid because I see many perspectives the thing isn't clean in. The same was at high school - aimed at IT &amp; Programming. Now, as on university, being in a hall of 300 other students, I am really trying to hold back before asking anything. </p>

<p>I've had a very good friend of mine, who then stopped seeing me for some reasons (not exactly sure about all of them), but one of the reasons she stopped to like me were ""You ask too much questions, its sometimes annoying"" or ""You try to detailize things too much"". I am currently being with a girlfriend for 2 and a half year already and it's sometimes happening with her too. Why does almost nobody understand my need to know things? And why is this happening to me? All the thoughts that I considered were me being </p>

<ul>
<li>seeing the problem from many perspectives, making me analytical, open-minded (maybe a lot connected to my programmer thinking?), maybe a good sign of intelligence?</li>
<li>not being able to get what others say - maybe low EQ, low empathy?</li>
<li>just too dumb to somehow interpret the answers and reading between the lines?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here comes the second part. Let's say I have a female friend on the same university as my GF. When my GF tells me a story about that friend hurting her feelings, I always try to see it from another perspective and show it to her (that correlates a lot with the way I think over things), in which, for example, I say something like ""I don't think she meant it as bad as you heard it. Couldn't she mean it &lt;&lt;&lt;{this}>>> way?"" The response is often something like ""Why do you always defend her like this? Why are you never on my side?"" </p>

<p>I am really trying to be supportive as much as I can, and when she's down and is driven by her emotions I just try to rationalize the behaviour more than just agree with her. Is it just better to shut the mouth and agree with my GF even I know she could be wrong and it potentially worsens the relationship with this specific person? </p>

<p>For example, some days ago a girl in a whatsapp group, sent a picture of her wearing a new t-shirt and I replied like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Nice t-shirt! It makes you look skinny!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In that moment i didn't want to be offensive, it was a compliment, but considering that she is  a bit ""overweight"" it looked like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Nice t-shirt! It hides that you are fat!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When i noticed the possible misunderstanding i replied again explaining what i was trying to say but everybody assumed it as something offensive and my girlfriend told me that I didn't look nice with my words.</p>

<hr>

<p>The good part about it, is that everyone ask me for a real opinion, cause they know that I will always say the truth even if it isn't nice.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm a promising young programmer in his second job experience with a real contract and (for someone with my age) a good salary.</p>

<p>This aspect of my personality sometimes can be a problem with my colleagues, making them think that I feel superior to them or just invading their own space.</p>

<p>I still really like to be helpful and I always offer myself to help when someone is in trouble with some code.</p>

<p>This is a nice thing in my opinion, but I met colleagues who felt offended cause i had less experience than them or just didn't want me to be there like i was really invasive.</p>

<hr>

<p>Do I have to assume this as my personality and keep living this way or I have to try to moderate myself? If yes, how?</p>

"If and how to point out wardrobe malfunction in someone of the opposite sex","<p>Last night I was playing poker at the casino.  A combination of where I was sitting, bright lighting overhead, and a poorly fitting blouse gave me a pretty full view of the inside of a dealer's shirt.  I was doing my best not to look but (like most people I think) when I actively try to not look at something I often find myself looking at that exact thing when my focus drifts.</p>

<p>I felt uncomfortable saying anything at a table full of guys and wasn't sure what would be the appropriate thing to say as the cause could have easily been that she is larger than when her uniform was assigned.</p>

<p>Should I bring it up?  If so what is a socially acceptable way to say that the space between your buttons is wide open?</p>

<p>Related to, but substantially different from the following question as the root cause of lack of coverage isn't something that can be immediately remedied:  <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3348/is-it-appropriate-to-tell-someone-of-the-opposite-gender-your-fly-is-down"">Is it appropriate to tell someone of the opposite gender &quot;your fly is down&quot;?</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Just for clarification based on several comments:  Due to rules from the union, dealers share tips in a pool of 100+ people without even any sort of tracking who individually collected what.  Given the low percentage of additional tips a dealer would see (&lt;1%) I see it as unlikely that tips would be a significant factor in this situation.  Good thing to consider in similar situations but not applicable in this specific one.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update on this:</p>

<p>I think most had interpreted this as cleavage out of the neckline rather than between the buttons.  Turns out she was pregnant and just starting to show which caused her shirt to fit tight down low and loose up top and distort in the middle.  She shortly afterwards switched over to the maternity uniform which fit much better.</p>

"How to judge if somebody needs advise or just a shoulder to cry on?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I've had this friend for a while, whom I'd describe as a ""very close stranger"". 
Since we live kinda far apart from each other and have absolutely no common acquaintances etc., it's easy to share all sorts of things with each other. I know all about her weird quirks, secrets, family, friends and work, but have never met any of them and vice-versa. We meet maybe once or twice a year for lunch or dinner, but write/phone about once a week (it's actually mostly less emotions and more problem-solving oriented). 
It might be similar to a two-way therapist relationship without any of us being a therapist and there is a lot of trust in each other.</p>

<p>We've helped each other over the years proof-reading papers and theses from a non-specialized point of view, so I'm well aware of her writing style and skills, which I consider is kinda ornate for the academic field. I absolutely have no understanding of her professional field though, so I'm not ruling out the possibility that scientist in this field write different than in mine. (I myself am probably just average myself as well, upper average at best.)</p>

<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>

<p>She gave me a call the other day in tears and totally enraged. She just handed in her PHD thesis and apparently it got trashed. Her advisor, whom she hasn't been getting along with since the beginning anyway, judged it lacked in many things, among them scientific writing quality. She obviously doesn't agree.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>I was kinda in a loss at what to do in this situation. I haven't read her work this time (didn't have the time to), but from the way she talks and past writing, I do think there's a realistic chance that at least in this point her advisor might have a point. I feared telling her that could have make her explode, she was already very upset. So in the end I just said kinda mirrored her opinion on her advisor and the situation (advisor is an ass and of course her work is good). But I felt kinda guilty because I didn't indicate that there might be actually something wrong. She said others have read it and if the language was insufficient, somebody would have pointed it out. From how she describes her other friends, I doubt that though cause they seem rather meek and she's a rather dominant character.</p>

<p><sub><em>I only know her from her interactions with me. I have the impression she's not as uncensored/real with others. So she could actually be much more reserved with others.</em></sub></p>

<p>She really believes her work is more than sufficient and compared it to a colleague's work (different advisor though), who got the title. On the other hand, her advisor is a professor (duh) and I suppose he should know better than her? Or, since she is ""just a very close stranger"", is it maybe not my problem to deal with and keeping silent and giving her a shoulder to cry on was perfectly what was to be expected?</p>

"How to ask someone if I can do a background check on them?","<p>I'm currently preparing to cycle the <a href=""https://www.adventurecycling.org/routes-and-maps/adventure-cycling-route-network/transamerica-trail/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TransAmerica Trail</a> next summer, and am in the process of searching for a traveling companion. The problem though is that, since this is a fairly long trip, it is <strong>much</strong> more difficult to find someone to go with who lives locally to me; i.e., someone I could find through local bike shops, cycling groups, etc.. Because of this, I've had to take my searches to the internet, and consider responding to ""companions wanted"" posts, such as <a href=""https://www.adventurecycling.org/adventure-cyclist/companions-wanted/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these</a>.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>would it be considered ""too much"" if I were to ask a potential travelling companion if I could do a [SSN based] criminal record background check on them?</strong> </p>

<p>I mean, I <em>am</em> going to be traveling with this person for the better part of 2 months, and will be trusting them with my life, in some ways. I just want to make sure I don't get matched up with someone who has an intimidating criminal history, mostly if it were related to theft or violence (whereas sth. like tax evasion I wouldn't be as concerned with). </p>

<p>So, would it be reasonable for me to ask for a background check? And, if so, what would be the best way of bringing it up? I don't want to scare people off from being overly precautious, however, I also don't want to be careless in my selection. Also, at the time of asking them, I would also be most comfortable in offering that they do one on me too. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

"I'm literal; how can I understand what is meant?","<p>Well I'm not literally literal. But I interpret communication relatively literally.  Specifically I usually take definitions literally.  This leads to misinterpretations.</p>

<p>Others have called me literal.  And just this past week someone compared my communication to a robot.  That wasn't the first time.</p>

<p>Here's an example of me misunderstanding:  </p>

<p>A friend said this publicly online:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call your friends out for their sh-tty behavior. Encourage your friends to do better. Love is pushing someone to be their best self, it is not being complacent in order to keep from disrupting the balance you are comfortable with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here was my interpretation: ""If you're pushing someone to be their best self, you are pushing them from sh-tty to good, to great, to execellent to best.  Not just the first step. Friend wants said pushing.""</p>

<p>A few days later while reflecting I thought of a piece of constructive criticism.  I sent it over a message.</p>

<p>They replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wasn’t necessarily looking for a challenge though lol. When I said challenge your friends, I moreso meant when they are being sh-tty people, call them out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I went back and read what they wrote.</p>

<p>The first sentence aligned with the reply.</p>

<p>If ""Encourage your friends to do better"" means ""Encourage your friends to do better [than sh-tty]"" then the second sentence aligns, as well.  </p>

<p>However I struggle to make the third sentence align with the reply.  If if I were to redefine ""best"" to mean ""not sh-tty"", then it aligns ""Love is pushing someone to be their [not sh-tty] self"".  But that's not what ""best"" means.  What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>How can I determine what people mean when they communicate?</p>

"How to date/meet people after a very long break","<p>And by long I am talking 16 years since I had anything resembling a friend or GF. 10 years ago I was finishing grad school and knew people but never did anything outside of class work. </p>

<p>I have tried simply talking to people, the only people that talk to me in person are bored cashiers that are way too young and just bored enough to enjoy watching me squirm.</p>

<p>I have tried looking for friends on dating sites and penpal sites. Nothing at all there. Can't get a response. </p>

<p>I even went outside the country and got a few people from China, Vietnam and Ukraine to chat a bit but I have no clue if they are legit and they obviously aren't hanging out with me even if they were sincere.</p>

<p>The two things that the people that will talk to me have in common is that they are women(which is fine-90% of the platonic friends in my life were women) and are roughly half my age: 25 +/- 2 years. Except one who lives in China and is 33, still significantly younger though. I just turned 50 and age gaps really bother me. My daughters are older than most of them but people closer to my age want nothing to do with me. I do look about mid-30's and probably act around that age.</p>

<p>None of those that talk to me are what I would consider serious options for friendship or more. Maybe I am too hung up on age but I am pretty sure my daughters would be upset if I started hanging out with people around their age or a bit younger. What could I have in common with a 25 year old anyway.</p>

<p>The reason I have been alone so long is complicated and a very long story. I got in bad relationships due to low self-esteem and some fairly serious mental issues. I figured it was the best I could do but eventually decided that if that was the best I could do it is not worth it. I still have those issues but am a lot older and I can handle my issues far better. I am not even medicated and have learned to internalize my issues so most can't tell. At my worst, I come off more quiet and withdrawn even though I have a maelstrom in my head. But you wouldn't be able to tell. Even during a psychotic issue my external response is hard to detect.</p>

<p>So I would like to connect now that I am in a better place and my kids have left and loneliness has crept in but apparently it is difficult to interact with anyone appropriate.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I presented my issue competently but any advice for developing personal skills will be greatly appreciated. If something isn't clear or you can think of a way to narrow this mess I will try to answer your questions. I know it is very broad and basically boils down to ""How can I join the human race"" but I guess that is the point I am at right now.</p>

To have issues with a specific person I have to get past my problem in the title. I guess no one can help.</p>

"How to politely tell my roommates that I don't want to spend time with them?","<p><strong>Background Information:</strong></p>

<p>Basically, I don't have enough time. It's an annoying problem that I guess most people share, but it still bothers me. I have so many things I want to do (books to read, stories to write, pictures to draw, games to play, software to develope, languages to learn, tv shows to watch, stuff to read up on, etc.) that I never have time to do them all. A lot of these things I also have to schedule with my friends so that complicates matters even more.</p>

<p>I have games I want to play sooo much but I can't find the time because there are other things I want to do even more. I've been wanting to learn Korean for quite some time now but while I can write and read it, I never had time for it to go beyond that (meaning I don't know what the things I'm writing or reading mean).</p>

<p>Just hanging out talking about stuff seems like such a huge waste of time and I keep thinking about all the things I'd rather do, no matter how much I try not to. I can tolerate it in short bursts (half an hour maximum), but that's about my limit without being bored out of my mind.</p>

<p>The same goes for going out to drink. People always seem confused about that part but going drinking just bores the hell out of me. And then it also wastes a big part of the next day, which makes it even worse. There are just so many better things to do...</p>

<p>I still do it sometimes... I mean... I do give in at some point when people keep asking again and again. When a friend really 'needs' a drink, I won't let him drink alone either. I don't actually have a problem with drinking and I know I also feel good while I'm drunk, so I get why others like it so much, but for me personally, there are just better things to do with my time. </p>

<p>Now so far, I've lived a pretty happy life (and plan on continuing to do so).</p>

<p>I've had a roommate with whom I shared no interests whatsoever. I still liked him and we were on good terms but we never really hung out. Basically: The world was good.</p>

<p><strong>The Situation:</strong></p>

<p>Now we got a new, additional roommate, with her boyfriend.</p>

<p>And they... I don't know... they just seem bored.</p>

<p>They basically only have one hobby, which is great but they can't do it all the time (would be too expensive) and I don't have any interest in that hobby and won't ever even try it because the money it would cost and the time I would have to invest before even being able to try it just don't seem reasonable (they like to drive around on motorcycles and I would have to at the very least get a license to even try that).</p>

<p>So they hang out in our kitchen and my other roommates room a lot. Both of which is fine, I don't even mind the times they are loud. I'm really good at tuning out background noises. </p>

<p>However, they keep trying to rope me into spending time with them. When they hang out with my other roommate, they want me to join them. When they are in the kitchen (which is right next to my room), they keep knocking and asking me questions (really polite and even nice questions, but I'd still prefer them not interrupting me). They cook too much food and invite me to join them (alright, alright, this one isn't actually that much of a problem ;)). They ask me to go shopping with them. And so on. </p>

<p>It's generally all extremely nice of them, but the problem is that spending time with them is boring to me. I really like them. I think they're great people. But I just don't have much in common with them and I keep feeling like I'm just wasting time when I hang out with them.</p>

<p>Although I should mention: We do all like to play board games and we already had a couple of fun evenings with it. I would not want to make that a daily - or even weekly - thing though, especially because unlike me, they really like to drink a lot during those evenings.</p>

<p>They don't share any of my other interests and seem to be completely baffled that I enjoy them so much. They are extremely unlikely to understand that sitting alone in my room reading a book is more appealing to me than - for example - going for a drink with them and I feel like saying it like that will come across very, very wrong. </p>

<p>I do talk to them a couple of times a day (and that part doesn't have to change as far as I'm concerned), always friendly and nice, genuinely interested in what they're saying (I really am) and even when I'm annoyed by them interrupting me or asking me to spend time with them I always remain as polite as possible. I've also never been in a bad mood or just brushing them aside or anything like that when interacting with them.</p>

<p>I know that they already know I'm trying to keep my distance from them, and I also know that it bothers them. I don't know if they think I don't like them or that I'm just being rude or maybe they think I'm too... idk... scared...? to ask to hang out with them but in my heart of hearts really want to...?</p>

<p>Either way, I'd like to sit down with them and try to explain the situation but no matter how I try to phrase it in my mind, it just keeps sounding incredibly rude and unfriendly and I can't imagine them really understanding it, even if I do explain. I would very much like to stay on good terms with them (as I said: I DO like them and I'm still gonna have to live with them after all).</p>

"Responding to people questioning my single status?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I am a computer programmer working as a graduate student under a biochemistry department in a university affiliated hospital. So far I have had a very successful career, having written novel and published data mining algorithms on top of programming hardware for spectrometers. I am also tall (around 6'2"") and fit at around 178 lbs. I don't think I'm particularly attractive (facially), but in the past I have not had a problem finding casual relationships.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>Some people at work (school?) question my single status - particularly the female staff (the biochemistry lab is 50/50 male/female, however the hospital is heavily female dominated) and I am starting to feel that it is impacting my career and reputation. Examples:</p>

<p>A woman (who is married) told me directly that she feels a man who prefers singledom is not ""normal"".</p>

<p>My supervisor (PI) told a female co-worker not to talk to me (she revealed this to me the other day and asked why he would say this).</p>

<p>A woman whose advances I purposely ignored is accusing me of being gay.</p>

<p><strong>Why I'm single</strong></p>

<p>I personally have little to no interest in relationships. I have had a few short term relationships in the past and realized that relationships are not for me.

"How can I help my friend accept that the relationship is over?","<p>After 9 months into the relationship, my early 20's friend just got dumped. She thought he was the one. He'd say things like ""I've never felt this way with anyone before,"" or ""I could see myself being with you for the rest of my life,"" right up until he dropped the bomb on her last week. He did it by explaining to her that he's ""too busy with school right now"" and she's ""the right person, but the wrong time"" and more ""it's not you, it's me"" things.</p>

<p>Now ordinarily I'm good with post breakup comfort. I have the tub of ice cream ready and I'm prepared to listen to her vent and tell me what an asshole he was. But to my utter surprise, that's not at all what happened!!</p>

<p>My friend relies heavily on her intuition, and she's told me multiple times (post-breakup) that she thinks that they were meant to be together and that they'll get back together in the future. Oh boy.</p>

<p>Things are complicated by the fact that they have classes together and their families are close friends so they'll see each other often. I'm worried that this combined with how she feels about the breakup will prevent her from getting closure and healthily moving on.</p>

<p>I've tried to confront her and help her see how douchey the whole situation was to help her move on, but she always takes his side and insists that he's ""always told her the truth, even about things [she] didn't want to hear, so why would he lie now in the breakup?""</p>

"Is it acceptable to order food at a restaurant if the person you are meeting is late?","<p>In the past, I've waited for over an hour, and I spent most of the meal feeling irritated at my friend.

"How to handle someone doing an exercise dangerously wrong?","<p>Important context:</p>

<p>The gym I go to is a powerlifting gym. Not your everyday example when you think of a gym. It's a lot smaller and the people who lift there are typically professional body builders/wrestlers/professional athletes/etc. who warm up with half the plates in the gym. However, the gym is still open to the public, so you get the occasional person who has no idea the first rules of safety in the gym. These people are typically 30s or older, as we don't see that many young people at this gym. The gym is also a 24 hour gym so a lot of the time I lift there is no employee present.</p>

<p>A little about me: I'm one of those rare young people. I don't exactly have the same intimidation factor as most of the other guys there, even if I can lift almost as much as them. Just because I'm not 6'5'' doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about. I have 5 years of professional weight training and 2+ years of teaching new weight lifters how to properly lift.</p>

<p>Here's where my problem comes in. Every once in a while I'll see someone perform an exercise dangerously wrong. If they continue to perform in the same way it will lead to damage that could have been prevented with proper knowledge of how to lift. As a trainer myself, I feel a big urge to try and help this person so they do not get hurt. However, I don't want to be ""that guy"" who goes around the gym thinking he knows everything or come off as rude. I also do not want them to take the correction in a wrong way. Because of the gym, they can get easily offended if you try to correct them because the atmosphere is if you go here, you know what you're doing. Now if someone came up to me and said ""hey, you're not doing this right, try to do it this way..."" I would be very appreciative of the advice. Not everyone is like this, unfortunately. Maybe this wouldn't be such a problem if my expertise was obvious from looking at me, but it's not. </p>

<p>How can I approach someone doing an exercise in such a way it will hurt them, without having them be put off by my offer to help? All the times this has happened in the past I have just ignored it and hope they don't get hurt. I talked to some friends and family about this and they seemed to agree that was the best action to take, but just ignoring it does not feel right. Should I continue to ignore it or is there a way I can help them?</p>

"How to avoid a museum guard when you feel he might endanger you?","<p>Yesterday, I was out with a girl at a fairly large art museum. We were in an ""abstract"" or ""contemporary"" or whatever exhibit (she chose this museum, I usually tend towards science or history museums), in an empty room criticizing a urinal which someone had ripped out of a wall and called art.</p>

<p>One of the guards appeared out of a smaller, adjacent room with very dim lights, and beckoned us over into the dark room. He was kind of scruffy looking, graying hair, and was well overdue for a shave, probably in his fifties or sixties. He said, ""come here I want to show you something"". I believe he also called the girl I was with a ""sir"", which she gets called fairly often because she dresses kind of masculinely.</p>

<p>Anyways, we hesitantly step into his dark room, because we're a little afraid, being two young women (early 20s) confronted by a creepy old man. There's a slit in the wall, and the guard instructs us to look through the slit. I look first, and there's a statue of a woman lying on the ground, full color and completely naked. It looked to me like the statue might have been sexually assaulted. I back away and give her a weird look with my face, and then she takes a turn looking through the slit. The guard then proceeds to try to explain about the artist who made the whole creepy room and how he pretended to retire from art while he made it. I wasn't listening really, because I was managing the space incase he tried to attack me. My date however was nodding along to the guard's lecture about this artist. When he stopped talking, I did my best to dismiss us and leave the room and return to an exhibit with more people in it.</p>

<p>So my question is, should I have handled the situation better? <strong>How could I have politely dismissed us before entering the dark room?</strong> How to excuse us as quickly as possible? </p>

"A server in a restaurant got offended when we addressed him as ""Uncle""","<p>I am from India and my experience is that addressing a serviceman in a restaurant as ""waiter"" is not taken positively. So depending on their age, we usually call them ""brother"" or ""uncle"". A few years back, I was visiting Germany and at one point, I visited an Indian restaurant with a few of my friends. </p>

<p>After we took our table, a friend of mine called a serviceman in the restaurant and asked him for a glass of water. While doing so, he addressed the serviceman as ""Uncle"" and at that point, the guy got extremely offended and replied, ""I am not your uncle"". This was shocking for us and we apologized. However, after that, we discussed this issue and found that each one of us thought that calling him ""Uncle"" shouldn't be offensive at all since he was anyway quite elderly for us. </p>

<p>Is this correct or we were wrong in thinking so? How should one address servicemen/servicewomen in the restaurant in a proper way? </p>

"How can I tell a friend to bring something I actually enjoy eating if they will bring something anyway?","<p>My boyfriend's brother-in-law (Bob) visits my boyfriend from time to time. Because he owns a bakery he always brings us a bag full of goodies. The bag almost always includes the following :a traditional sweet bread that I'm afraid I don't like at all,  a very generic chocolate cake, and either cookies or a second kind of cake. </p>

<p>Don't take it the wrong way, I do think this is a really kind gesture and I shouldn't be complaining but I don't really want to eat them. I am trying to limit eating sweets, I still eat chocolate from time to time, but when I ask my boyfriend if he will eat the bread and cake, the answer is ""I don't know"" or ""Perhaps"". I'm really tired of decorating my table with cakes and breads in wrappers or basically being the one throwing them away because they have gone stale. And then the conversation is pretty much the same every time: </p>

<p>Me (baked stuff in my hands): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey babe, I'm throwing these away, they've gone stale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boyfriend : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess, yeah...</p>

<p>I don't want to hurt Bob's feelings and I don't want to sound rude so how can I politely tell Bob that while I appreciate the gesture, I avoid foods that contain sugar? He's always so happy to bring us the same stuff over and over again, and I hate to ruin the mood. 
Alternatively, is it weird to ask for something else from the bakery that doesn't contain sugar instead, and how? </p>

<p>What I have tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have told Bob that he <strong>really</strong> doesn't need to bring anything</li>
<li>I have hinted in the past that I bake my own bread and I avoid refined carbohydrates but I guess Bob doesn't get the message. </li>
<li>I have asked my boyfriend if I can throw them away or donate them, but the response is usually, ""Leave them. I might have some at some point"" (and that point usually comes when I unwrap them and have some first, which isn't good for me). </li>

But I don't have any intention to ignore the recommendation and I just can't read it as I immediately lose my concentration during reading, and when I tried it again, I already forgot about the content I had read so I started to read it again from the top of the article, then lose my concentration again, and the same repeats endlessly.</p>

<p>These people don't understand that some people are rather incompetent at reading than others, which is particularly common among ADHD and RD.</p>

<p>Also, it depends on each article and I could read some articles without any problem. It is not just about the length of the article but also the easiness to read, the way the author writes, and the interest I have in the field, etc... </p>

<p>I hate making and taking phone calls. Whenever I have to use one, I become flustered and anxious.

"How to deal with a dangerous, developmentally disabled person I can not avoid?","<p>On my way to work, I cannot help but encountering a developmentally disabled person who harasses me and other women. How can I deal with him?</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have been taking the same train to work each day for about 2 years now. A developmentally disabled person has to take the same train to get to this special workplace for developmentally disabled people. He has a habit of harassing the girls/young women at the platform and in the train.</p>

<p>The first time I took this train, I was 'the new face' and so he immediately jumped on me. He used a slightly impolite greeting (one usually reserved for best friends here in the Netherlands), and started asking questions like where are you going, what are you doing. I told him where I was going was none of his business, that I prefer to not disclose that information to people I do not know. He started getting aggressive, telling me I was mean to him only because of his developmental disability, and calling me names. Luckily, by that time another male commuter had arrived that I know a bit from church, and he warned the man that he should leave me alone. </p>

<p>After that, this man started coming up to me every single morning, (just like he does with all the other girls/women at the station) using the impolite greeting. I decided to ignore him, so it has been the same every morning since: coming up to me, saying the impolite greeting, standing in front of me for a while and shuffling on.</p>

<h3>Tried</h3>

<p>I am including some of the things I have tried already below, I am looking for new ways to deal with this problem. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tried putting on big headphones and standing close to the platform so he had to cross behind me, but he still kept going at it, only now standing behind me. That scares me even more because he can be so aggressive. </p></li>
<li><p>I once tried reacting with the correct and polite form of greeting, but a situation much like the one described above occurred: he started asking personal questions, became aggressive and had to be sent away by another male commuter. </p></li>
<li><p>He also scared me really badly one morning when I was walking to the station, by blocking my way and impolitely greeting me. I had to walk through somebody else's garden and I ran the last bit to the train station. I called my parents. My parents have spoken to his parents (this man is known in my village for how he behaves towards girls/women), and apparently his behaviour has already improved from what it was, apparently he now walks on when ignored, instead of also becoming aggressive when not getting attention. </p></li>
<li><p>In the Netherlands there are special compartments in trains where everybody has to be absolutely silent (no talking, no whispering, no answering your phone etcetera). When he enters these train compartments and sees a girl, he just starts talking. We have had to go and fetch railway personnel regularly, because he gets very aggressive when being told he is in the special compartment and has to be quiet. But because of his behaviour almost all women/girls travel in this silent compartment, to avoid encountering him elsewhere in the train, and this makes him come into these compartments more regularly because it's where the girls/women are.  </p></li>
<li><p>I can not take another train, because of office hours. </p></li>
<li><p>I can generally not avoid him at the train station, since I use the walk to/from the station as my daily exercise, this means I am almost always there before he arrives. </p></li>
<li><p>He seems too developmentally disabled to understand replies like 'not interested' or 'no' to his impolite greetings. He just looks at you really confused, and either walks on to harass you in the same way the next morning (best case scenario), or sees them as a conversation starter and starts asking the personal questions until a male tells him to leave me/other women/girl alone. </p></li>
<li><p>He gets very aggressive towards women, but will listen to men when they tell him to leave us alone. I do not like being dependent on strange men for my own safety. </p></li>
<li><p>I once discussed this with somebody that is an officer, and calling the police is not an option, since what he is doing is not unlawful here in the Netherlands, and because of his developmentally disability he can not be held accountable.</p></li>
<li><p>Ignoring this person makes me feel really bad about myself, because he can not help that he is developmentally disabled and unable to learn proper manners.  </p></li>
<li><p>Giving him attention that is not the kind of attention that he wants makes him mad and dangerous. And when I give him attention and I know it is not what he wants, this also makes me feel like I am the bad girl. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have tried several ways of dealing with this person, but they either have no effect, or they leave me feeling bad about myself / being scared because of his reaction. How can I deal with him better?</strong></p>

<p>We both have an own house in different cities, but most of the time we are together in one of the houses. This weekend I had to sleep somewhere else for one night. When I left, Alice was still at my home. She doesn’t like it when she is there all by her own and I totally understand that. So I ask her why she didn’t go to a friend’s house or her parents who live fairly close to my house. She liked that idea but she didn’t have a lot of money. For me, money is not really a problem so I wanted to give her some money for the train and buses. The only thing she had to do is send me some info so I could transfer some money to her public transport card. She agreed to this plan and she would send me the information.</p>

<p>I never got the info and because of this, I though she had a solution on her own. I didn’t talk to her that day but we contacted each other with some messages and nothing sounded off. When I contacted her today, she sounded a little bit angry and asked me why I never ask her about the info. I told her that I was waiting on her message and thought she had found a solution on her own. I was very busy with things so my mind wasn’t on this problem. We also agreed that she will send me the info and told her this on the phone.</p>

<p>She was still not happy and didn’t understand why I didn’t ask her about it. The reason behind this is that she doesn’t like to ask for money and she didn’t know what info she had to send me.</p>

<p>How I see it, is that she had to do the first step. She has a problem and not me. I see a simple solution for her to fix this problem. Just called me on the end of the day and asked how my day was and just remind me that she was travelling that evening to her parents. </p>

<p>How can I make it clear to her that the only thing she had to do was contact me and reminded me?</p>

<p>Also I want to ask how I can make it clear that she can always ask money if she needs it? I think this is the big problem for her because of her pride (this is a assumption) as in the past I have borrowed money from her and this was never a problem. </p>

"How can I use a cell phone at work for work purposes without appearing to be slacking off?","<p>Where I work, it is frequently mentioned by both co-workers and managers that many people find it rude when staff use cell phones while on duty because it is seen as attending to personal items while on company time. I frequently find myself in situations where I must take notes, file online reports, and consult online records while ""in the field"" or while in another facility (where I do not have easy access to a desktop or laptop computer). I usually use a smartphone for this purpose but am concerned about how this is seen. Under these circumstances (frequent travel away from a ""home base""), carrying a tablet or laptop computer is impractical but not altogether impossible.</p>

<p>How can this be resolved? Would it be better to explain to others around me that I need a few minutes with my phone to check the status of the BQR Pipeline and submit a High-Priority Form 10-E or would it be better to carry and use a tablet or laptop anyway in order to be perceived as someone who is really ""working"" rather than texting friends and playing games? It is sometimes possible to delay online work until I am alone but sometimes it is not, either because the online work is high priority or because management has imposed a deadline to complete it.</p>

<p>If it is relevant, this is in the USA. I am specifically interested in the interpersonal aspects of this situation as it relates to workplace social skills rather than any specific issue of workplace policy.</p>

<p>The obvious options I see are:</p>

<p>1) Just use the cell phone and don't attempt to explain anything unless I am specifically confronted by co-workers or management (e.g. ""So, how many Pokemon did you catch today while you were on the clock?""). The obvious downside to this is that I could be damaging workplace social relationships even while getting all of my work done.</p>

<p>2) Explain to others why I need to use a cell phone.</p>

<p>3) Get a tablet or laptop and carry it around under the understanding that the benefits of being seen as working hard outweigh the burden of carrying it.</p>

<p>4) Push back on management and attempt to get policies or procedures changed so that I can take notes by hand and access online systems on a less frequent basis (e.g. at the end of the day).</p>

It's usually nothing extremely expensive, a couple of pizzas and sodas or kebabs with fries and sodas.  </p>

  tomorrow</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You guys mind if we don't join you tonight? We're just going to eat
  the food we just made, maybe next time.</p>

<li>How can I politely tell my friends I can't afford to order food or decline being treated even when my friends insist on paying for me and my boyfriend without ruining the mood of the evening, and without sounding miserable? (I worry that our friends will eventually stop visiting if we don't order food with them or fail to reciprocate). </li>

"What should I do in a situation where a friend is completely different depending on if we are alone or with other friends?","<p>I have a friend, whom I have known since we were both in 2nd grade (I am in 11th grade now). She has a different set of behaviours for different people. For example, when she's around the people she wants to be friends with, she tries to stay away from people whom she thinks her friends consider 'un-cool', but when she's alone with the same people, she behaves completely differently with them, almost as if they suddenly became useful to her.</p>

<p>This friend of mine has been helpful at the best of times, and is uncannily smart, due to which I have often needed her help in the past. However, her behaviour has led me to feel that it is not worth being friends with a person who doesn't consider me an equal individual, as I fall into the category of the people who she thinks that her friends consider 'un-cool'.</p>

<p>Should I:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remain friends with her, as I often need her help, and since I've known her for a long time?</li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Stop being friends, and make it clear that I don't like her behaviour towards me?</li>
</ol>

<p>We have been friends for a long time, and I truly mean friends, not just acquantainces. She is a truly nice person to her friends, and was one of the nicest people I ever met, but I guess I don't fit into that category anymore, as she has changed with time. When we're together without her other friends, I see her old-self sometimes, and then when her friends come in, she immediately changes. I live in India, and so does she. </p>

<p>I'm asking for a general piece of advice on situations like this. Should one put an old friendship before a person's rude behaviour, or should only the present condition be considered?</p>

"How to deflect ""How much does it cost"" questions?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Sometimes I get asked what my belongings cost, be it an ordered food, PC, or other stuff. In the university I study, there is extreme contrast in how much students and their parents make annually between students. As a result, from time to time I get into awkward situation where the food is not expensive for me, but others try to claim the opposite. I might not call over anyone into my room, but since I live in a dormitory, I cannot pass by unnoticed by my familiars when ordering food, and deliverers cannot get right to the door of my room. I live with a person who doesn't care much about anything. The distance between fences where the deliverer waits for me (as they are not allowed to get in) is quite long, so meeting someone I know is guaranteed and ordering food considered quite expensive in the dorms.</p>

<p>I live in middle Asia. I'm concerned with their thoughts because they might start generating attention to me, which is of very big concern to me. I live a life between my room and university, spending time on research and other stuff. Getting more attention usually means spending time on dealing with others.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How do I deflect or avoid questions like ""How much does it cost""?</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p><em>I'm going to my room with a package of food.</em></p>

<p><em>Familiar:</em> Hey! </p>

<p><em>Some entry talk</em></p>

<p><em>Familiar:</em> That food smells delicious! How much does it cost?</p>

<p><em>I make up something depending on the person asking</em> // *</p>

<p><em>Familiar:</em> Oh, that's expensive! <em>//I made incorrect guess</em></p>

<p>What should I tell on the line marked with '*'? I can keep making up numbers, but I'm sure one day they'll figure out I'm not being honest.</p>

<h2>What I've tried</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>rucksack</p>

<p>My best bet is carrying a rucksack with me. Unfortunately, sometimes I order a pizza, sometimes deliverer gets soup spilled all over package, so it is not always an option.</p></li>
<li><p>headphones</p>

<p>I may pretend that I don't hear them, but pretending that I don't see them would be blunt lie.</p></li>

"How to handle my girlfriend's parents' attitude to asking her for money?","<p>I'm asking this question on behalf of my girlfriend because she's asking me for help but I'm not sure on how to handle this situation.</p>

<p><strong>A little bit of background:</strong></p>

<p>My girlfriend's parents moved from south of the country and came here in the north for reasons of work. Her mom is a housewife (Let's call her Alice) so the only income is from her dad (Let's call him Bob).</p>

<p>They have 3 children (Jhon - 30 years old, Barb - 28 years old and my GF who is 18 years old).</p>

<p>Now, Jhon and Barb moved with their partners, so the family atmosphere is composed only of my GF and her parents.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>

<p>Every time one of their children started working, Bob and Alice saw them as a money cow.. and started milking them.</p>

<p>Literally, every time the monthly salary of one of their children arrived, they took a significant part of it.*</p>

<p>*By took I mean that they asked her to give them the money they asked for without accepting a ""No"" as answer, thus taking them.
If she says a flat no, things will get only worse.</p>

<p>Jhon and Barb moved with their respective partners so early because they were tired and frustrated with this attitude.</p>

<p>Now it's my GF's turn: she's only 18 yet she works during the day and goes to school in the evening. 
She's doing the best that she can to build up her future, but we all know what can be done with little to no money.</p>

<p>She had to pay the school for herself, she's trying to save some money to get herself a driving license and so on. Whatever she needs, she has to buy it.</p>

<p>While she understands that Bob and Alice need help every month, she is really frustrated that they ask her more than half of her salary every month, and when she denies something, her parents turn to aggressive and she is judged as the daughter who doesn't understand and doesn't want to help her family.</p>

<p>To make things worse, Bob and Alice start to waste money in dumb thing when she helps: They start to go to the restaurant frequently, they buy silly things ( they just got an access point for their home.. 70 square meters. ) and so on.</p>

<p>The only way she found to save some money is to take her money from her bank account and give them to me, so she can't be forced to lend money (since she doesn't have them).</p>

<p>While I'm sure Bob and Alice are nice people, I find this attitude dreadfully wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong></p>

<p>What can my girlfriend do/say to set some boundaries and avoid any repercussions and negative emotions?
More specifically, she wants to help but how can she handle them and make them understand that she can help up to a given limit?</p>

<p>Since she doesn't own any car or driving license, she is still dependent on her dad (the only one with a driving license).</p>

<p><strong>What's been tried:</strong></p>

<p>She already tried to tell them that she needs some money for herself and that it's frustrating working to have nothing in return.</p>

<p>Her brother, Jhon, tried to tell them not to milk her as they did to him.</p>

<p>None of the above helped.</p>

<p><strong>Answers to comments:</strong></p>

<p>@Tinkeringbell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does your girlfriend get in return for the payments she makes to
     her parents (folded laundry, meals, internet, tv, space)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She gets folded laundry since her mother is a housewife.
She sometimes has to pay for meals because they borrow her money to do the shopping at the supermarket.
She rarely is at home so internet is almost meaningless, but she gets it.
She gets TV for sure.
She gets space, yes, but if she needs to study, she has to go to the library because her parents are too noisy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If she compares it to living on her own, is it more or less expensive
     to stay with the parents?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be less expensive, in fact, we already plan to move together but we need a solid base. (She needs the driving license and a car/moped/scooter plus some spare money to rent the apartment.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the amount she pays a set thing, that was agreed upon beforehand?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It varies based on how much they ask her, but it's rarely less than half of her salary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the cultural background of your girlfriend's parents, of your
     girlfriend and you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, I live alone and I'm 21 and I like being independent so I planned my life with that in mind.
She would also like to move and come live with me to gain independence, but money is a mountain to climb.
She chose a night school just to be able to work during the day (she actually sleeps 6 hours every night during the week to maintain both things).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, do you have any more information on how your girlfriend tried
     to tell her parents she wanted more money for her own, how did that
     conversation go?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have much information, but I know that it was never a peaceful conversation. It was more of an argument every time rather than a calm discussion.</p>

"What small talk questions can I ask when I'm mostly interested in the motivations of people?","<p>I'm not very good at small talk, even though I have improved quite a bit. My mother once said it's because I'm not interested in most of the topics that small talk brings up. But then I guess many small talk topics are politeness and not true interest. Anyways, I sat down and wondered <em>what I am interested in regarding people</em>. I'm an artist and storyteller so I noticed I usually hope the other person has a story to tell when I ask them a question. I'm also a lot more interested in why people do things rather than what they do.</p>

<p>One tactic I've come up with is asking what job someone has, and then following up that question with ""How did it come to that?"" which in 50% of the cases results in a story. (However, there are many people who chose their path randomly and seem to be without real aspiration and then I'm kind of lost.)</p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions for other small talk questions that are not too personal but still focus on motivations and aspirations?</p>

<p>(Note that I won't be able to check this post until tomorrow, so I won't be able to answer questions immediately)</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I'm talking about one time encounters with longer talks, for example in Germany you can share a group ticket for the train with strangers to save money and you'll end up conversing for an hour. Uber driving might be similar. Or at events such as weddings where you talk to aquaintances of the couple that you will likely not see in years, so essentially also a one-time encounter with extended smalltalk.</p>

<p>Update 2:</p>

<p>I'm also considering a case where a conversation has been established where my example question works.</p>

"How can I respond to ""It's because I'm <historically oppressed quality>"" as a rebuttal to a request?","<p>Occasionally I hear or encounter ""it's because I'm &lt;historically oppressed quality&gt;"" as a response to an objectionable request to the claimant. The claimant is usually a minor who in my experience is 1.) Not very respectful in general and 2.) Not old enough to really remember when requests/demands <em>typically were because they were &lt;quality&gt;</em> as a primary reason. They are using this tactic because they apparently have no reasonable response to the request, but don't want to comply or want to be contrary.</p>

<p>At this point, in the claimant has derailed the conversation past the point of the request, and any negative thing said to the claimant will be because they are &lt;quality&gt;, with no regard to what was going on. Ex: If I ask the neighbor kids to turn down their music, it's no longer about the fact that the music is disruptive to both my sanity and my windows, it's now about their &lt;quality&gt;. How can I respond to this claim while still maintaining composure and the upper hand?</p>

<p><strong>Edit in response to @Catija with the reason I'm asking:</strong> Yesterday I asked my the teenaged children of my neighbor, who are black (I am white), to turn down their garage stereo in the evening (they use the garage as a recreational area). They turned it down, but soon after the request they turned it back up again. I returned slightly more irritated and reminded them not everyone was on summer break, to which they responded ""It's because we're black isn't it"". This is in Kansas. At this point I felt like I had no possible response.</p>

<p>At the same time, I've also heard (in the same vein) ""it's because I'm a woman"" and ""you're doing this because I'm gay"". I could easily extrapolate this behavior to any given minority group.</p>

<p>Edit 2: While I understand and appreciate @Passerbyes challenge to the frame of the question (What if I were the problem?), this question works much better if it is read in good faith that I acted based on racially-agnostic motivations.</p>

"How to temper conflict in close relationships","<p>I was reading some of the answers to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/499/why-the-closer-the-relationship-is-the-worse-conflict-we-experience/"">this question</a> and it got me to thinking.  I can't control another person's reaction to me, but I can perhaps temper my own approach when dealing with conflict.  Knowing why conflicts arise, perhaps I can prevent them from occurring as much or can contribute to reducing their intensity.</p>

<p>In particular, the answer regarding those being closer to us presenting more of a threat seem to ring particularly true.  Can I manage my differences with those closer to me so that I seem less like a threat so as to reduce the amount of stress the other person feels and minimize the amount of actual conflict felt without discounting my own perspective in the matter?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The opinion or actions of a parent, a child, or a spouse feels so personal that it borders on the existential. If my dad is angry at me, this becomes a central, visceral threat. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, would finding a different, non-threatening expression of anger (is there such a thing) work?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If my kid is failing at social studies, this becomes a reflection upon me as a parent. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I was the kid in this situation, how could I possibly deflect this reflection?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If my spouse disagrees with me on how to spend our collective budget, this impinges on my way of life and on my central priorities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I was the spouse, how would I disagree without making it feel like an attack on the other's way of life or their priorities?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The closer another person is to you, the more they seem like a fun house mirror image, and the more even the smallest differences can feel like an attack on your very being.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of these examples seem to have in common that it is the closeness of the relationship that greatly amplifies what are really small differences and increases conflict. Is there any way to nullify or reduce this effect? As an optimistic person I can't accept the idea that this is just the way it has to be.</p>

<p>I'd like to befriend a coworker with similar hobbies and values but I'm afraid I'd either sound awkward or flirty. How can I make him understand I'd like to become friends?</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I've been working in the same company for 9 months now. There's a coworker I met around the time I started that I recently got to know better after attending a programming boot camp he organized. There were 6 of us at the camp and we learned quite a bit about each other during our lunch breaks, where the atmosphere was more relaxed.</p>

<p>I'd like to befriend this coworker, but there are two main issues that prevent me from doing it quite naturally:</p>

<ul>
<li>He's a divorced man who's almost 20 years older than me and as I'm a very sociable woman. I'm afraid my sympathy would come across as flirting with him, and I really don't want that. </li>
<li>I don't have many friends anymore, most of them left after graduation and I want to make new friends. It's been a while since I last befriended someone and I suspect that coming to see him and saying ""Hey! You seem nice. Let's be friends!"" may not work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I tried so far</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I invited him to have lunch together at work. I accompanied him to buy some food and we came back to the office and ate with two other colleagues who extemporaneously joined us. I told him afterwards that I spent a nice time and he answered saying we could do it again on the days where he's free. This happened very recently so we haven't had lunch together again since.</p></li>
<li><p>Although this is not primarily driven by my will of befriending him, I send emails or come to see him whenever I'm stuck with an issue related to the language he organizes boot camps about. This gives me the occasion of asking him how he's doing, and he doesn't seem bothered by the question.</p></li>

<p>Now, although I didn't know <em>quite</em> where my car was parked, I was certain it wasn't in that direction. I had no idea how to tell the employee that, though.

<p>However, I've been in similar situations where I don't have an out like that. Where my choices are to deliberately go against their advice right in front of them, or waste my time pretending to follow it. It's even more awkward when I've asked the person for advice.</p>

"How to suggest someone to find a hobby without offending them?","<p>As for the topic, if possible I'd be grateful for general answer and more specific one regarding following situation:</p>

<p>My girlfriend has a clinically diagnosed depression (she attends visits with psychiatrist and is taking medications). Because of that she often has very bad mood (nowadays it's less common thankfully). I am always trying to figure out some ways to help her, generally when we are spending time together she feels alright. But except for her free time with me she is studying hard to get her college degree and has a part-time job which are both very stressful for her. </p>

<p>Sometimes when she is in a bad mood she tells me she wishes I were next to her (we live in different cities and usually see each other on the weekends only), and that she feels terrible when she is alone - when I hear it over and over again makes me feel as if I were entirely responsible for her happiness. Obviously I know that her depression has a huge impact here and I care about her a lot and want her to be happy, but I want her to be happy not only when I am with her but also when she is alone, so once when we were hanging out I suggested her to find some hobby. I thought if she had some passion like art or whatever else, maybe she could forget about her bad mood for a while. I told her something between the lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: You are only attending classes, working, and when you're back home you're studying. Have you thought about finding some hobby?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of my poor word choice she took it as if I were telling her that she is boring. I immediately corrected myself and explained what I meant and she said it's ok and that she understands what I meant.</p>

<p>Fast forward few weeks, she was in a very bad mood again and said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her: I know you think I am boring and that I don't have any hobby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously despite her telling me it was fine she took it to herself and I felt very bad about that because that was totally not what I wanted her to think. </p>

<p>Is there something I could do to fix that? I don't think that talking would work, but maybe I'm wrong. From time to time I'm trying to do some new stuff with her hoping she will like it (programming, learning foreign language), but even if she enjoys it in a moment it's nothing she would like to do regularly.
Can I somehow encourage her to try out new things on her own / look for some activity she enjoys doing regularly? (I'm aware that in case of depression that's not an ultimate solution if any at all)</p>

<p>And in more general case, how could I tell that to anybody (to find a hobby), without implying that they are boring?</p>

This year, though, I wanted to invite my friends out somewhere, perhaps <a href=""https://topgolf.com/us/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Topgolf</a> <sup>[1]</sup> (not an advertisement, trying to give impression of price/scale).</p>

<p>Is it in keeping with etiquette that I just pay for the party? Or can I ask everyone to contribute their share?</p>

<p>If it matters, I don't expect any gifts. If I were in that position, I would plan on paying for myself if not also the birthday-person.</p>

<p>[1]: Pricing is $25-45 an hour for up to six people, depending on time of day. It would be less than six people for at most two hours.</p>

"How to deal with an annoying front passenger?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p><sub>Don't be surprised at the use of the plural here. I'm talking about two different people displaying the same behaviour and sharing other characteristics. However, each time only one of them is present - so we are alone in that car.</sub></p>

<p>My front passengers are closely related to me, and much older. They got their driver's licenses before I was even born, so they are much more experienced. I got it a few years ago, and I know the rules better than them. But they are careful drivers and are never involved in accidents.</p>

<p>I also drive carefully, trying to minimize risks - neither driving riskily (too fast), nor inducing risky behaviour in others (driving too slow), but in accordance with the situation and the rules. Imagine me as someone who just got his driver's license and still follows all rules (and knows them by heart), but with more experience and routine. For sure, I do still lack experience and so I dislike distractions.</p>

<p>My front passengers do not fully trust me yet or try to show off their greater knowledge and routine. I am more than glad if people give me helpful advice, but this is not what this question is about.</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>When I'm the driver, they sometimes start to meddle with my driving, e. g. start pointless discussions about what rule I just violated or which turn I should take - reminder: That's when I am right! They already even tried to fumble with the appliances around the driver's seat.</p>

<p>A more specific instance: I'm taking my close elder relative, ""Mallory"", somewhere. After driving for some time, a conversation like this ensues</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mallory: You didn't need to blink.</p>
  
  <p>Me: I did.</p>
  
  <p>Mallory: No, not on this kind of road.</p>
  
  <p>Me: (<em>wondering about that totally strange suggestion</em>)</p>
  
  <p>Mallory: I got my driver's license before you were even born. On such roads ... <em>bizarre explanation follows</em></p>
  
  <p>Me: Could we discuss this later?</p>
  
  <p>Mallory: <em>Didn't hear what I was saying.</em> You understand?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Mallory, please stop it. You are distracting me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mallory, after some attempts, allowed that discussion to die down. At our destination, she was proven wrong.</p>

<p>This is just one example of such pointless discussions people try to draw me into. I'm a bit afraid of them, as driving a car demands a lot of concentration on my part. Yet, they seem to take my (relative) inexperience only as a means to score a point in some discussion.</p>

<p>Such pointless discussions are annoying and distracting, even if they are shorter. Even if Mallory had been correct, there was no point in discussing it at that very moment.</p>

<p>Now, this is a real distraction for me. I want to concentrate on driving the car and safely bring us to our destination. Pointless discussions don't drive us forward.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>What are effective ways to deal with a front passenger, who distracts and annoys you?</strong></p>

<p>I hope for experiences preferably polite ways to shut them down. So maybe think of family members, partners, good friends etc. on the front passenger's seat. I don't want to throw them out of the car!</p>

"How should I address scheduling phone or video calls with my long distance girlfriend?","<p>Currently, I live about 10 miles outside Cambridge, UK. My girlfriend lives a similar distance away, but in the opposite direction. A journey to visit her is about 2 hours via public transport, which often we split by each traveling for 1 hour. We don't see each other daily but we do see each other multiple times each week. We've been dating for a month and have been best friends for almost eight months.</p>

<p>In a week I am leaving to go to university, in Nottingham, UK. This is around 100 miles from her, and this is a 4 hour journey by public transport.</p>

<p>This increased time and cost is going to significantly reduce the frequency with which we will physically be together.</p>

<p>I want to continue this relationship a great deal, but I have never experienced a long distance relationship.</p>

<p>When we decided to start dating, we did discuss that we will need to make long distance work, but not how. We have agreed that we will phone often, but not spoken as to whether we want a schedule. I was hoping answers to this question would inform me a little before we sat down to discuss! We will text when we can - that goes without saying. My concern is that if we go for a month without seeing each other and we continue as we are without a schedule it will break down.</p>

<p>How can we ensure regular communication <em>between</em> our less frequent in-person visits? Should we have a schedule where we phone every evening on specified days, or should we aim to communicate more spontaneously? I’m concerned that if we have a schedule it will become a chore, but if we don’t have one we will slowly stop bothering.</p>

<p>Is there a third option?</p>

"Can my sister convey to her womanizer boss by her body language and general behavior that she is not 'available' for an 'office romance'?","<p>My sister recently accepted a high-paying job offer as office administrator in a local firm in our hometown in India, run by a divorced middle aged financial consultant. She is due to join next week but has now been informed by very reliable parties with direct experience that this person, her future boss, is a habitual womanizer who makes subtle advances upon female employees to start an 'office romance' (euphemism for an illicit affair.)</p>

<p>My sister doesn't need the money but says that <em>any</em> future boss could be a womanizer we don't know of, and does not want to give up the job just for that reason. However she feels that <strong><em>if</em></strong> the boss makes an improper advance and she rejects it (even gently yet firmly) it could poison the atmosphere at the workplace. Although the person might possibly tolerate her firm but gentle rejection of his proposition, she would surely lose the job as a result, or else feel obliged to resign.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong>: She is determined not to accept any proposition from him for an illicit liaison even if she loses the job as a result. How can she convey her unwillingness even before he thinks of making the typical 'romantic' overture?  Actually talking about it with the boss is culturally impossible and would be considered a great insult here in the entire South Asian region, so her goal is to proactively prevent any such proposal by making it clear by her <strong><em>body language and general behavior</em></strong> that she is not 'available' even though she is an unmarried young person. </p>

<p>Is this even possible to convey through body language and general behavior and if so, how can she achieve this aim?</p>

<p>Note: these advances by the boss may very possibly be construed as sexual harassment at the workplace but she has no direct experience or evidence of it at this point and filing a complaint after rejecting an improper proposition is <em>not</em> my sister's goal here. She is not going to be a member of Stack Exchange at present but she will read the answers posted. I am familiar enough  with the details to make any necessary clarifications. The interpersonal talent of our members is urgently needed here!</p>

"Answering ""how did you make this dish"" questions","<p>I love cooking. I especially enjoy making complex dishes that require days of preparation and hours over the stove. Nothing that requires a Michelin Star chef, but it does require time, patience and sometimes specific tools.</p>

<p>From time to time, I bring dishes I made to friends or my office. Almost every time, I get asked how I made the dish, and almost every time, the person who asks seems disappointing from my answer. Some answers I tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>Give the full recipe (people seem disinterested after the 10th
stage...)</li>
<li>Give a general ingredients list (people think I hide stuff from them, so they either say a disappointed ""oh..."" or ask for the full recipe, and then we're back to #1)</li>
<li>Say it's a bit complicated (people think I'm condescending, which I'm truly not, I just don't want a #1 scenario)</li>
<li>Joke about it (e.g. for a homemade ice cream: ""Oh, you know, just a lot of fat and sugar, and then some more fat and more sugar"" - again, they're not satisfied from the answer)</li>
<li>Ask ""do you <em>really</em> want to know?"" (to which the answer is always ""yes"", because that's the polite answer, and now we're back at square one)</li>
</ol>

<p>I get that there are many reasons to ask ""how did you make this dish"": being polite, acknowledging my effort, genuinely being interested, etc. but it seems like no matter the reason for asking, or the way I answer, the people who ask always seem disappointed of my answer.</p>

"Abused by my maternal uncle","<p>When I was a child, around 10, the brother of my mother sexually abused me several times, he was around 25 to 30 then, it wasn't penetrating but more than fondling, related with ejaculation, his genitals were involved. At that time I didn't know what is happening, later on, when I realized that situation it kept haunting me, I didn't have the strength to tell my mother, but now I have got the courage to do something about it.</p>

<p>My elder sister came to know about this when one sister of my mother yelled about it while not in her senses due to some mental illness, my sister asked the other sister of my mother and she confirmed it and according to my sister, the aunt sounded like supporting her brother. My sister didn't tell my mother, my mother came to know about it after more than 10 years. </p>

<p>I belong to a community where rape is no doubt a crime of highest degree, but exposing rape of a woman punishes the victim as well. the community humiliates her, mocks her and it gets difficult for her to get married. Police are well known for being corrupt and they exploit the situation. And I am sure this is why my mother and sister couldn't do anything about it, they wanted me to forget about it, get married and live a happy life.</p>

<p><strong>My question is how should I deal with this situation?</strong></p>

<p>As I said the Police is corrupt so it is for sure that I am not going to take any legal actions. Other options are </p>

<ol>
<li>Forget about it.</li>
<li>Expose my uncle by telling it to everyone else. I am sure I and my

will have to face the humiliation.</li>
<li>Boycott him (ultimately the news will get spread and point # 2 will happen)</li>
<li>Talk to my uncle, tell him to sorry in presence of everyone else
who knows about it. (What if he doesn't agree?)</li>
<li>Tell my family and get every single child of my family protected

"How to response to double standards elder relatives/acquaintance about my saving for a new PC without looking like an arrogant/disrespectful person?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I've been saving for new PC for a while and should be enough in a couple of months, soon be building it. The PC's components have already been chosen and should be working for both my job and my gaming hobby.  </p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>Once in a while, some relatives or my parents's acquaintance heard about my saving through my parents and would ask about what I'm going to do with it in a conversation. When I said that I was saving for new PC they respond with something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That sound like a waste, you should spend it for traveling, get yourself some experience, you're still young.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can get a new motorbike with the same amount of money</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I maintain my bike very often, still in good condition)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why would you waste so much money just for games? Why don't you save it and treat us sometimes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I still hold small parties for my birthday and invite them...)</p>

<p>I usually respond with something like it's not just for games but for my work too, I'm not spending all my saving for it (about 50%-60%) or sometimes when the conversation getting heated I just keep silent. </p>

<p>While I understand the importance of saving and won't spend all of it for my PC, some of these still irritated me and kind of angry when someone's hobby like traveling, party,.. is better than my gaming hobby. I do appreciate the thoughtfulness of elders/former generation for me about saving for the future. That's why I always avoid response with something sound arrogant like: ""It's my saving/hobby/you won't understand.""  </p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How to response to double standards elder relatives/acquaintance about my saving for a new PC without looking like an arrogant/disrespectful person?</p>

<h1>Goal</h1>

<p>I wanna help them understand that this PC is necessary for my work and maybe also understand gaming is my hobby and should be treated like any other hobbies.   </p>

"How can I rebuild trust with my girlfriend while still hanging out with a friend?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I have been with my girlfriend for 5,5 years by now. We love each other, it was a really great time, but not without downs of course. And one of that downs happened 8 months ago. I think I had some kind of depression back then. I was unable to feel anything, nothing cheered me up, I started giving up on everything - college, training and most importantly - my relationship. On one of the parties I participated, I drunk too much and did something stupid - (almost) kissed with a friend of mine (that was barely a stub, but it happened). Didn't tell about this to my girlfriend. Then I lied to her for 3 or 4 times that I am out somewhere but in reality I went to meet that friend. And that was the problem - I did lie and did not tell everything (she found out it when she read my messages I sent my friend when I left my phone home - I don't blame her for it, it happened only once).</p>

<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>At that party, it could have been anyone. Unfortunately, it hit on my friend. Now keeping in touch with that friend is not welcome (which seems somehow reasonable). But my girlfriend does not trust me in whole (at least not as much as before). Now I have nobody (except my girlfriend of course) I can truly talk to.</p>

<h1>What I want to achieve?</h1>

<p>I want to rebuild trust in me. Convince my girlfriend that all of that is past now. Explain that the reason I did those bad things was not that friend herself, but whole the situation I was in. Finally, I would like to be able to meet my friend freely.</p>

"Is it mistaken to express feelings clearly and fully in an email?","<p>The easiest way to explain what precisely I'm asking is by quoting an email (minor edits) written to me by a well-meaning person with whom I was discussing a relationships issue. To help ensure that I managed to fully convey how I was feeling (very important to me to be fully understood/not misunderstood), I preferred using emails to communicate, so that I could fully process my feelings and make sure the full picture is conveyed; with oral communication I found you often end up not being able to ‘finish the thought’, especially with more complex feelings, or to express all the feelings which can come bubbling up. Here's what they wrote:</p>

<p>[emphasis added]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to draw your attention to a little point that perhaps will help
  you to understand why <strong>some people may find the communication with you
  difficult</strong>: You gave a number of good reasons for you preference for
  using the email... I understand that you feel that this is the only
  way how to make your point clear but perhaps this is part of the
  problem – people in therapy and in relations in general accept that it
  is impossible to pass over to the other side all the depth of how I
  think and feel and we have to live with it somehow.   </p>
  
  <p>After all you have been through, it may seem to you that by raising such a small issue I am picking on you but I think that it is important that you realise that with all your gentleness, which is extraordinary indeed, <strong>you are coming across as rather powerful and insistent person</strong> which
  naturally may draw some unnecessary counter reaction and opposition
  from the other side. <strong>It could be that accepting the limits of what you
  can express rather than driving your point with an absolute clarity
  will achieve better results.</strong> I am making this point because in our
  meetings your wife was saying several times that your form of communication doesn’t work with her; so perhaps it is the time for trying something new?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a little more context, we're talking about something which everyone would agree is very hard to go through, this therapist understands and agrees. His issue is that I would typically make a list of 6 bullet points going through six emotions I had about the subject, with reasons and justifications for these feelings from my point of view, and the odd example of something which happened to back things up. I accept most people wouldn't do this, as you can tell I'm a very methodical and logical person, but this is how I've always worked, never having imagined that striving for clarity makes me seem inappropriately insistent and is therefore counter-productive.</p>

<p>This example relates to emails to my marriage counsellor, who was a little thrown by my methodical approach. I get the impression most clients don't do this. However there are other examples of the same thing from other areas, which although not as important to me, are worth mentioning as I'm comfortable to give more details to clarify my point. For example when my landlord initially refused to fix my garden fence, saying it was my fault for not maintaining the ivy, I emailed back with 4 reasons it can't have been my fault: it fell down only a few months after I moved in, when the ivy was already overgrown; the fence on the other side which had no ivy also fell down; the fences were very old; the wood was rotten through, so it wasn't due to the excessive weight of the ivy. Both then and now all the reasons are good ones, that's not the issue. The issue is generally does striving for clarity reduce impact by making you seem like a nutter (like my wife thought at the time, she's not so methodical).</p>

<p>The question isn't specifically about the counsellor/wife, but general. Say you worked in a bank and a client had a legitimate grievance, how would you react if the client spelled out 5 different failings on the part of the bank which led to the issue. Or if you were a journalist, a list of 7 criticisms of a piece you wrote. I'm talking about where all the points made are fair reasonable criticisms. Would you feel he was out to attack you, or just insistently trying to get his way, due to the large number of points and the methodical approach. And therefore it would have been better to just make one or two points.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Do you agree with his point, and if so what would you say is the balance to aim for between clarity and not being insistent - or even better, <strong>is there a way of making your feelings clear without compromising on the clarity yet without seeming insistent?</strong></p>

"How do I return inedible foods and not be charged, without offending staff?","<p>I've had difficulties at only Chinese restaurants in Canada, Hong Kong, US, UK whenever I must return dishes. Their staff vigorously defend the dish, counter and deny my observations, get angry and say something offensive.</p>

<p>I'm not Chinese, and surmise that I'm missing cultural in my communication. What am I doing wrongly, and what've I overlooked? Suppose that the food in a Chinese dish:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>is obviously rotten. I  touch nothing. I've been served <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choy_sum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">choy sum</a> that was  yellow, spongy; had blotches, discolorations, or flecks on them. </p></li>
<li><p>or isn't obviously rotten, but you can taste that something's wrong after one bite. I've been served <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gai_lan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gai lan</a> that's too stiff and unpiercable (unfresh?), and undercooked seafood. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then a 10-minute dispute follows. The manager will argue that  nothing's wrong, and that I'm just unfamiliar with Chinese cooking methods. When all else fails, the manager blames me for not communicating my preferences to wait staff:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh my God. You didn't tell us before. And now you want this and that.</p>

"How to ask close family and friends to stop casually joking about things that are hurtful to you?","<p>I am an outgoing person. I have no problem interacting with people and making friends, nor do I have an ego problem. But I have recently noticed that sometimes when I am just hanging out with family or friends and everyone is in a good mood, someone would joke to someone in a way that is obviously hurtful to that person. I have been on the receiving end too. Not all of them, but some of them, say things that can't be immediately fixed right away (sometimes not at all).</p>

<p>The thing is.. I <em>always</em> try to be respectful even with my closest friends/family and consciously make an effort to not say something that would embarrass them. Some examples of what I am talking about would be if someone jokes about:</p>

<ul>
<li>your physical appearance</li>
<li>the way you talk</li>
<li>making fun of your age (oh you are not married yet? wow, when will you get married? at 90? do you wanna die alone?)</li>
<li>if someone is poor, making fun of their financial situation</li>
<li>if someone is short, joking about their height</li>
<li>making fun of someone's race (where I live this is normal and not considered a big political issue)</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is.. people who do this are most of the time your close friends and family, who you <em>have to</em> meet and interact with. And when you try to politely tell them that what they said was hurtful, they just brush it off saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was just kidding. Stop being so serious.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I have experienced when you confront someone about this type of behavior is that they, in turn, start acting like <em>you</em> hurt <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>So <strong>my question is</strong>: when you are being made fun of by people like this, how can you let them know that this certain issue is sensitive to you and you would like them to not joke about it, without turning it into an argument?</p>

<hr>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>I never ever confronted anyone in public. I know that would embarrass them in return and that is the exact opposite of what I want. I always talk about it with the person when it's just me and them and we are in a relaxed mood. I don't interfere when it happens with other people except try to divert the conversation to something else.</p>

<p>But when it happens to me, I either ignore it, or I do sometimes mention it to the person in private. Like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that you said this the other day, I understand that you didn't mean it but it hurt me and also now others make fun of it too. So please be considerate in the future. I will appreciate it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In return, I get advised to grow a thick skin and that I am too sensitive. </p>

"How to ask someone to stop playing music without sounding religious?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Music is one of those things which are declared <em>Haram</em> (unlawful) by Islam, yet there are a lot of people here (and in other Islamic countries) who listen to it. So Music isn't considered a taboo here by the public as do other sins like <em>Vulgarity, Drinking, Gambling, etc.</em> but still, people know that it's <em>Haram</em>.</p>

<h2>Common Situations</h2>

<li>Public events and music being played in the background</li>

<h2>What I have tried so far</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Events which may have music</strong>: It's an easy one as I simply refuse to attend them.</li>
<li><strong>Public Transport</strong>: If music is being played, then I don't sit in that vehicle; if driver plays music mid-way through the journey, then at times, I ask him to stop but often it leads me to sound stupid as everyone stares at me as if I am alien. Also, I can't lie that I am having headache or reading, etc.</li>

"Offering to ride along with women when it's dark","<p>When growing up my brother and I where taught that, when it's night, you should offer girls/women to ride along when you are on bike or on foot to prevent unsafe situations. This wasn't saying that women aren't able to stand up for themselves but that there are some creeps out there. If you're not alone you are not as an easy target for sexual assualt, robbery etc. My parents told us this because we grew up in a somewhat rural area where a >7km bike ride is normal to get home. My brother and I often got home late from parties because a female friend lived far away and had to cycle there in the dark. We are raised on the idea that if something happens and you didn't offer to ride along you are partially to blame.</p>

<p>The example above is from when we were teenagers. Now, somewhat older (25), I have trouble applying the message from my parents that is hardwired into my brain. I recently started a job at a company where most of my colleagues are the same age. The location of the firm is at the outskirts of the city and we sometimes work evening shifts until late in the evening. I notice that some female colleagues have to ride home in the dark alone and I would like to offer to ride along for safety purposes. However, I'm afraid this comes of as either a romantic advance (I'm in a relationship so not my intent) or something condescending (""Do you think I can't take care of myself?""). I don't have to ride to their home since we mostly live in the same city and the populated areas are fine. I'm talking about the dark and desolate area between the company and the centre of the city. So my question comes down to this I think: <strong>""How do I offer to ride along with a women for the sole purpose of everyone being safe without implying alternative motives?""</strong> Workplace relations can be a slippery slope so I don't want to send the wrong message.</p>

<p>Some extra information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not to many people my age own a car. In my country we have more bikes than people so it's the preferred method of transportation</li>
<li>Most of my co-workers and I started the job in the same training group so we all know each other a bit and are on friendly terms</li>

"How to be a good backseat driver","<p>I have a lot of experience with highway driving that most of my friends don't have. Rules (from the USA) like <em>only drive in the left lane when you are passing - ie. slow traffic keep right</em> and <em>never merge into another driver's blind spot</em> are intuitive to me at this point. They make sense and make driving less stressful for all drivers around. </p>

<p>However, several of my friends, while conscious of the rules (guidelines?, laws?), are often forgetful or inconsiderate of other drivers. There have been many instances where I have felt uncomfortable as a passenger with my friends' habits of, for example, tailgating too close to the bumper of the car in front of them or not using their blinker to switch lanes. Time and time again, my friends' recklessness in these situations leads to ""road rage"" in other drivers who then become so offended that they MUST be reckless and angry back at my friend. It's an endless loop of rage and stress that is completely unnecessary. </p>

<p>I know being a backseat driver in itself is a curse of impatience, but if I feel like I'm in danger whenever I drive with my friends, I think it makes sense for me to speak up. The only problem is <strong>I am not very good at confronting these bad driving habits and need help</strong>.</p>

<p>There have been times that I have tried to be upfront and straightforward with my friends, saying things like ""<em>Bro, you should really move back to the other lane- there are three cars behind you that want to go 10mph faster</em>"" or ""<em>You should use your blinker, dude. That car in your blind spot may have been trying to merge too</em>."" But this typically just leads to them getting angry at me, their trusty passenger whose supposed to be on their side... I have also tried slipping passive advice like ""<em>Man, lately I've been feeling great and patient on the road because I've been giving everyone a TON of space</em>"" but they just smile and say ""<em>nice</em>"".</p>

<p>I'm open to all suggestions on how to become a better backseat driver. I'd mostly like to get different approaches on how I can confront their driving habits, but I could also use advice on how to improve my patience as a passenger. Thanks!</p>

"How can I tell if I'm being a bother when asking for help?","<p>I started a new job several weeks ago and like with any new job, I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>

<p>I have a ""mentor""--somebody on the team who's designated to helping get me up to speed with everything--and I bug them <strong>a lot</strong>. Some days I'm able to muddle through things on my own, but others I rely pretty heavily on my mentor.</p>

<p>I know that he has a lot of work he needs to get done too and while I'm sure he and the rest of the team expected his output to drop for the first few months I'm here, there are some days I worry that I'm relying too much on him.</p>

<p>Please note that I'm aware that this is a new job and this is all expected, but logically there must be some amount of help that is <strong>too</strong> much to be asking for. When getting ready to ask a question, how can I figure out how close I am to that line? That is...</p>

"How to react to accidentally calling someone the wrong name","<p>We've all been there, whether it's because they have a similar name, you've had someone else on your mind, or you just are tired and slipped up. It's always horrible calling a friend the wrong name (even worse when it's the same of someone you both know).</p>

<p>How should I respond or deal with calling someone the wrong name? Should I own up, or should I try and pass it off as something else?</p>

<p>Also, for more detail, please assume this question applies to the following - if this makes the question too narrow for the site, please let me know so I can widen it;</p>

<ul>
<li>This is referring to an online messaging system in such a way that the messages cannot be deleted before the recipient has the possibility to see them.</li>
<li>I am calling them the name of someone whom they do not know</li>
<li>You can also assume (however if it's easier to answer ignoring this you can) that I am able to say/do whatever I need to say/do before they read and reply to the message.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of a possible way this can occur:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Well, I think it's time I head of to sleep</p>
  
  <p>Friend (Clara): Well goodnight!</p>
  
  <p>Me: Goodnight Alice!</p>

"Is it unreasonable to feel uncomfortable when my Girlfriend frequently talks to her ex?","<p>I have been dating this girl for about one month now, and for the sake of discussion we'll call her Sally. Sally ended a relationship with her former boyfriend, we'll call him Billy, a couple months ago. Sally and Billy dated for a few months and briefly broke up, then got back together for a few weeks only to break up again after Billy threatened to release some ""sensitive data"".</p>

<p>For background, we're still in school, and Billy and Sally have classes together, (I have none with either of them). When I asked why she broke up with him, Sally said that it was because she couldn't hang out with him anymore, due to the conditions on which their relationship ended the first time (parents were involved).</p>

<p>Back to now, Sally and Billy regularly talk and Billy often does favors for Sally. Billy still has feelings for Sally, and makes them known. Sally maintains she only has feelings for me, and I trust her.</p>

<p>It should be noted that I also regularly talk to a former girlfriend, but the difference is that after we broke up - we've both moved on to other people and have just become good friends, as the relationship ended on good terms.</p>

<p>I feel uncomfortable whenever Billy talks to Sally, and even more so when he does things for her. I'd like to believe this is purely because he still has feelings for her, and maybe I'm just being jealous and quite frankly, pathetic.</p>

<p>For relevance, the other day Billy hugged Sally and apologized for what happened, which I'm not even sure how I feel about.</p>

<p>I have mentioned to Sally on two seperate occasions that I don't feel comfortable with her talking to Billy, at least in the volume that they talk which is almost as much, or maybe even more than we talk. Of the two times I told her, she said that she was sorry and that she won't let Billy become that personal with her again, and I'm not sure what exactly that details as nothing (seemingly) changed.</p>

<p>So I guess what I'm asking is, am I just being clingy/jealous? And furthermore, is my relationship with my former girlfriend a reason to not complain?</p>

"How do I deal with people who can't deal with local payment customs?","<p>I live in Japan. Japan still has a very cash oriented society especially when it comes to restaurants.</p>

<p>Often someone will visit from out of town and will expect to be able to (1) pay with a credit card and (2) pay only their portion on their card. This often ends up turning into a 10 to 20 minute fiasco. </p>

<p>First, all the locals are shocked. Then, they have to call the restaurant staff over and ask. Usually they ask ""is it okay to pay with a credit card?"". In those rare cases where it is okay, the guest from the US asks ""Can I just put my portion on the card?"" and then the restaurant hems and haws as it tries to find a way to accommodate them but has no experience doing so and/or has no facilities and ends up having to call neighboring restaurants or the credit card company etc..</p>

<p>How do I communicate to the visitors they're being jerks by not accepting the local customs and using cash?  That they're embarrassing our entire group by putting the restaurant owners on the spot?  And, that they're wasting all of our time by causing this commotion in the first place?</p>

<p>One guest recently did this 5 times in a row and the first time was the worst in that not only had the restaurant never charged a card but they accidentally charged the entire bill. They had no idea how to undo it (having never needed to before). They called their credit processor but it was after hours and no one was answering. So they apologized profusely and asked if the guest could come back the next morning. After another 5 to 10 minutes of negotiation one of the other employees got through to the credit card company and was able to void the payment. </p>

<p>You'd think after all that the guest would not do this again the next 4 times we met up (groups of 8-12 people) but nope. Every single time they tried to pay with a card and it was a big ordeal as the restaurant tried to deal with it.</p>

<p>My question is, Is there a polite and friendly way to say, ""Please consider carrying cash while here. Asking to use a card is putting a burden on everyone around you.""</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: viewing the responses and comments there are a few things people seem to miss</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The 1st store didn't advertise it takes cards. It did <strong>not</strong> have a sign saying ""ccards accepted"". That they had a card processing machine is a separate issue from actually accepting cards. They may have been given the machine for free as part of some larger service but had no intention of using it. Maybe they didn't want to pay processing fees. Being a Japanese store no customer ever in this history of their store had ever asked to pay with a credit card. But, being an accommodating is a Japanese custom, especially when it comes to foreigners, they felt obliged to try to accommodate the customer. It would clearly have been smarter of them to just say no but being the first time they've been asked they haven't realized that yet. But, that's not really the point of this question.</p></li>
<li><p>The question isn't about just the fact that many Japanese stores don't take credit cards. The question is also about a particular person who time and time and time and time again was too oblivious to see how much of a pain they were being to all their friends and the stores and how to bring that up with them. It's good to know how to tell friends before they visit and those answer are appreciated. But, this particular question is also about how to bring it up to someone that should have already gotten the message after the 1st time let alone the 5th.</p>

<p>The bad way would be something like ""Hey friend, have you noticed how much a fiasco paying with a credit card was the last 5 times you did it? Any reason why you keep insisting on subjecting us to this fiasco instead of just carrying cash like everyone else here?"".</p></li>
<li><p>This also isn't just about asking to pay with a ccard. It's about asking to pay just their individual portion with a ccard after the meal.</p></li>

"Correcting what I see as factual errors in a political discussion","<p>The day after the United States 2016 election, I attended a public political discussion club in the United States. I personally am very left-leaning, but this club was a conservative club; in fact, the name of the club was ""[location name] conservatives"". I'm not a regular attendee of the club, but I knew one or two people, and it's relatively normal for people to not attend regularly.</p>

<p>During the discussion, the conversation of Hillary Clinton's emails came up. If you weren't following US politics, there was a huge controversy during the election about Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/06/politics/comey-tells-congress-fbi-has-not-changed-conclusions/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Several days before the election, the director of the FBI released a letter saying that they had discovered new evidence pertaining to the controversy, only to, after reviewing the evidence, make no changes to their earlier determination regarding Clinton's wrongdoing</a>. Donald Trump had this to say about Comey's actions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can't review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can't do it, folks,"" Trump said, adding, ""Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it, and now it's up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on November 8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the political discussion group, someone repeated Trump's claim: that it was impossible to review 650,000 emails in eight days. I spend a lot of time following politics, so I knew that you actually could review 650,000 emails in eight days: you use software! <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/11/yes-donald-trump-fbi-can-vet-650000-emails-eight-days/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here's a good explanation of the process from Wired</a>; a Google search for ""how did comey review 650,000 emails"" turns up dozens of articles from reputable sources saying the same thing. I felt that I was on pretty solid ground with the issue.</p>

<p>So I spoke up. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I think it was something along the lines of ""Oh, they have software that can do that. It's all automated."" I remember getting a blank stare in response, and the conversation moved on. But it was a while ago, so my memory might be a little bit shaky here. </p>

<p>I have to admit that I did feel frustrated and upset. <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-comey-letter-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/"" rel=""noreferrer"">There's a really good argument that the actions of the FBI cost Clinton the election</a>. I personally felt that the email ""scandal"" wasn't a scandal at all. And I am very opposed to Donald Trump, who had just been elected. All of this combined made me feel very frustrated that the candidate who I supported during the general election was being rejected for reasons that, I felt, were related to misinformation and, to borrow a phrase from Trump, fake news, rather than her ability or qualifications or vision for the country. I knew I was upset and decided not to press the issue.</p>

<p>But looking back on the event, it seems that I didn't get through with my explanation about the emails. The other person didn't seem to find it convincing and moved on. I really didn't like the fact that they moved on; I felt like I was being ignored. While I don't necessarily expect people to agree with me on everything, I appreciate it when I'm heard out. And I really don't like it when people disagree with me, not about issues, but about basic facts about events.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I could have worded my correction to make it more persuasive, or at least so that it would have gotten a response other than a blank stare? How should I voice a correction in a group discussion such that others are able to consider it?</p>

"How do I deal with frequent demands for attention?","<p>I've been seeing a girl for a little while now. And there's this pattern that keeps happening which is driving me to insanity. It roughly goes like this:</p>

<p>1: Early in the day I say I can't meet her plans exactly as she wants. She has a habit of making grand plans without consulting and just expecting she will spend all weekend with me. I say I can't stay with her all day as I have to work in the evening or the like (the truth). I try to offer a compromise of doing something else with her another time.</p>

<p>2: She gets angry, dismissive, my not seeing her in the next few days the way she wants means I'm not seeing her for the next few weeks.</p>

<p>3: Constant phone calls at night. Often with her saying nothing. Sometimes screaming down the line. Either way it wears me down, saps all my energy and leaves me a zombie the next day.</p>

<p>4: Midnight. After I'm in bed. She calls and says she is going to jump on the highway or somesuch and I have to come.
The first time or two I believed her and came running...she was fine. Since then I have tried to ignore this seeing it as just a means of control</p>

<p>Yes. I know. It's not a healthy relationship. She isn't marriage material. I won't be with her forever. Nonetheless I do care about her and have this big ""what if she means it"" in my head, I don't want to be partially responsible for her death. Like it or not I'm in this situation and of the people she is close to I'm the one who lives closest (40 minutes by s train).</p>

<p>A:  What if ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf"" comes true? What if this time she means it for real? How should I correctly handle these demands that I come to her place right now or else?</p>

<p>B: How do I avoid getting to this stage in the first place? Short of caving to her every whim and doing whatever she says. I can't live my life like that, I have my own stuff too. </p>

"As a woman, how to avoid angry stares from other people's wives or girlfriends","<p>I am a moderately good looking woman. With basic makeup and hair styling, I can make myself look pretty. This is my preferred look when I go out. I often get a lot of stares, sometimes admiring and sometimes nasty, from other male colleagues and I have pretty much accepted that it, mainly because I cannot help it. </p>

<p>There are cases when there is a woman by their side and it makes her uncomfortable. It could be that man's wife, or a girlfriend. </p>

<p><strong>Incident 1</strong><br>
For instance, I was at a party of a very close female friend. I had a few small interactions with her husband earlier so it was natural for him to greet me. It was a simple ""<em>Hi, how are you?</em>"" But my friend was clearly upset by this and she made a long face at me all the time. Not to mention that our interactions have gone down after this incident. </p>

<p><strong>Incident 2</strong><br>
I was at a coffee bar with a friend. After sometime and all of sudden when I casually looked up, I saw a young woman giving me angry looks. I looked at her the second time and nothing changed. I saw someone sitting beside her, I am assuming he was her date, and that man was staring at me. I just minded my business and left the place. </p>

<p><strong>Incident 3</strong><br>
There was another incident where I was travelling with a friend in a bus. That bus had seating system where two sets of passengers face each other and that pattern is repeated throughout the bus. There was a couple sitting in front of me, and as soon as I took my seat, the woman asked the man to exchange his seat with hers. The man was sitting opposite to me. </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
While this kind of attention is definitely a confidence booster, I'm not an attention seeker nor was I there to create a havoc in their love life. But, I cannot forget those stares. They make me feel guilty about something which I do not understand. Also, I am a little upset about the way my friend chose to minimize her interactions with me. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> 
How could I signify to these women that I'm not interested in responding to those stares and that they have nothing to worry about? </p>

<p>Many of the answers here mention that I need to ignore such stares and I completely agree with that. Only that I need to have a thick skin to start implementing it. 
Also, got to know many things like 'mate guarding behaviour', that I need to help my friend 'validate their relationship', that I cannot control what others think of me. </p>

<p>And to all those who asked and suggested that I stop wear revealing clothing, it was not a fair thing to say. One cannot hide the silhouette no matter what. And the definition of revealing clothing is not defined. For some, wearing a sleeveless dress or showing ankle cleavage could be revealing too. </p>

"How to handle a younger sibling being verbally bullied, with sometimes racist remarks, at school?","<p>My younger sister tells me she's having trouble at her new middle school; one of these is that a boy, who tends to be the class clown and troublemaker, makes fun of her underbite. I told her to notify her teacher about these insults and to absolutely make sure that people will not find out that it was her who told them off. I was relieved to hear that her teacher completely agreed with her, and his parents will be notified, and that her anonymity will be respected. However, she tells me that when the boy was called and taken by one of the school administrators during one of their classes, he returned unchanged.</p>

<p>He then made a slightly racist remark on my sister, telling her that her brother is probably Kim Jong-Un (we're Asians if it isn't clear) resulting in a few nearby classmates giggling a bit.</p>

<p>I told her that she has 3 options, in order of severity:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Tell the teacher.</strong> Mention that he used a <em>racist</em> remark and to her it is verbal <em>abuse</em> and <em>discrimination</em>. Those 3 terms have heavy implications and will surely bring a severe punishment to the boy; but since he seems to not care about punishment, this might not do much change.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore him.</strong> I told her that as long as people don't really have the same opinion as him or the insults don't become viral, it can just be brushed off as an isolated incident. However, what I fear is that if she leaves this untouched, this will alter her reputation at her school which is currently fragile because she has no friends in her class and in her school. She does, however, have a cousin but she doesn't seem to help often, most of the time occupied with her own friends.</li>
<li><strong>Make racist remarks back at him.</strong> This is the most dangerous, but arguably the one that my sister doesn't disagree with. She has been holding back insulting comebacks at him for a long time. The kid is of African origin, so it's quite easy to make up racist remarks at him. However, this is <em>heavily</em> shunned upon, unfortunately. I obviously don't want her reputation to go hand-in-hand with the term ""racist"" but again, I don't want to leave her undefended against these insults. So I tell her to be extremely cautious if she is to choose this option.</li>

"How can I convince my girlfriend not to worry about gifts I give her?","<h1>Our Background</h1>

<p>My girlfriend was born in Laos and is currently living with her family in France. Money has always been a problem for her and her family. Her parents both don't earn a lot and regularly ask her for ""<em>financial help</em>"". While they claim it's just temporarily, they never showed any intention of paying anything back to her.</p>

<p>I was born in Austria, where I currently live and where she intends to move in with me. I myself do not have such monetary problems. I am currently studying for my BSc in Information Security at university. My monthly income is currently €600 and I have about €25,000 saved up in various assets (savings accounts, investment funds, etc.). Also, my chances of getting a well-paid job in the InfoSec industry are very good.</p>

<h1>My Problem</h1>

<p>I enjoy giving my girlfriend gifts. She enjoys playing videogames together with me, so sometimes I buy her a new game off her wishlist, or a DLC for a game we enjoy playing together, or an in-game item or similar. A while ago, for example, she showed me a video about some ultra-rare in-game emotes for the game Killing Floor 2 and said how much she wanted to have one specific emote. I looked around the Steam Marketplace until I found someone selling that emote for 60€. I bought the emote and when I told her that, she was rather upset at me. She didn't want me to spend so much money on ""a stupid emote"" and told me how many other things I could have bought for myself with this money.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised by her reaction, and I don't really know how to proceed with it. She knows how much money I have and how much I earn, so I am not pretending to be barely making it through the month. I considered that she might consider those gifts ""<em><a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=flexing"" rel=""noreferrer"">flexing</a></em>"", but this was never my intention, given that the cost of my gifts are not exorbitant and never exceed €100.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can convince my girlfriend that she should not worry about the gifts I give her? Or should I accept that it makes her feel uneasy and stop giving her gifts?</p>

<h2>Questions from the Comments:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> ""You mention that you're planning to live together. Have you discussed finances with respect to that yet?""<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, my girlfriend would plan to stay at home and take care of the household. While a single-earner household does not have the same economic strength as if she were to work part-time, I do certainly see it within our possibilities to have good standard of living with only one income.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> ""I don't think the problem is on the offering. It's on the gift - a digital cosmetic item. I consider myself a gamer as well and to be fair that's a lot for a cosmetic and I think that's why she got upset. Can you confirm this?""<br>
<strong>A:</strong> I agree that it's a lot, but as far as I understood, she didn't want me to spend as much money on her, not that she was upset that the item was so expensive. She had the same reaction when I bought her a game for 15€, which was worth every cent.</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> ""So she just said she wanted it, but didn't ask you to buy it for her and you also didn't tell her beforehand that you would?""<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Correct. She wanted it and I wanted to surprise her with ""Look what I got for you!""</li>
<li><strong>Q:</strong> ""How long have you two been together?""<br>
<strong>A:</strong> One and a half years now.</li>

"How to set personal hygiene standards with my boyfriend?","<p>I love my boyfriend very deeply, and we have an awesome relationship but as a person I struggle to bring up criticisms of others in my life without ""downplaying"" what I'm trying to communicate.</p>

<p>For example I have a friend that is always late to any plans we make together, and after it taking me years to bring it up, I ended up apologizing for being too negative. This kind of thing happens because I avoid the confrontation for so long that by the time I bring it up, whoever is at the receiving end doesn't think I'm serious. Can't blame them since I'm not doing a great job of communicating to them what the problem is.</p>

<p>I am trying to improve upon this, so I am planning on doing so for the issue described in the title of this question.</p>

<p>My boyfriend, as much as he is my soul-mate, is pretty gross. </p>

<p>Here's the major issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>His apartment is constantly a mess</li>
<li>He doesn't brush his teeth much at all, he only does it if I finally get the courage to ask. </li>
<li>He mostly wears clothing that he has had for 7+ years that doesn't fit him and is worn thin or has holes/stains. He also rarely washes his clothes. </li>
</ol>

<p>The list goes on. I cannot explain how it feels to go on a date that I spent 2+ hours getting ready for, only to see him show up looking and smelling like he just rolled out of bed. </p>

<p>To clarify on the 3rd point on the list, his outward appearance to the world is far less important to me than the problems with his cleanliness. I have minimal concern for what other people think of his looks. I find him extremely handsome and sexy, provided he is meeting these extremely basic hygienic standards. However, when he (often) does not meet those standards my attraction to him is lowered. </p>

<p>His lack of effort is particularly evident on a date or special occasion which would normally be an opportunity to look and smell good or at least adequate for me. He loves that I put in special effort to my makeup, perfume etc for those occasions, and beforehand will sometimes ask something along the lines of ""Doing any fancy makeup tonight for our fancy date? Yes? Can't wait to see it!"" so there is no chance that he is oblivious to the ""tone"" of the occasion. I think that one should put a little effort into being attractive to your partner so that they feel special and important, which is why I put in the thankless effort I do, as well as feeling good for myself. The hygiene and visual points may seem different at first, but they are in fact very similar because if neglected, they both send the message that I am being taken for granted. </p>

<p>This all seems to relate heavily to the topic of emotional labour and I am completely lost in navigating it.</p>

<p>I have sheepishly brought these topics up in the past, but since having expectations is a pretty new experience for me, I am unsure of what expectations are reasonable and what is too much. If i refuse to kiss him until he brushes his teeth, he has taken it quite well so far and will do as I request, but then just continues to skip it every day following until I bring it up again. </p>

"How to convince people I don't want to attend an event?","<p><em>Note- I used the 'United-States' tag, but this takes place on the US-Canada border.</em></p>

<p>TL;DR: There is an event that everyone is excited for but me, and I don't know how to convince people I don't want to go to it. Each member of my friend group wants me to attend for their own reasons, none of which are persuasive in the least.</p>

<p>At the school which I attend, there is a very large annual event. It is incredibly similar to a secondary school prom or ball, with the exception of this being larger and mounting a more general assault on the senses. I'm sorry if I take a harsh tone, but I just find events like this generally irksome and pointless. I dislike the event, and the night of it is often one which I dread, as it generally spills out, disrupting the area (or the few people in the area that aren't in attendance). I find the entire event, top to bottom, distasteful. None of my friends share this conviction. All of them are incredibly excited for this event, for varying reasons. They talk excitedly about it incessantly, which I understand- they are excited for an event they love.</p>

<p>However, there is one thing that they cannot seem to wrap their heads around: I don't want to go to the event. They know that I avoid social situations of pretty much any stripe, and the ones I do go to are chosen with care. They have tried in the past to coax me into more social situations, an effort which has proven largely fruitless. I simply continued in my ways until they got bored with me and moved on to other pursuits, leaving our friendship intact, unharmed, and somewhat strengthened. I was surprised by this last point, but it is undeniable that my refusal to engage in whatever inane task they are currently involved in strengthened my friendship with each one of my friends. </p>

<p>This situation is, in my eyes, no different from any other social event I avoid- it is another large, mindless cluster that I want no part in. But to most of my friend group, there is something that sets this event apart, which has made them redouble their efforts to convince me to attend. Initial efforts were asking me repeatedly if I intended to attend, and, when I invariably responded that I do not, they begin to question me as to why. After a few of these question-and-answer sessions that got them nowhere, they changed tactics. They attempted to put me in situations where it could be potentially embarrassing for me to say I am not going to the event. An example of this is one of them asking me for incredibly specific advice about a situation, and, once down the rabbit hole of 'what-ifs', they ask that I be there to make sure nothing goes awry with whatever they were asking about. This topic has spanned from dress color (which I was hopeless at) to chaperoning a couple (this was what tipped me off something was wrong- these people would never ask for, or want, a chaperone). These question sessions have recently slacked off, and I'm not sure what comes next, but they seem no less zealous that I attend, so something will pop up.</p>

<p>The personal motives of the people involved vary enormously. One person, let's call him David, has recently broken up with his girlfriend, who he believes is interested in me (this was all revealed in a rather awkward conversation recently). I question the last part, but I am generally oblivious about these things, so I don't know. He wants to go as friends, presumably so his ex-girlfriend doesn't ask me, as rejecting her advances would be awkward for everyone involved. Another friend, let's call her Jess, is convinced that I avoid social events because I don't know what I am missing. This has fed her actions to convince me to go, presumably in the hopes of making me come out of my shell, so to speak. This view is incorrect: I avoid social events precisely because I know what I am missing, and I am very glad to be missing it.</p>

<p>The most tricky of these motives to counter, however, belongs to returning co-stars, Alice and Bruce from <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/9393/dealing-with-a-friend-trying-to-get-me-a-girlfriend/9902?noredirect=1#comment38833_9902"">this question</a>. One way this event is similar to a secondary school prom is that it is traditional to bring a date with you to the event. They view this as an ideal way to get me and Mary (another returning guest from the link) 'together', and have set about trying to get me to attend with her. This, needless to say, will not happen, both because I am not interested in a relationship, and because I am not interested in the event. They have been proving particularly difficult to deflect, for reasons explained in the other question- basically, he refuses to accept that I don't want a relationship. He refuses to engage me in debate, and as such proves difficult to deal with (I am not accustomed to people that don't accept a well-reasoned argument). Alice is no better, as Bruce feeds off her energy. I see Alice much less, though, which makes her more manageable.</p>

<p>As can be seen, I have quite a problem. My entire friend group is aligned in an effort to get me to attend an event I do not wish to attend, for reasons I do not fully comprehend, in ways that cannot be accurately predicted. None of them, each for their own reasons, will accept that I do not wish to waste a night of my life being miserable. How do I effectively communicate to them that the question of my attendance is a non-negotiable no? How can I do this to the group, or, even better, to each individual person, addressing their own motives? </p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>@catija What does it matter/what am I trying to achieve?
I am trying to get them to stop asking. Several of my friends (particularly Bruce and Alice) don’t have a good sense of boundaries. I want to make sure the issue resolves in a way that does not result in anything embarrassing for me, them, or Mary. </p>

<p>@spagirl What have I tried? At the beginning, I went with just saying I wasn’t going, and supplying them with reasons. This is how I get out of most events. Once they moved on to the ‘advice’ part, I tried convincing them I wasn’t good at giving advice for parties. This proved fairly successful, but they have slacked off this method, so it didn’t have much time to test itself. </p>

"How can I convince a doctor to wash her hands, and not just use hand sanitizer?","<p>I recently saw a doctor who,  after entering the room, only used hand sanitizer. As her gown looked dirty, I stopped her from touching me and asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doctor, is handwashing more effective than hand sanitizer?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already knew that <a href=""https://www.thoughtco.com/hand-sanitizers-vs-soap-and-water-373517"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">handwashing is more effective</a>; I was only  trying to be tactful. She replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, hand sanitizer's fine. So let's start the examination. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to insist politely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd feel cushier with handwashing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But she looked offended, and replied gruffly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look. I don't have time. I have other patients waiting. Do you want to start or not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could I've communicated my preference that she washes her hands, without offending her?</p>

"How do I tactfully get clarity about maybe-flirtatious behavior?","<p>There's a woman we'll call Emma.  I've known her for a few years through work she does for somebody in my family.  I am in a long-term relationship, terrified of making my partner jealous, and hopelessly socially anxious usually, so we've never had a real conversation.</p>

<p>Usually (always) when I see her, my partner is there, but over the weekend she wasn't able to make it.  Emma seemed unusually friendly and chatty, and we talked quite a lot.  There was also some body language which I feel like was saying a lot more than the words, but I have no idea because I've historically been socially inept.  I was actually blown away by my unexpected ability to survive the smalltalk.</p>

<p>So the thing is, I have no idea how to tell if she was trying to make a move with my partner not being around.  She didn't <em>say</em> anything that would suggest ulterior motives, but like I said, there were some moments she seemed to use her body as a way of saying something else.</p>

<p>If I ask directly, ""when you did X, were you flirting?"", I have a feeling that'll just make things <strong>really</strong> weird, whether or not I'm right.  Is there some tactful way to figure this out?  She will be in our lives for who knows how long, due to her work, so I want to make it not-weird but also figure out wtf was going on.</p>

<p>And asking my partner for insight is right out.  She wouldn't take it well if somebody else were showing interest in me.  (Yeah, it's a fun world I live in)</p>

"Can I correct other people's children in front of them?","<p>I am a childless female 20-something who occasionally comes in to contact with other people's children. This happens anywhere really, at work, stores, museums, movie theatres, just around the neighborhood. And sometimes these children are being rude. I tend to be very forgiving about things like someone bumping into me accidentally and will say ""No, no, it's fine."" But when someone does something like cut in line or talk during a movie I will ask them not to. With adults I feel comfortable doing so, but when it is a child or young teenager I am not sure if it is appropriate/how the parent may react. </p>

<p>For this question I will limit it to when the parent is there and does nothing.</p>

<p>For example, I was in a museum using an interactive exhibit when a child squeezed into the small gap between me and the exhibit, pushing me out of the way to use it themselves. Their parent was only three feet away and watched this happen without saying anything. I wanted to tell the child something like ""Excuse me but I was using this, would you mind waiting your turn?"" but I was concerned about the parent reacting negatively to me correcting their child so I walked away.</p>

<p>In these situations I am mostly worried about the parent. When it is just me and the child I usually say something and as long as I am gentle and polite the child seems to understand and correct their behavior. But I have seen parents go nuts when someone says anything remotely corrective to their children. </p>

<p>In such a situation should I say something the child or the parent? Is there a particular way I should phrase it? </p>

<p>It seems wrong to just let such things happen and not say anything. I wouldn't let that fly with an adult so why should I let it go with a child?</p>

<p>EDIT: To add some clarification I am in the US. And the age range I had in mind was 6-13. That seems to be when they are still oblivious to their surroundings but old enough to understand if I were to say something. </p>

<p>The answers seem divided on whether or not to direct the comment to the parent or child. Both sides make good points so I am still unsure which would be best. It seems like in the majority of cases speaking to the child would be alright but in the minority of situations where the child has behavioral issues it could easily go wrong. If this isn't resolved in the answers I might make a new question about that specific case.</p>

"Responding to unknown ""popular culture"" references?","<p>Sometimes references will come up in conversation to players in different sports, singers, or other popular culture references, and most of the time they come up, I have no idea what's being talked about. </p>

<p>To give an idea of how bad my knowledge of these things is, I was talking with my mom once and accidentally mixed up Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan. While I have not done <em>that</em> since, I've been known not to have any idea who Madonna was (some sort of singer?) and who the heck the ""Raiders"" or the ""49'ers"" (aside from the gold rush prospectors, which I have a feeling was not what was being talked about) were.</p>

<p>How should I respond when these references come up? Do I just nod along, or do I ask who/what these things/people are? Up until now, I've just asked, and my friends are pretty cool with it and explain, but occasionally (when asking someone who isn't a close friend or something) I'll get a ""you're such a nerd"" smirk.</p>

"How to apologize for the transgression of an acquaintance?","<p>I recently went shopping with a girl who I met about two weeks ago.  I will call her my friend to communicate the issue easily. We were exploring one of the stores, and we came across what appeared to be a decorative water spout.  My friend asked the store employee what it was while simultaneously pushing the spout.  A lot of water came out creating a mess.  The employee was visibly upset. She had just said ""please don't do that"" while my friend was touching the spout. My friend apologized a few times and I did as well.  The employee was visibly upset and did not say anything in response.  My friend also seemed to annoy the employee by inquiring about the purpose of the spout again after the incident. </p>

<p>We left the store quickly after that.  Should we have offered to stay and clean?  The employee looked as though she would not have appreciated our continued presence.  Did I not apologize properly? I said ""I am so sorry"" twice.  </p>

"Invited to a wedding, but didn't get an invitation, what should I do?","<p>A while back ago, my friend married. I was sent an invitation when no one was at home, so it got recalled and sent back to the sender (my friend, at a nearby town).</p>

<p>A little background on this friend: we are classmates back in junior high school, in a small 20 person class (other class got 40s), so all of us are pretty close.</p>

<p>I was unable to contact her regarding the invitation, but at least <strong>I know definitely I was invited,</strong> although I never got the written invitation. The problem is, in most wedding in Java, we are required to show an invitation, or write on the guest book - which I don't which method she will be using. If it was the latter, I can walk through without problem.</p>

<p>I decided not to attend, and congratulated her the day after, which she confirmed everyone was there and asked why I didn't come.</p>

<p>Now my question is <strong>what one should do in a situation like this?</strong> The answer does not necessarily specific to the Indonesian culture, but should consider these:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was definitely invited, but didn't get the written invitation.</li>
<li>To attend the wedding, one should bring the invitation. However, there is a 50-50 chance it won't be needed.</li>

"How to start a conversation with a 'stranger' from school?","<p>After the summer holidays, I'll be a senior in high school. My year consists of about 100 people, and I approximate that I've never had a word with 30-50 of them. It's not that there were no occasions - while I generally don't share classes with these people, I have happened to sit next to them on the bus on a school trip or similar situations. It feels like a missed opportunity to meet someone new or make a new friend, but I just have no idea how to start a conversation - and how to keep it going once it started.</p>

<p>I've had a few ideas, but I don't think they would work out:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talk about the holidays. This is only applicable shortly after holidays (and we don't usually have trips at those moments) but then again I don't think a 'stranger' would openly talk to me about how they spent their holidays. (I don't think <em>I</em> would do this anyway.)</li>
<li>Something school-related. But that's rather boring, right? Especially if we don't share classes, what could we say?</li>
<li>Interests. But I don't think I could hold a semi-long conversation with someone about my passion for computer programming if they don't do coding themselves.</li>

Note: Two of my cousins and one friend have already benefited from the good advice given by members of IPS.SE but I was not directly involved in those cases whereas I would be if I am to convince my cousin.</sub></p>

<hr>

<h2>Cultural Tradition</h2>

<p>In India, cousins are often called 'cousin brother' or 'cousin sister' to indicate gender and also closeness. Our family is very large which is why I have been asking questions about many different relatives here. Why? Because we have some measure of 'social responsibility' to help our relations in trouble.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>One of my cousin sisters has decided to marry a person whom I personally know to have 'bad habits' and is unreliable. I should not usually intervene in such matters, especially when my cousin has actually selected this person herself, but her parents are anxious because this is a local person of known bad character and unlikely to improve because he is a habitual offender. </p>

<p>But she flatly refuses to believe them that he will not improve and she is now in a 'big fight' with them over this issue, so they have requested me to use my influence (and also family responsibility as a 'cousin brother') to make her understand the danger. Is there any diplomatic and effective way to do so? More details follow.</p>

<h2>Family History</h2>

<p>My cousin sister [code name = Little Bun which is actually her pet name kept by her mother] is 24 years old and well-employed in a major company in a big city in India, far from our home city. When she visited her parents here recently she met a local man, aged 28 [code name = Joe], who has charmed her so thoroughly that she took a very quick decision to marry him just 6 weeks after their first meeting. They have fixed their marriage for October 12th and both sets of parents are invited, yes, but they have been cuttingly advised not to take any steps to stop this very small-scale wedding.</p>

<h2>“Little Bun”  the bride-to-be</h2>

<p>Specifically, I am worried because Little Bun is making a big salary and Joe needs the money. Moreover, she is the only child of wealthy parents who own valuable properties in this city. It is sad but true that such girls have been targets of unscrupulous marriages in this region. I have seen more than one such local marriage end in cheating and bitter divorce, so I hesitate to tell her parents that I cannot help them in this delicate matter. However, I am absolutely not going to communicate with Joe in any manner over this or any other issue.</p>

<h2>“Joe”  the groom-to-be</h2>

<p>The problem: Joe is notorious in this town as an unreliable character with plenty of 'bad habits' (read vices) -- this is no exaggeration because I know for a fact that he drinks alcohol in excess, gambles away his earnings and is being investigated for fraud at his former workplace. He used to be a low-level manager in a local firm but nowadays operates 2 'tourist taxis' which run to faraway towns and give him a good excuse to leave the city when he needs to. </p>

<p>There is no caste- or religion- or socio-economic differences causing her parents to oppose this marriage. It's purely the concern about the known character of this Joe. However, Little Bun, who was always treated as a child by her parents, is in rebellion mode and refuses to hear anything against her fiance.</p>

<p>In typical movie style, Joe has convinced her that he is the 'victim of circumstances and social conspiracies' that refuse to give him a chance to lift himself up and away from his 'unfortunate past.' As in, she is not exactly unaware of his reputation but he has given it a romantic twist and also misrepresented the facts to his advantage.</p>

<h2>Myself</h2>

<p>I am rather influential with Little Bun who is 14 years younger and good at heart. But if I intercede on behalf of her parents I might possibly not convince her, but also risk losing that influence. On the other hand, I am very worried that Joe will lead her into big trouble because although I don't know him very well myself, his past history is well known locally and he has even been entangled with a few girls leading to much complications and heartbreak. </p>

<h2>What I have tried</h2>

<p>I have not discussed the matter with her yet, simply because I can't do it more than once and want to prepare the best approach.</p>

<p>So here I am at IPS.SE:</p>

<p>Is it possible for me to diplomatically convince my 'cousin sister' that she is going to marry a person with 'bad habits?'</p>

"We moved together unexpectedly and early. How do I approach my boyfriend about arising problems?","<h2>Current Situation</h2>

<p>My boyfriend of 5 months is currently living with me in my aparment. He moved in about 2.5 months ago, because he was kicked out by his roommate with a 2 week notice and completely out of the blue and since then, he has been living with me.
We are both 24 and employed. I work a full time job while he works 15 hours a week but he is also still attending university.</p>

<p>If the reason of why he was kicked out is in any way important please say so and I will update this question. But since it is a long story I will skip this part for now.</p>

<p>I made sure to be clear on what I wanted when he moved in. I told him he could live with me for as long as he liked, but I would prefer it if he would eventually get his own place since our relationship is still very new (I just don't think you should move together after just 3 months). He agreed but also said he would be fine with staying at my place permanently. (To which i did not respond, since I already told him what i preferred)</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>We have not set any boundaries or rules on living together, since I thought this was only a temporary situation. And maybe it still is, but I do not know if he decided to just stay and ignore my preference or simply thinks that I got used to him living with me.
There are now slowly things arising like:</p>

<ul>
<li>him taking a shower when I need to get ready for work, while he has a day off (I came late to work because of that)</li>
<li>loud music when I need some peace and quiet</li>
<li>no more time alone in my apartment</li>
<li>a lot of laundry, dirty dishes, ..</li>
</ul>

<p>And I do not know how to approach him about these things, since A) I do not want to suggest that he has to move out and B) he thinks he can stay because I am talking about long-term commitments.<br>
I am not sure if A and B are in conflict to each other, but what I basically want is I don't want to ""force"" him to move out, nor do I want to invite him permanently into my place.</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>I want to keep a healthy relationship with him and eradicate the negative feelings I get when the problems from above arise.</p>

<p>I want to find a non-suggestive way of reminding him that I would still sort of prefer if he got his own place, without sounding like I want him to move out. And if he decided to stay, that there are things that need to change.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I guess he does not see the need of having to move out at all. If I was him I couldn't see a reason either. He lives rent-free, close to university, in a quiet area. Except for the weekends and evenings, he basically has a whole apartment to himself.</p>

<p>I am looking for an approach that won't hurt his feelings or suggest him to move out, but just to make him aware that there is a problem that needs solving. 
How do I correctly start up a conversation about this? What can I say or do so he knows he is free to stay with me forever if that is his wish (though it is not mine), but then we have to set up some rules? </p>

<p>And just for clearance: I would <strong>prefer</strong> it if he moved out. That means if he <strong>wants</strong> to stay with me I would accept that. But if he has no preference of staying/ moving then I would like for him to move out.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for all the answers and comments, I see now that I will have to talk about this with him openly if I want my issues solved properly.<br>
As an addition, I will try to start a conversation about our current living situation and ask him if he is happy with everything so far.
I have not considered the possibility that maybe he also has issues that he does not speak up about since he is basically only a guest.</p>

"How to talk to a friend claiming to go on a rampage?","<p>My friend (m, 23) invited me (m, 23) to a house party and after a couple of beers he talked about a club in our city which he does not like. </p>

<p>He stated that the club is bad because the security kicked him out based on a dropped glass but did not prevent a rape of a women (I think the rape part is exaggerated but I wasn't there so I have no proof). Furthermore, he said that he hates the security because of that and would like to kill them with his hands, a machine gun or grenades. </p>

<p>I know that this story sounds rediculous, but the way he said it was serious and not meant in a funny way. I talked to his ex girlfriend (f, 21) also present at the party and she confirmed my perception of the situation. However everybody was laughing a bit but it was just because the situation was awkward. 
It is not the first time that he is mentioning a scenario like this and it starts to annoy me and his ex girlfriend so much that we are thinking about not hanging out with him anymore. </p>

<p>Additional information about his personality: He had a weed addiction, but right now he is not smoking that much (once in 2 month, maybe less), he does not feel good about himself especially what women think about his visual appearance (in my opinion his visual appearance is great, but he thinks that he is not tall enough), he has a bad relationship to his father, who expects a lot of him, while he is not able to deliver, and probably additional problems that I am not aware of right now. </p>

<p>After I stated the situation, I want to say that I don't think that he will do it in the near feature but I think that if he gets worse in his mental state, then there might be a possibility of him doing it. </p>

<p>I want to help my friend and I have these options in mind: </p>

<ol>
<li>I want to talk to him about his behavior and that it is not acceptable to talk like that in general or within a party group. Additionally I want to make absolutely clear that he needs to adjust his mindset towards a positive attitude. My problem with this is that I want to make my point clear without being to aggressive which would make it unlikely for me coming through to him. How can I find a good balance? </li>
<li>I also want him to see an expert e.g. a psychotherapist. I already tried to gently talk him into that by showing that I understand his problem but also stating that I am not qualified to help him. How can I tackle this problem in a conversation?  </li>

"How to politely deflect questions about awkward scars?","<p>Content warning: Self-harm</p>

<p>Due to some issues I had a few years ago with self harming (related to mental health issues which I no longer have - hurrah!), I'm left with a lot of awkward scars on my forearm. They're visible whenever I'm not wearing long sleeves.</p>

<p>I don't mind my scars being visible. They often are, in my day to day life. I also don't mind talking about them, but it's a discussion I prefer to have in an appropriate environment, on a one-to-one basis. There are various obvious reasons for that. People rarely ask about them.</p>

<p>However, there has been more than one occasion where, in a big group setting, somebody has been particularly vocal about them. Recently, at a party, somebody loudly asked ""What are those marks on your forearm?"", before turning a deep shade of red and looking mortified. The room promptly went silent, I made some sort of awkward joke, and conversations resumed again. It was awkward, to say the least.</p>

<p>I don't blame people for asking at all, and I accept that it's a possibility in these situations if I'm not going to commit to wearing long sleeves to every party I ever go to. I do accept that this is a solution to the problem, but it's not one that I want to abide by.</p>

<p>Is there a good way to deal with a scenario like the above, should it arise?</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to ease the tension, and also make it clear that I don't think the person who's asked the question has done anything wrong. Ideally, I'd like the outcome to change. Last time this happened, I made some sort of odd joke (which didn't really make sense), and then one of my more confident friends loudly resumed his conversation and things carried on. What I'm hoping for is a way to quickly answer the question without coming off as upset or embarrassed, and without looking like I'm upset/annoyed with the person who asked the question initially.</p>

"Is there something that screams 'virgin' about me?","<p>At my work there are these two colleagues, let's call them Bob and Adam just for convenience, who have a history of trash-talking about literally everyone in the company.</p>

<p>Recently I've stumbled upon a piece of an IM log between them - don't ask how, I know that the log is 100% legit. This time they decided to talk trash about me. Somewhere in the middle of the conversation Adam told he doesn't think that Inmir (me) has ever been on a date. Bob pretty much agreed.</p>

<p>This <em>is</em> true. Indeed, I have never been on one. Now I don't particularly care about this 'deficiency' of mine or this chatlog specifically - witnessing how many people Adam and Bob have talked trash about I had no doubt that eventually they'll do that to me too, online or offline. <em>What</em> grinds my gears is that I cannot ascertain if this particular sentence was an accurate observation on Adam's part or just something he uttered that happened to be true at the moment. Well, looks like he scored anyway.</p>

<p>Could I potentially give out any 'virgin' tells? I tried to work something out but couldn't. I don't and never did talk about my relationships, lack of them, personal life or anything like that, being an introvert - and a kinda extreme one - and a private person in general. My clothes are pretty generic for me being 25 years old, none of that stuff like fedoras or trenchcoats. I maintain my hygiene too.</p>

"How can I mediate between my fighting adult siblings?","<p><strong>TLDR:  I have fighting adult siblings.  How can I mediate?</strong></p>

<p>I have two adult sisters (I'll call them Janet and Carol) who have been fighting for some time now.  </p>

<p>The root of the fight was two years ago when Janet lived at Carol's house.  Janet was in a very unfortunate situation and needed help.  But Janet began to take advantage of Carol.  Eventually Carol put her foot down and called out Janet for her behavior.  Janet moved out and and hasn't forgiven Carol since.</p>

<p>From my point of view Carol has reached out a couple times to fix the relationship and apologize but Janet rebuffs these attempts.</p>

<p>This is where it feels tricky. Our family will still hang out with both Janet and Carol (though not together).  Carol feels a little hurt that it feels everyone is condoning Janet's behavior - which is somewhat true.  As they are both adults it feels awkward to call out Janet.  It's gotten to the point where Carol doesn't feel welcome anymore and is moving out of state.  </p>

<p>I can talk to Carol openly about it.  If I bring it up to Janet, or suggest she lets things go, she will become very cold.  </p>

<p>It has had far reaching effects on all our siblings.  If any kind of party is held, Janet won't come if Carol is there and vice versa.  It is hard to quantify but this has caused great emotional anguish for my parents and other siblings.</p>

"What is the best way to begin a discussion around a compromise for our wedding location with my fiancée?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My fiancée and I recently got engaged and we've started talking about weddings. She's from Michigan and I'm from Georgia. Our families still live in those respective areas, but we met and currently live in the DC area. The problem lies in actually figuring out where we want to have the wedding.</p>

<p>She has always had a grand vision of getting married in Michigan that I only recently found out about after getting engaged. It includes getting ready at her parents house, getting married at her childhood church, and have her entire extended family in Michigan come, among other things. Her mom is also very particular for what she wants for our wedding because it's her only daughter. While my fiancée doesn't know some of the bigger decisions (where the reception will be, how many people, etc.), she already knows a florist, a caterer for one night of the wedding, where she'd get her wedding dress, that she wants to get married in her childhood church, and a few other odds and ends.</p>

<p>While I don't have a preference on the specifics of the wedding currently (flowers, what kind of cake, type of ceremony, etc.), I would like for us to get married in the DC area because that's where we live, where are mutual friends are, and where we've started our life together. I also have little connection to Michigan other than she is from there and her family lives there. I know DC will be much more expensive, but my worry is if we do it in Michigan, she and her mom will make the decisions (which is the same worry her mom has about us if we do the wedding in DC). I have this fear mostly because her mom is a very strong willed person and my fiancée has a really hard time saying no to her mom for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How do I approach discussing a compromise on our wedding location?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Some answers to common FAQs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who is paying for the wedding?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My fiancée and I want to pay for most of it ourselves, however both sets of parents have agreed to help</p>

  <p>Do you have a budget worked out?</p>

<p>Yes. We have a rough estimate of how many people we want to invite and about how much that will cost per person</p>

"Could expressed attraction be an absolute prevention of someone feeling attraction to me?","<p>For as long as I can remember having first experienced love I've had trouble finding a partner and building a strong relationship.  More so, the only relationships I found, followed the pattern, that my partner was usually as desperate as I was to find a relationship, it was just a matter of days getting together and the relations rarely hold for longer than a few weeks.</p>

<p>Having been observing others I feel like what happens to me is different from what happens to others, as no matter how weird someone is in their looks or personality they at some point just get into a relationship, no matter if actively looking for it or not. Even those not actively looking to get into a relationship usually have more success in finding someone feeling attracted to them than I had while still desperately trying to find someone to get a relationship with.</p>

<p>For years I've been trying to figure out what the reason for this might be, and made it often a topic to talk about with my therapist. We came up with a lot of reasons that might be the source but due to trial and error behavior I figured out, most of them didn't have any impact on the outcome.</p>

<p>Talking about it with friends they usually tell me ""Don't get so desperate finding the right one takes some time."" And while I agree on that one, that's not my point.
As to be clear about it, in my whole life, thinking back into the 5th/6th grade, I never got a love letter from anyone, despite everyone(!) else receiving them a few times. I never had a ""date"" with someone in my late teen age. It was always from the very beginning pointed out if I had an appointment with an girl I liked ""This is just friendship, don't consider it a date."" And even the recent years, people just keep pointing out if a relation to someone gets more intense, that I shouldn't expect anything but friendship from it.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>The fact that I have autism makes it difficult for me to conceal that I feel attracted to someone, probably making my attraction to them visible very early. And the way I experience attraction is from what I know way more intense for an autist than for an <a href=""https://crackedmirrorinshalott.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/autistic-allistic-neurodiverse-and-neurotypical-say-what/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">allist</a>.</p>

<p>So I started wondering if this might be (as slowly I am running out of ideas what else might be the reason for this) the reason that I fail to make (almost?) everyone unable to feel romantic attraction towards me?</p>

<p>To be clear, this is just a yes/no question supported by some kind of evidence.</p>

"Etiquette at communion for someone who is not religious","<p><em>I'm an agnostic young adult living in America</em></p>

<p>A few years ago my family and I were at a Lutheran church because my cousin was becoming a pastor. Throughout the whole ceremony I did what I saw others doing- kneeling when they did, singing along, putting my hands together in prayer, etc. I didn't really know what I was doing but I was trying to fit in:<br />Then everyone got out of their seats and lined up to for the juice/water/etc. and communion wafers at the front. I followed my family and people in front of me and received and ate a communion wafer.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I found out from my boyfriend's family that one is not supposed to eat a communion wafer before one's first communion(? I think that's what I heard them say anyway)<br />His aunt was more upset by this and said I would be going to hell in a concerned and sad way. My boyfriend's family is Catholic but himself and his siblings are much less religious than their parents and grandparents.<br />His aunt also said she wouldn't even participate in a communion at a church she did not attend as it would be disrespectful. However his mother said she thinks it's proper etiquette to participate even if you don't attend the church.</p>

<p>This was all new to me and I'm mortified by how I must have looked during my cousin's ceremony. I really wouldn't have taken a communion wafer if I knew I wasn't supposed to. Most people there probably weren't disturbed by my family's actions as we were not confronted and maybe at worst some were thinking: “ignorance of the law is no excuse”</p>

<p>But <strong>what is the etiquette for participating at a communion for someone who is not religious?</strong> The different perspectives I got from my boyfriend's mother and aunt sort of confuse me. I aim to learn more to properly show respect next time.</p>

"How can I ask my housemate to put my things back?","<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>A housemate of mine is doing something to my property which I don't like. Please help me in finding a solution towards the greater issue of solving housemate disputes.</p>

<p>Some mornings, a housemate of mine likes to prepare smoothies in her blender. Next to her blender are my coffee grinder and filter coffee machine. I've never seen her use it, as I'm normally in my room at the time, but I can <em>hear</em> it being used.</p>

<p>Every time I've heard it being used, when I walk into the kitchen, I'll find that my coffee grinder is on top of my filter coffee machine. I imagine that she needs the space.</p>

<h1>Objectives</h1>

<ol>
<li>I want to make sure that my coffee grinder is put back in place.</li>
<li>I want to find out why my coffee grinder is being put where it is. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Reasons</h1>

<ol>
<li>I expect my things to be put back where they live.</li>
<li>Less importantly, the coffee grinder might be knocked off the coffee machine.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>I recently got extremely angry with this housemate after being woken up by a string of washing machine runs in the middle of the night, and a final one very early in the morning. I later found out that some other housemates participated in this. The issue was resolved, but a lot of stressful consequences followed.</p>

<p>I want to think about how to solve similar housemate issues instead in an amicable, calm, but stern way without creating new issues.</p>

<li>Is my objective reasonable?</li>
<li>Reason 2. is less important. In that light, should I mention it? My objective would still be fulfilled, but she would be able to think that it was just from my worry of it falling, and not telling her to change her ways.</li>

"Confronting my girlfriend's sister about trying to cuddle with us","<p>When visiting my girlfriend's family, my girlfriend and I will usually wind up on a couch with the typical light-cuddling of a couple in a room with other people--legs across the other's lap, leaning on each other, arms around shoulders, etc.</p>

<p>Thing is, she and her sister also tend to do that stuff when the two of them are on a couch together. When that happens, I don't presume to join them. I don't want to make her sister uncomfortable. But when my girlfriend and I are like that already on the couch, her sister has no problem with hopping in and making it a cuddle pile.</p>

<p>However, even though she made it this way, the sister seems somewhat uncomfortable with her and I touching anywhere and seems really uncomfortable whenever I move in any way that changes how we are touching even slightly--even if I'm moving away from her.</p>

<p>I don't want her to do this if she's gonna be uncomfortable and thereby make me uncomfortable. I also don't want to 'lose territory' on my SO to her, like when I have my arm around my SO, and have to take it off to do something for a second, and then when I go to put it back, her sister's arm is now there, and her body language is not inviting our arms to both be there. I don't like that. </p>

"Colleague thinks that he is too slow","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I am frequently working with a colleague who is a little bit junior to me (but not particularly ""fresh"" - he has been in the company for over 10 years in a lead developer/expert role for some other software). He is relatively new in our team, with me as his primary coach, so I, by definition, know much more about our particular project/software, but that's about it - apart from that he's as mature as one could ask for. I never was his disciplinary boss, and am not a formal team-lead or project-lead in that particular project (I am one of the two most senior persons involved, by time and knowledge).</p>

<p>He has, in the past year, really gotten into the project and proven his capabilities more than once; implementing new components in a very self-sufficient-while-team-oriented way, communicating directly with customers, and being overall very commendable. He gets positive feedback from everybody around him, all the time, including the product owner and all relevant stakeholders.</p>

<p>He is very methodical in his approach to everything; he will double-check shell command lines before hitting enter; double-check lines of code before saving/compiling; and he noticably thinks before talking. This is <em>not</em> obnoxiously slow, it is <em>not</em> annoying, it does not come across as being ""stupid"", but I suspect he thinks it is/does.</p>

<p>He will do his utmost to find information or solve problems on his own, but will call me when he cannot. Our typical conversations (usually by phone, as we are in separate cities) go like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Them: I am sorry, I have to annoy you again.</p>
  
  <p>Me: No problem, what can I do for you?</p>
  
  <p>... we work on some issue ...</p>
  
  <p>Them <em>(while typing)</em>: Sorry, this will surely annoy you hugely, I am sooo slow.</p>
  
  <p>Me: No problem, it's fine...</p>
  
  <p>Them <em>(while learning something new, which he cannot possibly know)</em>: I am so sorry that you have to waste so much time on me...</p>
  
  <p>Me: No problem, I like sharing know-how...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so on and so forth. At every step, he will complain how slow/annoying he is, and how sorry he is for annoying me, and that he doesn't know things.</p>

<p>Nothing of what he complains about does in fact annoy me. I am very glad that he is here, he has (together with other new colleagues who joined the team at the same time, and whom he has worked together for many years) taken a large part of work away from me that was overwhelming me before. We are all very easy with each other, there is mutual consent about almost everything. I would rather have him call more often than less often.</p>

<p>In the parts of the software which he has inherited from me, he has taken on full responsibility, but he has also gotten complete freedom to do as he like within our coding guidelines; he has constant access to me and other team colleagues for peer reviews, help, information about historic areas of the code and such.</p>

<p>I have, in the past flat out told him that nothing of what he does annoys me, that he is doing great (which he measurably is); I have explicitely voiced that I do not expect him to magically know things about our software or infrastructure that he cannot know, and that I'd rather have him ask me than try to find something in the sparse documentation. It is true that I am typing and coding <em>very</em> fast in comparison with him because I know every nook and cranny of that software environment; but I certainly have not rubbed it in, and concerning the actual results he is not in any way slower than other people. Any typing speed issues are masked by slow Webex/Skype connections anyways. ;)</p>

<p>He has been this way from day 0; it's one of the first things I noticed about him (not only towards me, but also others, including colleagues from his old team).</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>Recently, he has voiced doubts about being in the right spot because he seems to be so slow. It would be a nightmare for me if he quit the team - he does a <em>lot</em> of good work, everybody is happy with him, etc.</p>

<p>Do you have suggestions how I could behave, what I could say or do to make it easier for him? I would love if he would be confident in his role. Obviously, stating objective facts (like ""you used X hours for feature Y; I needed the same time for a comparably difficult feature Z - you are as fast as me"") or pointing out the happy customer/colleagues does not do it.</p>

"Dealing with people who always try to prove you wrong in a conversation","<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<p>You have an acquaintance, who would probably be really good at turncoat (the game in which one person has to rapidly switch sides again and again on a topic). Whenever you bring up any topic for conversation, their prime goal is to <em>contradict you and prove you wrong</em>, regardless of their opinion on the matter. </p>

<p>For example, consider the following <em>two hypothetical conversations:</em></p>

<li><p>Case 1:</p>

  <p><strong>Them:</strong> Are you <em>kidding</em> me? That sort of technology has been proven to be infeasible by scientists at MIT! </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Case 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You:</strong> Have you heard of Hyperloop? Far-fetched, don't you think?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Them:</strong> Far-fetched? <em>For your information</em>, Elon Musk has already started trials of the prototype!</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>You get the point.They always want to <strong>'prove' you wrong,</strong> regardless of whether the <strong>'facts' they quote are accurate or not.</strong> In the hypothetical conversations stated above, they could easily pick either side of the argument and go on to 'prove' they're right!</p>

<p>If their arguments are <strong>weak</strong> <em>(consider case 1)</em>, you often debate with them and defeat them,  but it gives little satisfaction as they just smirk. Plus, you're a pacifist and don't like arguing.</p>

I did this for about a week and every pull request I made to include the fixes (with rather detailed descriptions) was closed.

We were all by her side but my stupidity surfaced when they saw a picture of 'her ex' with that girl he was supposed to stay away from in a very inappropriate pose on social media. She was broken and realized he was cheating on her all this 1 year and some months. </p>

<p>And I misunderstood that picture to be a private picture of my friend's and mistakenly told my boyfriend, who in turn told her ex's best friend and so yesterday or so he got to know and must have raged on her. I thought she had deactivated her social media so I called her and she explained what happened after my boyfriend told that guy. She was sad and feeling guilty that she lied to him and told me when she hadn't told anyone about the 'private picture' I understand my mistake but I don't know how to fix things.</p>

<p>She has said we are done! I don't want to lose another friend as I have always been losing all.</p>

<p>She isn't talking to me and I think she's back with that guy, I can't even confront my boyfriend because then it'd get complicated and transferred further. I was stupid but what now?</p>

<p>She is my bestest friend since past 2 years and a very supportive friend since 4 years. I don't want to see her alone and lose her. She has isolated herself from everyone else. How can I save my relationship with her? Please help.</p>

"How to persuade a coworker we both need to do our own work?","<p>I recently started on a new team, with a single fellow developer. Under the motto of 'getting her up to speed as quick as possible', my co-worker has spent the past week sitting at my desk (open office space, yet a few desks reserved for the team so he's always close) and telling me what to write down. And by that I mean spelling everything out, he's not telling me 'this is what your code should do' but he's literally telling me to write down <code>System.out.println(""Hello World"");</code>. </p>

<p>I'm not new when it comes to the language I'm programming in, so I don't need this kind of heavy guidance. He's explaining me things I already know, telling me to write down things I already know perfectly well how to write down. When he <em>does</em> end up explaining/mentioning some new trick, his way of 'explaining' allows very little/ no time to actually write stuff down or practice, so information has a very low chance of actually being retained well. </p>

<p>He's constantly asking (every 15/30 minutes, sometimes every hour) to see code that isn't finished yet, tells me the bits that are done are great, and then just goes on to dictate the next step, the next line of code, that I haven't had time to develop on my own yet. </p>

<p>Over the past week, I've tried to convince him that I am in fact, capable of doing a lot of the stuff he has been explaining to me and that it may be more productive if he started working on his own portion of work for this sprint. </p>

<p>I started by simply asking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'Thank you. I think I got the rest of this, mind if I try on my own for a while? I'll let you know if I need your help'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, I've pointed out directly that this way of working isn't productive. I've met his remarks with 'I know', I've typed ahead without him saying anything. I've shown that I can do stuff on my own, I've also shown that I will ask him for help as soon as I get seriously stuck (even a few times figuring out what was the problem before he did). I've asked him multiple times to let me figure things out on my own, then showing that I am indeed capable of doing so, which he seems to confirm. Sometimes it results in being able to work on my own for 10 minutes, sometimes for up to an hour, sometimes it doesn't seem to register and he just continues talking. But he always checks in really soon after. </p>

<p>I'm a bit at a loss here, as he's not giving me signals that he thinks I'm actually a bad programmer that needs this heavy guidance, nor are there any signals that he thinks I'm e.g. working too slow. The only reason I got from him for doing this is 'that I want you up to speed as soon as possible'. When I asked directly if my current pace of working is too slow, I got a 'no, not at all' and a 'now, type this:...'.</p>

<p><strong>Given what I've already tried, and his reactions to it, would there be any other way to persuade my co-worker to let me do my work and that he should focus on his own work?</strong></p>

<p>I know I can always escalate this to management/scrum masters, but I'd really like to make one last attempt without a mention of escalating if at all possible. </p>

"How do I ask my friends to be more self-sufficient?","<p>I sometimes answer rather bluntly/harshly to close friends (this includes my SO as well) over a question during our gaming session because it's either something I already answered or something that they can find because it's right in front of their eyes.</p>

<p>Let me give you some example, first with my best friend with whom I often play video games with. We started a game yesterday called For Honor as they released some free version of their game. To acquire the game it required to log into your Ubisoft account to add the game to your library and my friend asked me (we are far away from each other playing online) if he had a Ubisoft account to which I responded rather quickly/bluntly ""How the f### am I supposed to know if you have a Ubisoft account"" because I'm not his mom and clearly not keeping track of every single account / launcher my friends have.</p>

<p>Fast forward 3 hours when we both downloaded the game, first coop mission it's some kind of tutorial when you have to block an enemy on the left, right and top. He then asks me what he should do while I finished doing the guard tutorial and the game tells me that I have to wait for my mate to continue, I'm perplex as there is a clear objective in the top left corner telling you to do this or that which is common to most games these days. I got annoyed again and told him ""Are you even looking at your screen or just asking me before doing anything?"". Don't remember my exact words but something along these lignes.</p>

<p>For the record this happens in most games that we start playing together. This is even more annoying if I have already played a game and he has not because he'll enter follow mode and I'll just play solo with my friend following blindly (I tried running in the opposite direction of the arrow indicating the quest location and he follows) which is not fun at all. For some context my friend is a gamer he has over 5000 hours of play time spread over several games on Steam.</p>

<p>Another example is with my SO, we sometimes play video games and I try to be cooler about it as she clearly doesn't have my friends experience in video games, but I will often find myself getting angry at her. For example playing a game called Portal Knights where you, among other things, can craft items. We for some reason would have to craft Item X and she would ask me ""How do I craft this"" to which I would answer ""Well you open the craft menu and look if you find the item in one of the category so you can craft it"". But then we would have some other quest 15 minutes after asking us to craft something else and she would again ask me again and I would answer bluntly ""Are you even searching through your craft menu ?"".</p>

<p>I think I'm reacting like this because I personally hate to depend on people (directly I mean, by asking someone) until I absolutely have to, I mean I won't post on StackOverflow until I've look at the first 3 page of the search result and nothing comes up. I like finding stuff on my own. Plus while I'm ok to explain some ""advanced"" concept that may not be obvious/explained in the game tutorial, I think it's best my friends/SO find out things on their own regarding basic stuff that you can find rather easily / are explained clearly in the tutorial.</p>

<p>My goal is to deal with the situations described above and instead of snapping, in a preventive way convey that in one hand while I'm ok to lead the way I'd like to play with my friend and not for him(by that I mean ordering him to go here, collect that, ..) and on the other that it would be in my SO best interest to learn how to search on her own instead of having to ask me every 30 seconds how to do this or that (something like teach someone how to fish instead of giving him the fish).</p>

<p><strong>My question is how do I effectively convey to my friends / SO that I would like them to be more self-sufficient when it comes to our gaming session ?</strong></p>

<p>Some context : I'm a 25yo male living in France.
I'm not currently under stress and these interactions don't end up in a fight but just in my friend/SO shutting down because I snapped at them.</p>

"What can I do when I know someone is acting deliberately but pretending otherwise so I cannot confront them without looking bad?","<p>I work at an institution of higher education.  One of our employee benefits is a generous tuition reimbursement if we take classes here.  I decided to take advantage of this and go back to school, finish my degree by scheduling classes part time around the FT job that allows me the benefit of this education.</p>

<p>I have a departmental boss who constantly pays lip service to being supportive of me and my career, including my decision to pursue my degree.  Yet she constantly does things to undermine me and make life harder for me than necessary.  Just as one example (and believe me it is only one of many, just happens to be the most recent and least complicated to explain), we have a quarterly potluck in our department to celebrate staff birthdays from that quarter.  She has known for a week now that I have a final exam on a particular morning next week -- yet she decided to schedule staff meeting for that same morning and just now rescheduled the potluck simultaneously, ensuring I won't be able to attend or enjoy it -- when I am, in fact, one of the staff members whose birthday is being (belatedly) celebrated.</p>

<p>Like I said this isn't the only example. There's a particular task which is not something I was hired for but is something people tend to dump on me because they don't want to deal with it.  Not only does she refuse to back me up in empowering the other staff to handle that matter themselves (only involving me if it is absolutely necessary) but on at least half a dozen separate occasions over the past semester she dumped ""rush rush"" type stress on me on class days trying to interfere with my class time and then come to find out she can't be bothered to put the stamp of approval on the end result of that task until hours later anyway -- so all the stress and ""rush rush"" vibe was just literally an exercise in making me feel like my class time was threatened, nothing more.</p>

<p>We have a flextime policy at my workplace -- but she refuses to use it, refuses to budge for even a reasonable accommodation.  Check me on this, but I do not believe 45 minutes for two days per week at a convenient hour (phased in with lunch hour) is even remotely infeasible let alone unreasonable.  There is literally almost never a day in my work life where anything is so time sensitive it would matter if I were gone for an hour.  I could understand not wanting to accommodate that every day of the week, but 45 minutes, for two days only, easily made up at the end of the day or split to beginning and end, is not an unreasonable request.  She simply refuses to budge and just makes a lot of noise and excuses about how my job has to come first and I need to be here, etc.  She talks like I'm some teenager who doesn't ""get it"" and needs that kind of micromanagement.  For the record, my role is in IT -- it is knowledge-based and results-driven; it is not a clock punching role in the first place.  On top of all that, I'm middle-aged and have been working full time my entire life since the age of 19, probably more years than some of you reading here have been alive!</p>

<p>This is not the first time I've had to deal with someone pulling this kind of crap on me, but I'll be first to admit this is one problem in life I have never managed to master handling properly.  I <em>KNOW</em> for a FACT she is doing this crap on purpose, and it is really making me angry.  Of course that makes it much harder to approach the situation calmly and objectively; my emotions get in the way.</p>

<p>How can I make this crap stop?  I'm too old for this.  I just don't need or want this in my life.  But I can't say anything to her or anyone else about it, because she will just deny it of course and say how ridiculous that I would think such a thing, blah blah blah.  When we talk she seems congenial and genuine, and I don't dislike her completely (outside of this problem), but this just leaves me feeling like I'm being gaslit to hell and back.  <strong>Her actions don't match her words</strong>, but I feel trapped, there's nowhere to go with this, and I KNOW it's deliberate -- it's too consistent to NOT be deliberate -- yet if I try to tell anyone else that, or if I try to confront her with it, I know it will go nowhere and might even make things worse for me.</p>

<p>How can I make this stop?  And how can I get the actual practical support I need for some reasonable accommodation for my classes?  I have no control over when classes are scheduled, I'm being as reasonable as I can, and nothing I need to take is available at night, FYI.  Thanks.</p>

"How to communicate to strangers that we don't want our children to believe in Santa Claus when they ask them?","<p>My wife and I have small children who are finally old enough to realize that December is a special time of year (ages 4 and 2). For a myriad of reasons my wife and I have decided we won't present ""Santa Claus"" to our children in the traditional, American sense. We will tell them about the legend, but when it comes to who leaves presents for them we won't say it was this mythical, bearded man. </p>

<p>Anyway, that's probably a tangent and appropriate for the Parenting SE. My question for this group is: what's the most concise, appropriate way to answer a person when they ask my kid(s) if they're ""excited for Santa Claus to come?""  We are in the US.</p>

<p>The older children have special needs, so we often respond for them because strangers typically do not understand their speech. </p>

<p>At a store the other night I interjected and re-phrased the question to my kid: ""||daughter's name||, are you excited for <em>Christmas</em>?"" Which felt like a more natural way to rephrase the question. </p>

<p>I suppose my question applies not only to strangers at the store but also to distant family and friends who, as is totally normal and expected, assume our kids are getting lots of great toys from ""Santa."" We want to not just smile and nod; we want to be true to our conviction without appearing ""holier than thou.""</p>

Sometimes, while I'm doing this, I'll notice that one of the passengers who are sitting beside me or standing behind me are secretly watching what I'm doing on my phone. I find this situation so uncomfortable that I may have to stop chatting with friends or close the website I'm using.</p>

"Strange interactions with a relative/coworker preemptively deflecting blame","<p>There's someone I deal with regularly -- let's call her Betty.  Betty and I are closely related and we work together on various projects that she directs.  Sometimes I run into a difficult situation with Betty that I haven't been able to figure out.  It usually goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Betty: How's it going?<br>
  Me: Frustrating.  My widgets are all out of sequence, so I'm putting them back the way they were.</p>
  
  <p>Betty: I didn't get them out of order.<br>
  Me: I didn't say it was you, I'm just frustrated that someone got them out of order.</p>
  
  <p>Betty: They were all jumbled up when you left for the weekend.<br>
  Me: That's not good, since I had just put them back in sequence.  I'll talk to the rest of the team and see what happened.</p>
  
  <p>Betty: Don't do that.  Nobody else would have touched them.<br>
  Me: Well, there's only me, you, and other people.  If it wasn't me and it wasn't you, then it was someone else.</p>
  
  <p>Betty: I don't know why you had them out of order.  You're making a big deal out of this.  Let's just get stuff done.</p>

<p>This interaction doesn't sit well with me because:</p>

<ol>
<li>I come away feeling like I'm the bad guy for making accusations against Betty, when that wasn't my intention at all.</li>
<li>It makes me feel like I must be interfering with work to just be a troublemaker.</li>
<li>I end up doubting my own memory of events, which is deeply unsettling.</li>
<li>Thinking about the interaction later, I end up angry at Betty.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there anything I can do to improve the way Betty and I are interacting?  We're going to be working together for another few months at least, and we'll be close relatives till one of us dies, so this is a very important relationship to me.</p>

"How best to address a former teacher","<p>I'm a 22-year-old college student soon to be entering my final semester of my undergraduate degree. For the second time this semester (and for entirely unrelated occasions), I've been contacted by former teachers via e-mail. Both of these teachers are figures from my elementary school, which runs from Kindergarten through 5th grade where I'm from. It is unlikely that I've interacted with either person since entering the 6th grade and certainly not within the past five years. Both cases have involved requests of me to return to my elementary school and speak with students about the academic and professional experiences I've had throughout college.</p>

<p>I'm perfectly comfortable with responding to these requests up but I'm unsure of how to address the e-mail. On one hand, every encounter I've ever had with either teacher occurred prior to my teenage years -- addressing them by anything other than ""Ms."" or ""Mr."" seems strange. On the other hand, I'm an adult and the power balance inherent in the teacher-student relationship we once had has dissolved, so it seems equally strange to maintain the formality.</p>

<p>I realize I am probably overthinking this but it's the second incident in recent times that I've faced this question. <strong>What is the correct way to address one of your former teachers in a casual setting?</strong> Is it improper to address a former teacher by their first name unless invited to, or is it more awkward to maintain the formality? My question was spurred by an e-mail, but I'm from a relatively small town and the chances of me encountering a former teacher while out and about back home are high, so I'm curious as to what the proper etiquette is in a more general sense.</p>

"How can I ask my neighbors - so that I will have an honest answer - who is the owner of this trespassing cat?","<p>I know that this matter is not strictly ""interPERSONAL"", but that's the problem -- I know there's a cat but I don't know who the owner is.</p>

<p>All I know is, the home owner association I live under is the stereotypical one run by spiteful old people. We do have a mailing list, but posting a complaint/plea there would more likely cause them glee than give me a straight answer.</p>

<p>We are 37 households, and only we and 2 others have (small) kids -- the rest are pensioners. We are talking with only two other households; there is not a lot of communal spirit here -- the first HOA meeting I attended, about a week after we moved in, made it clear to me (in ways I shall not go into here) just how hostile, ludicrously infantile, and petty these people are (even towards each other, not just ""newcomers""). Later, I requested that the run-down communal play area receive a bit of maintenance, only to be shot down rather rudely. I am decidedly not in good standing in their minds, and that is why I cannot think they would be very inclined to help me avoid their cat's poop in my garden.</p>

<p>I don't mind cats (or dogs, birds, etc.) but I very specifically don't want a pet in my household. Yet I have a problem that I'm unsure of how to deal with <em>in a reasonable way</em>. This is all in Denmark, so US laws and customs may not apply.</p>

<p>This year, a cat has been pooping in our garden, and ripping out grass or whatever else was around the scene of the crime, to cover it up. I obviously don't want this to continue (I would like my garden un-ripped, and my two small daughters would prefer it un-pooped-in also). It also has been leaving little puke pies around our cars in the drive way, which are quite disgusting, too.</p>

<p>But how do I stop the cat? I have tried planting ""scaredy cat"" plants, whose smell were supposed to discourage cats from coming near, but they don't work. I have also tried putting down metal webbing in the flower beds (because I heard that they don't like to step on such things and/or can't dig in it), and while that worked I can't extend that practice across my entire lawn.</p>

<p>Local law says that it's the responsibility of the pet owner to make sure that one's pet does not annoy others. This means I should go talk to the owner of said cat and ask them to keep the cat out of my garden. To which I would object: (a) I am convinced that <em>no</em> cat owner would agree to confining their cat because it roams in places that other people don't want it to; and (b) I don't even know whose cat this is! I have caught a glimpse of one cat, and followed it to the garden of a neighbour who has a cat door in their front door -- I am aware that this says absolutely zero about whether it's their cat or not. I have obviously not been able to read the chip or tattooed number in the cat's ear either.</p>

<p>How can I ask my neighbors - so that I will have an honest answer - who is the owner of this trespassing cat?</p>

"How to make a friend stop his racists jokes?","<p>I am in a group of friends of 5 people. We're all white, male, in our mid to late twenties. The group was formed from working together on the same group projects at the university. Obviously, over time, friendships are formed and the level of comfort within the group increases. It is common to make jokes amongst ourselves and just talk about random topics. </p>

<p>Lately, I've begun to notice that one member (let's call him Bob) of the group tends to occasionally make racially insensitive remarks. They haven't been necessarily malicious but they are of quite poor taste. Now, I understand that sometimes people let loose in a group of friends and make jokes that you maybe wouldn't make anywhere else, however it makes me feel uncomfortable and even embarrassed whenever Bob makes the jokes that he has been making.</p>

<p>Couple of examples:</p>

<p>1) Another friend (Charlie) was approached in the gym by a black woman offering to play ping-pong with him. From what Charlie said, the woman seemed to have an unusual laugh and voice which made Charlie laugh and tell us all about in the group chat, which in itself is fine - sometimes you meet a person that has a weird trait and it makes you laugh, fine. However, when discussing the matter, Bob jumped in and felt it was necessary to bring that woman's skin color into the discussion. He went as far as comparing the woman to an ape and then making a generalization that all black people are apes. - Not only does it feel in extremely poor taste but also ignorant. Humans have all evolved from apes so why was there a need to say specifically that black people are apes?</p>

<p>2) A slightly vulgar comic was shared in our group chat about a white farmer molesting his sheep. Bob didn't appreciate the comic because it was ""factually incorrect"". He felt like the skin color of the farmer was not accurate. He didn't specify which skin color it should've been but made it clear that the skin color of the farmer should be changed for the comic to be funny.</p>

<p>We all live in Europe in the same city so growing up we weren't really exposed to diversity. However, you would think that someone obtaining their master's degree would have a little bit more sense and acceptance in them. Not only are Bob's racial jokes unfunny and offensive, they also make him sound ignorant and like a racist. I also feel embarrassed for him because I feel like if anyone outside from our group saw those jokes, they would think Bob is a moron and by association so would everyone else in the group.</p>

<p>The other people in the group do not seem to be bothered by it. They don't encourage Bob but they surely don't make it known that the jokes are in poor taste. Generally they insert a generic smiley as a reaction to those jokes.</p>

<p>I've made it known that I am bothered by these jokes (specifically said it after the 1st example). As expected, the response was that I'm overreacting and people are just having fun. Any further Bob's jokes, I've just ignored to make it clear that I want no part in that.</p>

<p>So the question is, how am I supposed to deal with that kind of person? Bob is actually a nice person most of the time and his jokes are often funny, it's just that those specific jokes really bother me. So, how can I make Bob stop those racist jokes? </p>

<p>P.S. I'm also not really a confrontational person so I'd often rather not confront someone about an issue.</p>

"How to tell my violin teacher who's interested in me that I'm actually married after I sent positive signals back for months?","<p>I'm a 30 year old male and I've been married for 10 years. I work in an all-male environment. I don't have female friends. I have no male-female relationship experience outside of my marriage. In short, I suck at it.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I decided to learn to play violin. I hired a very attractive girl a few years younger than me, and made a big mistake of not telling her that I was married (I don't wear a ring). We talk a lot during our lessons and progressively I came to realize that she's attracted to me. She doesn't flirt openly, but I know. The fact that I'm also attracted to her probably contributed to why I never said anything, because enjoying opposite sex attention after 10 years of a somewhat mundane relationship was very important to me, which is selfish and I blame myself for that. I mirrored her interest, i.e. I showed her signs that I was interested, too. Because I was and am, and I'm not used to controlling my emotional feedback.</p>

<p>Now comes a moment where I think she's about to ask me out very soon, especially with Christmas around the corner. I don't know what to do, because I can't bring myself to disappoint her by casually mentioning my wife in a conversation. I know it may be painful to her, because it sure is very painful for me to know that this thing cannot lead anywhere. I don't want to cause her any suffering, because I care about her. I realize that this mess is my fault entirely...</p>

<p>What is the least painful way to tell her that I'm married? Is there any way to turn this into a friendship? Leaving my wife or having an affair is not even on the table.</p>

"When trying to break into a new social group, how can I gently dissuade someone in the group from isolating me and asking me question after question?","<p>I went on a social outing to a pub. I signed up to this social outing because it was in my area and I thought it would be fun and maybe I could make some friends. This person messaged me through the website I signed up for this outing beforehand and said he was looking forward to seeing me. I said you too (just being polite). I actually went to this outing because I wanted to, not because he was there, because I want to make new friends. </p>

<p>We were all talking, as in group talk, taking turns just shooting the breeze, not talking about anything in particular. And then one member of the group left the venue, and this person moved to sit next to me and started asking me questions one after the other. He seemed to know things about me that I hadn't told him, and I asked him how he knew these things, and he said he'd looked at my profile. So for example he said ""What are you doing for the rest of the day?"" And I didn't say much, then he said, ""Writing?"" And I said ""How do you know that?"" He paused for a moment and said ""I looked at your profile."" </p>

<p>At that point I felt creeped out (it was an involuntary response) and started to grow uncomfortable in the face of his constant questioning. He kept up with what pets I own, where I grew up, what I do for a living, etc. It was making me uncomfortable. He was staring intently at me and the other people in the group were talking amongst themselves so he had broken us off from them. </p>

<p>So I gave very short, one word answers. He kept going, though, so I tried flipping it back at him immediately, i.e. if he asked 'do you like such-and-such?' I would say 'well, do you like such-and-such?' But he kept on with his questioning so I stared at the TV away from him. Then I thought this might seem a bit rude, so I focused my attention instead on someone else in the group who was talking to another person, and then he did too, and he finally stopped asking me questions. We all left soon after that so I was able to avoid being questioned by him any more. </p>

<p>Later on after we left he sent another message saying he enjoyed seeing me and looked forward to seeing me again. </p>

<p>I don't really know him very well. I only met him once before. I have no idea what he's like; I'm sure he's a nice enough guy, I just really hate being interrogated. If anyone did that to me I would instantly find them repulsive and want to get away from them. This is just how I feel. I can't really help it. </p>

<p>Next time we went to trivia (they invited me) but there were too many people so  they said, 'we'll split into two groups. So-and-so knows all the answers, we'll put him in a group on his own.' Then they kept saying, 'Who wants to be with so-and-so?' And I got the feeling they wanted me to say 'I do!' But after the first time and all the intense questioning, I really, really did not want to be alone with him. If he started asking me questions again I knew I would feel uncomfortable again so I stayed where I was. So another woman reluctantly got up and said, 'I will be with so-and-so.' </p>

<p>In the future, though, I may not be able to avoid him, so what can I do? How can I gently dissuade him from interrogating me, without hurting him or making the rest of the group think I'm stuck up? </p>

"How to have a talk with a coworker I'm scared of?","<p>First off: I tagged this as Asperger since having Asperger's makes me have trouble understanding others' motivations, thoughts, and interests, as long as they differ from mine. That means, to understand the actions of someone I need to understand that person's motivations and the best way to achieve this is asking what thoughts have led someone to a specific result.</p>

<p>It's nearly impossible to achieve ""empathy"" by any other means.</p>

<p>This is what I made clear on the very first day at work with my coworker, we had an open talk where he told me that I came across like trying to criticize him on my first day by doing that and that he feels easily offended by critique. I offered him to keep my thoughts of improvement to myself and he said that he wants to hear it (I keep them anyway, as he even reacts passively aggressive to me sometimes on the mandatory questions to understand his work).</p>

<p>But today I came across something that bothered me so much, I had trouble keeping it to myself (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/46319579/2003898"">https://stackoverflow.com/q/46319579/2003898</a>)</p>

<p>I didn't confront him with it directly, but at the end of the day, I told him, that I found a different solution from his and would like to hear his thoughts about it when it's done.</p>

<p>In that moment he just immediately came over to my desk and repeatedly asked me like ""So show me, c'mon show me what you have done"" in a very pushy way.</p>

<p>I started feeling VERY insecure and I wasn't able to explain anything.</p>

<p>After I regained myself I tried to at least explain my idea to him, when he interrupted me with a phrase that was along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should focus more on doing your job instead of trying to show others how bad their work is. You know, I think you actually just criticize everyone to conceal your own lack of skills, I mean it's surely a lot of pressure to be underperforming as you do, isn't it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, he headed to our office's door frame and I just yelled ""You really offend me like this and then just call it a day?"", to which he simply responded with ""Yes, I do.""</p>

<p>This just caught me off guard and I feel so hurt, and as mentioned, right now I'm scared to go to work tomorrow, and even more scared to talk with him.</p>

<p>Anyway, I can't leave this like that.</p>

<p>I want to have a conversation with him tomorrow.
I want to ask him if he thinks there is any way to get over the feeling of being criticized by me all the time, as today was the first time after 5 months I mentioned (in)direct critic to his work, at all.</p>

<p>I in fact like him personally, and I like the job, but this working environment is a no-no if we can't find a solution.</p>

<p>And as for now, the question is:</p>

<p>How can I approach him without coming over as being critical again in regards to today's situation, and especially, how can I prevent him from ever doing to me again what he did today, as I just feel really, really awkward...</p>

"Should you point out a friend's flaws when they ask for insight into problems with another relationship?","<p>This has happened to me more than once.</p>

<p>I have a friend Sally who has annoyed me for certain reasons.  One day, Sally tells me that it seems like Jane has been annoyed with her but she does not know why.  When she explains what has been going on, it seems to me like Jane could be annoyed by the exact same things that I find annoying/off-putting about Sally.  I don't know Jane, so I can't say for sure.</p>

<p>How do I tell Sally that perhaps those things which annoy me (I've never told her that they annoy me) are what's annoying Jane?  Would I only mention them in the context of the situation with Jane, or do I also mention my personal experiences/grievances with Sally?</p>

<p>If it matters, in one instance Sally was extremely confused about what would cause Jane to distance herself from Sally.  She brainstormed a list of possible reasons but came up with counterarguments for each one to make them sound farfetched.  One or more of the items in her list are indeed things that bother me about Sally.</p>

<p><strong>For example, a reason Sally came up with:</strong> Perhaps Jane thinks I am trying to mooch off of her.<br>
<strong>Sally's counter-argument:</strong> But I offered to pay.<br>
<strong>My view</strong>: Sally is one the biggest moochers I know.<br>
Both from my experience and from the story she told me about Jane, the rare times that Sally does offer to pay are inappropriate.  For example, she may offer $5 for a half mile ride to her house.  While tempting to accept because she rarely offers up anything on her side, I would not feel right accepting money for such a short ride. </p>

<p>How could I tactfully react?</p>

"How to clearly communicate that you're asking someone on a date?","<p>It seems to me that it's sometimes difficult to both stay within the social protocol and also communicate your intentions clearly. </p>

<p>As an example of this, I once asked a girl I knew out to see a movie. At the time we were both in our early twenties and had known each other for a few months, but only saw each other rarely(1-3 times per month). When we did get the chance to talk though, we could talk for hours. As soon as I realized that I was attracted to her, I asked her out. I did this in person and made it as clear as I could that it was going to be just the two of us and that it's not going to be like our regular interactions. </p>

<p>The date itself went great, we both seemed to enjoy it, there was a clear flirtatious atmosphere and just in general it seemed to have that 'first date feeling' one tends to experience in such situations, especially when young. We watched a movie, went for a walk and finally decided to sit down in a random coffee shop. Again, none of this seemed out of the ordinary for a date(and honestly still doesn't).</p>

<p>When we were finally done with our coffee and started slowly heading home, I started moving the conversation towards setting up the next date, and to my surprise she literally asked me ""Was this a date?"" and seemed genuinely surprised that I considered it one. </p>

<p>Was there anything that I could have done from the start to avoid this situation? </p>

"How to be friends with a man, but not with his wife","<p>Background: I live in Germany and come from an eastern-european country, I am 30 and female. The man in question, let's call him Ben, is from Germany, he is 55, he recently married Alice, she's 40 and also comes from an eastern-european country (and speaks my language). Alice is a friend of my ex, through whom I met both Alice and Ben. We have seen each other only a handful of times.</p>

<p>So Ben is a nice guy, me and him have similar jobs, he's very considerate towards Alice and will do anything to make her happy. But he's pretty lonely since most of his friends have somehow lost touch with him (family lives and the like), he likes me a lot and wants to be friends with me. Me and his wife are passionate about the same sport where normally one needs a sports partner. So he really wants me and her to do this sport together.</p>

<p>The problem is, I don't want to be friends with Alice. She is totally not my type of person. She's a kind person, but - I'm sorry for being blunt - incredibly stupid. Please just believe me on this. Ben also knows this (everyone knows this). But he doesn't understand that the fact that Alice herself likes me doesn't make me like her. I don't want to go in for sports with her, sometimes that might involve going away for the whole weekend, and I most definitely don't want to spend my whole weekend with her. On the other side, I would probably like to stay friends with Ben because he is a nice person and I see that he needs a friend.</p>

<p>Another thought in the whole story is that I am inclined to believe that even being married Ben can't help having some romantic interest in me which might grow if I communicate with him more, which further complicates matters.</p>

<p>I am unsure how to handle this whole situation. So I guess I would like to ask, how could I tell Ben I can stay friends with him, but 1. with strictly no romance involved, 2. without having to communicate with his wife without him? I have told him numerous times I don't like her and why I don't like her, he doesn't understand and keeps telling me that she likes me. If all that goes wrong, I might opt for ending the whole friendship story with him altogether as well, but I really need to make it nice and not to hurt his and her feelings. Due to the same sport, I do bump into her sometimes and I don't want to cringe every time I do.</p>

<p>I hope I have made it clear. If questions arise, I will try to clarify.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I am sorry, I don't seem to see any comment button! Tried  in two browsers already, previously I was able to comment posts, but now I just don't see any button=((( I will answer the questions here then:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is alice aware that you don't like her, and why you dont like her? – yes, she very well is.</p></li>
<li><p>How/where/when do you interact outside of that sports thing? Is this specifically about asking him not to bring his wife to that sports thing anymore and only do the sport with you exclusively instead? – Ben does not do this sport. I communicate with him via messages and sometimes visit them. He just wants me to go in for sports with her, he knows both of us do it all the time and both of us are often in need of a partner. Visiting them is fine, I can handle her if he is there.</p></li>
<li><p>Could Ben be telling you he isn't interested in a friendship with you alone, that is why he is pushing you to his wife? – No, I am quite sure it's not the case. He just wants his wife to be happy and he actually thinks I will also benefit from communicating with her, but that will not be true.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>UPDATE 2: For the curious: I didn't write them for a while (actually since starting this topic), Ben wrote to me yesterday and I told him I have a feeling he likes me not just a friend, so it's not the best idea for us to communicate more. He seemed to understand, so I guess that was the easiest option after all.</p>

<p>When speaking to an audience with diverse and non-technical backgrounds; how can I effectively relate concepts to them?</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for a structure, a process, or technique I can use to simplify concepts ...and then organize the thoughts so they can be understood. Does this exist, or is there any method I can use?</p>

<p>Educators, and technical marketers likely have this information since they need to use this in their day-jobs.</p>

<li>What does it do? (sort, save, calculate)</li>
<li>How does it relate to the other pieces? (the line, and the endpoints of the line)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what I've picked up along the way, but think there must be several approaches for different types of learners. (e.g. visual learners, people who must write it down, or those with different intellectual propensities)</p>

"How to respond to someone when they ask ""How come you're still single?""","<p>I've been asked this question several times this year, mainly from family members but also from long-term friends. I don't feel <em>uncomfortable</em> being asked but I also don't feel <em>comfortable</em> with where the conversation goes, at the minute I've just been semi-honest. The responses vary from person to person, but I generally explain that the last relationship breakup was hard, or that I'm concentrating on my career, which then leads down to a spiral of more questions (sigh).</p>

<p>I'd prefer a response with abit of humour behind it, so I can deflect the conversation away from the question, or back to the person. </p>

<p><strong>How can I respond humourously to someone when they ask ""How come you're still single?"" to prevent further questions about my love life?</strong></p>

<p><sup><strong>Note</strong>: the answers should aim towards nonintermediate family, so it doesn't matter about their sense of humour or anything, just something potentially funny that indicates I'm not interested going down this road of conversation (even if they don't find it funny). </sup></p>

<p>This isn't a dupe as the other question isn't dead set on the type of response they want to have, I just purely want a humourous response only, regardless of the scenario. </p>

"How to keep a difficult phone conversation from escalating?","<p>I have scheduled a phone call with someone I have not spoken to in over two years. The only reason I am talking to them now is because it is very important to my family that I have a cordial, preferably friendly, relationship with this person (although this person is not related to me). I currently have very <em>strong</em> and very <em>negative</em> feelings about this person. My goal in talking with them is to understand what their attitude towards me is now, which will determine whether or not I try to rebuild the relationship. This is a personal relationship (as opposed to professional) and we are peers in terms of age, social status, cultural background, etc.</p>

<p>I am concerned because of what happened during a recent phone call with a different person, who I had similar emotions about. It was difficult for me to respond rationally and calmly in real time. (I already have trouble with serious discussions even when it's not a personal, emotional topic, because it takes me a while to process and decide what my position is and come up with the right wording for it.) <strong>I ended up losing my composure shortly into the conversation.</strong> I had been doing okay keeping emotion out of my voice despite growing more and more distressed, until they pushed the right button and it all came out.</p>

<p>I don't like being that sort of person. I also don't want them to think they have the upper hand, or for them to walk away saying they are the better person because I had an emotional response and they were ~just trying to talk~. (I mention this because my family has done this in the past to invalidate or ignore what I had to say.) <strong>I had enough self-control that I didn't say anything I regret, but I wish I had not been so emotional while saying it.</strong></p>

<p>It's worth noting that anger is only one of these emotions - there is also fear, distrust, sadness, disgust. So while anger management techniques may be useful, I'd appreciate answers which take other negative emotions into consideration as well.</p>

<p><strong>Things I tried:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rehearsing what I want to say</strong> - helped me remember to address my points, but I was still too emotional - even when rehearsing I'd get very upset imagining the conversation</li>
<li><strong>Playing through possible responses in my head</strong> - see above, didn't work; I was unable to predict new information they revealed and how they acted overall (I expect this to be even more of an issue with the upcoming call due to the time between when I last interacted with them)</li>
<li><strong>Ending the conversation</strong> - I hung up when I initially lost it, saying I clearly was unable to have a conversation about it, but they immediately called me back and insisted we couldn't keep not talking about the issue. I see their point; it's kind of a catch-22: I don't want to talk because I'm still too angry about it, but I'm still angry about it because we haven't talked and resolved it.</li>
</ul>

<p>(I am open to suggestions on better rehearsing and acting out scenarios, though. Maybe there are more structured approaches to try or resources I haven't utilized, rather than e.g. yelling at an imaginary person during my commute..)</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the upcoming call is that I don't know how they will act. Maybe they'll apologize and try to fix things -- or maybe they'll laugh in my face and tell me I'm a terrible person. I won't know until I talk to them.</p>

<p>I'd like to prepare some strategies before having this conversation, in case it does go poorly. <strong>What can I do to de-escalate high emotions during the conversation? What techniques can I use to keep it from escalating in the first place?</strong></p>

"How not to be rude when noticing people?","<p>I wasn't sure how to word my question so let me explain what I mean.</p>

<p>I currently work in a corporate setting where greeting and acknowledging people is important. It's awkward if you don't acknowledge people or don't seem natural doing it.</p>

<p>Here's a specific issue I'm having which I would like advice about. I do OK in one-on-one situations in terms of making eye contact and conversing. What I am apparently terrible at (judging by the reactions I get) is acknowledging people as I walk by them. When I try to acknowledge them with a little smile and a head nod, they often seem offended for some reason as though I'm staring them down (but it seems like I'm not...). On the other hand, if I don't acknowledge them at all, I think it comes across as either rude or excessively shy. </p>

<p>Another possible factor is that sometimes I see the same people over and over again, so it can be a little strange to have to greet them twenty times. But how much is too much and how little is too little? If I don't greet them after the first or second time, is that rude? Should I just pretend not to notice them?</p>

<p>If I attempt to self-criticize, it's possible the problem is this: I am the sort of person who notices absolutely everything and it is virtually certain that I will notice the other person before they notice me. The result of this is that I'm almost always looking at them (or nervously trying not to look at them again) when they notice me. But if this is the problem, I don't really know how to deal with it. Any ideas?</p>

<p>This is all very awkward and confusing for me.</p>

"My sister refuses to help clean. Our shared room is extremely cluttered and our relationship becoming strained. How can I get her to help out?","<p>I share a bedroom with my younger sister, she is currently 15 and I am 20. Recently I have been becoming very stressed out with the clutter in the room. I begun cleaning out my own belongings, following the KonMari method of disposing of things that no longer spark joy. This is going really well - I have removed a lot of my own clutter and am still working to improve it.</p>

<p>However, it's quickly becoming obvious that my sister is a large cause of a lot of the clutter, so much so that she's metaphorically shooting herself in the foot with the sheer quantity of unused and unwanted things that she keeps around. </p>

<p>One example of this is our desk. On the desk, there is a pile of her old school books, and also a pile of her clothes that she doesn't wear or no longer fits. Mixed in with these clothes is occasionally pieces of her school uniform, or kit for P.E. (exercise class, gym, whatever you want to call it). Because of the sheer quantity of things piled on the desk, she cannot use her desk for school work, and instead does all of her school work sitting on the bedroom floor. She is unable to put her schoolwork away, because the storage space we have next to the desk is also filled with her old school work, along with miscellaneous stuff that I don't know what it is but it's her stuff. </p>

<p>Another example: she sometimes plays video games with her friends. There is a space next to the TV that would be ideal for her games consoles, however they cannot go there as this space is filled with.. more clothes. a big ol' pile of them. Her drawers are filled up with more clothes that she doesn't wear/don't fit her - her main clothes pile that she actually to wear the clothes out of seems to be over in a different part of the room. (Until I sorted through my clothes again this month she was using MY clothes drawer as a footstool while gaming, which really annoyed me).</p>

<p>As much as I'd love to throw all of her stuff in binbags and say ""Hey, if you want anything out of there take it out before I take it to the tip!"" I think this is inappropriate (plus the konMari book says not to mess with other peoples' stuff). However it's really causing me some stress - I can't use storage because it's filled with her stuff that she's not even using. I only ever see her do 3 or 4 things in our room, play video games on her (floor-located) consoles, use her tablet (or a combination of the two), or do schoolwork (on the floor because the desk is full). So even the drawers and piles filled with miscellaneous stuff are useless. It's not a simple case of a few cups here and there - there's a whole corner of the room that I don't even know what's under it!</p>

<p>I've spoken to my parents about this, but they've basically just said that they can't get her to do anything either. She's used a variety of excuses to me (largely ""I don't feel like it"" which, how can I even do anything about that?? and also ""mum doesn't want me to throw anything away"" which I know full well isn't true). I have tried things like offering to work together on cleaning and sorting the belongings, and this has just not convinced her. Recently the mess has been really getting to me and it's caused some bickering between us, which I feel isn't helping my cause. So what I'm really looking for is a good interpersonal way of getting her to do it which won't result in her responding in personal insults (which has been the only way she's been communicating with me in the past week or two) or my parents getting mad at me.</p>

"How to handle friends who can't let small things go?","<p>I have a close friend who I'm on very good terms with, and have no desire to lose them as a friend. He's fun to be around and we spend a lot of time together either gaming or just chatting via IM. But he is quick to become irritated or angry at little things.</p>

<p>As an example, when we're playing games together and he's not doing particularly well, or another player flames him, he gets very annoyed which is understandable; but what I notice is that it can foul his mood literally for hours.</p>

<p>Another example would be when a customer (he works for an eCommerce company) is trying to pull a fast one, is uncooperative in resolving issues, or is in some other way difficult to work with. He rightfully gets irritated and annoyed, but it shows in his mood for hours after.</p>

<p>Since he was my classmate (I do regard him as my friend), I gave him my number. So we were casually talking on WhatsApp about general stuff like what are you doing now and things like that. </p>

<p>Then he asked me if I had had one night stands and I told him ""No"". And after a while with a lot of build up (like can ""I ask you something?"" ""Don't tell anyone that I asked you this"") he asked me if I was still a virgin. I was taken aback. He then wanted to know why, to which I replied that I am waiting for my special someone. He went on to make fun of that.</p>

<p>I don't know if these questions offended me, but it definitely made me uncomfortable. He messages me out of the blue and asks me all these very personal questions when I was least expecting it.

"How do I make my dad respect my opinions?","<p>This has happened time after time. When making a decision together with dad, he always goes behind my back and ignore my opinions, which is really frustrating and even infuriating some times for me. </p>

<p>For example, knowing my grandma's health was deteriorating while I was living abroad, I specifically asked my dad multiple times that had anything happened, I would like to know, so that I could come back and see her the last time. This February, in my visit back home, I learned from my brother that my grandma had passed away a few months back shortly after my previous visit. When I confronted my dad, he explained that he wanted me to focus on my work and take care of myself, plus I had just seen her in the previous visit, so he didn't think it would be necessary for me to come back. We had a big fight. </p>

<p>Today, I just learned a surgery had been operated on my mom against my concerns. About a week ago, my mom went to hospital as her chronic serious disease had gone worse. My dad let me know and asked about my opinion about the small incision surgery that her doctor had suggested. I expressed my concerns about the hospital (it's really small one in our local town) and the treatment plan. Based on my research, I found a new medicine just made available a few months ago that would radically cure the disease, which is only accessible through bigger hospitals. I suggested to check with the doctors there first and then decide if the incision is the best next step.</p>

<p>My dad went to these hospitals for inquiry. As we were just catching up today, it sort of slipped out of his mouth that the incision had just been done three days ago, before his visits.</p>

<p>I was really angry hearing about it. I would have understood if they told me before the fact. It's my mom's health and her decision ultimately. But again, I felt that he went behind my back knowing how I worried and invested I was. I felt very disrespected and that he could not be trusted. </p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>: 
How do I make him realize how hurtful this is? How do I make sure they inform me about my mom's health status?</p>

"Ask for support with weight loss, without sounding tedious","<p>My question is sort-of related to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2776/how-can-i-support-a-friend-with-healthy-weight-loss"">this one</a> but has the roles reversed. I've been overweight for at least 10 years, and obese for approximately 6. Last February, I decided to better my life. I've bought a fitness tracker, started an eating-habits diary and spent a few months trying to figure out what I should change. </p>

<p>I came to realize that I should move more, eat smaller portions and snack less (surprise!). I also realized that I tend to overeat a lot on social occasions and when I am bored, and that I am completely unable to turn down offers of food/snacks. After figuring out what I wanted to do, I informed friends, family, and co-workers that I was going on a diet. </p>

<p>I specifically asked them to not offer me food anymore. For example, I have a co-worker that loves to share cookies on Fridays. I asked him to just skip me until I told him I was ready to get offered food again. Everybody reacted very nice and made a lot of promises of help. </p>

<p>Thing is, I've been at it for three months, and some people are letting their guard down. They have started offering me food more and more often. One of these people is my own mother (I still live at home). But also my grandma and my co-workers are forgetting my request a lot. So lately, I've been offered food that I don't need and don't want to eat about three times a day. </p>

<p>I'm currently able to say no, but it still takes me a lot of effort. So that when I say no, it will usually take three seconds and a screwed up face, because I have to remind myself of my intentions. Sometimes, I snap and say something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, I'm on a diet and I asked you to help me, remember? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've also explained that although my diet is going well, I am not ready yet for them to start offering me unhealthy foods at every turn. It is difficult enough as it is to stick to my new, healthy regimen. </p>

<p>Lately, some people have started calling me tedious. They have compared me to the vegan person that always has to talk about being vegan. I don't want to be like that, but I'm also certainly not ready yet for everybody to start treating me 'normally' again. </p>

<p>How can I verbally remind them of their promise to me/the fact that I'm still on a diet and don't want to be offered food that often, without sounding like a broken record?</p>

"My mom won't let me handle my money, what can I say?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I'm 18 and I live with my parents, I also have two younger sisters. Ever since I was younger until now nothing changed in terms of their parenting with me. I have to go to bed at X hours and many other things that takes out my autonomy. (it's kinda embarrasing have to end a conversation with someone because your mom orders you to go sleep at 11pm..). This occurs, I guess, because my parents want to give equal parenting to me and my sisters.
But that's not the point (maybe for another question?).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: It's money that my family gave me and money that I collect for future things and can't go into my pocket basically. I don't have a bank account (and opening one isn't probably a solution because I'm not looking for a job right now).</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>As usual we buy things for ourselves, I, being a technology lover, likes to get something new from time to time.
The big deal is: i have my savings stored in a moneybox, BUT, that moneybox is hidden somewhere in the house and I don't have access to them. To use my cash I have to request my mom for that and with detailed information of ""what's the money for?"". As you might ask, this is awful and even when she accepts my request she asks a million times ""is it worth it?"". And sometimes it could go very wrong, like in the incident 1.</p>

<p><strong>Incident 1</strong></p>

<p>I saw a sale for a game ""Rocket League"" and I decided to buy. Asked my mom and I get the usual questionary of the cash. She gave it to me the money I needed after a long discussion. A few hours later I saw that if I spend 5 euros more I get some DLC's which is a great deal.
When I said to her that I need the extra she got all pissed off (yes, she got pissed for 20€ to spend on a game).
Since then I really don't ask for anything else except on the holidays or something.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p>With these rules I can't simply buy condoms for the reason that she will ask me awkward questions about it and it sucks. So, since I'm 18 now and I don't want to be treated any longer like I'm 13, <strong>how can I tell my mom that from now I can/should manage my own cash?</strong></p>

<p>(Feel free to edit my question if something is misspelled or if I'm not being clear enough, thanks)</p>

"How to keep an interesting conversation going when there's a dog present at family gatherings?","<p>I try to pay a regular visit my grandparents once a week, and on special occasions like their birthdays. Most of these visits coincide with my aunt, uncle and cousins being there as well. They also always bring their dog, let's call him Fifi. </p>

<p>Fifi is a small/medium dog (depending on your definition of dog sizes), and he's really misbehaved. He continually begs for food and attention, rubs himself against your clean pants (hair everywhere), ruins your nylons with his nails, sits on your feet, walks in front of you when you stand up and barks/whines a lot. Fifi's owners can't control him, they let him roam free through the living room, encourage the begging with snacks and act like he's being funny when he barks or ruins an outfit by talking baby-talk to Fifi (or offering more snacks). </p>

<p>As a result, <em>both my grandparents and the rest of our family have made regular, serious requests to leave the dog at home on family gatherings over the past 6 or 7 years.</em> Apparently, this is not an option, for reasons unknown to me. What I do know is that my grandparents/rest of my family would never put up with this if there wasn't a really, really, really good reason. </p>

<p>Fifi causes problems. We can finally have a good talk going with each other, one that's more interesting than just the regular 'he died, she's got cancer, they're getting divorced' remarks my family is so keen on making, and either Fifi acts out in a way that needs attention, or one of his owners starts talking to/about Fifi in a way that ends the interesting conversation prematurely.</p>

<p>So far, we've tried getting these conversations back on track (or not to end them in the first place) in a few ways: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Saying 'just a sec'</strong> when Fifi's misbehaving is bothering someone, taking Fifi's collar, guiding him away/making him sit in an appropriate spot and then just continuing the conversation. This almost always end in one of his owners baby-talking to Fifi, calling him from across the room, and/or mentioning someone's name in the process, taking over attention and causing us to have to interrupt our conversation. </li>
<li><strong>Asking Fifi's owners to take care of him</strong>, then continuing the conversation. Same problem as the other approach: owners start calling Fifi from across the room, and most often we have to act anyways to actually get Fifi to stop misbehaving because he doesn't listen. </li>
<li><strong>Just keep talking</strong>. There's instances when one of his owners will shout across the room 'FIFI! Did you just fart?!', drawing everyone's attention and then start a monologue about how we shouldn't give Fifi anything to eat when he's begging because now you can smell what happened (or something similar). We've tried to just keep the conversation we're having going or turning back to it as soon as possible, but so far it has had really low success rates, as it's kinda difficult to keep your attention to something when someone else is trying to take it too. </li>
<li><strong>Attempting to ignore Fifi and his owners</strong> hasn't worked so far, as Fifi just keeps begging, rubbing or scratching, and his owners keep paying it attention, and in such a way that they demand our attention as well and we can't keep the conversation going. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, given that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fifi can't be left at home (for whatever reason), </li>
<li>His owners can't control him (and themselves) at family gatherings,</li>
<li>We've tried to address this with Fifi's owners and neither Fifi nor his owners seem capable of changing their behaviour.  </li>
<li>Either I or the person I'm talking with regularly need to interrupt an interesting conversation to save pants, nylons or food because ignoring Fifi and letting things happen is no option,</li>
<li>We can't just pick another time to visit when the dog won't be there. </li>
<li>Fifi's owners aren't causing trouble on the rare occasions that we meet them without Fifi (e.g. only my aunt will be there, and uncle will be home watching Fifi)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can we keep an interesting conversation going or recover it, when Fifi and his owners are present at a family gathering?</strong> </p>

"Dealing with coworker who is excessively self-deprecating","<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>My coworker is very self deprecating to the point where several of my colleagues are worried about him. He will make negative remarks on the quality of his work, and even himself, saying things like ""my work sucks"", or ""I'm stupid"". Additionally, he's taken to complimenting me in a way that is simultaneously self deprecating to him (for example, implying that I will one day replace him). </p>

<p>At first I tried to encourage him not to say these kinds of things, but as time went on, and my (short) patience wore off, I'm just annoyed by him. This sort of behavior is annoying to most of my colleagues, but especially me, as I'm a pretty disagreeable and argumentative person, and this kind of behavior is particularly annoying to me (due to things in my past that are too lengthy for me to get into). </p>

<p>I've had several conflicts with him in the past, where I attempt to confront him about this sort of behavior, but I've failed to handle these confrontations in a productive way. </p>

<p>These confrontations basically play out as me asking him to stop making these sort of jokes, and him saying that it is a problem with the way I perceive the jokes, and not the fact that he is making the jokes in the first place. That's the short of it, but the way these confrontations actually play out involve a lot of frustration from both him and me. I'm at least a little rude during these discussions, and he is very defensive, so we get nowhere. </p>

<p>Although I agree that I'm taking these jokes more poorly than most of my coworkers, I don't agree that these jokes are okay to make. They reduce confidence in him, reduce team morale, and make him difficult to work with.</p>

<h1>The question</h1>

<p>What is the best way for me to deal with this coworker? I have a lot of difficulty dealing with people I dislike, at least for long periods of time (such as someone I work with every day). The best I've come up with is keeping my interactions with him as short and professional as I can, but I have difficulty doing that without also making it clear that I want to talk to him as little as I possibly can (i.e., I'm worried that I'm still coming off as rude). Is that the best I can hope for, or is there another solution?</p>

<p>Management is aware of the problem, but I'm not sure how much, or what they can actually do. </p>

"How many time should you try to call someone if the other person is not answering?","<p>Last Monday, I wanted to ask a question to my cousin and decided to phone her. I called her once and she didn't answer so I decided to try a second time right after my first attempt. When she finally answered, she told me that she was in a meeting but decided to answer me anyway.</p>

<p>She usually works from home on Monday and I had no idea she was in a meeting. I'm afraid that me deciding to call her <em>twice</em> has prompt her to answer because she thought it was important when it wasn't. She didn't say such a thing so I believe that calling twice is fine. However, I do believe that trying a third time without waiting, at least, one hour would have been too much.</p>

<p>This got me thinking, is there some etiquette regarding the number of time one should try calling someone else if it's not for an emergency? And how long you should wait between each call?</p>

"Politeness vs. conciseness in writing emails","<p>I often find myself starting sentences with phrases like ""I just want to let you know that"", ""I would like to ask if"", ""I am writing to discuss"", or ""I was wondering if"" in emails.

"How do I answer the question ""why are you vegan?"" honestly, without making them resent me?","<p>I am a vegan, only for ethical reasons. It is something I'm very willing to discuss. I have deliberated about it very carefully, for a long time, and have read papers and text books on the philosophy of ethics on my spare time in order to help me get my bearing on this issue. So, I'm very happy to discuss the reasoning process that has led me to where I am, as long as the person is willing to engage in a careful one-on-one discussion that isn't emotionally charged or defensive, with the intent of truly hearing me out, and vice versa. I'm also happy to debate it in the same kind of manner. But I don't go around looking for that debate; I only have it if it's clear that the other person is willing and eager to do so.</p>

<p>Of course, that is not often the environment in which I'm asked about my eating habit. It's usually in a casual conversation, with others present, wherein typically a quick one sentence answer is desired. My answer is usually ""ethical reasons"". </p>

<p>I notice, often, people get defensive when I say this. They will try to justify their eating habits. Or they will make tongue-in-cheek comments like ""you must think I'm awful for eating this burger, haha."" Some of them (in the case of family members) hold on to their opinions, but lash out at me at a later time. (This leads me to believe that others, who are not in my family but are saying nothing, also must resent me but just don't want to be confrontational.) From experience I have found that simply expressing that I'm vegan for ethical reasons prompts lashing out, resentment, and passive aggression, without me ever explicitly judging them. It gets exhausting, and it erodes my relationships. It makes it so that I now fear this question, and am now intentionally discreet about what I order at restaurants. </p>

<p>I understand why the person asking the question might perceive that I'm implicitly judging them. After all, we can say, of things like a diet or artistic preference, that something is ""just my preference, and it's okay if you think differently"". But that's not usually true of moral claims. If one firmly believes that something is a moral obligation, they believe it of a person regardless of whether or not that person believes it themselves. For example, we wouldn't accept it if a psychopath says ""you feel it's wrong to kill, and I don't. That's just my preference."" Nor does anybody today think it was okay for people to own slaves in the past, simply because society treated it as an acceptable practice back then. (Note, I am <em>not</em> saying that these things are morally equivalent to eating meat. I'm simply using examples to illustrate the point that difference in moral code, unlike difference in taste in art, is not something that can be dismissed as ""just a personal preference that we must accept"".)</p>

<p>So I might want to fall back on ""I didn't judge you in any way"". However, given the above paragraph, I can't escape the fact that there's a perceived intrinsic judgement I am making simply by justifying my eating preference.</p>

<p>I understand that my position is very much in the minority. I still want to have a real social life, though. I have longstanding friends, and a family that I love. I don't want to alienate everybody because they think that I'm a sanctimonious asshole. But, at the same time, I don't want to compromise my ethics, or be dishonest about them. </p>

<p>I have considered being dishonest, in response to the question, and saying something like ""well, it's just something I'm trying"", or ""I think this is the healthiest option"". (I actually don't think that being vegan is the healthiest option.) It is a compromise. I hate being dishonest, but I also hate eroding my relationships. However, if possible, I want to avoid being dishonest.</p>

<p><strong>How do I answer the question ""why are you vegan?"" honestly, without making people resent me?</strong></p>

<h2>Clarifications:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I'm a Canadian, from Toronto.</li>
<li>I'm usually asked about my veganism during mealtimes, or when jointly ordering food.</li>
<li>I've never given a more thorough answer, but I do clarify when asked a question.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Further clarifications:</h2>

<p>Let me answer a couple of popular questions that seem to be coming up in answers and comments.</p>

<p><strong>""Why are you vegan, more specifically?""</strong></p>

<p>I could write a lot on this, though I don't think my exact reasoning process is very relevant for this question. So I'll just say that it's primarily related to animal welfare, and secondarily related to the environment. Both of these fit under the umbrella of ""ethical reasons"", which is a response that's simply meant to contrast it from the other popular reasons for being vegan. (Namely, health reasons, personal taste in food, or physical revulsion. None of these three apply to me.)</p>

<p><strong>""<em>Are</em> you judging them?""</strong></p>

<p>Another way of asking this is, ""do you think that they are worthy of moral judgement?"" Well... to be perfectly honest, yes. I hate that this is the answer, because everybody I love does it. But I cannot find another answer that's consistent with my beliefs, no matter how much I want to do so. I usually don't express this. And, as a caveat, I think that those who understand the situation are more worthy of judgement than those who don't. Most people don't. I spent a long time eating meat while believing what I currently believe which, I think, makes me worse than most meat eaters. I don't mean for that to be condescending. It's not a matter of stupidity, but simply of what you happen to know and be exposed to. It's very likely that I am funding other immoral practices of which I'm ignorant, and for which I'm worthy of moral judgement. Nor do I expect anybody (including myself) to be perfect paragons of moral virtue. I understand that it's very hard to do so when it comes to a practice that might be morally wrong, but is considered by society to be entirely acceptable. </p>

<p>Now, while I don't want to be dishonest about <em>my</em> reason for being vegan, the question of whether they are worthy of moral judgement is something that I am willing to, and have been dishonest about (on the rare occasion that this actually comes up). Only because I know how socially volatile it could be to tell the truth in this case. (And I don't want to live up to my namesake on this site.)</p>

"How to tell a student in same school I want to get to know him?","<p>I'm  currently a 19 years old Spaniard male senior student, and a month ago I was asked for help by a male student in another course about a subject I'm good at. While helping him I discovered we have the same interests. We live in different towns and it's not possible to meet in person, so we sometimes chat via text.</p>

<p>However, I'm usually the one that starts the conversation, and I would like to ask him if he's interested in getting to know me (or simply tell him I'm interested) and whether we could establish a texting routine this summer so we can try to be friends. We rarely see each other at school, and we're not in the same class so technically we aren't schoolmates. How can I ask for a texting routine? (e.g. every Tuesday and Thursday). I would like to avoid making things awkward between us.</p>

<hr>

<p>As meeting in person seems viable, I'll list the reasons why I would rather text with him:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Distance.</strong> Yes, we go to the same school, but it's not mandatory like
Secondary education. It's hard to explain because our education
system is different. Anyway, there's a distance of 62 Km (38.53
miles) between out towns, and the only ways to go to his town would
be: by car (which is impossible since I don't own a driver's license)
or by train (which is affordable, but the train station is far from
his town).</li>
<li><strong>It's too early.</strong> As I said, we met each other a month ago, and because
I helped him with a subject. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel a month is just not
enough time to start meeting someone in person.</li>
<li><strong>He has a life.</strong> I really would like to meet in person, but sadly he
may not because summer vacation has just started and he will want to
meet his friends, date with his girlfriend, apply for a job... I
don't want to be a nuisance. So that means for example that he maybe
won't want to go to my town. I wouldn't mind to go to his town,
though. But still, I'm afraid of being a pain. Perhaps I'm wrong and
he would like to introduce me to his friends, but this leads to the
following reason:</li>
<li><strong>Bashfulness.</strong> I'll be honest, I'm too shy to start and keep a
conversation in real life. And that's why I would like to establish a
friendship by means of texting. Unfortunately, I lack
self-confidence. What if I make a bad impression? I know this is
a cowardly behavior, but I don't want to ruin the opportunity of having
someone to chat with.</li>

"How to tell my boss about his lack of hygiene","<p>I work in a small consulting company. I love what I do and I love to work with my boss who is a kind of genius in our field. He is a quick thinker and can be very technical and smart. He is good and we manage to be complementary when working together. </p>

<p>Everything would be perfect if he had good hygiene. He always has big sweat stains under his armpits (every. single. day.), he has bad breath and his laptop is REALLY nasty. </p>

<p>All of this disgusts me to a point I find it very unpleasant to be near him. I can't think about him without thinking about his sweat stains, especially because we have a project together and I always need to sit very close to him and sometimes write things on his laptop. Plus, we meet lots of clients and I think he loses all his credibility with this bad presentation. </p>

<p>Maybe I am being too critical and I know I have a problem with hygiene but I think I need to do something about that. </p>

<p>I need to find a smooth way to help him understand that he needs to do something about this. 
Last time, I tried to say this in a natural way :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wow, it's so hot in here, I'm sweating so much.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was thinking that maybe he would consider his own sweat, but he answered : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know right ? Wanna turn on the A/C ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I failed miserably :( and now I can't find a good way of telling him about this... 
I'm afraid we will both be in a very awkward and embarrassing situation if I talk about this.  </p>

"How to say no without sounding rude?","<p>Recently I have been having a lot of troubles with my friends, when they ask me to do something and I say no, because I don't like it or I don't want to do it. </p>

"Close relative refuses to acknowledge being deeply in debt","<p>Note: the text uses ""they"" when talking about the person in question to preserve anonymity.</p>

<p>A few years ago I was living with a close relative of mine and their parents, and I became aware that the relative was involved in some sort of a cult/sect. Relative was claiming that they were learning to heal people from distance. Tuition was apparently costly, as relative emptied the bank account which stored inheritance from my grandparents (a significant sum, approximately 30 of the relative's current monthly salaries). They were forced to reveal that when I told them I needed that money.</p>

<p>Saying that I was shocked would be an understatement. I was furious, felt that the relative was a grandiose idiot, and I did not want to have anything to do with them. I asked them a few times to give me access to their bank account history, but they refused, claiming though that they had broken up with the cult. I did not keep pressing, but instead moved out and ceased talking to them for a year. The relative kept living with their parents at the same place, who also knew about the situation. After that year, I approached them and told them I had thought it had been cruel to break contact, and I wanted to restore it.</p>

<p>A few days ago the relative approached me and told me they had multiple loans open, had already failed to meet some of their payment deadlines, and that particular day was the final deadline for the late payments the banks had agreed on, after which the matter would have been taken to court. They asked me to cover those payments.</p>

<p>I'm making more than the average salary, and I have significant savings, so I could do that. However, I refused, saying that I did not want to pay for their stupidity. Instead, I started digging into their debts, using the fact that they came to me themselves, and therefore were (somewhat) willing to open up. It looked like this:</p>

<p>""Write down a table of all banks, organisations, and people you owe money to, with names, dates, and amounts.""
""But why would you need that.""
""If you keep protesting, I'm getting up and leaving.""
<em>they say something, I get up and leave, then return 20 minutes later</em>
""The table has only initials. Write down the full names.""
""Can you explain why you need those?""
""I do. And you aren't really in a position to negotiate.""</p>

<p>It turned out way worse than I had imagined, as the total amount of their debt was approximately 80 times their monthly salaries, and aside from loans included some people and organisations the relative had borrowed money from. I questioned the relative on each of them, and it turned out that some of those sources were quite shady, and one was shady enough for me to decide to pay back to him right away for the sake of safety of the parents of the relative (who still lived there).</p>

<p>The next day after I figured out the picture, I sought help from a lawyer. He advised me to find all legally binding documents that mentioned the debts of the relative (loan agreements, etc) and send those to him. I told the relative about that request. With the air of confidence the relative claimed that they ""had everything in order"".</p>

<p>I was shocked yet again and attempted to remind them that they had enormous debt. They kept reiterating about everything being in order. I threatened to tell everything to their parents (who the relative had asked me not to involve due to their heart problems). They said go ahead. I freaked out and slapped the relative on the face, then told everything to their parents.</p>

<p>The three of us confronted the relative, but they were telling nothing at all. ""Show us your bank account history."" ""Why do I have to?"" ""Because we know you are deeply in debt."" ""I won't show you anything."" After maybe 20 minutes of interrogation they at least admitted that they had had the debt I had paid for the day before. ""Well, I had one debt, it's covered, now I don't have any."" Feeling like an impediment (I was way too furious, although I kept quiet most of the time), I left after a while with the relative's mother, leaving them alone with their father. On his own, he managed to get nothing either, despite his interpersonal skills significantly surpassing mine or his wife's.</p>

<p><em>(added later)</em> I have also received messages on social media from people the relative owns money to. They intend to go to court in a few days. The name matches exactly to what the relative told me; the amount matches approximately, but that looks very much like rounding.</p>

<p>I still have a very vague idea about the relative's income, savings, open bank accounts, and only a moderately good idea of their debt structure. Their current monthly loan payment is twice as large as their salary. They owe money to more than 10 entities. Many of those payments are long overdue. I also believe that in the day between I interrogated them and they told me they ""had everything in order"" they got into another debt.</p>

<p>I am strongly tempted to leave the relative to deal with their own problems. Unfortunately, this will mean the parents of the relative will see those problems too. But I can only assist if the relative cooperates, which they defiantly don't do.</p>

<p>I don't really want to work for the well-being of the relative. However, at the very least, <strong>I want to ensure the safety of their parents</strong>, which includes finding out all potential causes of danger and eliminating them or targeting them at the relative only. With regards to more details on potential causes that I have already been told about, I am somewhat at a loss, as I feel I cannot share more than I have.</p>

<p>Secondly, <strong>I want to minimise investment of my time and money in this</strong>.</p>

<p>Ideally, <strong>I would want the relative to acknowledge the fact that they are in trouble, open up, and accept (legal, not financial) help</strong>, because that will make their parents happier. The parents fully comprehend the situation, but they are not very good at taking active action, which leaves me as the person to intervene.</p>

<p>Also, I think it's pretty obvious from the above that I do not control well my emotions, so I will have to either minimise my direct involvement, or to change my attitude somehow.</p>

<p>What can I do to achieve these goals?</p>

<hr>

<p>Some ideas on leverage that I have:</p>

<ol>
<li>The relative has social network accounts with >100 friends. I can reach out to (some of) them and tell them about the situation.</li>
<li>I still have the list of the people and organisations the relative owes money to. Those are just first names (I am now regretting I did not press for last names too), but that's enough to find them through the relative's friend lists on social networks.</li>
<li>The relative keeps two laptops at home with unencrypted hard drives, and has an Android phone. While both laptops have Windows and are password-protected, I can still copy their hard drive contents, and with some luck, get access to their Google account, from which I can get their contact list and location history. Or I can simply do that while they are at home but not at their laptop, as they do not have a habit of locking the screen.</li>
<li>I could talk to the relative's parents to force the relative out of the house. The parents are unlikely to agree to that, though.</li>
<li>Since the parents are fully aware of the situation, they intend not to sponsor the relative in any way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, the relative has a sibling who shows identical symptoms (was involved in the same cult years ago, has not been seen interacting with it since, does not bring any money home). The sibling is married and lives separately; their spouse is aware of the situation with my relative, but has no extra information about the sibling. The spouse was shocked to hear the story from me and promised to have a conversation with the sibling after the spouse's planned vacation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Response to comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You helped them, then all the sudden they didn't need or want your help anymore. They refused to offer any actual documents or proof that their story was legitimate, for a reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have reasons to believe and not believe this.</p>

<ul>
<li>The relative has never been caught on an elaborate lie. All lies are always simple: ""I have no debt"" instead of ""I've received an unexpected gift from someone I've been dating for a couple of weeks, which was enough to cover me for the time being"". During my interrogation, I was insisting on details, which they are bad at making up (or so good they've never been caught).</li>
<li>One detail from the story about the particular debt I repaid checked out (I was able to independently verify some documents).</li>
<li>Furthermore, initially the relative was asking me to repay a different debt, one that was due to their late loan payments, and only after going through the entire list I decided that that particular one should be covered ASAP.</li>
<li>However, in order to repay that debt, I made a card-to-card transfer, to a card whose number the relative dictated for me. After I made the transfer, they got their phone and told me that they texted about the fact to their creditor. I have not seen the messages, and I don't know who the card belongs to. <em>Probably</em> I should have demanded more proof that that number was indeed the right one; however, the relative is strongly averse to questioning their actions (and has been so for as long as I remember), so I'm not sure how that demand would have played out.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to mark the answer by @YElm as accepted, since they provide multiple specific strategies I can adopt. However, I am still on lookout for any good ideas, and would be grateful for them.</p>

"How to handle people who don't get along on Stack Exchange?","<p>Active users of Stack Exchange tend to frequent multiple sites and chat rooms, so it means we will tend to bump into the same people in different places. People don't always click, and will disagree on with one another on some things, that's natural.</p>

<p>If I have a disagreement with someone I <em>tend</em> to move on quickly - forget about it and treat the person the same way as anyone else - respectfully. However this is not always the case with some people, they don't move on and hold grudges. </p>

<p>Holding a grudge doesn't really matter, in the sense that it only harms the person holding it, if the person is able to think and act objectively.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however there will be the person who cannot move past things and if there's been an incident between two people, it will colour their opinion and they will not let go or be able to rise above their feelings and so react in a subjective manner to any encounters with the other person. This can make life difficult when both people are active on the same sites and in the same chat rooms. </p>

<p>It's fair that people will not always agree, but it becomes suspicious, if over time, one or both people disagree with or object  to <em>everything</em> the other person says. So a person will be reacting to the personality, rather than the content of what they're saying.</p>

<p>Most of the network is public and it's difficult to create a discussion with someone, that doesn't become a public debacle with other people being involved and lowering the tone of the site. Also, some people do not react well to being called out for their behaviour, and will become defensive.</p>

<p>Also, we cannot really know what is going on inside someone else's head, so perceived observations of two people not getting along, may be misconstrued. Plus with online communication and cultural differences, it can be even harder to read people. So there's the risk of misinterpreting someone's behaviour. Some people can have healthy arguments and both feel like they get along well and respectfully. </p>

<p>What are some effective ways of dealing with this type of situation, either as an observer or being engaged in this type of interaction?<br>
Do we determine if there's a problem? If so, how?
Ignoring it may also be an option.</p>

<p>Really this question could apply to any online community.</p>

"How to create a more engaging online conversation with a friend?","<p>I have a friend I talk with <em>online</em> and the conversations we are having are rather short. I would like to have more engaging conversations without forcing myself and the other person in a conversation we don't want.</p>

<p>Here an example of how the conversation is usually going, this happens when I start the conversation or when the other person starts the conversation. The conversation example is quite generic and the subject is always a little bit different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other: Hey, how are you doing?</p>
  
  <p>Me(5 min to 1 hour later): hey, I'm doing okay, little bit busy with school. How are you doing? </p>
  
  <p>Other(1 hour to 2 hours later): ""something small about the day only responding about what I said, in this case busy with school"".</p>
  
  <p>Me(5 min to 30 min later): ""responds talks about something small about the day""</p>
  
  <p>Other(1 hour to 3 hours later): ""short response"" &amp; I'm going to sleep, cya</p>
  
  <p>Me(5 min to 30 min later): Okay good night</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the example shows, I response quite fast since I have my chat app open at all times, which means I see messages almost always immediately. The other person always takes more than an hour to respond.</p>

<p>For me this is quite though since I don't know how to respond. This also makes me quite unsure if this person wants to talk, however I think this person wants to talk since I'm not the only one who starts a conversation. I tried different things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only asking about how their day was</li>
<li>Saying something about my day (as the example, also in my first response)</li>
<li>Responding to questions and not starting a new subject(to give the other person space to talk)</li>
<li>Take more time to respond to messages, so I give more space</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How to start a more engaging, online conversation with a person who gives short responses and takes a longer to react to messages?</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Starting more engaging, online conversations with this person. </li>
<li>Give the other room to talk about what they want to talk about.</li>
<li>Not being clingy/codependent (I don't want this to be the focus of the question) however the distance should stay appropriate. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>

"How to politely deal with strangers who aggressively hand out religious tracts or preach to you seemingly out of nowhere?","<p><sup>This question is not being posted to get into a religion or freedom of speech debate, but rather present the idea that regardless of religious beliefs, aggressive and pushy behavior wrapped in the pretense of a specific faith’s beliefs is often unwanted at best and annoying at worst. Is there any way to politely sidestep these folks?</sup></p>

<hr>

<p>I am a secular Jew living in New York City (USA of course) and find it difficulty to politely deal with Evangelical preachers of all faiths who aggressively hand out religious tracts. Below are the different degrees of folks I typically run into and my experiences with them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses: Not So Bad</strong>: Sometimes I am dealing with Jehovah’s Witnesses who honestly are not that bad. As far from aggressive as possible. They just stand there with a pamphlet kiosk and easy enough to walk away from.</li>
<li><strong>Chabad Lubavitch: “Yes, I am Jewish… Please go away.”</strong> Next up are the Chabad Lubavitch Orthodox Jewish folks who are fairly aggressive if you are nearby, running up to you and asking “Are you Jewish.” I tend to just walk away if possible, but sometimes I say, “Yes, I am Jewish but I don’t want to talk to you.” Sometimes these efforts to avoid them work and they disengage. Sometimes they become even more aggressive and have even chased me down the street.</li>
<li><strong>Christian Evangelical Groups: Unpredictable</strong>: During the holiday season in New York City, you tend to encounter various groups of Christian Evangelical groups. Sometimes there are groups that are not horrible to deal with; they respect distance and boundaries. Other times you get groups who clearly have a tactic of doing things like (for example) aggressively surrounding subway exits around rush hour (5:00pm to 7:00pm) at night and confronting commuters going home after a long day of work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand that these people believe in their respective religions. And I respect that in some cases this kind of preaching is a part of their beliefs in some way. And I also understand that for many people this is—essentially—their job and they will be rewarded by their leaders with housing, food and support they could not get otherwise.</p>

<p>So knowing that I want to respect their position in the world, is there any way to cleanly and politely say thanks but no thanks without lying or being mean or deceptive?</p>

"How to tell someone believing in pseudoscience & conspiracy theories is wrong without making them feel stupid/upset?","<p>A close family member of mine is a raw vegan, anti vaxer, anti-antibiotics, anti-fluoride, believes in chemtrails, has a machine that filters water and makes it alkaline, eats lots of supplements, buys only organic produce and buys all her hygiene, beauty and cleaning products at the holistic store. </p>

<p>Overall, her health isn't great, and whenever she gets ill she blames it on something she ate or the chemicals in the air... </p>

<p>In my opinion, she is not nourishing her body properly, and I'm worried that piggybacking all the supplements and miracle treatments is not only ineffective but detrimental to her health. It also worries me she would only go to the doctor as her last resort, and even when she gets a prescription, she wouldn't always take the meds. She says she prefers to fight the illness naturally and have a stronger immune system as a result :( </p>

<p>If I say something she believes in is wrong, she gets upset. So I try to logic her out of her beliefs, but she would rather tell me I have a very linear and mathsy way of thinking (since I am a physicist), therefore I can't possibly understand her ""facts"". This makes me so sad as she would trust me with physics, yet somehow in an argument about biology, chemistry, ""toxins"", and vaccines my use of pure logic and critical thinking goes over her head. </p>

<p>On the other hand, she has read books on those topics which are popular science at best and complete garbage at worse. None of those come close to even high school textbook standard - she might as well be reading tabloid articles in book format. Sadly, she feels her arguments are more valid since she has read books with things like  ""adjuvant"",  ""metabolism"" and ""blood-brain barrier"" written in them. That's enough for her to deem them reputable sources of the truth behind such and such.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder... If I had the time and the willpower to read all she has read on this: would she then listen to me? Or would she keep arguing?</p>

<p>Anyway, this person is important to me and I hate our constant arguments. I hate that I hide my chocolate &amp; pretend to be vegan in front of her to avoid upsetting her. I wish we could just enjoy some lunch out in town without hearing things like ""that sandwich must have been packed with sugar and gluten because I feel so bad now"" for a week afterward, even though her test for gluten sensitivity came out negative. And most important of all I want to make sure she isn't unwittingly ruining her health.</p>

<p>How can I convince someone believing in pseudoscience &amp; conspiracy theories to change their views and trust conventional medicine without making them feel stupid or upset?</p>

<p>Recently, however, I have come to realize that there are better things I could be doing. When I started 8th grade I decided I needed to control myself. I did successfully, but still played them on the weekend. Then, this week, I decided to just not play any video games or watch any 'media', as my mother calls it. I'm been really glad I did this.

"How to arrange neurodivergent vs. neurotypical social needs?","<p>Around 8 months ago I met a friend who has a very similar perception as I have in regards to having autism and Asperger's. Since this friend was multiple years ahead therapy-wise, I learned a lot from that friend about myself.</p>

<p>One thing I learned was that apparently neurodivergent persons have no real relation to strangers while having a great willingness to give and sacrifice a lot for those close to them. Much more than neurotypicals usually would/can commit to (or sometimes even want to receive).</p>

<p>The problem here is neurodivergent people can't empathize with neurotypicals and vice versa. So my scope here is as limited as anyone's. </p>

<p>So since this commitment<sup>1</sup> isn't usual, as I know now, I can empirically understand that I never will get back what I want to give. This was the main reason for ALL my relationships failing, as I got so jealous since all the little things I expected as a matter of course, were never returned and I didn't feel wanted.</p>

<p>Even as I realized that it was me making our commitments and bonds too strong and not the others making them too loose, it didn't stop the emotional pain, as the awareness of this sadly doesn't change the emotions of promise and the following disappointment. This made me get to a point where I decided with myself not to expect anything from anyone any more.</p>

<p>I've been going this way for 3 months now already and this has prevented almost any disappointments in this time frame. But I also realize I'm starting to not care about friends any more. I was a very loquacious person, but I just start getting bored, asking myself ""Does it even matter, speaking up now? I won't be understood anyway."" And that's definitely also not where I want to go.</p>

<p>So <strong>tl;dr</strong>:</p>

<hr>

<p>As a neurodivergent person that is committing a lot for their friends and emotionally expecting this to be returned, how can I handle the fact that this commitment won't be returned?</p>

"How to permanently leave a group activity without insulting a friend","<p>Currently I am in a group activity (pen&amp;paper online) we started 2 years ago and which is held weekly. I consider everyone of this group as my friend.</p>

<p>But I have had arguments with the leader of this group (game master).
These issues seem illogical to me and the arguments tended to be with prejudice.
I realized I did not have any fun at all and it was more like a weekly duty.
I started speaking with the other group members and about half of them were not happy too. One enlightened me and told me our leader is a emotional person which I didn't realize. That gave me more insight and helped dealing with conflicts. I tried to talk about the points that bothered me, tried to figure out the right moment. But I realized how careful I have to be with every word I say because it could upset our group leader. And since nothing has really improved for about 3 months it is time for me to say goodbye.</p>

<p><strong>Question:
I want to leave the group permanently. But I don't want to burn any bridges. How can I do that?</strong> </p>

<p>When I leave it is clear that it is because of our group leader. He will ask me why I want to leave. But any of my arguments would possible insult him so what do I say?</p>

<p>To make it even more complicated since I will not stop this group activity but just change the group. And since I will use the same platform the group leader will see I just changed the group. So I cannot say I am not interested in this activity either.</p>

<p>I would like to stay friends with the group leader since I appreciate him as a person. But that seems very hard for now.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 08.08.2017</strong></p>

<p><strong>I talked to him today</strong></p>

<p>He was shocked that I wanted to leave. He understood there is no point for me to stay when I am not having fun.</p>

<p>But he wondered why I didn't speak to him before leaving. He didn't notice that I tried to speak with him on some points. But there was no ground for discussion, he was the gm and just said how it will be.</p>

<p>He told me that if there are not too much players in the group I am welcome to come back when I am ok with his playstyle. Some feelings were hurt like many of you already knew. But it does not look to bad.</p>

If he looks at PII from my account, that seems like a violation of b. in the mod agreement. Thankfully, this hasn't happened yet, but if this doesn't stop soon it might, and I <em>really</em> want to avoid that.</p>

<p>My parents know that I mod a SE site, and I've told them that I am really uncomfortable with my brother looking at stuff on my computer. They refused to talk to him about it, saying that a.) He's not going to do anything, what's the problem? b.) I spend too much time on there already, so they don't really want me bringing it up again.</p>

<p>I've already asked him to stop a couple times, saying that I really don't want him looking at the stuff, even if it isn't PII, such as the Teachers' Lounge chatroom. He hasn't so far (keeps trying to get me to press keyboard shortcuts and stuff that will switch to my mod tabs while he's watching, but I'm not so tech illiterate that I don't know what <kbd>ctrl</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd> does). He's relatively familiar with SE - he has 20k rep on Stack Overflow, 14k on another site, and 10k on Meta.SE, so he's not unfamiliar with the system. (Hi. Yes, I know you'll probably be reading this question at some point. Maybe you'll take me seriously now...)</p>

<p>We're both culturally American, although not living in the States right now.</p>

<p>This isn't just about the mod stuff - while that certainly contributes to my unease, I don't like him watching over my shoulder watching what I'm doing generally. (Or looking at my phone.) So:</p>

<p><strong>How do I bring up the issue of my brother reading what's on my screen?</strong></p>

"How to act when people bring a baby to work?","<p>I am uncomfortable interacting with babies because I personally don't find them cute or interesting to interact with. I also am not good at faking positive interactions with babies, because I really just don't know how to act with them. I'm not good at making the 'baby voice' or making silly faces. </p>

<p>I realize that perhaps I should get better at interacting with babies, but I personally feel like this is not something I should <em>have</em> to deal with when I am at work (since I do not work as a babysitter). But co-workers often bring a baby to work out of necessity (which I understand), and it sparks this immediate change in everyone's behavior: people stop what they are doing to gush over the baby, to take turns holding it and interacting with it, and telling the parent how cute it is. All of this seems like it is socially <em>important</em> because literally, everyone does it except me. And I think the parent can sense my discomfort, because I have had the awkward experience of the parent taking the baby around the room to be held by everyone, and just skipping past me without saying anything. Part of me was relieved because I didn't have to interact with the baby, but part of me felt embarrassed and alienated because everyone else was approached. </p>

<p>I really don't feel like participating in any of this, and even if I wanted to, I think I would appear very awkward if I attempted interacting with the baby. But at the same time, I feel as if I am being rude by ignoring the baby, and I feel like something is wrong with me because I am not excited to see the baby. I also feel like people judge me and think maybe I am not very nice because I wasn't interested in the baby. I don't want my co-workers to think I am a weird baby-hater. Does anyone have tips on how to respond when a baby shows up at work, and I am not a baby person? Do I just need to try harder to interact with the parent and baby, or is there a way to back out of these interactions that won't make me seem rude or weird?</p>

<p>PS I kind of understand how my coworkers feel when a baby shows up because I DO feel that way if a dog shows up. I will stop whatever I am doing to play with the dog, and I am always happy when a dog shows up at work. I just don't feel that way about babies.</p>

"Is it normal in a professional environment to inform a director of personal discomfort experienced on their site?","<p>Should I tell the director of a lab in a business school how I was personally affected about their actions while participating in a study? I am a student and I met them in a professional setting as a paid participant of a research study and we are in different faculties.</p>

<p>The action was that they declined to shake my hand for religious reasons (we are the opposite sex). This is not about wanting to shake someones hand, I do not want to contact anyone who doesn't want to for any reason. The way I was personally affected by their actions was that I was really emotionally and personally distracted after the incident and they might want to know about the experience someone had in their lab.</p>

<p>I value that they have religious rights, and want to respect those as much as possible. On the other hand, I do happen to value open communication on a personal level as being more socially active than being silent. I just want to tell them that it made me feel like: ""You can't use the information from my research session because if you can't see me for more than a body, then that's equivalent of not seeing me as a human subject in your research trial"". That's being petty though, I want to engage in active listening as much as expressing myself, and would never actually withhold my information from the study.</p>

<p>It has also been recommended to me that I offer alternatives such as offering a wave instead of a handshake, or just not disclosing the reason for the declined contact if it is discriminatory.</p>

<p>In case I did decide to contact the individual, I contacted my student union's ombudsman asking for what services I might have available in terms of peer support. I don't know what this support would look like maybe editing a draft letter or having mental health back-up. I got an automated response that they are out of office until after the semester is over.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Since asking this question I have built up some context on what those religious reasons might be, and have learned to not take it personal. I will NOT be contacting the individual, any qualm I have with a religious policy has nothing to do with that person.</strong></p>

"How to handle an unreasonably hostile individual when avoiding them/the situation is not an option?","<p>This question was inspired by the events that took place on the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dr-gridlock/wp/2017/12/11/they-made-her-put-out-her-cigarette-she-then-threatened-to-kill-everyone-on-the-plane/?utm_term=.3c7d4255053e"" rel=""noreferrer"">Southwest flight from Portland to Sacramento where a woman became unruly and threatened to kill everyone on the plane when she was caught smoking a cigarette mid-flight</a>. </p>

<p>In one of the comments on the linked article, a person noted how calm the person sitting next to her was even as she made these threats and other people on-board and the crew had to restrain her for the remainder of the flight.</p>

<p>Now, if I were the person next to her I don't know what I'd do but I don't think I'd just sit there. I feel my first reaction would be to try to reason with her and calm her down but from my experience, when someone is in such a state (clearly not making logical or reasonable actions/decisions) this approach would just make her and yourself more frustrated and agitate the situation.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best ways to interact with a person in an unreasonably hostile state in a situation where keeping out of it is just not an option?</strong> The goal would be to calm the person down until someone of authority can come in and handle the situation (waiting to land the plane or for a police officer to show up). </p>

<p>I'd equate her behavior to that of someone acting drunk and disorderly so I'm looking for answers that could be used in this aspect as well, essentially how to communicate with and calm someone who is in an immature, illogical state of mind. </p>

"How do I tactfully avoid interacting with a person I meet on the way to work every day, at a subway station?","<p><sub>This is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a question about how to say no to street vendors. I specifically want to know how I can avoid interacting with a particular person who <strong>just happens to be</strong> a street vendor. He could be any other person I meet on the subway every day, and not necessarily a street vendor. So please don't close this question as a duplicate of <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3223/appropriate-ways-to-dismiss-street-vendors"">an earlier question</a>.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>I am a second-generation American of Middle Eastern/ South Asian origin working in a big city in the USA where there is a subway.</p>

<p>Usually someone is selling newspapers in the morning.</p>

<p>For the past year there has been this creepy-looking person (in my opinion) selling newspapers. This person looks like a cunning criminal type. Although I cannot give you 'evidence' of this, it is my 'gut feeling' which we are encouraged to trust while encountering a stranger. </p>

<p>He tends to go up to people, say hello, ask them for a high-five. I even see people stop and talk to him.</p>

<p>Then last year when I was minding my own business, he came up to me and asked for a high-five.</p>

<p>I was really scared of saying ""no"" because one time when I refused someone who was soliciting money, they got really aggressive and I almost had to call the cops on them. [I and my family do not have good experiences with officials and prefer not to involve any officials in this matter.]</p>

<p>So for a year I reluctantly gave high-fives and acted like I was happy about it. </p>

<p>Then a few months ago I saw a video on computer security and the person presenting it said something interesting, ""You are an adult, say no"".</p>

<p>So the next day when I was in the subway and this person wanted a high-five I gave a thumbs up and said this is easy for me. Then he thought I am celebrating Ramadan, hence I am not giving high-five (I look Muslim, plus I wear long skirts). He asked if I am fasting for Ramadan and I said yes, just to end the conversation right then and there.</p>

<p>Now it's way past Ramadan, and the person jokingly asks for high-five. I am polite and say, ""have a nice day"".</p>

<p>Believe it or not, many 2nd generation Americans retain a lot of mindset (for better or worse) from their ancestral country. Plus I keep hearing that acid attacks are now coming to Western countries like France and the UK. My ancestral background is from a culture where such attacks against women are not uncommon. So honestly, <strong>I am really scared of random interactions with unknown people.</strong>  I also want to avoid angering anyone. </p>

<p>I wish I can smile and give a friendly nod and pass by: but not talk or give him a high-five. My concern is, if I interact with him more, my boundaries will be overstepped and I won't know how to de-escalate. It is hard to ignore a person who you have no choice but to pass by each day, <em>if he oversteps my boundaries.</em></p>

<p>Many members have commented that my fears about this person seem irrational. I don't think they are irrational but that argument doesn't invalidate my question anyway because <strong>I have a right to avoid him if I want to, whatever the reason.</strong> To get around that controversial point let us simply assume that I am extremely shy and want to avoid interacting with this person for that reason: how do I do it tactfully without antagonizing this person? Please address that aspect rather than my possible motivations.</p>

<p>QUESTION: How to avoid interacting with this person and how can I politely communicate my lack of interest verbally or <strong>non-verbally</strong> (preferred) without upsetting him, myself, or any surrounding people?</p>

"Dealing with colleagues who think single women as being always available","<p>I am an Indian woman, residing in India and single.  And the latter brings a lot of unwanted attention to myself, from both genders. Females make fun of me stating that I need to get married and start giving me unsolicited advice. Male colleagues take it for granted that I am available. As far as I have seen, married women are respected a lot and they are even spoken to smoothly. </p>

<p>I have lunch with a few colleagues, one of them is a married female. We all have good conversations and it was okay until a few days back. One day, that female colleague had a slight dress (read, Indian salwar kameez) mishap and her cleavage was visible. She was not aware of it and was still talking to all of us. I noticed and messaged her and she adjusted. She is a busty woman. The important point is, I found that two of the men didn't want to see that cleavage and they put their heads down though they were listening to her. </p>

<p>A few days back, I had such mishap too. There was no female to correct me and it went unnoticed. But, those same two male colleagues were staring at my cleavage and were giggling. I was in an Indo-western attire. Even if I were in Indian casuals, I think I would have got those nasty stares and giggles. </p>

<p>I really wanted to tell those men that I had respected them when there was a similar mishap with the other colleague and they chose not to see it. But, when it came to me, they chose to enjoy the scene (as termed in Indian context). </p>

<p><strong>In what ways do I convey this point to them that their irrational behaviour is not welcome with me? Can I state the same thing what I have written here?</strong></p>

"How to deal with the fact my dad raised money for charity, then spent the cash on himself?","<p>I'm 26, female, living at home with my parents for now (boyfriend left me to get a job abroad, said the relationship was effectively over), and over the past few months my dad was fundraising £40,000 for kids with Down's Syndrome.</p>

<p>I was pleased when he told me he wanted to do something helpful. Dad had always wanted to raise money for charity, but never had the time until a few years ago, when he started volunteering to teach art to kids with Down's Syndrome (2 days a week).</p>

<p>He raised £60,000 in total since March.</p>

<p>However, last night, he told me that he'd got something important to say; he confessed to pocketing the cash, spending £13,000 on a dating agency for his sister (my aunt), £5,000 on an old Mercedes car, £3,000 on a beat-up old Transit van, and £1,500 on a classic guitar from an online auction. That means there's only £37,500 left of the £60,000 he's got. It was a little-known fact my aunt wanted to join a dating agency, except to my dad and her. BTW, this dating agency is based in London and normally caters to super-rich people, but has no income-requirement.</p>

<p>He expects me to spend some of the cash, said ""Go get that £20k Mercedes SL you saw on Autotrader that's your dream car, you can afford it now, it's gonna be so good when I see my daughter owning a classic 2000s Merc for not much money.""</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong - dad's obsessed with Mercedes, owns things with their badging on. It's true, I liked that car, but I'd probably buy it out of my own money.</p>

<p>FWIW, we're middle-class; a white middle-class family (well, half-Indian, half-English, to be exact; i look less ""Indian"", more white, think Charli XCX the pop star if you've no idea).</p>

<p>I feel outraged, but didn't tell him at the time.</p>

<p>My mum knows, and is so angry she does not know what to do.</p>

<p>I did ask him at the time why he did it, he claimed ""I only raised the money to look good and get in the local newspapers"". </p>

<p>I'm not looking for legal advice, more moral advice, since my dad's fundraising seems to have been solely for making money for himself.</p>

<p>I'm struggling to understand why he would do this; previously he'd been very much a good person, never done anything criminal etc. but I'm worried about the consequences. I do love my dad, but am worried about what the repercussions will be when this is revealed.</p>

<p>It's not a case of IF this will be revealed, but WHEN people will find out.</p>

<p>I work in a public-facing job (ironically enough, for a non-profit organization) and have a public profile on said charity's page (local charity, not a national one) but I don't handle this kind of thing; I only do marketing, not public relations, not marketing and PR.</p>

<p>My basic question is; how do I handle the fact my dad raised money for charity and pocketed part of the cash? Is he a scam artist/con artist?</p>

"How to treat a pompous person who scares away people?","<p>You know the type. One who lectures everyone, disapproves of questions if they don't fit in his (very narrow) definition of the subject discussed, be it history, YA novels, cinematography, cartoons or anything else, really. Let's call him Malvolio.</p>

<p>To give one example, Malvolio considers any criticism of an author or artist reprimandable, which really kills any discussion. </p>

<p>Ours is a volunteer organisation, each of us volunteer the hours we can and we give lectures on various subjects. Our audience consists mostly of 11-17 year olds. </p>

<p>I myself lately am quite busy and able to drop in only once in a fortnight or even just once a month, while Malvolio helps out much more frequently,  at least twice a week. It is very commendable and he means well, but, problem is, he scares away the kids. He reprimands them, makes them feel ignorant. The kids complain to us,  other tutors about this behaviour, and that his lectures are dry and uninteresting then ask questions such as ""'Who will be here tomorrow in our group?  If it's Mr. Malvolio, we prefer not to come.""</p>

<p>On coffee breaks with us (there are usually 4-5 volunteers present as the kids are divided by age groups) he recommends that we should be more strict, as ""These kids need to be taught discipline and manners.""</p>

<p>Should we, other tutors do something about this? If yes, what exactly? Talk to him? I'd really hate to complain to the manager lady, Malvolio does so much more than most of us who have full time jobs.</p>

<p>I am Israeli, the kids in question are from different backgrounds: from Ethiopia, Russia, Middle East and so on. The kids are mainly from 'problematic families' and the goal is to keep them off the streets. Teaching them something is an added benefit. Some prefer to play football outside, which is also (mostly) okay with the manager as long as they stay with us and don't leave. The lecture subjects have to be approved by the manager, who is also present at the first lecture of new volunteers, but otherwise she's quite busy organizing (food delivery, schedules, collecting donations and so on). The lectures take place in Israel.</p>

"I do art. When people say ""draw me"", do I include their physical appearance flaws?","<p>So I draw little caricature-doodles for fun and am decently good at it. Sometimes people ask me (very casually, not for pay or anything) to draw them. What if this person is overweight or has an obvious flaw like a big nose or acne? Should I draw that in or try to make them look attractive? </p>

<p>Now, I know a really self-conscious person won't ask me to draw them in the first place, but nobody has 100% self-confidence. Do people expect me to make them look attractive even if they know they are not?</p>

<p>However, if I leave off a flaw then the drawing will not resemble the person. Also not drawing in an obvious flaw will ironically highlight it because it says I've noticed it and know it is unattractive enough to modify my drawing. </p>

<p><strong>Is it considered rude to ASK such a thing?</strong> Sometimes asking is considered bad like if somebody wants to know if they are fat and you respond with ""do you want the truth or flattery"". I'm much in the same position</p>

<p>Ok: to stick very close to the interpersonal skills guidelines, here are my official questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do I modify my drawing or not? This is an action to be taken in response to the interpersonal situation of offending somebody by highlighting their flaws.</p></li>
<li><p>Is it rude to ask directly if I should make them more attractive?</p></li>
<li><p>What phrasing should I use in 2 such that the phrasing doesn't overtly say ""should I cover up your ugliness""?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>2 and 3 are subject to the person LYING to me, then magically expecting me to know how to act. Americans love to do this. So this brings me back to 1.</p>

<p>I tried to explain to her that the person in her dream is not me. Whatever she dreamed has little to do with reality. But her argument is: <strong>She wouldn't dream that if there would be no reason to dream like this.</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I saw a friend and he told me his wife was angry at him because she discovered a used condom in his pocket in her dream. He also tried to explain to her <strong>it was just a dream</strong>. And she answered like: <strong>""But why did you do that?""</strong></p>

<p>We all live in Thailand but I guess that could happen anywhere. It seems some women (maybe also men, I don't know) mix up dreams with reality and they want an explanation from a real person about what happened in their dreams.</p>

"How to apologise for how you said something without going back on the content","<p>A long term friend (the trend on IPS seems to be to call her 'Alice') is a little promiscuous and quite often uses her <em>charms</em> to get guys to do things they wouldn't otherwise do. A guy we recently met has fallen for her and has been there for every request she ever makes. </p>

<p>Anyway, it ended up last night with me having a go at her and, in a bit of a shouting match, using some rather strong language (that I'm pretty sure this site won't let me repeat) and saying some pretty insulting stuff mixed in with telling her I don't approve of how shes treating this guy.</p>

<p>If it helps some of what I said was (warning - strong language):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""You just can't keep your slutty claws out of guys who will fall for your sh*t can you?""</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now, I'm sure it won't come across from what is in those hiders but I actually don't care how much sex she chooses to have or with who, it's just how she treats the guys who get sucked in.</p>

<p><strong>How should I apologise for the way I said stuff, but without going back on how I feel about her behaviour?</strong></p>

<h2>Clarifications</h2>

<ul>
<li>The guys tend to (not always) be fairly innocent to start with. After a little sexual experience, they think their relationship with her is something really special but she just wants to draw them along until they get too clingy or stop doing everything she wants.</li>
<li>I wanted to apologise because I felt bad for upsetting her and because I felt the actual content of what I said was easier for her to ignore if it was cloaked in some pretty nasty language.</li>
<li>Alice and I are just friends and the guys we're meeting come from anywhere, normally we're both friends with them for a while first, but the most recent one was a guy I'd known for months (had no intention of sleeping with though) and have really seen the change in him and how much time he spends studying since she has started getting with him.</li>

"Addressing conflict in interaction with old grandmother","<p><strong>tl;dr: My hot tempered grandmother has gotten even more short fused and unpredictable with age, which has lead to conflict with my mother (who lives with her) and me (who lives abroad but calls weekly). How can I address the conflict without harming the relationship?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I love my grandmother. She had a great role to play as I grew up. However, as time passes, the effect of age brings issues that I find very hard to deal with. </p>

<p>The most important aspects to remark are, as I see it:
- I've been living abroad for a couple of years, but I've made it a point to call home once per week (more than that is not possible due to time difference and technical constraints). My mother lives with her. I was visiting home a couple of months ago.
- Her memory fades. She remembers us and some things (like the fact that I'm abroad), but she forgets the names of things and often what we've said.
- She tends to draw dramatic consequences from prosaic events. For instance, if I call earlier than the last few times, she will assume I had an accident or something along the lines.
- She doesn't hear well, and often pretends to have understood when in fact she didn't. My mother is often nearby and helps her in such cases, and I got her some good noise-isolating headphones, but it is still a major obstacle.</p>

<p>It is often enough that I tell her about my week and reassure her whenever she has some misled fear. However, occasionally it is not. Last time I was visiting, I offered to cook sometimes (periodically, but sporadically, every Sunday for instance). It was at first welcomed and even praised, but once she decided that it meant we were forcing her to eat a specific thing and refused to eat. My mother tried to remark that it was a rude thing to do, and my grandmother entered a self-deprecating state where she claims she is a burden.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, I was in the middle of our usual conversation with my mother, after which I would normally talk to my grandmother. Apparently my mother took the call from another room as she uses to and my grandmother interpreted that as a red flag. As my mother tried to minimize the fact and explained that it was just circumstantial, my grandmother assumed we were hiding information from her and refused to take the call. After some attempt of mediation, she took it, rudely asked for news and left after a minute. I was absolutely confused and couldn't think of anything to keep her on the phone for longer. My mother also reproached her behaviour this time, remarking that her (my grandmother's) words may be hurtful for us, who love her.</p>

<p>I try to understand all the complexity that comes with age, and hope to find a way to reduce the stress and anxiety on my grandmother. However, this is passing a toll on my mother's nerves and mine. We don't know how to address these scenarios and whenever they come they ruin everyone's mood and peace.</p>

<p>So, finally, my question is:<br>
How could my mother and I prevent these reactions from my grandmother from escalating, ideally while also preventing them to happen often in the future?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit 1: As requested in the comments, I update the question to remark that it has been a problem for years and, throughout that time, her doctors have dismissed the situation as ""normal for her age"" and never pointer to Alzheimer's.</p>

"Winning too many games at game night - how can I keep it fun for everyone?","<p>A few friends and I, on Friday nights, play board games and video games. It's enjoyable, and they're good friends. There's one small issue. I win too many of them. Far, far too many of them. </p>

<p>I've won all the games we've played on the last seven of eight nights. I'm trying to be a good player - I don't trample over others' successes, I don't rub it in, I give honest compliments on interesting play styles... but after so many consecutive weeks, it's starting to sound trite, even if I do genuinely mean it. They're interesting people to play games with. </p>

<p>We tried switching to video games - including games I've never played, like Mario Kart and Arms. I ended up winning a disproportionate number of matches of Arms, and (for how new I was) did well in Mario Kart.</p>

<p>It doesn't just happen at game nights. When I play <a href=""https://www.starrealms.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Star Realms</a> with them, I consistently get long win streaks. The last six games I played with one of these friends, I won. They won one before that, and I won what feels like another five or six before that. </p>

<p>I don't think anyone is going to overtly say anything - this group is too polite and kind for that. But I've noticed the group... avoiding playing these kinds of games, when I'm around. We usually end up doing something else. Which I'm okay with, but we all love playing games, and there has to be a way to get this to work.</p>

<hr>

<p>I feel like I'm in a bind. I don't want my friends to lose interest in playing with me. Part of the fun of games is the social aspect, yes, but part of the fun is also the equitable chance to win, and I don't want them to feel like that's being crushed out. </p>

<p>Intentionally losing games feels manipulative, and there's no way they won't notice if I make obvious mistakes. Recently, I've started going with atypical strategies in games, to see if I can get them to work and give myself a slight disadvantage. I do, and so far, I'm winning no less often. I'm not playing competitively, either - gunning for a win and trying to shove others out of the game has never been a play style, or social style, that I like. </p>

<p>On the other hand, what can I do? I know this all sounds pretentious as hell, but it's a real problem I'm facing. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to keep game nights fun?</p>

Both my mother and his parents know about it. I actually worry more about the effects of tobacco. </p>

<p>Sometimes my mother visits us and there had been a couple of times, where he happened to do it in front of her knowing that she knows about it. My mom is a very discreet person and never said anything so far to indicate it had bothered her. I certainly thought it hadn't. </p>

<p>Recently though, and after watching some documentary <strong>about the effects of smoking in general</strong>, she told me she doesn't feel as comfortable. 
Boyfriend doesn't smoke right in her face and almost always asks if parents mind if visiting. His dad lets him smoke inside the house but my mom and his mom don't do that. Mom is concerned a lot and she wants to say something about it but she doesn't know how to approach it since it's not really her business whether he smokes or not.
I don't want her to say anything but I don't want her to stop visiting either. I told her that I'd rather she never came by the house again than saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. I don't want this escalating. We are in our thirties.</p>

<p>My mom has an increased concern about my boyfriend's health because of the smoking and the fact that I am a passive smoker, which is understandable.
People smoke. He is one of them. Do I particularly like that he smokes? NO. But I can't make him stop. I know my mom's concerns are valid and that she feels uncomfortable about it but she tends to be a bit stubborn about it and not wanting to drop the subject. (Not saying she's wrong but she tends to lecture me about it). </p>

<p>How do I address these concerns?  If I decide to tell my boyfriend about it, how can I tell him to minimize conflict? Is there anything my mom can say next time she visits that won't make things awkward and potentially cause a fight? </p>

"How do I respond when an acquaintance asks if I'm smart?","<p>I recently graduated college and I am now working as a programmer at a startup tech company for a year.  I'm a competent programmer, but I'm definitely not a rock-star.  </p>

<p>When I'm meeting other young adults or college students and I tell them what I do they often seem impressed and ask something like ""so you must be really smart?"" or ""is what you do really hard?""  I feel like saying yes would make me seem arrogant, so I usually respond by saying I think I'm doing well enough.  This ends up being awkward and also undersells the actual work that I have done. <strong>So, how do I answer this honestly without being rude?</strong> </p>

"How to get clients to pay their bills and still be happy?","<p>I'm working in the enterprise SaaS equivalent of gym memberships. The client knows they should use it because it's good for them (earns them $$$), and once they get into the swing of it, they enjoy it. But, despite my best efforts at UX, the subject matter is inherently dry for creatives, and if they get distracted or in a rut, they're prone to stop ""going to the gym"". As the ""personal trainer"" I have to remain vigilant at keeping everyone happy and motivated or I lose clients ... hence the interpersonal relationship skills.</p>

<p>Some clients don't pay their bills on time, and the system automatically cuts access to the profitable parts (along with a courtesy email to their accounting department and account manager). Once a month or so a user emails me and says (paraphrasing the tone) ""I can't get access to my data because the account's overdue. I'm trying to get work done and this makes it difficult. Can you restore access please?""</p>

<p>(For context, at the moment I'm replying something like ""<em>Sorry, it cuts you off automatically when the account is overdue. I've restored access. [Name of acct manager in copy], has the invoice been processed? By which date can we expect payment?</em>"")</p>

<p>Can anyone give me an explanation of the attitude of these users, and offer a strategy of what I could say or how I could behave to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Increase the probability of being paid on time, while concurrently;</li>
<li>making these users happier through those actions (i.e. avoiding ""coercing"" compliance with payment terms through punishments. I can think of plenty of coercive things I could do, but they would decrease user happiness).</li>

"How to get along with a parent that has painfully different views & values?","<p>I'm struggling to connect more with my mom and want to know how to overcome one of the most significant boundaries that keeps ruining our efforts. In short the challenge is that we have such different views and values when it comes to politics, budgeting, long-term life decisions and priorities. When it comes to life decisions &amp; personal values it appears to me my mom is often self-sabotaging herself. When it comes to political views my mom attacks mine and we have fierce, passionate disagreements (political divide like is happening in many parts of the European world).</p>

<p>A little context:</p>

<p>My mom raised my sister and I mostly on her own. That wasn't easy for her. Fast forward, and I changed my life for the better with education, hard work, and a mixed bag of luck with at least some positive. I now live in a different country than my mom and sister.</p>

<p>My mom and I talk on average about once a week and see each other on average once a year for about a week. We care about each other and let one another know. Where our relationship falls apart is in challenging personal quirks (example: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/7064/how-to-deal-with-person-offloading-their-indecision-on-their-host-under-guise-of"">How to deal with person offloading their indecision on their host under guise of kindness?</a>) and - the main interest in this question - in views &amp; values. Here are two examples of how my mom differs painfully in...</p>

<p>...<strong>political views</strong>: My mother ridicules people who share my political values, and has what I see as extremist ideas in support of very conservative government, opposing any civil rights or human rights codes   </p>

<p>...<strong>and personal values</strong>: My mom has never been good at managing money, and she's made her life harder a number of times through rash decisions, impulsive purchases, or simply bad strategies in my opinion. One example is buying a house. She lived in a dangerous neighborhood and it took a while but she was finally convinced to move. I urged her to make a frugal, safe purchase in order to gain personal and financial security which is especially important as she nears retirement and the country around her is struggling. She decided to buy a more expensive place, in a more upscale building. It hurts me to see her act in ways that look like self-sabotage to me, no matter how I empathize and try to see her reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>What can I do to overcome these differences in views &amp; values, to try to build a lasting healthy relationship with my mom?</strong> I want us to be able to share how things are going in life, and eventually I see that my mom would need someone she can turn to as she's older. At this rate, we can barely be open with each other (we try, inevitably it crashes and burns and it takes time to heal &amp; reconnect), and if she tried moving to my country for retirement it would be a disaster (we can't tolerate living each others roofs and she gets pretty helpless when out of her routine/being in a new place).</p>

"How to ask a host to fix something, they consider due to their lacking knowledge, not flawed?","<p>I am living for 2 months now in a pension and will probably stay there for 3~4 more months. The host provides WLAN. Sadly the WLAN is blocking some websites and a vast amount of ports required for VOIP, gaming, and gaming platforms (i.e. playsstation network, steam, blizzard and so on).</p>

<p>When I payed my lease for December, my host asked me if everything is fine. I said it is, and incidental asked if I am right in my assumption that the blocking of websites and services is intended. They responded that this can't be and the trouble must come from lacking signal strength. I said, I am quite sure that isn't the case, as the behavior of the services doesn't fit with what it would be for a bad connection. They promised me, they will check if they can figure out anything. Since then even more pages (some I was earlier able to access) got blocked now<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>The problem here is, I think my hosts don't seem to be technically very skilled. So I am quite sure, they either used some default setup for the WLAN not knowing that it will lead to a lot of services being blocked or they actually miss configured their router. It also could have been that they flat out lied to me, to avoid a conflict, but lets ignore that option here, since in that case I would fight a not winnable battle anyways.</p>

<p>So how can I approach them about this? The problem I see is, just going to them and telling them they are wrong and probably just unconsciously configured something wrong when they set up the WLAN, will most likely not do me any favor. If someone would approach me this way, I would get defensive, maybe even miffed, and most likely I wouldn't investigate if I indeed might have done something wrong. Especially not if that would require me to do some research to increase my knowledge on that matter.</p>

<p>So how can I approach them so that it is most likely, either them researching them self how to set up such a device correctly, or letting me physically access their private devices and checking the configuration under their supervision<sup>2</sup>?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> This didn't necessarily happen after my request, as it is like 2 ~ 3 weeks ago I last accessed the now as well blocked website.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The latter is just an option if there is no real way I could archive the former. Since I expect neither they would really want me to enter their home and <em>play around</em> on their private device, for something just being in MY interest, nor would I really feel comfortable with that, since they will probably blame me, if in the future ever anything with devices involved would cause trouble.</p>

"How to invite people to an event who don't get along?","<p>I'm hosting an event in a couple of weeks - my son's first birthday party. I have several people who I would like to invite. Unfortunately, some of them don't get along. This seems to be a one-sided disagreement - meaning that Person A doesn't like Family B for some slight that Person A can't get past. I'm not involved in the disagreement and don't completely understand it but my husband and I regularly interact with both Person A and Family B and would like to invite them both to the event.</p>

<p>Neither of these parties are family. They are both friends. Person A was in our wedding and Family B hosted our baby shower for our son, so both are part of our close circle of friends. Person A did not attend the baby shower but that was at Family B's home while this event is at our home.</p>

<p>So, I see a few ways of this turning out.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>I invite both but don't tell Person A</strong>.<br>
Person A may or may not get grumpy at me for not telling them in advance but they are both at the party. Person A may depart early rather than being around Family B.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I invite both and tell Person A.</strong><br>
Person A will likely not come to the party. I would be disappointed in this outcome. Person A may still be grumpy at me for inviting Family B, ""preventing them"" from coming to the party.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't invite Family B.</strong><br>
I've already given an invite to Person A, so the opposite of this isn't possible. This feels like I'm getting in the middle of the ""feud"" and picking sides. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, how should I handle this? Is there some alternate solution that I'm not seeing here? I don't really feel like I should be even having to deal with this. They are all adults, so perhaps I'm over-thinking things. I trust them all to be gracious at the party and not make a scene, so perhaps option 1 is the best choice... but I feel like full disclosure might be more fair to Person A.</p>

"Untangling the intersections of transphobia, fetishization, and reality","<p>This is an issue that I've been running into quite a bit in the last year or so, primarily on an online image/meme sharing site. It usually pops up in the context of cosplayers' or animes' depictions of transgender or crossdressing fictional characters, which almost inevitably kicks off a roaring dumpster fire of really gross comments.</p>

<p>These really gross comments usually fall into, or are posted by, two opposing factions. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The general *phobic nastiness. </p>

<ul>
<li>Openly challenging and condemning people's gender, sexuality, mental health etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The fetishization of trans and/or crossdressing people. </p>

<ul>
<li>Oddly claiming to be supportive of trans and crossdressing folks using hypersexual and often plainly derogatory terms. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>This is obviously really unpleasant to witness if you happen to be trans, or are close to folks who are... Basically walking in on a fight between two groups who both get it completely wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Now I know that going after the generally phobic doesn't tend to help, so I'll set that aside for the purposes of this question.</strong></p>

<p>I'd like to focus on group 2, the fetishists, because it almost seems like they're attempting to ""get it"", or at least may at some level be a little more receptive. </p>

<p>I don't see anything inherently wrong with having a fantasy, most people do, and <em>for the most part</em> that's healthy and normal. But... at point... These fantasies intersect with the real world. That's where things can get more than a little irksome. The way a trans or crossdressing person is talked to, or about, in a sexual fantasy piece written by a cisgender person often isn't how they'd like to be talked to, or about in reality. Often the way these characters are depicted is completely divorced from reality. </p>

<p>So far I've tried gently, and admittedly, at times, less gently, explaining that some terms aren't ok. The most common one being the term ""trap"". Usually saying something as simple as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, maybe if you like them, you could stop using derogatory terms to talk about them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This usually just leads down a semantics rabbit hole, and seems fruitless. They're kind of dug in, have the support of their peers, and seem to think that the anime, or other fictional work, is somehow authoritative. </p>

<p><strong>How does one begin to untangle the fantasy, or fetish, from the reality?</strong> How does one explain that the depictions of trans and/or crossdressing folks, and the language used, in these fictional works doesn't generally connect to the real world? And that when they use that language and believe those depictions, they may end up doing harm to real people in the real world?</p>

"My brother messes up his life (and those of other family members) by doing nothing. How to have a talk with him about this?","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: My 30 years-old brother messes up his life, and those of other family members, by doing nothing. I need my brother to open up and explain his point of view, so that I can understand him.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get my brother to talk with me about these issues?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>I have a younger brother who will turn 30 in a few weeks and who has no clue what to do with his life. This affects the lives of other family members, especially that of our mother with whom he is currently living (again). Mother once mentioned that his behavior will be the reason why she will bite the dust if this continues.</p>

<p>But let's start at the beginning:</p>

<p>Our father died when he was a teenager and was still going to school. At that time I somehow slipped into the father role because I was the only person he listened to. My mother barely had access to him at that time. After he finished school he went to a foreign country for a year and then moved to another country to study there. </p>

<p>He finished his Bachelor's degree two or three years ago. Even though the death of our father deeply affected him, he seemed to be back on track. After finishing his Bachelor's he moved back to our home country (in Western Europe) and moved in with our mother and had no plans as to what to do with his life, which continues up till now. He is literally doing nothing. He never worked in his life (I'm not considering being a paperboy during school as ""work""). Our mother is working in two jobs and is breaking her back and he does <em>nothing</em>. </p>

<p>At the moment I'm seeing three problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He's not having any money problems. We received a heritage after our grandparents deceased. A five digit figure. He used the money to invest it in the stock market. He's not gambling but really doing his research and is in the market for the long-term and makes quite a bit from time to time. If I were to guess, his current financial situation would allow up to 4 years of living alone. </p></li>
<li><p>He had offers in the financial sector (his Bachelor's is related and he considered working in this field) but you won't be able to start directly managing a billion $ hedge fund. He has a problem with the concept that, at the beginning of your career, you usually start at the bottom of the ladder and slowly climb up. He thinks he can start at the very top because ""everything is logical"". Besides that, he once mentioned he doesn't want to work for someone. But he also does not want to start his own business because then he would have to deal with things he dislikes.</p></li>
<li><p>Our mother is not throwing him out. She's afraid that she would lose her son if she throws him out. I've told her a million times to set him a deadline. Either he gets a job and split the costs or he has to move out. It took me over a year to convince her to ask at least for rent. But the amount she asked for is also more symbolic. (I don't know the exact figure but I would be surprised if it would be more than 100 Euros a month).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the beginning, I defended him to my family members that he would make his way. I don't think that you need to follow the conventional way and get a 9-to-5 job and live your life like anyone else. But he's not living at all at the moment. </p>

<h3>What I've tried</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>I've told him that the only problem he has and why other family members attack him, is the fact, that he's not living on his own. He doesn't need much money. He's not going partying, doing any drugs or has any expensive hobbies. </p></li>
<li><p>I've made several suggestions as to what he could do and how he could turn his strengths and hobbies into a living. </p></li>
<li><p>I introduced him to people in the sector where he would like to work. But if I ask him a few weeks later, he just tells me that he didn't have the time to follow up or comes with some other phony excuse.</p></li>
<li><p>About a year ago I wrote him a (snail-mail) letter, where I explained him at length, that he's messing up his life. This gap in his CV is something he cannot explain to any potential employer. Everyone will think he was in prison or has something else to hide. </p>

<p>Two weeks after I sent him this letter I asked him if he had anything to say about it. His reply was that he didn't have any time to read it yet (even though he couldn't tell me what he was busy with). Four weeks later he told me that he still needs to think about it. He wanted to make up his mind if he would like to travel a bit or get a Master's degree or apply for an internship or a job.</p></li>
<li><p>I offered him help if he needed some. I also suggested to go to a psychologist if there's something that holds him back that he doesn't want to talk with family members about. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>But nothing has happened ever since.</p>

<h3>What I want to do:</h3>

<p>I want to know how I can involve my brother in a dialog where he opens up and tells me his point of view so that I can understand him. I want to have something I can work with. The only thing I know is that he's not happy with the situation either.</p>

<p>I just want to understand his behavior and would like to know from him how he imagines his future and what is currently holding him back. So that I can work from there on forward.</p>

<p>Every time I bring up the topic, he totally blocks and gets mute and we have several weeks of silence between us. From my point of view I don't have the feeling that I'm pressuring him (considering that this has been going on for two years) and I also don't consider myself judgmental (I don't care <em>what</em> he is doing as long as he's happy and not affecting others with his behavior).</p>

<p><strong>How can I involve my brother in a dialog where he opens up and tells me his point of view so that I can understand him?</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Update]</strong></p>

<p>Thank you all for being very helpful and patient. I have reached my goal and currently I am having some kind of dialog with my brother. If I could I would point out which advice was most helpful from you but it was a mixture of factors which came together. But pushing me to reflect my own behavior was definitely a huge part of solving my question.</p>

"Is it bad that I called someone who (kind of) works above me, ""buddy""?","<h3><em>Background</em></h3>

<p>I'm an intern at a corporation (3/10 months in), and work directly for the manager of the department (I.T.). I do good work and my boss definitely likes (tolerates) me.. I'm nearing 30 years old, and most everyone else is 40+ years old.. </p>

<p>There's one man in particular who also works directly for the manager (maybe 45-48 y.o.), let's call him ""John"", and he's been working here for 3-4 years. He's sometimes goofy and loud, slightly temperamental, and seems to like making (lame/forced/just not funny) jokes at inappropriate times (nothing sexual). When this happens I try to read my boss's face/body language, and I can tell he doesn't like it. Other than that though, I suppose John does good work and ""gets things done"".</p>

<p><br>
The relationship between me and John is as follows: </p>

<p>We work in adjacent cubicles, and interact 2-3 times a day. When we interact it feels a little forced, mostly because I think the guy is obnoxious, and he tries to explain everything all the time, assuming nobody knows anything. I have a very technical background, whereas he doesn't so much, and so, many of our interactions are him explaining something to me that I already know, and me pretending that I'm listening and learning. This is why I say its ""forced"", in some respect. </p>

<p>We sometimes will have conversations about non work related things, and every other week on payday we (the department) get breakfast together before work. During those times things are a bit ""smoother"", but he still makes inappropriate remarks and maintains that demeanor outside of the workplace. Because of that, I choose not to engage too much with him. So, our relationship is definitely more ""business"" than not. </p>

<p><em>End Background</em></p>

<p>So, today we're all in a meeting (me, my boss and John), and John is talking about how a bunch of people won't be in the office tomorrow, including my boss, and in response to John's statements I said, ""Yeah, it'll just be me and you, buddy"". I didn't emphasize the ""buddy"" or anything; it just was a light-hearted, quick remark. And I don't think it phased either of them, per se, however, nobody said anything in response (though, what would they say anyway?). </p>

<p><br>
<strong>Question</strong>: </p>

<p>Even though I don't work for John, he does have seniority over me, and given the fact that the comment was light-hearted, was it rude that I called him ""buddy""? How did our boss interpret this? And how might you have reacted if you were John? </p>

"How to talk to a person not sticking to the rules of a secret santa and disappointing the receiver of their gift?","<p>Time for a holiday-themed question. </p>

<p>I lead a small online group in an MMORPG. For the holidays, we decided to exchange gifts ala Secret Santa. As leader, I took it upon myself to organize the whole thing. The mechanics for the gift exchange was that participants would sign up, and they would give a gift of an in-game item to another random participant, and receive a gift from another random participant. We agreed on a budget, drew lots, setup a wishlist so people can get the item they want, and exchanged gifts after a few days.  </p>

<p>Now, a few days later, one of the members who signed up for the exchange comes to me, upset, asking if it was OK to give gifts under the budget. She felt that she should have gotten something of equivalent value, as she also gave a gift at the right amount, saying ""I gave fairly"".  </p>

<p>Full disclosure, I never really talked about ""rules"" with all the participants, like whether the budget was a maximum or a minimum amount [see MAJOR EDIT below], thinking that they would at least give something close to it. However, said member only received a gift that was less than half the budget, and is upset.  </p>

<p>I know who gave her the under-budget gift, as I was the one drawing lots, and this person isn't very ""wealthy"" in-game because he was new (I was even surprised he signed up at all!), though I know he could afford the budget with just a little extra effort on his part.  </p>

<p>I am asking because, as the one who organized the secret santa, I feel responsible for the recipient's dissatisfaction, and feel like I should do something to resolve this. The recipient also expects me to resolve this, as I talked with her while writing this question.</p>

<p>I want to communicate to the gift-giver that they should at least give something near the budget, but I'm not sure how to: do I tell him that the recipient got upset? How do I tell him to send something more appropriate (up to budget), without upsetting him, too?  </p>

<p>I'm sure I will be stepping on toes here, especially at the top voted answer, and I'm sorry for this. All I can say for myself is that I was writing the question tired and flustered at 12 midnight. I said above that I didn't explicitly say whether the budget was a maximum or minimum in the details. Well, now, having had some rest and digging up the chat logs manually, I <em>did</em> explicitly say ""at least x"" when I messaged everyone individually. <strong>So the ""budget"" I mentioned was a ""minimum"".</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Clarifications from comments:  </p>

<ul>
<li>The gifts are all in-game purchased with in-game currency. You can ""buy"" in-game currency with real money.</li>
<li>Compared to the other participants, the giver would have had to spend more, in terms of percentage, of in-game money he currently has. (think, beggar offering 5 coins vs rich man offering 5 coins kind of thing) For most of us who have been playing a while already, the budget is an affordable sum.</li>
<li>The gifts are not public, no one would know what you got unless you told everyone.</li>

"How to appear more relaxed and less reserved during job interviews?","<p>I tend to get stressed during job interviews. Nothing out of normal I guess, but I've received feedback from interviewers that I seemed quite reserved and they didn't like it. It was a justification of why they didn't want to hire me. </p>

<p>The field I apply for is full of very self-confident, even arrogant, and extroverted people, who can sell themselves very well.</p>

<p>I do smile, try to speak with confidence and keep the eye contact. But of course I don't feel as relaxed and self-confident as during e.g. social occasions, so I don't ""crack jokes"", although I always try to do some smalltalk (""So I've been told the company restaurant is very good"", ""How long have you been with the company?"", etc.). </p>

<p>Job interviews in my field frequently include tests and brainteasers, where you need to focus, which is another reason why I find it difficult to relax - I find it difficult to be totally relaxed and solve maths puzzles at the same time.</p>

<p>How can I change it? How can I come across as less reserved and more relaxed in job interviews?</p>

<hr>

<p>It's not an intrapersonal problem. I'm not asking how to get more relaxed or less reserved. I'm asking how to make an impression of being so in a very specific context of a job interview.</p>

<hr>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't add comments, so let me answer them here. I'm not a very reserved person generally. I'm definitely self-confident and in some situations even chatty, although I'm not as extroverted as many people in the industry. In group discussions I'm normally the most active or one of the most active participants. </p>

<p>I could mention here that working in another company in the same industry before I did know a lot of more introverted managers and senior managers. Some of them were extremely introverted even to me. It's just that now, during job interviews I tend to meet people to expect me to dance and joke around a second after meeting them.</p>

<p>When going to job interviews I need to mind what I'm saying and the culture of interviewing is quite confrontational in my country. You get negative feedback expressed very directly. You also need to take many tests. I find it difficult to be chatty and smily and ""bubbly"" under these conditions. I always tell myself upfront that I should behave like that, but then I come in and even the interviewers themselves mostly aren't like this. They are negative. They use stress interview techniques. I manage to remain calm but these aren't conditions that make me relaxed and chatty. I've received the negative feedback already twice or trice, so I would like to change it. (To be accurate, I also received the opposite feedback - that I would be a good culture fit and passed ""the airport test"" with flying colors"" twice or twice, but it's the negative feedback that sticks. It was always expressed very negatively like ""I can't imagine you ever working in our industry"").</p>

<p>After some thinking I suppose it might also have to do with my hitherto experiences as an employee. I've already had two jobs where I was super enthusiastic and engaged at the beginning but where I was criticised, punished and at one of them mobbed for my professional input, being proactive and sharing thoughts. This made me feel quite uncertain in work-related situations, which can result in my appearing reserved.</p>

"How to clearly understand and be understood by a friend who speaks English as a second language","<h1>My friend and business partner</h1>

<p>My business partner is very good at computer programming, and pretty bad at speaking in English.  When he writes, he is clear.  But real-time natural English is a problem.  How can we run a business together, avoid conflicts in our friendship, and persuade each other of things?</p>

<p>Let me give you an example to make this concrete.  Yesterday he came to me and said ""we're not working hard enough on this software.""  But he is interning over the summer to fulfill his student visa status; so really he is the one not working hard enough.  He wants me to work at night, which is when he is off his internship.  But I work best in the morning, and also generally alone.  We're both learning to work together, so I don't fault him for this.</p>

<p>I was not offended when asked to ""work harder,"" but I think he overstepped his request a bit in the sense that so far, I've written most of the software and fleshed out the business ideas</p>

<p>In general, he has a hard time assessing how he comes off in English (Hindi is his first language) and he has a lot of trouble being clear and concise.  It doesn't help that he's a very good programmer, which has made him somewhat arrogant so he doesn't really listen either.  I've always thought a good talker has to be a good listener to speak clearly and concisely</p>

<p>How can I help him with basic proficiency so our business doesn't fail?  I know many startups have a hard time</p>

<h1>Me:</h1>

<p>My mother was born in China, so I am familiar with the situation, but often even with her after knowing her for over 20 years, it can be hard to understand why she does things, and it's hard for her to understand my American customs, although she's lived here longer than I have</p>

"My mother taunt me everytime she wants oppose my opinion","<p>The problem is that she always use a taunt to hurt my feelings and self esteem.
There are two situation every time when I interact with my mother. Either negative or positive, there has never been a state in between which we can say a normal conversation or interaction.</p>

<p><strong>About my family</strong></p>

<p>My family has a stressed and unsuccessful type of environment. My father was not successful financially and is no more in this world now (RIP in 2012). Above me there are 2 brothers and a sister, she and one brother is married. I'm the youngest and the age difference between me and the second youngest brother is about 14 years, I'm 19 though. Both my brothers and my sister had a divorced in there first marriage and this I'm telling you because you can figure out the kind of family I'm living with. Unorganized and lazy, mostly negative. </p>

<p><strong>Lets come to the problem,</strong> When ever I'm doing any kind of interaction with my mother she always reply in a way that is painful to accept from a mother, we can ignore friends but we can not ignore or neglect mother because at the end of the day I have to stay at home to relax.</p>

<p><strong>An example.</strong>
Friday morning I woke up 10 AM and told my mother that I'm going for movie with my friends, she said okay because there were other relatives in my home.
When I returned from there 4 PM I sat on the sofa in the hall scrolling though my social media feed, and my relative asked - ""Son, have you had lunch?""
I said -""No, whats being made?""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My mother said -""Malls doesn't have lunch facility in there?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Another example</strong> is when some times I asked my mother for some favor and she reply in an unwilling tone, I got frustrated and argued then </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She taunt -""What if your work colleagues know your real personality?  They will not give a bit of respect.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[I work at a part time job in an NGO with my college to earn some money.]</p>

<p>These are just minor examples. She used to this with my elder brother also. It seems like she can not see anyone succeeding in there life. When ever I achieve something in life, I'm afraid of telling it to my mother because I know she will taunt it someday. If I share any emotion of mine with her she taunt it too in any argument. I don't want to stay with my family, but until my college ends (3 years remaining) I have no choice. Please suggest something? </p>

"How can I invite my daughter's friends over without being odd?","<p>My daughter is turning 4 years old in August. She has been going to preschool since September. Her class is pretty small, with only 6 kids. She's good friends with most of them. She'll be joining them again in the next school year.</p>

<p>The school year is coming to an end and she's going to get bored in the summer. It would be great if her classmates could come over to our house and play at some point in the summer.</p>

<p>I guess this is kind of awkward because I don't know her classmates' parents very well and the kids are quite young. I know some might not want to leave such a young kid alone with people they don't know well.</p>

<p>How can I ask without it being weird? Should I also invite the parent over too?</p>

<hr>

<p>I see the parents when I do the pickup and drop off but it's brief. There has been some small talk and some of them even gave me a lift but I haven't spent a lot of time with them. I don't think the other parents know each other very well either. </p>

"How do I tell between compliments and 'ball' jokes while juggling?","<p>While training juggling in a park, from behind me I heard a female's voice say, ""You are really good with your balls.""</p>

<p>The vocal inflection was that of a compliment, but she didn't reference juggling so my initial reaction was that she had made a lame ball joke. I turned slightly to avoid eye contact and continued juggling, completely ignoring her.</p>

<p>I try to gracefully receive compliments, and I am worried that I may have hurt her feelings by giving her the cold shoulder. How should I respond to statements that could be compliments or could be someone teasing or trolling?</p>

<p>I am a 34 y.o. male from the Pacific Northwest, USA. The female's voice was between 15 and 30.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I train technical juggling (patterns), and 7 ball endurance juggling. I train for personal reasons, and do not preform. </p>

<p>My preference is to juggle outdoors, and this has been a great way to share my knowledge about juggling. If other park visitors are interested in learning how to juggle, the conversation often starts with a compliment.</p>

<p>In my juggling experiences, non-jugglers largely fall into three categories; (1) people that are interested in juggling, (2) people that are indifferent to juggling, and (3) people that want to distract the juggler.</p>

<p>My goal is to determine the intentions of the other person.</p>

<p>If it was a genuine compliment, I would say, ""Thanks, do you want to learn how to juggle?""</p>

<p>If the statement was teasing or trolling, I'd prefer to avoid this distracting interaction, and continue training. A reply like, ""Thanks, wink wink..."" may engage the troll and further derail my training.</p>

<p>As pointed out in the answers and comments, she may have been attempting to simultaneous give a genuine compliment and make a joke about by balls. Or, she may be been showing romantic interest. I consider both of these to be edge cases, and had not considered them when writing the original post. A simple, ""thanks"" and a wave would probably be the best in either of these circumstances.</p>

"Why don't people initiate conversations with me?","<p>I don't really understand why no one actually initiates conversations with me, they always just seem to talk to someone else near me but not actually me. All of my friends start discussions with my other friends and if I try and say something to them they give me a one-word response and then ignore me.</p>

<p>It's, I just, I don't really understand why and I really want someone to talk to me more. Am I just really uninteresting? But I doubt that, because people who I don't hang out with have long and interesting discussions with me. Strange, really.</p>

<p>Why don't my friends talk to me?</p>

<p>Am I just uninteresting? Is that why they prefer other people?</p>

<p>Why do they only give me short responses?</p>

<p>And I'm not stupid, I saw a woman in the past who told me communication techniques like asking them what they're interested in and teaching me about their body language, because I have a condition which makes social situations difficult for me.</p>

<li><p>No clashes</p></li>
<li><p>Often hang out with them</p></li>
<li><p>Example, they just say 'yes yes' to what I say and then turn back to the person they were talking to, so it is futile to try and join an ongoing conversation because I'm not listened to, and conversations I start only last as long as there's no one else there. Does this just mean I'm not as important as other people?</p></li>
<li><p>This is a general thing and it has gone on for sooo long but I've just been getting upset about it lately so I decided to ask.</p></li>
<li><p>I live in England.</p></li>
<li><p>Actually, I changed my mind. <strong>Sometimes</strong> there are females but I don't know these females very well, I haven't talked to them a lot. They don't say anything to me at all. However, there are other girls who I know who talk to me all the time, it's just those ones that don't.</p></li>
<li><p>Funnily enough, I'm not actually unpopular or an outcast. In fact, the friend group that I hang out with are, what I can quote from another person, the 'outcasts' of our school year. I know almost everyone and am generally liked.</p></li>
<li><p>My friends occasionally say I'm girly because I have hair as long as a girl, they also look down upon me and speak in a patronising way to me occasionally (a lot of people speak that way to me but I get compliments for my hair every day even from strangers, it's just my friends that say I'm a girl for it).</p></li>

"How to convince co-home-owners to consult me on significant changes/purchases?","<p>I live in the US and my wife and I share a house with my in-laws (and young daughter). We bought the house just over a year ago and myself, my wife and my in-laws are all co-owners. My wife and her parents are Korean and they have a custom of living with parents/extended family.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have been finding that my in-laws have a tendency to make changes to the house or significant purchases, without consulting with me. For example, there was an incident where my father-in-law tried to do some 'repairs' on the brick front steps to the house (which in my opinion made things worse, as he's not a professional stonemason). Then, the other day, without discussing with me, they went and bought half of the furniture in someone's moving-out sale, most of which, in my opinion, is low-quality 'junk' that we don't really need (they have a habit of hoarding all sorts of things, in general).</p>

<p>It's not so much about the money, but the fact that they are doing these things unilaterally, without involving me. I have tried explaining to them that, as a co-owner of the property and given I am bringing home half of the money to support the family, I feel like I should have the right to be included and involved in decisions about the house. However, it seems to keep on happening and they are clearly not getting the message.</p>

<p>So, what can I do to get the message home and convince them that they need to involve me in these decisions?  There is a language barrier involved, as my in-laws don't speak good English - their first-language is Korean. So, most of my communication with them goes through my wife (as I don't speak Korean). I have discussed it with my wife several times and once or twice in 'round-circles' with them, but the impression I get is that they give my concerns lip-service - ""yeah, sure, we understand, whatever .."", but nothing actually changes, or they forget two weeks later. My wife often seems to take their side (so it's 3-on-1) and says its partly because these things need doing and there isn't time to consult me first. However, I don't buy that, as most of these things are not in any way urgent.</p>

<p>I should probably also mention there have been a couple of times where I lost my temper over these sorts of things and either yelled at them or threw something across the room. I know it's not helpful, but it's starting to really get to me - it's simply not acceptable to me to be regularly 'sidelined' in this manner. Normally, we get on fine on a day-to-day basis, but these sorts of incidents happen every 2-3 months and anyone can be pushed too far (right?).</p>

<p>I am considering that perhaps I should make some 'frivolous' purchases of my own (new plasma TV or guitar perhaps?), to give them a taste of their own medicine and send a message that, if they think they can do whatever they want without consulting me, then that can work two ways. Perhaps that would help them to see things from my point-of-view and be more mindful to include me in these decisions in future?</p>

"How to handle dysfunctional behaviour in workplace","<p>In our team of several software developers we have two leaders: me (official title: ""Team Leader"" - recently nominated, technical) and another guy (official tite: ""Scrum Master"" - this is the case for a few months already, non-technical) - let's call him Frank. </p>

<p>Frank and I have totally different visions of how the team should work in areas such as cooperation with customer, procedures, communication within the team, etc. I find Frank's attitude highly destructive for the team (it might be that he feels the same about my actions :-) ). Eg. he overcomplicates the procedures without any justification (I asked for it and got none) and then sends the mail to the whole team claiming that it was agreed (while what happened really was that we were arguing in front of the team). </p>

<p>Similar thing happened when I tried to do some procedures improvement: I consulted client (who was in favour), consulted Frank (who was in favour) and one other developer (who was also in favour). But then Frank changed his mind, blocked my idea and the customer later said to me that he doesn't understand the situation because the proposed change was good.</p>

<p>Now the question is: </p>

<p>How do I handle these situations to get desired result (Frank does not get into my way)? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should I talk to our project manager as kind of superior for the two of us (seems obvious, but I doubt if effective)? </p></li>
<li><p>Or should I ignore his actions in some areas and try to improve situation in other areas? </p></li>
<li><p>Or should I continue building a relationship with customer representative and then mount a common cause against Frank (based on real problem to solve)? </p></li>
<li><p>Or should I take any other approach?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some background about the setup: our team of developers is employed by an outsourcing IT corporation and working for another corporation. Some cultural differences might be involved as customer is from Germany, me from Poland and rest of the team (including Frank, our boss and developers) from Belarus.</p>

"How can I decline an invitation and then go without them?","<p>In 2016 I went to a comic con with a group of online friends, of which a couple of streamers with a decent sized community. F is in this community but nobody really speaks to him outside from what he says in stream chats and from what I know, nobody is really friends with him. He seems like a lonely individual but has very little friends as he often says weird things in chat.</p>

<p>The community was invited to meet up at the comic con and so was he. Me and the group met him there and he was awkward, to say the least. He has a habit of getting someones attention by grabbing someone by the upper arm (so firmly it hurts) and then talking <em>very</em> close to your face. He seems to do so more with girls, but maybe the guys were just quicker to push him off. He makes weird, sometimes racist comments. He commented on girl's boobs and how they were 'too fat' etc. He seems to have little to no understanding of how to behave in a social situation or what (not) to say. One of the girls wasn't feeling well due to low blood sugar and asked me to take her to the bathroom. F joined even though we said he shouldn't and made his way into the <em>womens</em> bathroom and it took us and 2 other ladies yelling at him before he would leave.</p>

<p>Fast forward to now, he somehow got my number from someone (we haven't talked anywhere outside the stream chat for 2 years) and <strong>invited me to join him and (so he said) S and M to a con</strong> at the end of the year. I barely speak S and M but we get along very well when we do. I asked S if she heard about it and she had only casually answered during a public stream that 'she'd think about it'.</p>

<p>He tried to get me to create a group chat in whatsapp, I think because he doesn't have phone numbers of S and M.</p>

<p>S, M and I agreed that it would be cool to go to the con and catch up, but we really have no interest in going with F. We're scared that if we go, he'll find out and meet up with us anyway.</p>

<p><strong>How do we tell him we'd rather go alone, considering he has a difficult character?</strong> Or would, in dealing with someone who seems to have trouble accepting no, ignoring completely be the best solution?</p>

"How to not be ""this annoying nitpicking Quality Engineer""?","<p>I am a 23-year-old woman who was hired 2 weeks ago. </p>

<p>As a Q&amp;A engineer, I have to ask developers to change the way they are coding in order to improve the code's quality, maintainability, and testability. People do not like being asked to change their code, and I am afraid they will resent me for doing so.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How can I make such a request while minimizing the risk of being seen as an annoying and nitpicking person?</p>

<h1>Background about the company</h1>

<ul>
<li>The company didn't have any Q&amp;A before.</li>
<li>The company is about ~30 people with ~15 of them being developers.</li>
<li>The employees are all mostly young (I'm terrible at guessing age but they have small children)</li>
<li>I haven't seen the delivered code yet and will use SonarQube to make sure that the code fulfills the minimum quality criteria. However, I have already had to ask them to add ""id"" for all the button and field HTML elements (I needed it to automatize User Interface test).</li>
</ul>

<h1>What I'm doing now</h1>

<p>I have only had one request for now. I went to one of the developers and turned my request into a question because I have noticed that people seem more accepting when they are asked this way. </p>

<p>So I asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not able to find the id attribute for this element. Is there any?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dev looked for it, said it was missing and that it was a mistake. But they seemed annoyed by the idea of needing to fix it and started explaining to me that I don't really need it.</p>

<p>After that, I kind of panicked and agreed that I will try to do without it <em>for now</em>. However, since then I have had to ask for this twice (because I realized the issue was more important that I first thought it was). The developer looked kind of annoyed at me each time I had gone to ask him.</p>

<h1>Note and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>I could do without the id by using a more fancy selector. However, this <a href=""https://sqa.stackexchange.com/q/37253/36046"">will reduce greatly the maintainability and readability</a> of the tests which I don't want to do.</p></li>

"How can I help my roommates ignore my difficult past?","<p>I have recently moved into an apartment with two other guys because I was going to university outside of my home town. I come from northern germany and moved a good bit further to the south.</p>

<p>I am living here for about almost two months now and I have already made good friends with my roommates and I regularly hang out with one of them and his girlfriend. I really enjoy spending time with them, as they are very casual and upbeat, like to laugh but are still straightforward. They have a lot of traits that I value and would like getting accustomed to.</p>

<p>During the first weeks, when we got to know each other, I was trying very honestly to do my best in this new environment and to change for the better. Because of a difficult family situation, I had been very busy with negative thoughts about myself and my life most of the time before, when I was still living with my parents. When I moved out, I was finally able to leave all that mess behind me. It is a long story and the details don't really matter, it is enough to know that my parents got divorced when I was 2 yo and I lived in two separate families until I was 16. This made my life very complex and I learned very early that there is never one right answer and that family relationships are difficult. I had often sunken in depressive thought when I got older, I spent most time alone, on the computer, or at school.</p>

<p>The point is, that I want to integrate this past positively with my rather light-hearted present. I am living in an apartment with people that I like and that like me, and we could have a great time together. I might grow more confident and assured of myself and may find a girlfriend to travel and live with. There are many possibilities.</p>

<p>During the first weeks at my new home, it was as if my past didn't even matter, and my roommates where happy to be around me and wanted to know me better.</p>

<p>But one evening, when we were talking, my roommate told a story from his childhood and I felt inclined to tell a story from my childhood aswell. But this turned into a chain of bad memories and I basically started telling the ""tragedy of my life"" as a narrative. It didn't really have a point to tell them, except describe myself as a character, but it felt like something I wanted to get off my chest (although I had talked about it with my parents a lot before) aswell. I also thought that I would tell them sooner or later anyways so I didn't hesitate too much.</p>

<p>In the end, I think it was a mistake drop this much weight on the conversation. Because from then on, they started treating me differently. Almost as if they pitied me or as if they were trying not to insult me or make me feel disliked. I feel like that story put a really bad shadow on my character and interacting with me became more challenging and uneasy. Also I myself felt that now I had dragged my past into my new life, which was exactly what I did not want to do. I feel like it was a mistake to tell them about my family issues in my past. Then again, it had been a really important part of my life, and sooner or later I might have told them some things anyways, because it is a large part of how I define myself (maybe that is a problem?).</p>

<p>I would like to show them that they do not have to worry about me and that they should just treat me like a responsible, happy person. Because that is what I am trying to be. But that has gotten way more difficult ever since I told them about my past. What definitely also plays a role is that I have been thinking about my past myself again, since that talk. Before, when they did not know, I didn't even start to think about it because there was no reason to and I was happier that way. I had really rediscovered myself in a new way. </p>

<p>How can I introduce myself to new people without making a hurt/weak/sad impression but still be honest about what my past means to me? I am not someone who likes to hide things from others, I would like my roommates to know that I had difficulties in the past that I am still working on overcoming. But I don't want them to treat me with special care because of it, because that would not really help me with overcoming my personal view of my past, it only adds noise to my environment that I have to cancel out by responding to it one way or the other.</p>

<p>I can't make them forget what I've told them, but I also don't think I can approach them about it, because they are probably not even being overly polite consciously. How can I show them that I am not concerned about my past anymore and they shouldn't be either, without explicitly talking with them about it (because that might make it worse)?</p>

"Stalking - I accuse a colleague to be a free rider. How can I ask him if he does that?","<p>My situation: I am 35 years old, female, from Germany. I work at the university and I have a lot of male colleagues. Two years ago, a friend of mine (no colleague, living appox 500 kilometers away) told me, that he loves me. I told him that I didn't want a relationship and he started stalking me. Over 300 WhatsApp messages per day, several voice messages.... He told be that he wanted to kill me, rape me, kill or cripple my friends. After months I had a nervous breakdown when he sent me pictures from the highway and when he told me he would come to my apartment and kill me. I went to the police and they forced him to turn around. I reported the whole case to the police and after a while the prosecuting attorney dropped the case (reason:he never attacked my physically). I changed my mobile phone number and deleted all social media accounts. Since then, he stopped stalking me. This was May 2016.</p>

<p>In April 2018,I found a letter in my mailbox. No stamps on in, just a single sheet of paper with an old image of me and a TF symbol engraved in my forehead... Including the words 'remember the trigger figure' (TF). I brought the letter directly to the police. A second letter followed two weeks later (at my birthday), this time I also found glass shards under the tires of my car. One week later I found screws under my tires.</p>

<p>Two more isolated TF symbols I my mailbox followed and the police granted me a preliminary injunction. The next letter was really strange. There was a picture on it clearly shot in my home town and the text had some distinct spelling mistakes, which were never made by the original stalker.</p>

<p>Around this time, a colleague told me that he fell in love with me and I rejected him. He works as technician in my department and he is very angry about his life and often reacts really aggressive against me and others.</p>

<p>Two more letters followed... Both including information the original stalker can't know... One was about field work in another country only my colleagues knew about. The second letter arrived today. It contained the family name of my new boyfriend and an image of my with the word 'disgusting' engraved to my forehead. I attended a symposium last weekend where I showed a scientific poster, which I did together with my boyfriend. This is the only time that somebody could have read his family name. We are connected nowhere else and therefore the original stalker can't know his name.</p>

<p>The angry, rejected colleague attended the meeting, too and acted really aggressive against me. He called me arrogant and selfish for presenting a poster and acted really jealous when somebody told him that I will not attend the conference dinner but spend the evening with my boyfriend instead.</p>

<p>I also received several emails from the colleague containing the same spelling mistakes I found in the letters and the letters are printed on the same paper we use in our laser printer. </p>

<p>My question: how can I ask him if he did that? I want to ask him first without informing the police because I don't want the whole workgroup to suffer from my situation. And I want to give him a chance to confess and stop it. How can I start a talk about that? And how can I deal with him in the future? He will stay at the university because he is a permanent employee, same as I am.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated, I am really worried right now. </p>

"How can I help my partner learn to have deeper conversations?","<p><strong>TL/DR: One of my needs in our relationship is going unmet: the need for engaging, thoughtful conversation. I truly believe my partner is capable of this, but hasn't been in an environment where he was encouraged to have more than superficial discussions. How can I help him build his conversational skills and confidence?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> To try to clarify what I mean by thoughtful conversation, I'd be talking about things like ruminating on an interesting movie we watched (how does it reflect current society, are we going that direction, which character was fascinating and why, was the story arc good or what plot armor was there, etc) versus walking out of a movie and having it left at ""I liked that movie."" </p>

<p>I've tried model this with him to some extent with conversations about football, which he is super knowledgeable about where I know only the basics. He'll mention something in response to sports radio and I'll ask something like ""Oh? Which position was that?"" He'll tell me which one, then I'll ask something like, ""What does that position do again?"" He'll go on in some detail until I understand the gist of it and then further engage him with a question like, ""Why is that guy not a good fit for it?""</p>

<p>This is the kind of conversation I'd like to have, but about other topics as well, not <em>just</em> football. And instead of being the one engaging every time like above, eventually I'd like him to be able to engage similarly with me, even about potentially unfamiliar topics. Most of our conversations just feel like typical small talk (""how was your day,"" ""what should we eat today,"" ""want to do anything this weekend,"" etc).</p>

<p>To try to summarize the example, I'd like it if when in a conversation he would:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Provide more than one word answers when I initiate a conversation (responses less like ""ok,"" and more like ""oh, I agree/disagree/don't
know because xyz"")</p></li>
<li><p>Be open to discussing in more detail than generalizations (""I liked that movie, but I would have liked it more if..."" versus ""It was
good."")</p></li>
<li><p>Be willing to listen and engage on less familiar topics (If I mention something like, ""Huh, this article mentions a new technology
for doing xyz,"" answers less like ""Um, ok... That's random"" and more
like ""Oh yeah? What's new about it"" or ""Oh, how would that work?"")</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Extra Background:</strong> This info may not be necessary to basic advice, but may also have details that could help. Feel free to skip it.</p>

<p>I've been dating my fiance, who I love and who I know loves me deeply, for about a year and a half. We've been living together for half of that time now. We got engaged the week before I graduated from grad school with my MA this past May. It wasn't out of the blue, as we had mentioned getting married before, so of course I said yes. In the past couple of weeks, my feeling of closeness to him has declined noticeably.</p>

<p>In general, I'm the kind of person whose mind is constantly churning through things, but who has to make an extra effort to identify my feelings, so I spent a couple of weeks in a confused state of low morale before I could identify why I was feeling so badly and figure out the cause. I didn't feel like I could truly connect with my fiance emotionally. We had a discussion about this (that went much better than I had dreaded) and together came up with some actions items for each of us that we thought could help, including me being better about expressing my needs unambiguously and pointing out behaviors that cause the disconnect when they happen instead of letting it build up.</p>

<p>He also shared what he called his greatest fear: that I would realize I was too smart for him and leave. I reassured him immediately and emphatically that this wasn't the case, that I loved <em>him</em>, and that he is also an intelligent person and possess more intelligence than I do in a number of cases (emotional intelligence comes immediately to mind).</p>

<p>I understand, though, where this fear comes from. He was a college drop out; I just obtained my MA. His family do not have any higher education; mine almost all do. Through our mutual hobby, we're surrounded by bright people who are almost exclusively male. I love getting into the weeds on a variety of topics with them, and there are several that I can hold really good conversations with easily. In thinking through my fiance's fear, I also realized that since I graduated my master's program, I have been turning more to these friends for that kind of engaging conversation, probably because I'm not getting it through classmates and professors any longer.</p>

<p>This realization caused a bit of a personal panic in me because I was faced with the question ""Is this kind of conversation a need of mine in a romantic relationship?"" I'm afraid that if I'm honest with myself, the answer is probably yes. It's nice to get this need met from friends and colleagues, but I'm extremely worried that if I don't get at least a little bit of it from my husband-to-be that I will drift away from him. I can see how the lack of this kind of conversation went unnoticed until now with almost all of my intellectual energies focused on graduating and breaking into my career, but I'm kind of kicking myself for not realizing it sooner because of how deep into the relationship my fiance and I now are.</p>

<p>All this backstory leads to the question: can I help him develop the kind of skills that would help him fulfill this need of mine? How specifically would I go about helping build those skills? He was a straight-A high school student who was bored by school. He's a capable problem solver (I see this in action all the time). I just think he's never really gotten his sea legs regarding his own intellect or expressing his ideas. He's also told me he thinks his communication skills could improve. Additionally, I would bet that he probably feels intimidated by me (and some of our mutual friends) since having more substantive conversations is my default setting.</p>

<p><strong>Research:</strong> I did some searching and found <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/14124/19058"">this answer</a> that seems somewhat related, but not quite the same. In that user's instance, it was always the same few topics, but for me it's more of a depth question than a topic question.</p>

"What non-verbal communication can I use to ask if someone want physical comfort?","<p>Sometimes, someone will talk to you about a very emotional and/or difficult topic. In this scenario, you are supposed to give comfort to the person with whom you are talking. </p>

<p>As someone on the autism spectrum, I always find those kinds of situations very hard to deal with as I don't know what to do. Most of the time, I will simply just ""freeze"" and be unable to do anything. </p>

<p>If the other person is crying a lot, then I know that offering a hug would be appropriate. So, I just open my arm to suggest a hug and wait to know if the other person wants it or not.</p>

<p>But, if the other person isn't really crying, offering a hug feels like I would be ""overreacting"", especially if the other person doesn't really like to be touched. So, I would like to offer some comforting tap on the shoulder/arm instead.</p>

<p>If I could just ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you want me to tap your shoulder/arm in a comforting way? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things would be simpler. However, I'm pretty sure asking something like that would be absolutely weird. </p>

<p>So, is there some non-verbal ways that I could ask this question? </p>

<p>I don't want to touch someone that doesn't want to be touched.</p>

"Roommate demanding security deposit before leaving the room","<p>I signed the lease for a small 2 bedroom apartment. I have had four roommates in the span of three years. The three previous roommates left because they moved out of town. The current roommate started in January. Our relationship had generally gone alright. He is clean and respectful in terms of noise. However, he is pretty quiet. We have had lengthy conversations in the past while having dinner and we have even gone out for dinner twice (although always my suggestion).</p>

<p>In the last months, situation has gone worse. He started wearing headphones while in the living room. I once tried to strike up a conversation with him by asking ""How was your day?"" to which he took the headphones off, answered briefly and put them back on. I reproached him that it was rude to put them back on if I was talking to him. He said that he didn't know the conversation was not over. I responded saying that it wasn't. Then he asked, ""is it over now?"" to which I affirmed. I did not want to bother him further. </p>

<p>The following day I asked him if everything was alright with his life. He had mentioned in the past that he was a bit burned out of work. He lives a bit far from home (7 hour drive) and does not see his family much. I know also he's the only child and his parents live in different continents (probably he was raised my his mom only). For the record, I am from Europe, while he is American. To my question, he responded that he doesn't want to talk to anybody after work and that he sees the roommate relationship as a business, where it doesn't have to go further than cleaning and mutual respect for each other. Then he asked me if that was ok with me, to which I said that honestly I would prefer to live with somebody that did not see this coexistence as a business.</p>

<p>Despite this, I never asked him to leave. My lease was up in November and I let him know that I was planning to stay until March and that he was welcome to stay longer. Mainly because looking for a new roommate for only four months was going to be difficult. I admit I would have preferred to live with somebody else, but it was more convenient for me to wait until March and live with him.</p>

<p>Our relationship deteriorated after our conversation about living together as a business. I tried to strike up a conversation with him a couple of times, but did not go far and he did not reciprocate by showing interest about me. Then, at the beginning of November, he let me know he might be leaving by the end of December. I told him that was ok. The next day though, I asked him that he needed to make a decision quickly, because if he leaves in December, it is going to be hard for me to find a roommate given the holidays. I told him that he would have to leave by December 8th (30 days after) if he left. After this, he said he was going to leave for sure and he got upset and angry that he needed more days. I told him that I was running the risk of not finding a roommate to move in right before Christmas. This situation happened to me last year, and because I went home for Christmas during two weeks, I could not find a new roommate until mid January. I ended up paying a month of rent by myself. I explained that to him and I think he understood, but it did not change his angry mood.</p>

<p>Yesterday, he told me he was moving out on December 1st and that he needed the security deposit before then to pay his new room. I told him that is not how it works and that he needs to leave the room before I give him back the deposit. He got mad and raised his voice saying that he needs the money and that I need to tell him what problems his room might have so he can hash them out before he leaves. I said I understood that and I would let him know. I asked him again if everything was alright given that he seemed very angry. I asked him if something in my behavior had not been alright and it is the source of his anger towards me. He responded: ""We're not having this conversation. I will leave on Saturday and we will be all good""</p>

<p>Honestly, I am a bit scared because I have never had this angry behavior against me (I have shared houses or apartments with more than 15 different people throughout the years). He mentioned once that he would be interested in buying a gun so he could go to the shooting range. I don't know if he did.</p>

<p>Because he needs the money, I am planning to check the room if it needs work, give him 60% of the deposit and the remaining 40% once he leaves, to make sure the room is clean.</p>

<p><strong>How can I convey to him that this is a reasonable decision?</strong></p>

<p>Some more data. He is in his late 20s and I am in my early 30s. We shared costs for common things such as toiler paper and paper towels. In fact, whenever something is lacking, I just buy it and don't let him know how much it is. I expected him to do something similar and he has. At the beginning, he asked me once how much it had been the TP. I said he didn't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>My name is the only one on the lease. He never signed anything and I have no connection with the landlord.</p>

"Asking guys to quit shouting in a bar","<p>I've been making a more conscious effort to work on my social skills lately. Particularly soft skills dealings with random people in public places. My shrink recommended that I do the obvious thing, ""Go out in public, and do something that you enjoy doing, while making an honest effort to interact with other people.""</p>

<p>I figured that adjusting <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1480/when-playing-darts-how-can-i-separate-real-players-from-random-drunks"">the way I play darts</a> would meet the requirements, so that's what I've been doing once or twice a week.</p>

<p>Last night I ran into a familiar irritation. Rowdy, drunk, guys. They were playing pool, beating their chests, and shouting back and forth about their shots, sexual prowess/orientation and how that somehow related to their ability to play pool. Whole lotta:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What!?! What now!?! Did you see that shot!?! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by a long back and forth about who was gay and who was the <em>bigger man...</em> While literally beating their chests. </p>

<p>The first couple of times, I laughed, but as things progressed they gradually got louder and more obnoxious about it. Eventually it got to the point where I couldn't get in the groove and play darts. It was just too loud and too distracting.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there's an effective strategy for getting guys like these to settle down in a situation where they're at full volume and escalating their weird alpha male competition.</p>

<p>The old me would have went straight to open hostility and potential violence, but I'm trying real hard not to be that person anymore. Jail is unpleasant and filled with these sorts of situations.</p>

<p>I ended up dealing with it, by not dealing with it. I just played darts distracted and poorly till an older couple schooled them on the pool table (beat them in a game, gaining control of the table). </p>

<p>Is there a way to get guys in this sort of situation to chill out, without being aggressively confrontational?</p>

"How do I get my friends to understand that I won't be social ALL the time and tolerate their scoff when I say 'I'm studying'","<p>For a few months, I've been going out to wherever they've called. Spent money on food outside, had drinks with these folks. I have my exams coming up. Every time I get a text saying 'Hey, what's up!

It drives me NUTS when I imagine them roll their eyes to my response of 'I need to study'. </p>

<p>It's almost like this cult that absolutely wants to party 24 X 7 and NEVER get serious.

"How to respond to a stranger's compliments on my themed t-shirt when I am unfamiliar with the theme?","<p>The compliments I receive about my choice of clothes are from my relatives and close friends, which I can just say ""thanks!"" without sounding disinterested or off-putting as they know me well and expressing my gratitude with a ""thanks!"" would suffice.</p>

<p>However, today was dress-down day at the office I'm currently interning at and I wore a Star Wars polo tee that I received as a gift a year ago. I was making my coffee at the pantry and an intern who I've not met before was washing her mug when she said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, I like your shirt!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If my tee was about a topic that I could strike up a conversation about, it wouldn't be a problem. However, I have never watched any Star Wars episodes before so I couldn't talk about Star Wars and I didn't want to say ""thanks, you look great yourself!"" as it would seem like an empty compliment to her, a stranger. So I just tried to answer her in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh hey, I'm not really a Star Wars fan. My aunt bought this for me as a gift. But thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then smiled to her and walked off. I don't know if statements like these would offend someone, but that was how the interaction went.</p>

"How do I deal with accents and my audio processing issues without annoying people?","<p>I'm fairly certain that I have audio processing disorder - basically, I can hear sounds just fine, but I seriously struggle with comprehending what I hear, as I will often misunderstand words or have pauses when my language processing seems to ""lag"" (I might say ""sorry, I didn't catch that?"" and then right after the words are out of my mouth my brain catches up and I understand what they originally said).  In particular, I have trouble distinguishing ""foreground"" sounds from background sounds and speaking with people who have accents different than mine (even mild ones) and that speak in lower tones (sometimes I can understand one person who has an accent but not another that has the same accent).  I have trouble mapping the sounds that I hear to the words and when speaking with someone with an accent I try to listen very intently but often have to ask them to repeat just about every other sentence.  It's even worse when background noises and accents are combined.</p>

<p>When speaking with someone who has an accent, I feel like I have to ask for repetitions enough that it's rude, and <strong>I feel embarrassed at how much I struggle</strong>.  I also just moved from the West coast (US) to the East coast, and I will be starting my first job out of college, so I want to leave a good impression.  I am a native English speaker, and I have no problems understanding written English.</p>

<p>I normally handle it by trying to sound apologetic and saying something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, I'm having trouble hearing you"" or ""I'm sorry, I have difficulties understanding accents"" and asking them to repeat or speak slower or louder, but that can be very tedious with longer interactions, and I can see how much it can be exhausting for someone to interact with.  I will also need to have verbal communication at work with people from different backgrounds than mine, and during my last internship there was a manager visiting from India who tried to ask me for directions and spent several minutes trying to explain to me what they were looking for until another coworker intervened and helped them out right away.</p>

"How to not be a part of self centered conversations?","<p>In the past, I have been a part of self-centered conversations, especially in the offices. These would be among a group of people, where there is one person who is very much self-centered and would tactfully concentrate all the conversations towards themselves. Others do not perceive any sense of narcissism. But, it is clearly a case of one. It is this tactic that always works and people fall for such sweet manipulation. And this is done to divert attention from anyone else and always keep the conversation around them. </p>

<p>But, not many realize that the person is manipulating others and is a trap to keep them under their control. </p>

<p>I was part of such group, but, when I realized that everyone else is getting manipulated, I couldn't resist myself. I engaged in conversations that were no more around the person. But, that made me the bitter one to the main person and a series of conflicts raised. </p>

<p>I, later understood that these kind of persons should be left alone. But, I am sure I would encounter such persons in the future too and I have no idea how to deal with them. While keeping mum all the time would be a conflict within myself; that they would think that I got manipulated too. I do not want to give them that impression. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong> 
I realized that manipulations are a common thing both at workplace and in personal life. All I did was to redirect conversations away from them but that brought a lot of animosity between us. So, I do not want to be the bad buy and at the same time, I want the manipulator to know that I am not falling for that.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>how do I redirect conversations to not focus on self-centered people, without upsetting those people? And if I can't redirect that way, how can I make clear that I'm aware of what self-centered conversation monoplizers are doing?</strong></p>

<p>Adding a conversations scenario. </p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong></p>

<p>Purpose : Conversation Hijack</p>

<p>Context : Workplace lunch</p>

<p>The entire group is discussing about how well one of the team members, Tom, has done in the recent past, praising Tom for it and gathering more information about it. Out of the blue, one of the team members says something like 'I have faced a similar situation too;  I have done XYZ and so and so.  blah blah blah'. With a joke in such hijacked conversations, the entire group bursts into laughter and no one would ever think of coming back to Tom. Cracking jokes is one of the easiest ways to divert the conversation. And the frequency of the hijacking could be less or more depending on that person. </p>

<p><strong>Praising one is just one of the contexts.</strong> It could be anything else like showing fake concern towards a team member and then diverting the topic to themselves and their own set of problems or success scenarios.</p>

"How do I cope with a girlfriend who got feelings for another person but is not in love with?","<p>I've been with my current girlfriend for more than a year now and very happy with her. To me, she feels like 'the one' and every time I see her or am with her, I feel on top of the world. A few months ago, she confessed to me that she started to like another guy from her study, but is not in love with. I didn't really knew how to react to this but I said I appreciated the fact that she shared me with this pointing out that I appreciated that she was honest to me, but that I cannot handle the fact that she is seeing this guy on a daily basis (because of her study). </p>

<p>A few things you should know about this situation and what followed:</p>

<ul>
<li>This guy knows my girlfriend is in a relationship but he apparently does not care: he once send a shirtless picture to my girlfriend (at the moment I was sitting next to her) and this resulted in a big fight between me and my girlfriend. He also told her that he wants to fight for her, but luckily my girlfriend told me that there is no reason to fight for her because she wants to be with me;</li>
<li>What followed is that I forced her to stop having contact with this dude, because I could not handle her being in contact with him. I could notice she didn't agree with this but she talked to him and said that they should stop talking to each other. This all did result in me getting distrustful in my girlfriend and said to her that it needs a lot of time for me to get over this and to gain my full trust for her back. After a while, she told me that the fact that I forced her not to talk to him anymore, resulted in her 'getting pushed towards him' by me because I forbid her something (this was really hard for me because I don't want to be this kind of boyfriend, but at the time forcing her to stop having contact was the only possible solution I could think of, hoping she would lose interest in him); </li>
<li>From time to time, when I am by myself, I get caught in this mindset where I get totally insane just by thinking about another guy trying to mess with the relationship between me and my girlfriend (i.e. getting really aggressive 
and wanting to punch this dude in the face / getting real sad). This affects my mood significantly and sometimes results in me and my girlfriend getting back in a fight where I point out that I cannot handle it. She then tells me I should not worry, that she is loves me very much and that I am perfect for her.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guy and my girlfriend will not see each other anymore after the coming week. There will be a summer break coming, she will do an internship somewhere else in the coming year so that is the thing that keeps my hopes high. </p>

<p>A lot of you guys will say that I should break up, which I can't. This would affect me in such a way that I cannot handle. She is in almost every way perfect for me. For example: I have a mentally disabled sister and she is the first woman in my life who is truly putting effort in trying to communicate with her / doing this with her, which is very important for me.</p>

<p>I know that they sometimes share communication, mainly about the projects they are working on. But still, I find this very hard because somewhere I am afraid he is still flirting with her.</p>

<p>To point out, I am not a weak person or afraid to say what I think except for one thing: I am afraid that when I keep asking her to stop communicating with this guy, I will push her in 'his arms'.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>How do I tell my girlfriend how I feel about all this without pushing her further away and make sure my girlfriend won't stay in touch with this guy? Am I handling this wrong ?</p>

<p>I'm looking for different perspectives so I can find a way to handle the situation (which I currently clearly can not).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>So, to let you guys know what happened a few weeks later:</p>

<p><strong><em>She admitted she cheated on me several times after I accidentally saw some way too erotic messages on her phone send by him to her (and by cheating I really mean cheating i.e. having sex)</em></strong></p>

<p>I broke up with her immediately, even though she really wanted me back, cried for hours, called me multiple times (even in the middle of the night). This has again been a big lesson for me: trust is the fundemental of a relationship, and when you can't trust each other, you better leave before you get feelings wrecked as she did with mine. It has been hard to get over it, and still every night I lay in my bed with lots of aggression and sadness. </p>

<p>So, if someone is in the same situation as I was, keep my story in mind. </p>

"How can I ensure people know 'What happens on the pitch stays on the pitch""","<p>Preface: I am an incredibly passionate and competitive soccer player. I absolutely despise losing and I love a good physical and mental battle when playing on the pitch.</p>

<p>Recently, a new friend of mine started up a 5-a-side soccer session in which a group of his friends (that I had never met) would meet up and play a game for an hour twice a week. He invited me to come along as they were short one evening about a month ago and it has been a brilliant, enjoyable few weeks playing with them. (I am the youngest player at 21, and ages range up to 40 years old)</p>

<p>When he asked me to play initially, I mentioned to him</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I take playing soccer very seriously and change into a different person playing, nothing I say while playing should be taken to heart and if you're okay with that I'd love to play </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I am generally easy-going although stubborn in day-to-day life, when playing football I have an innate need to win. Because of this, when playing on a with or against someone that doesn't seem to be interested I will vocally (and probably borderline aggressively) tell them to come on and put some effort in while playing.</p>

<p>Generally this is taken quite well as just me being passionate while playing, however when a new person (approx 34/35) joined the last session and I shouted to put some effort in he seemed to be quite stunned and taken aback that I had confronted him on it.</p>

<p>After each session we usually have a few drinks and chat about games etc that are on and I have made some great friends because of this, but this new guy flat out refused to speak to me after the game because he </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>didn't want to be friends with a younger person who thinks he can boss people older than him around</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried to explain that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had no intention of bossing him around and I'm sorry he thought that </p>
</blockquote>

<p>but he did not listen and has ignored me since.</p>

<p>I am not worried about making up with this person as I only see him for an hour or two at soccer a week.</p>

<p>The general consensus of the group is for a serious game but with lighthearted fun in between. Is there a way of changing a persons understanding of what I say in an interpersonal way? The rest of the group understood what I was going to be like before I played as my friend told them what I said. Is the best way to just outright say it to a new member or is there an easier/more conventional way?</p>

<p>My question is <strong>How can I ensure the people I am playing with know that what I say on the pitch is not a personal attack but rather a passionate remark with no lasting intention?</strong></p>

<p>Edit:
Okay, a lot of people seem to think that I am being abusive to the people I am playing with. The regular crew of people that play are 100% serious and want to play to the best of their ability and it is absolutely perfect for me and we all get along great. The problem came when a new person showed up and took my 'passionate encouragement' to heart. I understand i can come across very strong (especially when losing) and I am not justifying that it's okay to give out to people. I just want to say that what I said to him was more along the lines of ""Come on man you can play so much better than this, put some work in"" rather than a personal insult to the man. I'm not asking for a solution to insulting someone with no consequences while on the pitch.</p>

<p>My solution:
Thank you all so much for your answers. I guess all I need was a ton of strangers on SE to tell me that it is in fact my behaviour that needs changing and not pushing the blame to the opinion of the others I play with. I will now be making a conscious decision when playing to tone myself down and play nicer. Thank you all :D</p>

"How to ask a girl for a relationship","<p>I'm dating a girl with the goal of finding a girlfriend. She told me before that it's weird for her to kind of be in a relationship but not properly. I thought she meant that the beginning phase of a relationship is weird to her but yesterday she hinted to be pretty heavily that she expects an explicit start of our relationship, meaning that I have to ask her for it.</p>

<p>I thought this kind of thing always happens implicitly. Apparently, I was wrong.</p>

<p>Some context: We're pretty young (She's 18; I'm 23.) and are German.</p>

<p>My question is: How do I ask her for a relationship? I'm not asking about how to find out whether she wants to be my girlfriend; I already know that she does. I'm asking about how to put it in words. Is the sentence ""Willst du mit mir gehen?"" still something people say?</p>

"Whether to Initiate Contact With Barista","<p>I frequent a particular coffee shop 3-4 times a week, and am pretty familiar with the baristas, as I see them often. I've noticed one of them, C, is flirty and playful with me, and seems genuinely happy to see me when I come in. I'm interested in getting to know her better, but so far our interactions have been limited to brief conversations over the register. I've tried to occasionally steer conversation away from work, but she's busy and on the clock, and I don't want to be the asshole holding up the line. Knowing that what little relationship we have so far is business/customer related, </p>

<p>1) Is asking her out at work likely to be unwelcome/irritating/too aggressive? </p>

<p>2) If it is, are there alternative ways to initiate contact that are less abrasive? E.g., would seeking her out on social media be appropriate, or just weird and creepy?</p>

"When should I make eye contact with someone I intend to walk past?","<p>I am an adult male living in the US, in case it matters. </p>

<p>Anyway, there's something I do when walking past people on a (not too busy) sidewalk or in a hallway, where I will make eye contact with them, smile and nod, and then look away. Often, they will do the same. It seems to me like the purpose of this exchange is to reassure the other person that you are friendly and aware enough of your surroundings to not run into them.</p>

<p>I like to perform this exchange whenever the situation occurs. The problem I sometimes run into is not knowing when to try to make eye contact. The way I see it, I can either :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>not try to make eye contact at all (which would be rude)</p></li>
<li><p>stare them down until they look at me (which would be creepy/intimidating), or </p></li>
<li><p>glance at them a couple times and nod if I see them looking back (which is what I do currently). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I'm wondering is if there's a proper way to handle this. I feel like what I do doesn't work as often as it should, and would like to complete this exchange whenever the other person attempts it (so I don't cause them to run into the same problem). </p>

<p>So, am I doing this right? And/or is there anything I could do to increase the chances of success? </p>

<p>I noticed <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/564/when-is-it-appropriate-to-look-into-peoples-eyes-while-walking-on-street"">this question about whether this exchange should happen at all</a>, in this case I'm confident that it should and would like to maximize the chance of success and minimize the chance of discomfort. </p>

"How can I convey to someone that the way she communicates is awkward without upsetting her?","<h2>Context</h2>

<p>During family conversations my sister, who is 27, often interrupts the flow of a conversation with in order to mention something that is marginally related to the topic at hand. Most of the time this falls flat; as what she's talking about isn't particularly interesting, related or something the group she's talking with understands. I'd say she is a ""nerdy"" type and will often bring up various forms of media that the family isn't familiar with.</p>

<h3>Fictitious Example</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Family A</strong>: Did you see that ludicrous display last night?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Family B</strong>: What was Wenger thinking sending Walcott on that early?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Family A</strong>: The thing about Arsenal is, they alw-</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sister</strong>: Did you guys watch the latest episode of <em>Arbitrary Niche Nerd Media</em>? It was really cute when <em>Character A</em> kissed <em>Character B</em>!</p>
  
  <p><strong>Family A</strong>: I really don't know what that is?</p>
  
  <p><strong>(awkward pause in conversation)</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Family B</strong>: (topic change) Oh man, did you guys hear about Stacy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know this is a rather contrived ""example"" of how she acts, but I'm really trying to emphasize her poor timing and how these situations play out. Even if I try to play off of what she says, it almost always ends in an awkward pause and someone bringing up a new topic. I'd also like to state that in this scenario, my sister is well aware of the ludicrous display last night, so it isn't a lack of understanding of the topic.</p>

<h2>My Problem</h2>

<p>Personally I find this really frustrating as it often derails a good conversation. It's apparent to me that my family appears to feel the same way based on their body language/facial expressions. I don't want her to stop participating in conversation, but I want to bring it to her attention that the way she's communicating is generally not being received well.</p>

<p>I personally am familiar with the things she talks about often. She talks about games and shows that I've watched or know something about. The issue is a combination of the timing of her interjections and her (seemingly) not understanding her audience. It really isn't a matter of getting to know her better, but a matter of letting her know that mentioning X concept from Y media where my family doesn't know anything about X or Y is a distracting conversation topic especially when it's provided with very little context.</p>

<h2>The Interpersonal Problem</h2>

<p>My sister is rather sensitive (she doesn't have diagnosed mental health issue) and telling her outright would most likely make her just not want to talk or socialize at all. It's not my intention to upset her, or exclude her from wanting to participate. So how can I tell her that the way she interrupts/detracts conversations has been typically hurting the conversations she's be involved in a way that doesn't hurt her since she doesn't seem to be aware of the way she disrupts the flow of conversation. This is a request for techniques on softening the blow of a revelation that may not be well received.</p>

"Invitation for dinner refused with a strange reason","<p>I have got a new colleague to work together on a very long project. We have worked for a month now, things look good so far. She is a very reserved person, but I am not a big extrovert myself, so this fact didn't bother me. Still I have thought that as we are going to work together for a long time, and the project requires quite a lot of communication, it would be good to get to know each other better. </p>

<p>So I spoke to my partner and today, when we both were leaving the building at the end of the day, I have told her that my partner and I want to invite her and her partner for a dinner on Saturday. She was startled, then she was silent for a couple of minutes, then she started to say something like ""We don't usually go for dinners"" and I was prepared to hear about allergy, or halal or kashrut, whatever, then suddenly she blurted out: ""We are very particular about our meals, we are foodies"".</p>

<p>I was so astonished that I said something very stupid about my cooking being not good enough for her, she said ""Sorry"" and went out of the building. Now, it is a weekend, but I have to meet her again on Monday. What should I do? I still feel very uncomfortable about this situation. I do not want our work relationship to be influenced by that, but I feel that it would. Should I say sorry? My partner thinks so, but I do not really know what for should I feel sorry.</p>

<p>To answer possible questions. If she would say something about allergy, or another engagement, or even not being in the mood to go out this weekend, I won't see it as a great deal, I would say ""What a pity, another time then"", would probably repeat an invitation in a month or so and let it go after the second refusal.</p>

"How can I set expectations with roommates/housemates a year into the arrangement, and make sure we hold each other to it?","<p>As a small bit of background, I have lived with my boyfriend for about three years now. A year ago, my younger brother (20 at the time, 21 now) moved in with us after hitting a rough patch on his own. This was agreed to by the boyfriend, so that hasn't been much of a problem, aside from having two 20 something men in the house ""competing"" for the ""alpha"" spot. The only real issue was space, as the apartment was very small.</p>

<p>So, in May, I bought my first house and we all three moved into it. A couple weeks later, we took in a second cat that a friend needed to find a home for. A week after the second cat, my brother and I adopted a brother and sister set of puppies.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. I (25, only female in the house) work an 8-5, Monday-Friday job a 30 minute drive from the house. My boyfriend (22) works 4pm-12am on normal weekdays for a large company, but it's their busy season so he's generally working a lot of overtime. His job is also 30 minutes from the house. At the same time, he is enrolled in an online college to get a different degree. My brother is about to return from a class to start his new job as a semi driver, meaning he will be home only a few days every two or three weeks.</p>

<p>While we have had money and bills sorted out since moving to the house, chores have fallen by the wayside. Thankfully, we have at least kept up with house training messes with the puppies, and we are keeping food cleaned up. But this still leaves a lot of clutter and is making this very nice house look like crap.</p>

<p>The problem comes in three facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My boyfriend sleeps a ton, especially during this busy part of the year. When he wakes up, he has enough time to take care of the dogs, make sure the cats are fed and their boxes are clean, eat something, and do homework. After that, he has to get cleaned up and head to work.</p></li>
<li><p>Before he went for his intro class, my brother worked overnights at a gas station down the street. On top of this, he didn't eat well. This, at least in my (uneducated) opinion led to him sleeping a lot and generally not wanting to do anything but go to work. He didn't even want to help with the dogs, though the girl is his and they absolutely adore each other. (It's been very, very heartbreaking to watch her look for him the couple of weeks he's been gone.)</p></li>
<li><p>I have medical issues I am working through that I believe have led to my incredible lack of energy when I get home. Despite this lack of energy, I have tried my darnedest to make sure the puppies are going outside as regularly as they should be, make sure they have water and their last meal of the day, and work on training them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You may be able to see how we've not gotten much done in the way of chores.</p>

<p>I want to work to correct this, and my brother and I have even discussed a few points with this, mainly with yard work. I want to have a conversation with both men to work out a plan <em>and</em> how we can hold ourselves to it.</p>

<p>What I want to do is basically create a chore list and hold us all to it. However, there are some chores some of us can't do, and there are chores that suck (ever smelled a cat box that needs changed?) and the same person shouldn't always get stuck with them.</p>

<p>The problem with the chore list is that it's never worked. The boys never do their part, and I never do mine. We need to work out how to get this under control, and soon, so that the mess doesn't begin to affect our health, the health of our beloved animals (I would pretty well die if I caused something bad to happen to any of them.), and visits from my mother, who has threatened to stop visiting if the house looks the same on her next visit.</p>

<p>How can I convince the boys of how important this is and get them to work with me to both make this list as fairly as possible and actually hold each other to it without letting the chores go undone? (My boyfriend and I have tried a ""If you don't do your chore on your day, you have to do it the next day!"" and it backfired miserably... For what I'm sure are obvious reasons...)</p>

"How can I recognise that I am teasing someone too much without verbal feedback from that person?","<p>In my situation, I am dating someone who is the typical class-clown type and enjoys being funny and making jokes. Sometimes our coworkers (we met at work) tease him and I'll join in. Most of the time it is all in good fun. But I noticed recently that it feels like I'm ragging on him all the time for things that aren't always good-natured teasing. He has expressed that sometimes I make fun of him when he isn't in the mood, or bring up unrelated things in the joke that makes it no longer funny.</p>

<p>There are a lot of resources online for how to respond to bullying and teasing. However, I don't see resources for people who would like to learn to stop teasing their friends and family. </p>

<p>We have already discussed it(it being the problem: me teasing him is not always nice) between us. He told me that he felt upset over a particular joke. I felt bad that I had hurt his feelings and asked him what I can do to not hurt his feelings again. He described other times when he wasn't in the mood for joking and I realized that while I could tell he wasn't 100% having fun, I didn't pick up that I was directly affecting him at the time. This was how I realized that I don't know how to prevent it going forward. I don't know how to tell when I am being hurtful because he admitted he is the type to bottle it up for awhile before telling me. He also told me that 90% of the time, joking and teasing doesn't bother him.</p>

<p>When I say I feel like I'm ragging on him all the time, I mean that half an hour after a conversation or exchange, I'll feel a little bad about the things I've said or brought up, but I'm not sure if it affected him and am belatedly realizing they might have been mean.</p>

<p>In reflecting on past experiences where I was notified after the fact, I observe the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The person being teased argued the premise of what they were being teased about (ie: ""The reasons behind -- are --"")</p></li>
<li><p>The person being teased seemed frustrated about the other activity the group was engaged in (hiking etc) </p></li>
<li><p>The person teasing was more engaged with other people doing the teasing than the person being teased</p></li>
</ul>

<p>From these notes I gather that if the person being teased isn't laughing along and is redirecting the conversation in any way, that should be a Big Red Flag. Other indications of Big Red Flags would be very helpful to me.</p>

<p><strong>How can I recognize that I am teasing someone too much without verbal feedback from that person?</strong> <br> <strong>In a conversation with 2 or more people where teasing is normal, what non-verbal cues can I look out for that the teasing in that moment is unwelcome?</strong> </p>

<p><sub>If you have experience being teased where you were hurt or uncomfortable or know how someone felt during such an episode, I believe answers to the following questions could be beneficial in a well-rounded answer: What kinds of ways have you shown that you were uncomfortable? What things did you do to try to suppress your uncomfortable feelings that may have let the other party know you were uncomfortable (if they were unaware)?</sub></p>

"How to deal with a good friend and a girlfriend that do not get on","<h1>Situation</h1>

<p>I've been with my girlfriend for about 5 years now. We get on well and I'd like to stay with her. A year ago my girlfriend and a good friend of mine (also female, we'll call her Jane) had a big falling out. My girlfriend will not talk to Jane and wants nothing to do with her and is upset that I maintain contact, albeit in a very diminished form when compared to before, with my friend.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm in a really tough position because although ultimately my girlfriend is more important to me, my friend was always good to me and we got on very well. I can't engage in hobbies/activities that I previously did with her such as camping, movie nights, whatever else. Please keep in mind that all my interactions with Jane have been with her boyfriend present, so it was never inappropriate. Their relationship was fine up until the falling out and sometimes my girlfriend was also present during these activities.</p>

<p>I can't get my girlfriend to forgive Jane and I'm unwilling to engage in activities that involve Jane because it will upset her. Yet I feel like I've wronged Jane because she's been there for me and helped me out on numerous occasions and now I'm pushing her out of my life to appease my girlfriend.</p>

<p>What is the correct action here? Ideally they could reconcile, but Jane is unwilling to apologize and thinks she's done nothing wrong and my girlfriend wants absolutely nothing to do with her.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>About a year ago I was at a party and did not have my drivers license. I have it now, but back then I didn't. It was in a small village and the only transport options available in this village (for those not driving) were bus/taxi. It was a Friday night and my colleague was hosting the party so he brought me there after work. The party ended everyone fell asleep drunk. I was pretty drunk too and wanted to go home. The problem was that it was now very late and there were no buses driving anymore. So I wrote to my girlfriend via whatsapp and asked if she'd be willing to make the hour long drive to come and pick me up.</p>

<p>My girlfriend isn't the most confident driver and she wasn't willing to get me in the middle of the night from a village she's never been to. I was annoyed by this because I would have done it for her without hesitation if our roles were reversed, but I understand her fears etc so I let it go. So I sleep there on an air mattress my friend Jane kindly provided for me.</p>

<p>I wake up the next day and everyone's leaving. Buses still aren't available (perhaps due to a public holiday? I wasn't sure then and still not now) so I contacted my girlfriend again and asked if she'd be willing to get me now that it's day and because the buses weren't available.</p>

<p>She still wasn't willing. What ended up happening was that Jane brought me home and was very angry with my girlfriend for not getting me. She wrote a series of scathing messages to her on whatsapp, like <em>really</em> scathing. I was surprised by the hostility in it and thought it was frankly a bit too harsh. Among more valid criticisms, it touched on how she thought my girlfriend was childish, selfish, etc and how she was lucky to have me as a boyfriend and how she didn't deserve me.</p>

<p>Jane and my girlfriend are worlds apart in terms of personality. Jane is fiery and brutally honest. She speaks her mind and talks without a filter, whereas my girlfriend is not like that at all. Minus the personal attacks, some of what Jane said about my girlfriend was true. But the overall tone was just too much.</p>

<h2>Other Info</h2>

<p>It may be prudent to provide more info so that Jane's anger is more understandable. Jane's not a bad person in my opinion. It wasn't just one time my girlfriend didn't want to collect me. Other times included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every day after work, I'd walk about 2km from the train station to our house. This was in every season, also when snowing/raining. Normally I did not mind and did not ask, but in adverse weather it would have been nice to get picked up. During such adverse weather conditions, she would only collect me after argument. Sometimes I'd return home drenched if the wind was too much for my umbrella.</li>
<li>A few times the trains went on strike so I was literally stranded. She would always say to hitchhike home, upon which I would insist she collect me. She did, but only after argument and she'd be angry about it afterwards (distance of 20km).</li>
<li>While getting my drivers license, there were times I had to take a bus trip of an hour or longer to get home because she was unwilling to drive for 15 minutes to get me.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that I have my own license and can get around myself, these frustrations have ceased. Her unwillingness to drive has not. She's uncomfortable driving any long distance and will ask me to drive in most situations, especially if the distance is large.</p>

"How do I properly apologize to a good friend and let them know that I did not actually want them to move to another city?","<p>I have a very good friend, let's call him Rick, who I have been acquainted with for the past 5 years. Our relationship was strong enough that he often told me that he was my best friend, and I often reciprocated as well. That being said, there is an ""in joke"" among my friend group where we tell Rick to ""get lost"". For example, if we're just hanging out and chatting, and Rick says something, one of my friends will sometimes respond ""Rick, why don't you just get lost?"" and then everyone else echoes this in turn and we all have a good laugh. Rick seems to enjoy this joke as well and takes it all in good fun with a smile and is not bothered by it. Or so I thought.</p>

<p>Last year at a birthday party thrown by my friends, I blew out my candles and someone chimed in asking what I wished for. While I know that making a birthday wish is just silly superstition, I decided to play along and maybe make a joke of my own. With a big smile on my face, I proudly exclaimed ""I wished that Rick would get lost!"" The joke went over well, as everyone had a good laugh (including Rick), but a few months later Rick moved to another city roughly an hour and a half away to live with his girlfriend.</p>

<p>At first I thought that this may be just a temporary arrangement and that Rick might move back after a few months (with or without his girlfriend). However, that is seeming increasingly unlikely as he has now purchased a house there. Normally I would not make a connection between me telling a friend about a birthday wish that they would get lost, and them actually ""getting lost"", so to speak, but now others from my friend group have started saying that Rick moved away because I told him to get lost. </p>

<p>Now I have begun thinking that maybe me telling Rick to get lost did contribute in some small way to him moving to another city. I of course never meant it when I told him I wished he would get lost, and I highly value our mutual friendship. I want to make amends and let him know that I was just joking when I said I wished for him to get lost, and if possible ask him to move back, as I rarely see him in person anymore (most of our interaction now consists of online group chat and occasionally playing video games online together). How do I go about making such an apology and let him know that he is welcome to come back whenever he is ready?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: I told my friend to get lost, and a few months later he moved to another city. Some other friends are blaming the fact that he moved away on me and I feel like I may have contributed in some way. I would like to apologize to him and somehow make amends, and let him know that he is welcome back at any time.</strong></p>

<p>I understand why my superior is crossed but I don't know what else I could have done to make Bob more willing to help me. I would like to explain that to my superior and ask for his help but I don't know how to do so. I don't want to be seen as the problem, as someone incapable, etc...</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How do I explain the situation (and ask for help) to my superior without making him see me in a negative light?</p>

<h1>Notes and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Everyone else here is very helpful and happy to answer my questions/help me when I need to. </p></li>
<li><p>Bob might be sexist but didn't talk with him enough to know for sure (maybe he is just like that with everyone)</p></li>
<li><p>This happened Friday but I only saw my superior message today</p></li>
<li><p>My superior was only present remotely Friday and is also remote today (Monday)</p></li>
<li><p>In the group chat, Bob was answering me (mostly asking me questions) but did not suggest any solutions. However, is lack of interest was more visible in person.</p></li>
<li><p>Bob didn't follow up with me. I asked another coworker of his this morning (when he wasn't here yet) and, it turns out the problem was pretty basic and easy to solve (I just needed to make an 'install' before launching my command). I posted that my problem was solved in the group chat after that.</p></li>

"How do I avoid meeting an acquaintance that comes to visit every few months?","<p>An acquaintance visits my city for 1-2 weeks every few months because her boyfriend lives here and wants all of three of us to meet up together.

"Help a coworker or friend reconsider their work/private life balance","<h2>Context</h2>

<p>I work in IT services companies and I've seen several colleagues and/or friends of mine that are in power positions (project leader, tech expert...) take on too many responsibilities, with the consequence of severely impacting their private life because they work a lot of extra hours (unpaid&amp;untraced) so their projects don't fail. </p>

<p>Overtime work reduces the time to spend with their families at home if they have one, and/or the time to spend on hobbies, and it also comes with a great deal of additional stress.
Recently, one of them got sudden 2-weeks leave because they were so close to burnout even the company realized it would be worse to let the situation go further. Another has shown complete relapse in an habit they had previously spent a lot of effort for years, even though they had been so iron-willed about it before.</p>

<p>According to me, they are risking their physical and mental health in a situation where it is not needed - the IT sector is thriving at the time, and the salary is enough. The way I see it, they are used to taking on responsibilities but have trouble recognizing or setting up a limit to the workload they take on.
They are in positions where they feel that they alone are responsible of the success of a project, but in my opinion, it's also the company's responsibility to allow enough 'resources' (aka, people) for projects to be completed. The company (or at least the involved levels of management) are aware that the workload is too much to be done in the theoretical work hours, but as the work is finished in overtime, there's no problem and thus no need to add more resources.</p>

<p>(The companies I'm talking about are not small companies that would fail if a project fail. One of them is 40 000 people and the projects are 5 to 25 people - not a game changer.)</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I'm both worried for my friends and pissed at the companies for taking advantage of responsible people. But we're not that close of friends ; I might miss crucial context elements ; I suspect it's not my place to do anything about that, and anyway, any change in the situation will have to come from the involved people and not from an outsider.</p>

<p>But <strong>in the assumption</strong> that they might be in a situation from which they could and should get out, <strong>are there ways in which I could discuss the subject with them to help them acknowledge (or progress toward the acknowledgment) that there's an issue that's not going to disappear and need to be addressed?</strong></p>

<p>For example, right now, I'm thinking about asking them if they could give me an estimate of their real work hours for the past weeks, or asking them 'what would be the limit where you would put your foot down?' in the hope to make them consider the current situation in regard to this limit...</p>

<p>PS: not putting this in Workplace SE because either I haven't ever worked in the same company as my friend, or I'm not working <em>anymore</em> in the same company. I'll ask there if it's best, though.</p>

<h3>Udate answering comments</h3>

<p>Regarding company culture about overtime, speaking of the one I used to work in:  </p>

<ul>
<li>It's considered as normal to work some extra-hours, for developpers as well as project leaders, though for the last, it's often in the form of working at home to work on files (so a bit harder for me to estimate their actual overtime).</li>
<li>It's unofficially frowned upon to put in extra-hours without your boss authorization, and if you ask for that, they'll tell you that you were not ordered to do overtime so you shouldn't have done so. This would probably go against your reputation in the company and impact your chance of augmentation or promotion.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I don't like that overtime is the normal, what I'm worried about here is more extra-hours than usual, even for people in their position. For at least one of them, it's evenings and weekends, in a way that does not seem sustainable or healthy to me.</p>

"What is the right way to refer to someone with dark brown skin who is not African American?","<p>I had a conversation recently where someone was deathly afraid of referring to a person by their skin color. It went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coworker: One of the people on the other team came by and said he wanted talk with you.</p>
  
  <p>Me: What was his name?</p>
  
  <p>Coworker: I don't remember. He was kind of tall and had short hair.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Not sure who it was. What else?</p>
  
  <p>Coworker: He was at Mary's retirement party and gave a speech.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Still not sure.</p>
  
  <p>Coworker: <em>[leans in and whispers]</em> He's black.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The coworker clearly thought it was inappropriate to refer to the person as ""black"", but felt it necessary to say because no other descriptors were working. They couldn't have referred to this person as ""African American"", since they just moved from the Caribbean (the person forgot what country they were from, but knew it wasn't Africa). </p>

<p>What would be the proper way to refer to a person with dark brown skin who is not African American?</p>

<p>This is in the United States. If regional differences matter, this is the Midwest (Ohio), and I'd like to know if it is different in different parts of the country.</p>

"How do I uninvite a friend from building a PC because I decided to invite others?","<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>

<p>I have recently acquired parts for my PC build and will soon be building it. I had been building my anticipation with my friends but also with my siblings. Now a friend said he wants to build it with me and I have invited him to come over on the day.</p>

<p>Recently however, my elder brother also said he wants in and despite no issues being here, why should I exclude my little sister then? But that is a <strong>cultural thing that I cannot include her and my friend together</strong>. </p>

<p>The friend, being a gamer I felt, <em>'deserves' to be present</em> as he'd appreciate the inclusion. My siblings, on the other hand, are not gamers or power users by a long shot. But they certainly are very interested in building it with me. They might not know the software and hardware or anything such but were <em>very impressed</em> by the beauty and aesthetics of the components I acquired.  </p>

<p>My dilemma here was that I am in post-op recovery so I will not be able to handle the heavy items and the friend has assured he can do it. But when my brother has said the same, I decided that I would build the PC with my siblings, because I will be more comfortable with a family member having the liability over anyone else. This means that I now face the problem that I have to pull back the offer I made to my friend.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>How do I uninvite my friend from building the PC together, without creating an awkward situation between us? </p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong><br>
I want to let him down softly, making him understand why I changed my mind.<br>
Our friendship is important to me and I don't want this decision to have a negative affect on our friendship.  </p>

"How do I maintain eye contact with someone as a listener if it makes my body physically uncomfortable?","<p>Here is an example: I'm talking to one of my professors, making eye contact and being engaged like a good student does, but all of a sudden I feel like I lose depth perception (I find that this happens only during one-on-one talks and if there is a wall several feet behind them) and my neck becomes tense. I'm not sure what's going on, and I feel like I absolutely have to look away because I feel physical discomfort and I think that I must look weird. However, I know it appears that I'm anxious and not paying attention, and I end up having my eyes dart around.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what's going on with the depth perception issue, but it's happened for a while, so I don't think it's going away anytime soon. Is it appropriate to look away when listening to someone you want to make a good impression with? If so, how often can I do it?</p>

He told me that if I wanted to be good at math, I needed to fix my attitude.</p>

"How do I tell my friends that I want to be included in activities beyond our gaming sessions without alienating them?","<p>I'm approaching a social situation now where I'm straddling the line of authority figure and friend, and while I think I have a plan set to address this, I'd like some input from others, get some advice. </p>

<p>A group of six of my friends and I meet weekly to play Dungeons and Dragons. I am the ""dungeon master"", who is in charge of preparing and narrating the world, as well as preparing the various situations/puzzles/etc for the players to solve. This takes a significant portion of my limited free time each week to prepare.</p>

<p>My issue comes from the fact that these friends are part of a larger extended circle of friends all from the same high school and college circles. My closer friends are these six that I typically play with, however I have had extended interaction with several other members of the outer circle as well. Every week, this extended social circle is often planning events (going out to bars, barbecues, etc.) in a large WhatsApp group chat rather than individually.</p>

<p>During our game sessions, this group frequently discusses plans made over this group chat, parties and outings and such with Friend X or Friend Y that are group events or open to further attendees (""Oh, I think Friend Z is coming too."", etc.) The past few months have made me aware of a pattern of behavior within this group that has been occurring. Our group chat specifically for the DnD group flares up before sessions to organize, we have our session, and then the chat goes quiet again for another week.</p>

<p>The issue, and the source of my feelings, is that I am not invited to any of these functions, nor do any of them speak to me much outside of our weekly games. I have asked a few times to join the larger chat in socially subtle ways (""Hey, that sounds like fun, can I come? Would you add me?"") to an affirmative reply and a promise to add, only for them not to after a series of similarly subtle cues to remind them (""I haven't received the invitation, by the way."" etc.) The reply to this is usually an affirmative, but to this day I have not been included. The culmination of this behavior was an invitation to a birthday party via Facebook, which I only realized I had missed by one of these friends calling me the day before the scheduled event asking where I was, as the party had been moved to that day. This discussion was had over the group WhatsApp yet again.</p>

<p>I have about three to four hours of free time each day after work, gym, and chores have been completed. One to two of these each day, weekends included, are spent preparing for this group game every week. I don't charge for my time or services, and only want their camaraderie in return. I believe the core of why I feel hurt by this is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of these friends have known me since middle school (We are
currently 24+)</li>
<li>I have made repeat attempts to attend or be ingratiated to social
functions, only to be left out or my own invitations not responded
to/ignored.</li>
<li>This group otherwise acts friendly and casual when around me, despite
this behavior.</li>
<li>I don't believe I should have to work harder to be engaged in their
friendship than they do with me, as that is rather exhausting to me.</li>
<li>My ""best friend"" is also in this circle.</li>
</ul>

<p>My plan is to have our scheduled session on this upcoming Saturday, then before we end for the evening, bring up how I feel directly with them. I'm not entirely sure if this is the best way to go about this. Thoughts?</p>

"How to get confrontational brother to respect my life choices","<p><em>EDIT: As I have seen some close votes for too broad. Please communicate the issue with the question so that I can edit it.
Because I believed the question to be ""not too broad"" as my question is clear:</em> <strong>How to communicate to my brother to respect my life choices?</strong></p>

<p>I have a brother that is 7 years older than me. We normally get along very well, spend once or twice a week time with each other because we live in the same town for a couple of month now.</p>

<p>Now my problem is that he is VERY straightforward pushing and confrontational. He is a very very sporty person and wants to push everyone in the same direction, because ""it's healthy"". Which is true, but you have to respect personal choices and sometimes he does not get that. Especially with me.</p>

<p>For example: We go bouldering* regularly (he goes more often and thats his main sport) and expects me to go regularly with him as well. And mostly I do that because i like it and its fun. But sometimes i just want a lazy evening, or simply not go, and I'm almost afraid to tell him straight up ""I just dont want to!"" because I know that he will a) be angry at me because he is a person that gets angry fast and b) he will try to convince me and try to make me feel guilty for not ""doing the healthy thing which is good for me!"".</p>

<p>Or sometimes when he writes me via facebook, and I simply don't want to answer for different reasons, or sometimes can't because I dont see it, he gets angry with me for not replying as if I was entitled to answer him everytime he writes me and at best instantly! As example: he wrote me yesterday to which I did not answer and today morning comes a text why I dont answer him even if I got nothing to do the whole day (not so much to do at work currently). To which I answered that I dont look at facebook during work and he could contact me via whatsapp because I have whatsappweb open at my worklaptop. To which he just answered why I didn't reply to him yesterday in an angry manner. And sometimes he messages me over and over again at different medium which is VERY annoying because I just want to be in quiet sometimes (no introvert or anxiety but just enjoying calm sometimes).</p>

<p><strong>How can I communicate to my brother that he has to respect MY life choices to do sports or do a lazy evening?</strong> And that he has to respect it or deal with it that I sometimes don't have the time/energy or motivation to answer his messages. Other than that we have a good family relationship, we get along well, and do other stuff as well like going out sometimes. But as he is a very convincing and dominant character, he can be very rough and pushy and I would like to be able to communicate that to him that he has to respect others personal choices. Especially with me, as he still sees me as his little brother that can't handle himself, but I am 22 now and very well capable of handling myself.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Because someone said I should just say that to him. The reason this needs some IPS is because he wont really listen to critique on hist person. He is very resistant in his regard and always only sees his side. And pushing back bluntly is not an option because it's not about standing up to some bully but to make this clear to him without burning bridges as he is my brother and we have a very thight family and we see each other often.</p>

"How can I get Americans to speak more slowly after I've already asked them once?","<p>I'm from East Asia so my English is not good compared to people from Western countries who use English or its Indo-European siblings as its native language. In most cases, it is fine to talk with fellow Asians (East Asian and Southeast Asian), and although I often don't understand what some Europeans say, the problem arises more from their accents than their speech speed, though their speech speed feels somewhat fast as well.</p>

<p>However, I don't understand what Americans are saying mostly. For example, if I watch CNN I only understand about 30%, largely due to their speech speed (but also I don't often understand their accents).</p>

<p>Now, the problem is that even after I ask an American to speak more slowly, they seemingly can't change their speed. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>American</strong>: <em>gdajlgjagllmalvmlagjagmalvmalmldmamglanvammeao</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>I</strong>: <em>Sorry, can you speak more slowly?</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>American</strong>: <em>OK, do you understand now?</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>I</strong>: <em>Yeah!</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>American</strong>: <em>OK, then lgamlvmdljalmalvmadmvlavmeovmqmmvladljaljlajvdljal</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then I asked them again to speak more slowly, and it usually ends up in a few loops, and then I get upset and stop to talking with them. </p>

<p>The conversation is almost always initiated by the American. I rarely start the conversation as I know I don't understand what they talk about mostly, and honestly, I don't like to talk with Americans if they can't change the speed. This is not because I feel embarrassed but because it is quite stressful to keep concentrating on what they are saying and be forced to use a huge mental resource.</p>

<p>It seems that just asking them to speak more slowly is not a solution. How can I make Americans speak slowly? This happens in non-Anglo countries where English is not one of its official languages. Is it that difficult to speak more slowly? I don't know if this applies to Canadians or Australians as I have never talked with them.</p>

I met this person, S at a church I was attending at the time (I changed churches for different reasons). We became friends, because we had a few common interests, and I wanted to help S learn sign language (S wanted to become an interpreter, which is great. No problem with that.) </p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> When we would try to get together, S would leave some vague comment or message to me, and I would be the one to mostly initiate the questions that were vital to scheduling a lunch time together. We have had a few lunches together, and they were enjoyable. </p>

<p>A recent situation that disappointed me is that S went away to a workshop, and we both expected to meet on Sunday for lunch, after her expected return on Saturday. S just now (Tuesday afternoon, 2 days later) messaged me that the workshop went longer than expected, and she wants to reschedule. </p>

<p>S did not communicate <strong>AT ALL</strong> that she would be missing the lunch date, either before or on the day. Not really appreciated. If S simply forgot and was busy, I understand that, but this is not the first time S has forgotten to communicate with me. </p>

<p>If I was in S's shoes, and I was missing a lunch date with someone, I would let that person know after I realized that I could not make it. </p>

<p>I have rescheduled many, many lunch dates (at least 6) with S in the past, and I am trying to figure out if this friendship is worth it. </p>

<p>I am asking how to communicate to S that if S makes a date with me, she either needs to stick with it or let me know that it won't work out in a reasonable time <strong>before</strong> the lunchtime. I do not mind if we reschedule it if needed, but I need to know at least a couple hours before, because when I make a plan, I stick with it. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I have expressed disappointment at missing another lunchtime with her, and have jokingly said something along the lines of ""You better not miss the next one! Third time's the charm?!"", and I am a pretty forgiving person in general. </p>

<p>Because of our busy schedules, we are not able to interact much. I work 9 to 5, and her schedule is varied. </p>

<p>She has expressed desire to have a lunch date with me multiple times. </p>

<p>Extra note:
She is leaving to an out of state college by the end of August, and if this friendship is going to be salvaged, it would have to be within the next month or so. </p>

<p><strong>Question: How do I communicate to S that her actions are not appreciated, without shutting down friendship?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Second Update:</strong> I have scheduled a lunch date with her two weeks from this Sunday. We shall see what happens. I have very low expectations at this point. </p>

<p><strong>Third Update</strong> S canceled that lunch, postponed it. Supposed to have dinner tonight, and she informed me that she can't make it due to a friend being induced to give birth today and that friend needs her. I understand, but this is going pretty far. </p>

I've been having a 90% hatch rate with my own eggs this year but I have been looking into collecting data on the hatch rates of my customers, especially those that have received shipped eggs (this is because shipping typically reduces the hatch rate of eggs).

"How Do You Stop Overthinking About A Romantic Interest?","<p>I've been speaking to this girl at my university for a little over 2 months now. It's very easy to see that she's shy and introverted, but she is a really sweet and interesting person.
Over the course of these two months, I've caught myself overthinking, not just about how she responds through text, but about how she may be hiding her true feelings and thoughts and so on.</p>

<p>What I want to ask is, how do I stop overthinking and worrying? More specifically, how do I stop overthinking and worrying about what she may/may not be thinking or feeling towards me?</p>

<p>The problem is that, like I said before, she isn't great at conversing. She's pretty quiet and I have to initiate a conversation most of the time in person, and always through text, to get her talking. And even then it isn't always a lot.</p>

<p>While she does speak more often in person, I still find it hard to not worry about everything. I think this can be traced back to when a girl back in high school played with me for 3 years and now overthinking is like a deep-rooted issue that I have to deal with. But it's gotten to a point where I just want it to stop.</p>

<p>I enjoy every minute I spend with her, even if we don't say a word. I don't find the silences awkward, and she said she no longer does either. We also have been getting pretty physical over the last 3 or 4 weeks, sometimes ending up in a play-fight or cuddling.</p>

<p>But yeah. Even as I'm typing this, for the past 2 hours I've been trying to keep myself occupied with different things to prevent myself from falling into a depression just because I kept thinking that she doesn't find me as a romantic interest and doesn't plan on making it easy to understand until it's too late.</p>

"How do I tell my close-ones that I don't appreciate it when they say I look like a bird?","<p>While I ultimately believe that my family and friends love me and would never do anything to intentionally hurt me, there is a certain culture among my immediate and extended family members and my friend group of lighthearted teasing that I feel sometimes goes too far. </p>

<p>It started a little over a year ago; I came home one day after getting a haircut and ran into my older sister. Upon seeing me with my new haircut she exclaimed ""My God, ****, you look like a bird!"" and started laughing. This took me aback because it didn't make any sense. I get my hair cut regularly every two months at the same time and I always get it cut in the same style. I go to the same barber shop and make sure that it's the same barber every time to ensure that there are no variations in how my hair is cut. As far as I can tell, my hair looked exactly the same as the other thousand times it had been cut and I honestly do not know why this time my sister decided that I looked like a bird. I spent a lot of time looking in the mirror and to this day I have never been able to see it. I have asked several acquaintances for a second opinion on whether I look like a bird but the results were inconclusive (a little more on that later).</p>

<p>Anyway, while this incident shook me I chalked it up to my sister being goofy and didn't think too much about it after that. However at supper that night my father made a similar comment to me about looking like a bird, and him and my sister starting giggling uncontrollably. I was not amused to hear this observation for a second time, but I decided to let it go and focused on eating my so they would see that I was <strong>not</strong> encouraging further joking at my expense.</p>

<p>The next day I left my parents' house to go back to my apartment about an hour away. I thought this would be the end of this ridiculous joke that I look like a bird, but my sister told my cousin about it. As I was roommates with my cousin at the time, he also began making periodic comments insinuating that I was a bird and it really started to get on my nerves. This became an ongoing joke that would come up very often when speaking to my sister or my father, and they would often text me unprovoked to say something. One such incident that I remember is that when bird hunting season started my father texted me and told me to watch out for bird hunters. Another time when I told him about an incident of a bird defecating on me on the way to the store, instead of showing any sympathy he laughed and said ""Birds sh*tting on a bird? Never heard of that before!""</p>

<p>Outside of my family, the joke caught on with my circle of friends as well. It started with me mentioning something about it to two close friends and asking them for reassurance that I did not look like a bird. However, instead of saying that I did not look like a bird, they laughed and started making similar jokes and this quickly spread to my larger friend group such that all of them know about the bird joke at this point and often go out of their way to bring it up to the amusement of everyone except me.</p>

<p>The situation has escalated to the point where I am seriously annoyed when anyone makes a joke about me looking like a bird. I am starting to fear that I will never hear the end of it from either my family or my friends and will have to listen to these bird jokes for the rest of my life. Last Christmas my sister got me a bag of bird seed for one of my presents and while I smiled and pretended to find it funny, my hands were shaking with anger and I did all I could to hide that fact. I am generally a very fun-loving person and I don't mind a good joke here and there, but it's been going on for over a year now and honestly I am sick and tired of people saying that I am a bird, or that I look like a bird. </p>

<p>I am somewhat quiet, so a lot of the time I let things go that I probably shouldn't. This also means that if I outright asked my friends or family to stop making these kinds of jokes about me they would be very surprised and I'm afraid it may cause some kind of confrontation. I have considered talking to each person involved individually and asking them to stop, but the sheer work involved has dissuaded me from this approach. However, the situation as it is cannot continue.</p>

<p><strong>How can I convey to all of my friends and family who are participating in this joke that I am hurt by their teasing and would like it to stop - without talking to each of them individually?</strong></p>

"How to deal with rude interruptions in a seminar?","<p>The following situation has occurred several times with B (the same person, in the audience), A (a speaker, different from time to time), and C (the audience, mostly the same).</p>

<ul>
<li>A is presenting some topic at a seminar</li>
<li>A presents some background material X</li>
<li>B interrupts, says something like ""how many in C already know about X?"" (suggesting that A should skip it).</li>
<li>C, who is generally quite annoyed with B, answer in some half-hearted way, usually letting A go on with the background material</li>
</ul>

<p>I find the behavior of B rude (I can explain in more detail if this is disputed). If it is rude, then what is a good way to call it out? I will soon be A, and would like to deal with this in a light-hearted way but still sending a clear message.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks for the many comments, and sorry if I did not make the question clear enough from the outset. It turns out there are actually three questions:
1. Is B's behavior rude and underhanded?
2. If someone is rude and underhanded in this way during a presentation, should one call it out?
3. How to call out improper behavior / make it stop (in this particular case)? Given that the obvious methods (raised eyebrows, few answers from C, et.c.) have all failed.</p>

<p>baldPrussian gives good suggestions in his answer, but I don't think they work in my particular situation. The polling is seldom actually carried out, and I think little is lost in thinking of the polling requests as slinging insults or statements-of-superiority-of-B at the A. Of course the simplest thing is just to ignore B, but that feels wrong (in the same way lying feels wrong).</p>

"How do I ask someone to be my roommate?","<p>I am going to complete my freshman year of college this spring and I have run into a small problem. My roommate (let's call him ""Jim"") seems to not like the college and in all probability is going to leave at the end of the year. Even if Jim doesn't leave the college, he has given me ample signals that he will change rooms and live with another of our friends (who is, by the way, a very old friend of Jim). I don't have a problem with that and respect his decision very much. </p>

<p>However, that has landed me in a sticky situation. All this means that I will not have a roommate at the end of the year. I obviously need one. I don't have a particular preference as to who my roommate should be but if I can convince one of my friends to be one, it would be great. My question is, <strong>""How do I ask someone to be my roommate without sounding very dominating?""</strong> </p>

<p>To not make this too broad, I have already talked with Jim's friend's roommate and I am not sure I prefer him being my roommate for a year. So, I am looking for someone else. The costs and other things are not an issue since we live in halls of residence and all things are paid for before the beginning of the year. My main issue is that if I approach someone (say ""Bob"") to be my roommate, <strong>how do I talk to him about it?</strong> I am a bit afraid that Bob's current roommate might take offence to that and we could get our relations strained and I don't want that happening.</p>

"Dismissing a stranger asking for help without being dismissive of their possible situation?","<p>For some background into the layout of where this situation takes place, my apartment complex has it's own dog park. Within a few hundred feet of the dog park is a large and spacious public park, surrounded by tall prairie grass.</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>Recently during my nightly visit to the dog park, a young girl (17-19 in appearance) approached me from behind. Our conversation went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Girl: ""Excuse me, miss? Do you live here?""</p>
  
  <p>Me: ""Yes?""</p>
  
  <p>Girl: ""Can I stay with you for a minute?""</p>
  
  <p>Me: ""Yes...? What's up?""</p>
  
  <p>Girl: ""Some guy just chased me through the field (the open park area), and I don't know where to go.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once she was inside the dog park, I tried getting more details out of her to understand what had happened and if she was still in danger. While I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt (as I know I would've been terrified in the moment if I was her), the details of her story never quite became clear. </p>

<p>Here are the details she shared with me:</p>

<ul>
<li>She had been walking from an apartment across the field.</li>
<li>The man followed her in a car, and when she began running, he sped up to keep pace with her.</li>
<li>She dropped some of her belongings in the field and needed to retrieve them.</li>
<li>Her phone was dead, it was becoming dark outside, and she was afraid to walk back for fear he would show up again.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concerns</h2>

<p>My initial thought was to offer to <strong>walk her through the field to get her belongings and then back to her apartment with myself and my dog</strong>, thinking we would have safety in numbers (her, myself, and my large dog).</p>

<p>However, as she explained more of her story, I became more skeptical. To shed some light for readers, here were my concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The dog park has a clear view of the field which she said she had been running through (which I am always facing),  yet I didn't see any of this take place.</p></li>
<li><p>There aren't any roads through the park so I'm very uncertain of how he was chasing her in a car through the field.</p></li>
<li><p>She approached me from the opposite direction of her apartment <em>and</em> the field.</p></li>
<li><p>She seemed pretty calm, and she didn't seem out of breath, which I would expect from running so far in colder weather.</p></li>
<li><p>As I asked her to repeat the story to help clarify, details were inconsistent.</p></li>
<li><p>My area has had increasing numbers of sex trafficking activity (very elaborate plots that lure people into being kidnapped/attacked).</p></li>
<li><p>It's become a 'trend' here to have a female claim they need help to lure victims into a trap where they are robbed/attacked by a number of men.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What I tried</h2>

<p>I allowed her to use my phone to call someone to come get her. I heard someone answer the phone, but when she explained that she needed a ride because a man had been chasing her, the person on the other end hung up on her.</p>

<p>I offered to call police, but she assured me that there was nothing they could do because she didn't have any description of the man or details of his car beyond the color.</p>

<p>I ended up telling her that I had company coming within 10 minutes and that I couldn't come with her, but that if she wanted to walk home, she should do it while it was still light outside so I would have a clear line of sight on her as she walked through the field. I assured her that I would pay close attention and that she could come back if she saw the car, or that I would get help otherwise.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>Is there a better way to approach/handle skepticism of a stranger's pleas for help without risking my own safety or coming off as dismissive of theirs?</strong> </p>

<p>I feel that I couldn't have told her I didn't fully believe her because if she was telling the truth, that'd make me out to be a terrible person. However, if she wasn't telling the truth, that exposes that she had malicious intentions and I can't think of a way that ends well.</p>

"Should I let my wife's little brother win at chess?","<p>My wife has a half-brother who's 14. He and his family live in another state, and we see them about one weekend a year. He also enjoys chess.</p>

<p>Now, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I'm pretty good at chess. At the very least, against the average 14 year-old (which he is), I can control who wins and by how much. I've played him once before (last year) and kept it ""close"" the whole game, and ""barely snuck by"" at the end to beat him.</p>

<p>I'm seeing him again in about two weeks, and he's made it clear he wants a rematch. Now, of course there's a chance he's gotten great at chess in that year and he whoops me, and honestly, I'd love that. It'd be cool seeing him improve so much, and I like playing people better than me. There's a much bigger chance, though, that I choose how close our game is again. </p>

<p>This brings me to the title question: should I let him win? If we play multiple games, should I win all of them? </p>

<p>On the one hand, I'd <strong><em>HATE</em></strong> if someone let me win on purpose. On the other hand, he's 14. I'm 24 and started playing 16 years ago. Of course I'd probably win. It seems kinda mean to beat him every single time we play. </p>

<p>(NOTE: If I chose to win, I'd keep it close again. I'd miss some obvious moves that would end the game; if I made a move that put him at risk, I'd ask him to stop and think about what I might be planning; if he made a blunder (like he missed his queen was threatened), I'd probably point it out and ask if he was sure. If there's a better way to win ""nicely"", please feel free to let me know).</p>

The refusing friend contends that he is unable to travel to my side of town. The refusing friend is not impaired though he does have a somewhat demanding job (no over time challenging deadlines white collar work).</p>

<p>I feel that this is unfair. Why should I always drive the extra distance? I'm not unwilling to drive 30 miles 6 or 8 times a week, but I expect some level of parity -- the 7th or 9th time it would be nice if he came out.</p>

"How to reply politely to someone asking too many vague questions?","<p>I have a roommate who asks a lot of questions. Most of them are on topics that are more a matter of opinion, such as religion and politics. He is from Colombia and lots of things are new to him, but I also think it may just be his personality.</p>

<p>Some questions I don't want to answer because I don't know the answer. Some questions are very subjective. It's starting to stress me out. Here are some examples of what he asks</p>

<ul>
<li>in this country are teachers paid well?</li>
<li>how long does the coffee stay hot for?</li>
<li>do Protestants take their religion more seriously than Catholics?</li>
<li>when was the last time there was a strike? what was it about?</li>
<li>is $10 considered a lot to spend on lunch food?</li>
<li>is it common for people to leave a light on at night?</li>
<li>do most people have a dentist they have used for a long time?</li>
<li>do you pay tuition to go to school here?</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one stands out for me because he is a full time student and I know he's actively involved in the campus life (part of clubs) so I find it hard to believe he doesn't already know the answer. This is why I wonder if he's just trying to socialize (which I would like though we need to find a topic of common interest). </p>

<p>What I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>saying ""I don't know""</li>
<li>explaining it's a matter of opinion</li>
<li>saying there's too much variability over the country to make a general statement</li>
</ul>

"How to explain that I rather do something else than go to a social event?","<p>I hate all forms of social gatherings (Parties, Weddings/Receptions, etc). </p>

"How do I constructively address my co-worker's accusation that I don't see her as a ""real person?""","<p><sub>Although I have added the India tag for cultural context, I consider this to be a question on a universal theme, and therefore welcome responses from members all over the world.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>Since mid-September I have been volunteering one day a week at a social work non-profit (typically called NGO here in India) that provides non-clinical counselling services for the general public. I am not involved in the interpersonal aspects of their activities and do not interact with the people utilising these services. I am a qualified sociologist and I have been helping the social workers to technically prepare some upcoming research projects.</p>

<p>One of my co-workers there (code name Alice) is a full-time social work counsellor. We are not doing the same type of work but we do interact a bit in the office. She recently called me on the phone in the morning of my volunteering day and said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need to take my mother-in-law for a medical checkup so I will be an hour late getting to work. Would you give the counselling for the first few clients?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I have no qualification or training in counselling and said that I couldn't possibly counsel the clients. She did come late and the clients were kept waiting. Later she accused me of not seeing her as a ""real person.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could easily have given the clients that counselling... I am so rarely in need of your help and my mother-in-law had to see this doctor. We will all have such unavoidable situations. I don't think you even see me as a real person with real problems!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was quite surprised and asked her what she meant. She said that I was politely formal and aloof with her and never seemed to recognize her personal identity; I was not particularly warm in interaction nor interested in her family matters; nor even considerate of her occasional need for help such as when she had to take a family member to the doctor. Also, my behavior suggested that I had a one-dimensional and uninvolved view of women in general, she said. Note that she is a trained counsellor and has considerably more insight into such matters than the average person.</p>

<p>First of all this question is <strong>not</strong> about the clash of ideas regarding whether I as an unqualified person should or should not counsel the clients. And Alice is essentially right that I do not exactly see her as what she calls  a ""real person"", which is the interpersonal focus of this question.</p>

<p>A bit of background might be useful in context. The social and cultural atmosphere in the part of South India where we live does not encourage 'friendship' between men and women, and conservative society still views it with some disapproval and suspicion. I am unmarried and have tended to be very formal, reserved and very proper in interacting with women who are not my family members, and especially keep my distance from married women. </p>

<p>That is part of the cultural expectations here, which can also tend to create one-dimensional and remote mental attitudes to women, unless a man has a genuine passion for cultivating friendships with female colleagues/ acquaintances, even at risk of facing a bit of social and personal backlash. (The same applies to women who would like to form friendships with men.) I don't want to be close friends with women in general. I am also very introverted and get quickly tired by interacting with other people. And I am certainly not interested in the details of their family matters.</p>

<p>What complicates the Alice situation a bit is that I find her physically attractive but I don't feel like expressing that in my behavior, and she is off limits because of being married. I am not particularly  interested romantically in Alice but I didn't want to be ""just friends"" with her and certainly didn't want to meet  her husband or talk about him. I also never imagined that any of that was relevant to the part-time work I am doing there. So I have taken no interest in her personality or family matters, and that contributes to her perception that I don't see her as a real person. However, the expression of her feedback is something I am willing to take seriously, especially after participating intensively for the past few months and learning a lot  here on Interpersonal.StackExchange.</p>

<p>I was also saddened and affected significantly by reading about the very recent death of an adult movie star, the <a href=""https://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/august-ames-depressed-death-tragic-last-texts/"" rel=""noreferrer"">news article</a> regarding whose tragic end was e-mailed to me by a sociologist friend with his own observation that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the world fails to see so many women as their unique selves. We men look at women and often cannot see beyond the physical exterior. It is very sad that the only way for at least <em>some</em> women to express themselves, stand out from the crowd and be taken seriously as  real individual people is by that ultimate act of self-destruction. That is why this shocking incident is relevant sociologically to us and also an eye-opener to everyone that more exposure to social media does not guarantee better (inter)personal insight in the digital age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I feel that I might try to to address Alice's valid criticism here.  <strong>My goal</strong> is to be more amenable to seeing her as a multi-dimensional individual. That doesn't come naturally to me and that is why I need the help of the interpersonally talented members of IPS.SE: how can I eventually convince her that I was positively influenced by what she said, and am now trying to 'see her as a real person'?</p>

"How to helpfully react to a male coworker's sexual comment about a woman","<p>I'm a 29 year old male. Sometimes find myself in a situation with a male coworker who I've just met, or a male stranger who I'm talking with (at a bus stop, for example), and they make a comment about a woman that I find to be in bad taste. </p>

<p>For example: ""Have you met the new secretary? She has an amazing body doesn't she?"" </p>

<p>Or a stranger in public: ""Check out that girl ... I'd like to get some of that!"" </p>

<p>My goal is to simultaneously communicate these two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I feel that their comment is demeaning and objectifying of women</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not trying to put them down, and I don't think I'm morally 'above' them. I don't think less of them as a person and I haven't become less interested in having discussion/friendship with them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong>
I'm not suggesting that it's disrespectful for a man to simply find a woman attractive. What I find demeaning and objectifying is when a man verbalizes his sexual attraction to a woman's body as a topic of casual conversation - especially when the man clearly has no knowledge or interest in any character trait of the woman. Also demeaning and objectifying are comments made about sexual things he would like to do with her.  </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
At least one answer to this question notes that I didn't mention anything about wanting to change the way the person thinks. But that is really my greatest hope in the way that I respond - that I would help the person to think more critically about the way they talk (and think) about women; that their perceptions of women would not be reduced to sexual preferences and fantasies.</p>

"How can I subtly tell coworker I don't want a surprise leaving party?","<p>So, I've handed my notice in at my job and one of my colleagues (let's call him Bob for the sake of argument) is giving me the suspicion that he's throwing a surprise get together with the office for my leaving (only a small office, we're all professionally quite close and it has happened previously with other colleagues who have left). The sentiment is great an' all, but I really feel uncomfortable with surprises (I don't know why? I'm quite an extroverted person). I'd much rather people just told me and arranged things with me (boring, I know!) but I make plans out of work a lot and I don't want to let anyone down (both in and out of work). </p>

<li>He's asked me if I'm doing anything for it, which I replied ""I
haven't organised anything, nor' was I planning to."" (normal question)</li>
<li>He's also asked me, what day specifically I'll be leaving (in a separate conversation, as he doesn't know when I handed my notice in, just knows that I'm leaving). </li>

<p>The thing is, I don't want to just approach him and say ""Please don't do any surprises or anything, I'd rather we just arranged something!"" because I would literally look super arrogant (and it would be slightly awkward if he wasn't and was just curious about my leaving). Safe to say though, I'm probably not the only person who doesn't like surprises.</p>

<p>Which begs the question, how can I subtly tell someone I don't like surprises?  </p>

"How to politely defer conversation until I've finished my food?","<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>Lets say John and Peter are classmates. Peter eats slowly, and talks a lot while at it. John cannot enjoy the food while talking, so he prefers to finish off all courses and continue conversation after that. John is interested in the conversation.</p>

<p>The location is university's canteen, and they ordered first and second courses. It is quite crowded, but they sit in front of each other at the table.</p>

<p>Peter usually talks about his daily adventures, and sometimes asks semi rhetorical questions. His face expression tells John that he expects an answer, or any other kind of voice feedback. Though Peter uses written communication method for important things, so what Peter says during dinner is just regular conversation.</p>

<p>Peter perceives John as blunt person, but John knows that Peter might get frustrated by direct answer.</p>

<p>The country is Kazakhstan. It is located in Central Asia, to the south from Russia (just in case you don't know where it is, which is usually the case with foreigners).</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How can John politely tell Peter to hold on with the conversation before he finishes the food? Will it be better for John to suggest Peter to eat his food too?</p>

"How to converse with the CEO during lunch?","<p>Twice the CEO of our company sat next to me (also across from me) during lunch in the company.

"How do I connect with people over texting?","<p>I'll start off with some context: I'm 19, and I've had problems keeping friendships for as long as I can remember. I have no problems making new friends (but it's a bit hard for me to relate to people). But right now I'm in a social situation where a lot of the interaction takes place on text or social media. My friends text each other for hours whereas I can't continue conversations on text for more than 10 minutes. I can't even keep in touch with really good friends who I don't see everyday. I don't want to lose their friendship due to lack of contact.</p>

<p>I'm in college right now and I can't make new friends with people who I'm not in the same class with because those kinds of relationships mainly develop over texting. So how can I get better at texting?</p>

<p>Edit 1: A bit more explanation: I keep seeing my friends text each other all the time but I've never understood what they talk about for so long. I know for sure that it's small talk. But how they manage that for hours is difficult for me to understand. Something specific I'd like to know is this: How do I turn small talk into a meaningful conversation without being too forceful? </p>

"What is a good replacement for social contact when giving up smoking?","<p>I am planning on quitting smoking. I have already reduced my nicotine intake substantially by switching from machine cigarettes to roll-ups, using tobacco which is less strong.  </p>

<p>Having analysed my smoking, I think that one of the things which I will miss most is the social interaction which smoking brings.  </p>

<p>I live alone and, while I do go out to groups/meetings and stuff, most of my day-to-day social interaction with people is driven by smoking.  </p>

<p>E.g. - when at home, I go outside for a cigarette, and usually this means I meet both of my neighbours.  Neighbour A will usually come outside every so often with her dog, and I, standing outside my door, will have a chat with her.  Neighbour B is also a smoker, and he tends to come outside for a cigarette at the same time as me.  He and I will have a chat.  </p>

<p>At work, I go for smoking breaks at the smoking shelter, where I have a friendly chat with colleagues who are at the shelter for the same reason.  </p>

<p>Looking back over the past ten years I have been smoking, on and off, since university, I note that a lot of my friends have been people who I have first met in smoking situations.  </p>

<p>Obviously I do go out now and then to events where I meet friends, but not often enough to replace the loss of regular, short social contact with people on that day-to-day basis.  </p>

"How can I address a man talking inappropriately about women?","<p>Source is this twitter thread: <a href=""https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/976848126987374593"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://twitter.com/MalwareJake/status/976848126987374593</a></p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She said that the guy who appeared to be the unofficial group leader started talking about one of the (very few) female conference speakers like a piece of meat. The other guys jumped in and described the many (specifics were very shocking) things they would do to her.
  One even made rape ""jokes"" (which are obviously NEVER okay).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When in such company, I would just leave the conversation, after taking in how repulsive this kind of attitude is. But that doesn't make them understand that this is just not ok. So the question is: how to be assertive in these circumstances.</p>

<p>This 'unofficial group leader' seems to express such things to (re)establish his leadership position. At that point, the others in the group are already determined to be no match for him (at least in the leaders' mind).</p>

<p>One way of addressing him, could be: ""Now I see how you are still single"" or ""wow, your girlfriend must be really happy with you"" (depending on the situation). Although that's just passive aggressive, and will not result in a constructive ""hey, this way you are talking reveals that you are actually not respecting women at all, you should revise how you look at women.""</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the real reason this guy is acting this way? (I suppose I have some idea about it, but please elaborate)</li>
<li>Given that we know or assume to understand the reason why he talks this way, how to best address this guy and/or group, to get them to understand what they are doing?</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit: adding context.</p>

<p>This is something that often happens at tech conferences, but of course it happens everywhere (I suppose) when there's too many men and little or no women and drinks. There's this idea that you can't have good looks and be smart at the same time.</p>

<p>I've seen it happen in Belgium (Europe). My biggest concern is not detoxing tech events, but I'd like to see this kind of behaviour disappear entirely. It just shows a total disrespect for women in general, and it's a hard idea to get across, especially towards men with lower moral standards.</p>

<p>Edit: I'm asking from the viewpoint for someone in the group. Maybe the better question is: what can someone in the group (obviously not the alpha guy) do, to make sure the rest of the group isn't tricked into thinking this is the proper way to talk about women?</p>

<p>(If anyone has better tag suggestions, I'm a bit at a loss.)</p>

<p>Edit:
I'm going to refrain from refining the question. I like how people interpreted it in different ways, and there are a lot very good opinions on these interpretations. Changing the question could mess up other people's answers for no good reason.</p>

<p>I don't see it as a duplicate of the linked question as this is a group going wrong thing, which is harder to counter than an individual making an inappropriate comment. But I agree it covers a lot of ground and probably overlaps with several other questions.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

"Work supervisor expects platitudes in response to his pleasantries, even when I'm miserable","<p>I have been working at my job for over a year now and I have some minor but extremely annoying interpersonal issues with my boss. He's British and I'm Canadian but we are living in Ireland. I'm a software developer. I think it comes down to having different temperaments and lifestyles. </p>

<p>For example, I am 28 weeks pregnant. During this pregnancy I have been really struggling with sleep disturbances. I tend to wake up at 2AM or 4AM and cannot get back to sleep. I am also a little overweight so the extra weight is really wearing on me now. I'm also hormonal and more irritable than usual and a little stressed about this big life-changing event that will happen in 12 weeks. </p>

<p>My boss likes to do some 'niceties' before diving into talking about work. I don't really enjoy this because I have to lie to him to have a smooth conversation. For example, he asks me how I am. I tell him the truth: I am struggling or I am really tired. He doesn't respond well to this or he said things that I consider to be kind of sexist such as 'oh, it's normally not a problem.' A man telling a woman how pregnancy normally feels doesn't sit well with me or else he doesn't like to hear that I am tired etc.</p>

<p>I have to lie to him to get through these conversations. If I say 'fine/good, how are you?' it gets this conversation over with but it's incredibly boring and repetitive to have to do this everyday for 5 days a week. I'd rather just jump into saying stuff like 'hey, did you see that email?' or 'hey, did you see that new ticket? What's the priority for the day?'</p>

<p>I also get sick of the routine of a 9-5 job + 1hr 15 mins commute at times and I'm not always thrilled about coming into work but I don't hate my job. My boss has repeatedly said that his children drive him insane and he'd rather be at work than at home. I don't always find my work to be interesting. </p>

<p>Other people don't seem to have an issue with me being honest about being tired. Do you have any suggestions about this situation?</p>

"Frequently rebuffed when trying to initiate or join a conversation","<p>I moved to Germany about six months ago to take on a new job. Being new here, I've been trying to socialise and build up some new friendships. </p>

<p>A recurring pattern when I attempt to join in a conversation at social events, is that I'm frequently ignored. Usually, there is a glance or nod in my direction, and the conversation carries on without me.</p>

<p>When I attempt to initiate a conversation with a stranger I usually get curt one-word responses. Sometimes they look away or give a forced smile and move away. When I attempt to sit with someone the vacant seat is invariably taken already.</p>

<p>Very often I see this behaviour with women, both locals and fellow expatriates. Being frequently rebuffed like this in social settings is bewildering, frustrating and at times depressing. I'm a middle-aged male with a non-threatening physique. I maintain good hygiene and dress and act to blend in. </p>

<p>In most interactions with women I don't feel any romantic interest. I never make offensive jokes or controversial comments. Language is not an issue since these interactions are in English, which I'm quite fluent in. So my questions are,</p>

<li><p>What could be the reasons for the negative feedback when I try to initiate or join conversations?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the best way of dealing with these rejections without retreating into my shell?</p></li>

"How to handle girlfriends past / social media usage?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My girlfriend (Filipina) is (like almost all Filipinos) an intensive user of social media. Means: Lot of activity and almost 3k ""friends"". It's okay. People are different and that's nothing to complain about. </p>

<p>Actually we are 6.5k miles apart. On December we will be together without any distance. </p>

<p>The lady is 24 (I'm 29). And of course, it's normal, that people have a past. I have a past, you have a past. So far so good. </p>

<p>Before we met each other she was a flirty type of girl. Means, she talked to a lot of guys, who also left some (flirty) comments (Different type of guys. Also elder guys). It was before me. So usually nothing that should bother me. But. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm different. I deleted all ""traces"" of my past. It is past for a reason. And I don't want her to feel bad. And I think that's my point. I know it was before me, but it's kinda killing me to see these comments. And to imagine how her life would be when we wouldn't have met each other. Yes, it sounds strange. And sometimes I try to give some ""hints"". I never told her directly that it's killing me. </p>

<p>I would never forbid her things. I don't have the right to do so and she's loyal. That's nothing I should worry about. I don't care about social media and I only use the messenger to text her. </p>

<p>It is just a strange feeling to see ""so much past"". I mean you almost ""reconstruct"" her entire life. And that's not only dangerous. It also gives me the feeling, that the past is not completely past. The ""addiction"" to collect (female) friends is one thing. (I can't understand it, but that's her thing :D) </p>

<p><strong>Question: How would you deal with that? Talking to her? More or less directly? Ignoring it?</strong> I don't know if it's a kind of jealousy, but I don't like the feeling. Maybe I'm overreacting or too sensitive, that's why I'd like to hear other opinions. </p>

<p>I know. It's ""just"" social media. But actually it's a part of the relationship, it's our way to communicate. It will be over in a few months. Nevertheless it's something that affects my mood. </p>

"How can I ask my husband about his work progress without him becoming defensive?","<p>My husband and I work from home and share a work office. We have so for 5 years. We also have a new 7-week-old baby girl. </p>

<p>Prior to her birth, we used to ask each other how work was going all the time: ""what are you up to?"" I'd ask, or ""are you working?"" I didn't ask because I want to monitor if he's working a lot, but because I want to know if it's safe to disturb him or even just find out about his day. These were always received fine when no defense at all. </p>

<p>Now our little girl is here and there's a lot more pressure for him to work (since I'm not working yet) and because we all are currently still in survival mode where there just aren't enough hours in the day to get everything done. These same questions have become dangerous to ask. He becomes defensive and feels like I'm judging him by not working enough or because he's taking a break when he should be helping out with our daughter.  These aren't my intentions at all, but the situation is much more difficult and stressful now. </p>

<p>To be clear, this happens to me too. It's very easy to feel judged, because I do things differently - maybe he thinks I leave her a bit too long undressed before her bath and I feel judged and defensive.</p>

<p>Suddenly it feels like we are behaving as enemies instead of as friends in some aspects and are suspicious of each others' behavior.</p>

"How can I go out to lunch with a friend's partner with him not feeling betrayed?","<p>I have a friend (John), whose partner (Jane) I am also friends with. The three of us have hung out together for many years.</p>

<p>I'm unsure when it is considered acceptable to spend time alone with Jane, and if I should take any steps to ensure that John (her partner) doesn't feel betrayed, regardless of what he may say.</p>

<p>Now, I'm well aware that in any healthy relationship there should be a great deal of openness, tolerance, and trust. However I'm not so idealistic as to believe every relationship is as peachy as it appears - If I'm creating stress on another couple, and jeopardising our friendship, then I'd rather wait until the weekend to see them both.</p>

<p>Jane is the only person I know who works near me, so I'm not left with the option of seeing another person, or inviting a third party. I've grabbed coffee with her a few times, and I feel guilty having not said anything to John. I know that if I had a girlfriend, I certainly wouldn't want him to be frequently calling her out to lunch, regardless of how much I trusted them. It'd make me first feel jealous, betrayed and insufficient, and then later probably guilty and various other emotions of self-deprecation, for having thought badly of friend and partner meeting up for food. At the same time, I fully realise that everyone is free and independent, and has a right to make their own decisions. It's certainly not up to John to dictate who Jane sees, but here are some of my concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>Should I continue having lunch, as frequently as I want, with Jane?  </li>
<li>Should I have a chat with my friend John, so that I can be sure that I have his approval?  </li>

And I try to move on. But, when the opposite person involved in the incident doesn't seem to think on the same lines, a kind of unpleasant friction arises between us. This becomes very awkward, especially so when we face each other after quite a few years. Clearly, they have not moved on and still want to indulge in something that would boost their ego. But, I have clearly forgotten about such incidents. </p>

<p>The incidents could be anything related to teasing each other, making fun of them which they could or couldn't reciprocate or just anything. </p>

<p>Recently, I have witnessed one such person. When I met that person, I was very normal but s/he was not and said something demeaning to me. I was initially taken aback at that and later I understood that making such statements boosted their ego. </p>

While I am trying to remember how I am going to interact with people even for the first time, I want to know how to deal with people who surprise me suddenly with their 'ego-boosting' behavior. </p>

As the same time, I understand that my conversations rather diversions from their self-centered discussions was one of the reasons for their nasty behavior even after quite a few years. What I would really like to know is how do I evade these self-centered discussions? There is always one person such person whom I encounter at a professional level or at personal level. It is not always possible to not to be part of their discussion. They could be my peers, my relatives, my seniors or juniors, just any random person. </p>

<p>All I can think of is to keep mum to prevent any unpleasantness at a later point of time/life. Will that be the only step I need to take?  </p>

<p>Edit : </p>

<p>I am adding the context as requested. </p>

<p>Kindly note the person(s) I have mentioned about are very much self-centered. They have the knack to pull people towards them with their persona and mislead them. At the same time, they try to center all the conversations around them, could be their own family members, or their own office related work or their own lifestyle. Anything at all, and it has to be around them. </p>

<p>When I met the person, many years ago, I found the self-centered discussions uninteresting and diverted to various other topics. This person would keep mum, staring nastily at me all the time, because the attention of the group was diverted towards me. </p>

<p>At that moment, I didn't think much about that diversion, but I did realize later that the person's ego was hurt and since s/he couldn't do anything about it, grudge built up. I was cool as a cucumber but s/he wasn't. </p>

<p>There was no bullying involved. It was mostly diverting the discussion from their self-centered ones to a wide range ones. And I did make fun of them too because I was just giving it back. </p>

"Dealing with a wait-and-see situation when you have a time constraint","<p><strong>Short Version:</strong></p>

<p>I have a budding friendship with a coworker, but recently said something incredibly stupid that has left them feeling justifiably hurt.  While I think it would be best to give them time, I am about to go on extended work leave and feel that if I don't try to resolve the issue now, the friendship will completely wither and die by the time I return.</p>

<p><strong>Long Version:</strong></p>

<p>I am a married man dealing with some personal issues, foremost among them is a lack of a proper support network of friends to talk to about the stress in my life.  I have been trying to proactively get involved with new people through work so that I may eventually develop the kind of friendship(s) I need.</p>

<p>Foremost among those I have begun to develop some comfort with regarding person topics is a female coworker.   She is part of a larger crowd I have been going out for drinks with for the last few weeks.  The other evening at such an outing, I noticed a conspicuous simultaneous absence of her and another male coworker.  After she left, I made the regrettable choice to send a text asking if something was going on there, with a ""good for you"" vibe.  This was a poor choice in and of itself, and justifiable anger resulted.  My immediate apology included the phrase ""I only wished to let you know I am okay with whatever"".</p>

<p>What makes it particularly horrific is I did not realize that male coworker was married.  My choice of phrasing things has thus taken on a much darker meaning, suggesting that I might be looking for similar attention.  This was not my intent.</p>

<p>Normally I think it best to let tensions cool, but given the magnitude of the error, I left a follow-up apology by text the next day when I realized this.  I explained that I would never wish to imply she was playing with married men.</p>

<p>Although she is a coworker in the broad sense, I don't work with her directly.  It has now been two days without any contact.  I will go on extended leave in two more days.  She probably doesn't realize the exact date my leave starts.</p>

<p>I realize that things are pretty bleak here in general.  The only silver-linings is that she already knows I am a social idiot who doesn't really know how to approach friendship.  This is something we had discussed previously.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong></p>

<p>What approach regarding timing is the least-bad option?  Should I attempt to talk to her (at work!) about the issue before I leave, or should let it be? I have also considered recruiting a mutual friend (more hers than mine) as a proxy to initiate conversation, but that has its own complications.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>She texted me, apparently we are talking again.  I am as surprised as anyone.  Thanks for all of the advice from everyone.</p>

"Someone criticized my ""casual player game"", how to make them think?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I love candy crush and candy crush like games. I love grouping things by color and I'm <em>very</em> good at it. I play it in my free time, especially when I need to relax my mind.</p>

<p>I know such games are targeted to a broader audience but it doesn't mean that they can't be harder in there very own way (trust me, they can!).</p>

<h1>What happened</h1>

<p>Today, during my lunch break, one of my coworkers saw that I was playing a candy crush like game and told me in an almost neutral but still a bit condescending voice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are playing candy crush.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I was taken by surprise, I just responded ""this isn't candy crush"", he corrected himself (""You are playing a candy crush like"") but the only answer I could come up with was ""this isn't candy crush"".</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: I have had this remark made to me several times in the past and always by people considering themselves as ""true players"" and who would look down at games for a larger public.</p>

<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>I don't want to defend my game by implying that candy crush players are, indeed, not worthy of respect, but I am because I'm not playing candy crush.</p>

<h1>The question</h1>

<p>For the next time, how can I make such a person think about what they are saying and what they are implying when saying it? And how can I make them know that I absolutely disagree with what is implied (that game for casual gamer have less value)?</p>

<p>The perfect outcome would have them agree with me but just making them think about it would be a good start.</p>

<li><p>This coworker never talks to me otherwise (and he isn't shy). And I'm pretty sure he wasn't just trying to ""make the conversation"".</p></li>
<li><p>I'm also asking for cases where the condescending aspect is clearer (in case you still think that the coworker wasn't condescending)</p></li>

<p>Back then, I said something to the effect, that I didn't have money (not a complete lie, especially considering that no information was given). This frustrated Bob so much that he went away immediately, mumbling something, sounding disappointed.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>My question is: <strong>How do I (politely) dismiss a request for money from a stranger?</strong></p>

<p>My goal is: <strong>I do not want to give them money, and want to end the conversation as soon as possible.</strong></p>

<p>I would prefer a polite solution, but I became unsure about insisting too much on it and so only put it in brackets.</p>

<p>Now, additional details/explanations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only in the last question did Bob actually mention money. He didn't do so before (also not during that monologue).</li>
<li>Bob never disclosed how much money (or in which form, i. e. bank transfer or cash) he wanted or what (or whom) he needed it for for.</li>
<li>I was surprised that the conversation ended so quickly. But I wonder, and that's also why I ask that question, how to react if they had continued asking for money.</li>
<li>I'm not sure if my reaction was overly polite. The conversation was short and not unfriendly, but that's hard to judge now. I tried to remain neutral.</li>

"Advice for making friends when moving from the US to the UK?","<p>I'm moving from the US to the UK for my husband's job and I'm from Oklahoma/Texas/Georgia.

"How to act out of concern for safety in group setting with an individual showing aggressive tendencies?","<p>Not sure if this question is better for martial arts or what. The goal is personal safety, but I find it interpersonal because it's a matter of maintaining personal safety using 'soft' strategies (decisions &amp; discussion not body armor) while also maintaining group relations and norms and not burning any bridges or coming off as acting rashly.</p>

<p>In the news we hear about crazed acts of violence against innocent people. I'm not sure if this is actually any more common nowadays than in the past and I recognize it is an exceptional, unusual thing in any case. Still, it happens. In schools, in public places, in offices, maniacs lash out violently. I'm on board with ""we can't live in fear"" mentality, but I also think the world can be a dangerous place in general and one has to take some level of responsibility for their own safety in response to stimuli and circumstance. </p>

<hr>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<p>In a class or school, a member of the group (student or employee) has demonstrated a history of (non-violent) aggressiveness. For example, when confronted about performance issues, they become enraged, turn red and yell. Those outbursts are dealt with by administrators but are not always grounds to permanently remove the aggressive member of the group. Eventually after so many outbursts and continued poor performance, the aggressive person is told their time with the group is up and they'll have to leave at a certain date. That person becomes enraged again, but cools off and remains until their expulsion date. (Why they're not escorted out immediately is an administrative decision out of group members' control.) </p>

<p>If I am one of the people this aggressive person has targeted their anger at in the past, I'd feel unsafe, concerned they could escalate to actual violence on account of their dismissal. Even before dismissal, this kind of person is a threatening presence for the group, especially for those they aim their anger at. <strong>How are group members to act in this situation?</strong> </p>

<p>For one to avoid the group - a class or work setting - may be acceptable for short periods as if one were sick, but that ultimately becomes a significant career move if one decides to just leave the group over this. To avoid the aggressive person like the plague is frowned upon as not everyone can take that course and it can escalate or upset the person, who's aggression and behavior may be improved by acceptance rather than becoming an outcast. To report the aggressive person to a higher authority doesn't seem to make sense as they haven't actually committed any crime or even threatened to, they are just generally short-tempered, and escalating the situation in that way may just escalate their bad temper or aggressive behavior in the future. None of us are perfect and being short-tempered is not a crime, though it can be threatening to the group. The situation becomes more complicated if the aggressive person is a known hunter or otherwise firearms enthusiast legally; a short-temper is not (yet) grounds to lose one's right to bear arms, and the aggressive person may have no criminal record or any history of physical violence toward other people. Heck, there are cases where this aggressive character is generally not seen as a bad person or an extremist in any way, quite friendly most of the time and appreciating life as most others do, but just has a temper and a bad habit of lashing out at others which is threatening to the group. In some cases, this aggressive person may remain in the group and not get expelled from it by administrators, and group members go on in their work while feeling threatened by this person's potential to become violent.</p>

<hr>

<p>In these cases what is one to do? This is a situation I've recognized more than once over the years, in different settings and groups. I'm asking as if I'm a peer of the aggressive person. E.g. we're both students, we're both co-workers, and whether or not there is some hierarchy (e.g. project lead vs. project implementation staff), neither of us have sufficient administrative powers to remove the other from the group. Again the goal is ultimately personal safety, but achieved in such a way as to maintain group relations and avoid causing any unnecessary social or career harm. For example answers that suggest a group member outcast themselves are not really achieving the goal; while maybe an answer is simply remove yourself from the group, this is not always an easy option and is not a scalable approach that fellow group members can work with.</p>

"How to clarify relationship status with friend you haven't talked to in 2 years?","<p>In college, I had a fairly close knit group of friends that I played games with pretty regularly. That group primarily consisted of 4 people, myself, Alice, Bob, and Sam, with others joining depending on who everyone was friends or roommates with at the time. Alice and Bob started dating after a while, and myself and Sam became pretty close friends, and that was the situation when we all graduated.</p>

<p>It's now been a couple of years, and things have changed quite a bit. Alice and Bob moved out of state for grad school, while myself and Sam stayed in our college town. Since college, Sam and I have stopped being friends for various reasons, and I believe Alice and Bob have stopped dating, though I have been unable to confirm that. I'm also reasonably sure that Bob/Alice have the same level of ambiguity over whether Sam and I are friends now. I don't really hang out with the peripheral friends anymore, because for the most part they were all everyone else's friends or roommates, not strictly speaking mine, and our interests drifted apart over time. So, these days, the old friend group really doesn't exist in the same way.</p>

<p>Bob is coming back to the state for Christmas this year, and messaged me to see if I wanted to get people back together to play games. I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea, but I don't want to do the social lifting of trying to plan it, especially with people who are disinterested in playing games and have blown me off in the past. At the same time, I really don't want him to invite both me and Sam in a group chat with everybody, or anything similar, because of how awkward it would be. So I want to try and figure out what the social situation would be if we did play, to try and head off the problems at the pass.</p>

<p>So, given that, my question is twofold: how can I tactfully ask Bob whether he's broken up with Alice, and if he would want her to come (is this even appropriate to ask? I have 0 experience here...), while also explaining to him that Sam and I are no longer friends, and that he cannot invite us both to any get together?</p>

"How to recover from being falsely seen as a racist?","<p>So here is the story:</p>

<p>It was a Saturday night and my wife and I were sitting outside, drinking. We've already had a few drinks and we were talking, listening to music, in a good mood if you will. I see about 5 or 6 houses down from ours (we live in townhouse apartments, so the houses are stacked right next to each other), a couple of guys step outside.</p>

<p>I was feeling confident with the alcohol in my body and wanted to walk down there and talk to these guys. They seemed like they'd had a few drinks themselves and I knew they wouldn't mind me walking up to them and talking to them.</p>

<p>I walk down there, we introduce ourselves, we were just talking. Funny part is, no names were exchanged still. After about 10 minutes of talking, I tell them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never caught any of your names, what is your name?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now of these two guys, one of them was of African-American descent. This is important to this story. This guy of African-American descent, he thinks. He thinks for a about 5 seconds and goes </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Umm... Mike. My name is Mike. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am usually really good at reading body language and facial cues. But this time, I messed up really horribly. From his pause and his ""Ummmm"", I felt like he was giving me a fake name. I got this really strong feeling that he did not want to give me his real name. It had NOTHING to do with him being African-American or anything, just his body language made me feel so.</p>

<p>The smart, all-knowing me go:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh come on man, you don't need to give me a fake name. Assuming I won't be able to pronounce your real name is very offensive. Try me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both these guys start laughing hysterically. I just stand there like an idiot, waiting for them to finish. The guy says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My name really is Mike. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I felt horrible. I did not mean to be racist at all, but it sure did seem like it. I apologized like 10 times but I still felt horrible. I still feel horrible! </p>

<p>What could I have told the guy so he understands, realizes, and believes that I was not trying to be racist?</p>

<p>This is why I feel so bad about it: right after this happened, Mike said he has to go in the house and ""grab cigarettes"" and walked in. The other guy was still out, but I felt so horrible, I just told them to have a good day and walked away. Neither of them came out after this incident for about 20 minutes; even though they had to come out to smoke their cigarette if it was genuine. So I felt like they did not want to come out because I was sitting in my back yard. </p>

<p>I am in the US, in a ""backwards"" town in the US, to be specific. Important because a lot of people in this town are kind of racist. I've had racist remarks told to me in this town before. I am an Indian myself. To summarize, I am very confused and I am very ashamed. </p>

"How can I decline or redirect a religiously-objectionable community-service project without alienating people?","<p>My large, international employer supports employees volunteering in our local communities, even allowing us to spend a certain amount of work time on such projects.  My local office of about a dozen people was recently talking about doing something as a group, and somebody offered to organize a project.  (That happened while I was on vacation, so I don't know the details of that conversation, but I'm on board with the general idea.)  A group project, in addition to helping the local community, is an opportunity to do something valuable together as a team that isn't work.  I think there's team-building benefit to that.</p>

<p>Here's the problem: the specific organization the person contacted is problematic for me because their work is strongly bound up in a religious mission that I cannot support.  Their religious goal is front and center in all their publicity, their motto, their client interactions, etc -- bringing the light of (name) to the world, that sort of thing.  I'm happy to do the <em>type</em> of work they suggested, and I'm always glad to hear of religious groups that act on their faith by doing things like feeding the hungry -- but I can't be part of a project that <em>promotes</em> their religion, which their work does pretty blatantly.  Participating in that way is a violation of <em>my</em> religion.  (Please just take me at my word on this; I'm not trying to start a religious argument.)  I am certain that this possibility did not occur to any of my coworkers.</p>

<p>The project got far-enough along while I was away that I would feel awkward saying ""er, could we do something else instead?"".  Because we are a small group, it will stand out if I don't participate.  I'd also rather not lie about being busy; I don't like lying, and it will also probably be pretty obvious because it's a work-time project, not an evening or weekend.  If I organize a different project (which I'd rather not do, but could do if necessary), I worry that it looks like I'm stomping on (or at least wasting the time of) the coworker who already made these inquiries.  If I tell that coworker why I'm uncomfortable, I risk an uncomfortable conversation in the workplace.  I'd also like to avoid giving the impression that I don't care about helping my local community -- I do, but not like this.</p>

<p>How and with whom should I bring this up?  We're all peers except for one manager (who is not <em>my</em> manager; mine's remote).  We all get along well and like each other, but we're coworkers not close friends.  They are all aware of my (minority) religion at a surface level but are almost certainly unaware of the problems of involvement with this other religion.  (After all, most people never have reasons to think about stuff like that.)</p>

"Witnessed a woman being abused (groped) in a nightclub","<h1>Scenario</h1>

<p>Last Thursday I (21 year old male) was in my student union as there was a Drum and Bass Event happening. I went out with a fairly large group, about 8 lads including me and 2 girls. We were all having a great time. I was talking to strangers around me and conversing with a lot of different friendship groups. Basically I was feeling very confident in myself and extroverted. I wouldn't say I was drunk but I was on a good high. </p>

<p>Then I notice a very out of place guy walking around checking out the women.</p>

<h2>Reasons</h2>

<ol>
<li>He wasn't wearing normal clothes for a night out (eg. trackies/jacket).</li>
<li>He was by himself (not that you can't be in a club by yourself but for a Drum and Bass Event, you'd expect people to be dancing).</li>
<li>We held eye contact for a few seconds and he looked at me dull and emotionless, not the look of somebody having a good time.</li>
</ol>

<p>I kept an eye on him and noticed that he approached a woman from behind and started groping her. The woman I believe was with one of her other friends and 4 lads which hadn't noticed yet. Now obviously I knew this was wrong and had to do something.</p>

<h2>Possible Approaches</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Speak to the woman (pretending I know her) and ask her if she wanted to come get a drink. This way she walks away from the guy, without me having to confront him.</p></li>
<li><p>Approach the guy directly and tell him that what he is doing isn't cool. This could get me into trouble with him and I would have to prepare for confrontation.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask if the girl is okay and tell her friends what is going on. This would be a strength in numbers scenario where I wouldn't have to confront the guy alone.</p></li>
<li><p>Go off and get a bouncer without speaking to the girl before hand.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the end I went with choice number 1 and this worked, however the guy did push me which I expected but I didn't react and just walked to the bar. The guy didn't follow and we didn't see him again for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>What would you say is the best approach for this sort of situation? Do women prefer this approach from other men they don't know or is there a better way for myself to handle it?</p>

"How can I ask my flatmate why she's upset after I mentioned feeling like a third wheel?","<p>A few days ago my flatmate [22, F] and me [26, M] went to a party. She was asking me which of two guys she should hook up with. It was more jokingly, at least I thought and she also told me it's just a joke. Later at that evening she went on to flirt heavily with the guy I said was better. At some point we wanted to go home together, however that third guy was coming with us. As we waited outside for him, I asked her, what exactly is going on between them. She told me a few time it's nothing and they already spoke together and it's just fun and all. But she also said, ""maybe I'm going home with him, you never now"". and seconds later ""no no, I wanna go home with you"".</p>

<p>I then said, I'd feel uncomfortable if there is something serious going on between them and I'm driving home with them. I'd feel like a third wheel. If that's the case, I'd rather go home alone. She suddenly became pretty pissed and told me I acted really bad, and she then told me to go home alone.</p>

<p>She came home a few minutes after me and I wanted to talk about the incident, however she said she doesn't want to. I pressured her to still do it, cause I'd just feel bad otherwise and don't want to go to bed angry. In her opinion she wouldn't feel uncomfortable at this situation and so shouldn't I. I think however it's not that hard to understand that someone might not like that situation. Another point of her was, what would happen, if he was to be her boyfriend. I said to her, that's something else, then they know each other and I wouldn't feel like I'm just annoying them, since they'd spent more than enough time together.</p>

<p>At the next day I tried it again and said, I'd like to say sorry, but I'm still not sure what about. Her reaction was a ""ok. thanks -- long pause -- I guess"". We talked a little, but nothing productive really.</p>

<p>3 days later she seems to be still mad. I feel kind of uncomfortable since we live together and I don't like all the tension. She isn't saying anything just giving very short answers, doesn't show any interest in me whatsoever (something she usually does, like 'how are you?', 'what are you doing today?'....)</p>

<p>I keep thinking about all of this and assume I'm missing something. I'm not sure if she maybe thinks of me as a big brother and wanted to introduce this guy to me. I showed that I'm not a big fan of either of the two guys she asked me to chose from. Maybe she wanted to change my mind on them. (I didn't like them because I heard them say stuff like ""I'd love to bang Alice sometimes as well"" and ""Jane got a nice ass"".... )</p>

<p>As a side note: </p>

<ul>
<li>I have feelings for her, which makes all of this very hard for me. I don't know if she knows it. She might have figures it out, we are kinda flirting, but it might be seen as just friendly flirting as well.</li>
<li>I was a little energetic that evening. Not screaming or aggressive. I asked her a few times to just clarify whats going on between them so I can decide whether I wanna join them or not.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since the last two conversations didn't really solve anything, I am asking for advice for a third one: How do I start it, without coming across too insisting/annoying?
How can I get a proper answer on what exactly she is pissed at? I feel like she doesn't really know either.</p>

"How can I tell a friend they need to help with what they promised because what they promised can't wait?","<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>

<p>My boyfriend, John, has a female cat. He's had her for a long time. He also happens to have a friend, Lily, who loves cats. 
Over time, Lily went from being a cat lover to being a cat activist, adopting stray cats, neutering/spaying others,  providing food, rescuing kittens and so on, out of her own pocket. I admire what Lily does. She really cares about cats. </p>

<p>Now, a few months ago, Lily convinced John to adopt a male kitten. (John and Lily used to be house-mates in the UK, they know each other for quite some time). </p>

<p>Lily reassured John that she would be covering the kitten's expenses, even his food. I told John we should adopt the kitten <strong>only</strong> on the condition Lily helps us with the vaccines and the neutering and since this would be taken care of, I agreed. I love cats myself and used to have two. </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Lily did buy food for the cat a few times, and John has since had numerous discussions with Lily about feeling bad having to accept her help. </p>

<p>Lily has recently been asking us when we are taking the kitten to the vet (when it shouldn't have been up to us in the first place) and John hasn't clearly told Lily we can't do it until today when they had a phone call that didn't go very well. </p>

<p>Lily accused John of not caring about his cat, (John hasn't spayed his female cat-it's been years) and how bad this is for her (well, she never goes outside and was the only cat until now), while John reminded Lily of her promise and how it was her responsibility to take the kitten to the vet. 
In the end, Lily told John she won't be able to pay for the neutering yet even though she knows the kitten is almost 6 months old and needs to be neutered soon. John worries we might end up with a pregnant cat. And we don't want that. </p>

<p><strong>My position:</strong></p>

<p>I keep reminding John that <em>I</em> agreed to adopt the kitten on the condition Lily would cover the cost of the neutering and the vaccines (as an incentive to convince us to adopt the kitten). I'm also planning on moving in the future and I don't want to end up with more cats than I can handle. </p>

<p><strong>John's position:</strong></p>

<p>Wishes Lily didn't have to help. Also doesn't like being told what to do about the female cat. Had been hesitant asking Lily's help with the kitten, but did so after getting upset. </p>

<p><strong>Lily's position:</strong></p>

<p>John should have spayed the female cat but doesn't address what needs to be done about the kitten. </p>

<p>John ended the phone call (he hung up on Lily after she was yelling at him for not agreeing with her about the female cat), telling me that <em>I</em> should handle this with Lily, get into a fight or whatever I think necessary, next time. </p>

"How to address a detail of an idea without appearing to shoot it down?","<p>There is a specific pattern which appears frequently in my conversations and alienates my conversation partners. I would like advice on how to address that pattern as a whole, not just the one example I am giving. </p>

<p>It starts with someone expressing an idea. Today, it started with a colleague in a meeting, who said something along the lines of ""we need a chart of our product setup, let's set aside a slot next all-hands meeting to work together on it"". To which I answered ""And how do we ensure that we don't end up with 3-4 people actively discussing and the other 25 zoning out?"". </p>

<p>From everybody's reaction, and earlier conversations with friends, I can now piece back that I came across as saying ""What a stupid idea, it will never work because people will zone out for sure"". </p>

<p>The actual contents of my mind (some more salient than others at the time) were roughly ""What an interesting idea, I would like to engage more with it. I would like it to succeed, but it's complex enough that it's not guaranteed if we just implement it naively. I just noticed a possible failure mode, and maybe you have already thought of it and have a strategy for avoiding it. If yes, I would be interested to hear it. If no, then I propose that we think about it, now or sometime later, because that way your idea is more likely to be successful"". </p>

<p>This is something which has happened to me more than once, with different people, and different ideas. They say ""we should do X"", I say ""and what can be done about Y"", and they hear it as criticism. So I am afraid that I might be gaining a reputation as a grumpy naysayer. </p>

<p>What would be a good way to express my actual reaction, while still ensuring that the potential complication gets addressed? I would like some answer pattern which is more succinct than what I typed above, because I am afraid that people won't follow me if I am so wordy, and will probably change the topic before I have come to the point of the potential complication. Also, I am better at reflecting on the meaning of conversation after they have happened, but much more reactive during them, so I need something which I don't have to compose carefully in my mind for a full minute - I will either forget it, or somebody else will jump to another topic while I am doing it. </p>

It was a dysfunctional relationship coupled with philosophical misconceptions on her side and immature knowledge on my side; not to mention stresses about money and from relatives. I decided to terminate it so I would have time to fix it. This required hard work, and she couldn't believe that I could do that, but now I confidently say that my job is finished.    </p>

<p>For various reasons the way I terminated it hurt her, and now basically she dismisses and degrades me. One year ago I messaged her friend Susan, but she said that there was no hope, that I was not Clara, and that I should have focused on my happiness first.

<p>From <a href=""https://kletische.com/get-someone-try-new-things/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Get Someone to Try New Things</a>, I learned that as long as I have a perfect combination of words to message her, then I could open the doors that both Clara and Susan locked on me.

But for various reasons I want to talk to Susan first so that she will tell Clara to contact me, and this is where my friend worries that Susan won't answer me. She thinks that if she were Susan, she wouldn't want a person who had made her friend sad approaches her again. Whether I can prove to Susan that I'm qualified to get back into a relationship with Clara is irrelevant; she needs to see that Clara won't be hurt again. But the only way to show Susan that Clara won't be hurt again is for her to listen to me before judging me. <strong>She needs to help me understand what she doesn't understand, and this requires effort.</strong>    </p>

<p>Honestly I think there is no reason for Susan to keep silent with me this time, but to be extremely cautious I want to hear what you think. How can I approach Susan and make her understand I need her to listen to me before trying to talk to Clara? The country is Vietnam and the philosophy is Taoism.</p>

<p>The root of the problem is he believes that our family of 4 (so 3 other people) do not return the favors he gives us.</p>

<p>Our opinion is that he almost always asks us to do something with him (drive to town, go outside and pick up something, etc), but it has to be done within a few minutes or he gets upset. So there are there many instances where we say we're in the middle of something (""Can you give me a couple hours?"", ""What about tomorrow?"", etc).</p>

<p>For me, 22M, specifically, I always give him a few days heads up when I would like us to hangout or I need help. My schedule is super busy so I treat everyone else's the same. Therefore he can arrange his plans accordingly if he chooses to help.</p>

"How to help my girlfriend with her lack of self-confidence?","<p>My girlfriend and I are together for little over a year now. She has big problems with self-esteem and little to no sense of self-worth, which I think is at least in part due to parental abuse and -abandonment.</p>

<p>No matter how often I assure her that I love her and everything about her (her personality, her looks, her intellect, our shared interests, etc.), she quickly deflects it as ""I am only saiyng that to cheer her up"".</p>

<p>I don't want to keep any secrets from her, so if she asks me about my ex-girlfriend, I always tell the truth to the best of my ability. (My first relationship ended almost a decade ago, so some details are hard to recall, especially since those memories mostly weren't really pleasant). My problem is just, she gets extremely sad and insecure over the most minute details.</p>

<p><strong>An example:</strong> She asks me questions like ""What hair colour did your ex have?"" and when I tell her she had brown hair, she gets depressed and tells me she finds her black hair ugly. I tell her that I find her black hair absolutely beautiful and that it's my favourite hair colour - which is true - but she just dismisses it as something I say just to cheer her up.</p>

<p>I don't want to lie to her and pretend my past doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Worst of all, after she had calmed herself, she usually falls into an episode of self-loathing, where she apologizes profusely, telling me that she is sorry for being such a burden to me. When I tell her that it is fine, that I am not upset, and that I love her more and more every day, she just seems to ignore that.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to help her feel more confident about herself and our relationship? Any help would be appreciated!</p>

"How can I express to my boyfriend that I don't feel comfortable with this situation without sounding like blackmailing him?","<p>My boyfriend and I have been in a <strong>serious relationship</strong> for a few years.</p>

<p>I have known of this female friend ever since but have never met. <strong>She visited him once</strong> where he lives now and stayed over in his room for about a week. They have remained in contact but now she is on an exchange in another country and <strong>she has asked him</strong> to visit her. She has a one room student accommodation where he would be able to sleep on a spare bed. The issue is really that they have some history, <strong>she was his first love</strong> (unrequited) and that makes me uncomfortable with the situation. I am unable to go with him for work reasons and I don't feel comfortable watching him <strong>go there alone</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> He has never shown unfaithfulness at the time or ever really. I am more just uncomfortable with her, she is known as the most attractive girl that all his friends are into and I don't trust her. I don't want to push him away or cut him off from his friends but I also don't really like the idea of him going.</p>

"Appropriate way to show appreciation to colleague?","<p>I've started my first year in industry some months ago in a UK Software company. Since I'm pretty much a newbie I had to ask around for help. There is this guy that has been helping me a lot with work stuff but also with some other stuff not related to work (e.g. I've had some serious issues with my PC and couldn't get it back on track on my own, so he stayed overtime helping me sort it out). Besides that we also get along pretty well and seem to have a lot of subjects in common.</p>

<p>With Christmas coming up shortly I was thinking of feeling Christmassy while also showing my appreciation for his huge support with my PC (being a student, needing a new PC would have been quite a hit to my budget). He is a bit (more?) geeky and I believe around 30yo (although I never thought it was appropriate to ask) and although I like software development I wouldn't categorise myself as geeky. I am not British myself either, so I am not entirely sure how to go about it. I've noticed (Christmas, in this case) cards are fairly popular, so I was thinking of going for that.</p>

<p>I could send him a Christmas card or something else, more personal. But I don't intend to come off as ""too friendly"" and get misunderstood either.</p>

<p>Also, there are more colleagues around my desk, some that I've never talked to, some that have been nice to me, but not as involved as this one. I am a bit unsure whether it would be all right to give something to one person or seven out of 30+ that are on the same floor.</p>

<p>So, basically, this is my question: <strong>Is a card an appropriate and effective approach to show my appreciation? If not, could you advise of a better way?</strong></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p><strong>My goal :</strong> show appreciation to helpful and friendly work colleague.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural context:</strong> UK, Software Company</p>

<p><strong>Who is involved:</strong> Me and another work colleague, both males.</p>

<p><strong>My uncertain approach:</strong> Give a (Christmas) card in which I try to convey my gratefulness.</p>

<p><strong>My priorities for the outcome:</strong> To manage to convey my appreciation towards the work colleague without coming off as ""too friendly"" and without being rude to other work colleagues. I am looking for a better approach if a card fails to be the right choice.</p>

"Should I apologize for not acknowledging a colleague in office?","<p>At my new office, I got to know a few people and among them is a woman  (""Alice"" for simplicity). I could call all of them acquaintances including Alice. </p>

<p>I usually greet Alice outside of work, with a smile or ""How are you?"". I usually do not greet her while I am at work. I say this because her desk is just after mine, she passes me each time she comes back in after taking a break and it kind of feels weird to smile at her each time.</p>

<p>Today, it so happened that I finished my work and I was looking for my supervisor, so I could inform him that I was leaving for the day. He was in a meeting, so I kept looking behind me to see if he was done. While doing this, Alice left her desk and walked in front of me to . I did not greet her, even though I caught her eye, I just turned back to my computer screen awkwardly and I kind of felt like she was expecting me to smile or acknowledge her because she turned away awkwardly too.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I felt terrible after this. Most of all, I felt guilty that I didn't smile because I thought she expected it.</p>

<p><strong>Should I apologize to Alice for this incident?<br>

"How to start or keep up a conversation with a friend or crush","<p>I am currently studying in a high school, and I have several friends. Among them is a girl I like. We have several common interests e.g. gaming, and we're on very good terms and talk a bunch in real life and online. When I'm in a group, it's pretty easy to find topics to talk about; however, when I'm talking to her alone, there are often a few problems:</p>

<p>a) The conversation gets quite slow, and I run out of things to say. The silence gets quite awkward.
b) If she makes small 'complaints', e.g. ""I'm tired"" or is happy about something trivial, I can't find anything to say to that.
I sometimes end up just smiling awkwardly if the topic before was in some way funny.</p>

"Is there a polite way to ask a kid to ""move along""?","<p>Another dog-related question, sorry. I read <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/4225/2708"">this question</a> but I'm not sure it applies.</p>

<p>My two Border Collies need/want a lot of exercise. One of the reasons I chose this neighborhood is that about 700 feet from my house is a mowed, 26 acre area (a water retention field when necessary) that no one - and I mean no one - uses. I have the HOA board's permission to exercise my dogs off leash there. The field, which is surrounded by a nice sidewalk, is considered common property.</p>

<p>Although dog ownership is high here, most people do not exercise their dogs except to take walks. So when I'm out in the field chucking balls and giving my dogs commands (in sign language, so as not to annoy the neighbors), people, especially kids, are apt to stop and watch my dogs and me. This is fine. I love for people to see that dogs can get other kinds of exercise, and they are beautiful on the field.</p>

<p>Once in a while, though, kids want to play with my dogs, and that's also fine, except when they're ""working"". If they want to interact before or after the session, I will make my dogs be social. They'll obey simple commands, chase balls, etc. I also teach the kids some sign language commands, which they use and seem to like. But when they're working, the dogs just want to chase balls and have no interest in stopping for some social time with kids. If I interrupt their ""work"", they will give the kids the most cursory attention then run back onto the field. It kind of embarrasses me how impolite my dogs seem then.</p>

<p>How do I tell the kids that my dogs don't want to play right now without being unkind (especially if their parents are around)? Worse yet, sometimes (like today), a kid will wait for 10 or 15 minutes to play with my dogs, not knowing that they still have 30 minutes of exercise to do. How to tell the child that waiting is useless and they maybe should, I don't know, not wait around?</p>

<p><sub>I try to pick times when kids won't be around: when they are in school, suppertime, etc. Often this is good enough, but sometimes not.</sub></p>

"How do I announce my presence to someone who is not aware of it without frightening them?","<p>First of all, I'm not sneaking up on people on purpose. But it seems, that I'm quite Ninja-like in my movements and this has caused problems. People are immersed in something (e. g. computer, TV, music etc.) and I want to interact with them in some way, but whatever I do, it frightens them terribly.</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>One sample situation is my visit to aunt ""Alice"". She is about 60 years old and sits in the living room, reading a good book. I need to ask her something. In order to reach her, I even have to walk down old stairs and hope that I make enough noise. But I don't. So finally I stand in the living room (Alice is facing away from the door) right behind her. She has absolutely no idea of my presence. *What shall I do now?""</p>

<p>If I pat her on the shoulder or say something or walk into her line of sight, I scare the living daylights out of her. But I don't want to. Is there even a way out?</p>

<p>I'm not sure that it is always entirely my fault, e. g. when someone is listening to music wearing headhones (also already encountered). I'm not trying hard to move silently and stamping can also become annoying. So far, I have found no way out.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>How do I announce my presence to someone who is not aware of it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>My goal is to establish communication without frightening them too much.</strong></p>

<p>I'm looking for verbal or non-verbal cues and strategies. The starting point is the moment I stand behind them (but not necessarily, if you have a totally different idea), since only then do I know that they are not aware of my presence.</p>

"How to manage expectations around a vacation offer from family?","<p>This is the most ""first world"" problem I've ever experienced, but I'm hoping some folks with similar experience might have some guidance.</p>

<p><em><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Wife's mother offered to pay for a big trip somewhere; We're worried the offer is self-serving. What's the best way to accept or reject this gift while minimizing damage?</em></p>

<p>My MIL (mother-in-law) lives alone and has recently become obsessed with the show ""Doc Martin"" (set in England). I'd prefer to minimize details, but I don't use ""obsessed"" lightly: this progressed quickly past ""fandom"" and has already detrimentally affected her relationships with us and others. She's gone to great lengths to get everyone around her invested in the show with her, but it's just not our cup of tea. She's taken this as personally offensive and it's been the source of a lot of tension. </p>

<p>During a recent visit, MIL pulled my wife to the side and told her that she'd like to send just the two of us on a vacation to Port Isaac in Cornwall, where the show is filmed. My wife, being cautious, asked for more details so we could discuss it. ""I'll need your help finding out when they film so we can be sure you'll be there at the right time, and I'll get a list together of all the places you need to go and people you need to try to meet,"" was the reply. It turns out that she's been thinking about this for a while and has created a specific itinerary she'd like us to follow for the trip. She also asked that it be a private gift; my MIL &amp; FIL are on good terms but live apart and lead separate social lives.</p>

<p>We're concerned that taking this trip contributes to my MIL's delusions around this TV show and puts us in the awkward position of enabling her isolation. It seems like this is a grandiose attempt to get us interested in the show, and a way to deepen her personal connection to the cast/characters. The ""privacy"" around the offer is a bit worrisome as well, and suggests that other family members might not look fondly on this sort of indulgence. My wife likened it to a free business trip (It's ""all expenses paid"", but at what cost?) while I joked that it'd be like sending my grandparents on a ""Game of Thrones"" tour (""HOW many people died here?!"")!</p>

<p>On the other hand, this is a <em>huge</em> gift that she feels strongly about, and turning it down will likely do some serious damage to our relationship with my MIL. We travel often and have talked about England in the past, so we can't brush it easily off as something we're not interested in. Ultimately, our worry is that this isn't so much a gift for us as a gift for her that we're being used to fulfill.</p>

<p>A few other details affecting our decision:</p>

<ul>
<li>We're American, and this is not a trivial expense or trip.</li>
<li>The area we'd be visiting is looks lovely but is not somewhere we'd visit on our own.</li>
<li>My MIL explicitly said she's not mobile enough to accompany us - it would just be my wife &amp; I. </li>
<li>This gift wouldn't break anyone's bank, but the nature of where we're going and why might raise a few eyebrows.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're less concerned about ""stay or go"" and more about ""how to manage expectations"". In particular, we're worried that she thinks we're going to become friends with the cast or that they'll know her personally from the letters she's sent. We'd love to take the trip and don't mind seeing some new sights to get pictures for her, but want to be 100% certain that my MIL understands that we're unlikely to be invited for tea with Martin Clunes!</p>

<p>Can anyone offer some tips on how we might approach discussing this offer while minimizing offense to our family? Does anyone have experience (favorable or otherwise) with taking a trip paid for by family? We're both a little flummoxed as to how we should proceed.</p>

"Girlfriend become aggressive when we bump into other women","<p><strong>About the relationship</strong></p>

<p>My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years now and we have lived together for 2.
We are both introverts, and we had some trust issues over two years ago, admittedly my fault (watching p*rn videos if useful to know).
This is my first relationship, and it's her second (the first has gone bad, since the other guy fell in love with another girl, and they broke up the very next day). </p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>Similar to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/19082/how-to-tell-my-girlfriend-im-uncomfortable-with-her-getting-jealous-when-i-look"">How to tell my girlfriend I&#39;m uncomfortable with her getting jealous when I look at other people?</a>, so I'll try to add more details as possible.</p>

<p>It's related to bumping up into other girls when hanging around. Example: in summer it's fairly common to see girls wearing (or ""not wearing"" as she used to say) shorts/hotpants. In winter pantyhose/leggings are addressed.</p>

<p>No matter where I look or what I do, I get accused of staring or wanting to leave her for ""one of those"". She becomes REALLY aggressive sometimes, shouting and insulting for a while, pretending that I had to keep my eyes closed, or walk behind her (my gf), and such.
The really frustrating part is that I can literally stick my eyes to the ground but she insists that I'm giving nasty looks at the girls.</p>

<p>This is really affecting our relationship and our lives, since she doesn't trust me to go alone to the supermarket anymore.</p>

<p>It <em>might</em> be addressed as jealousy, but since I have no female friend (only acquaintances) I can't tell that. <em>My real concern is related to her very low self-esteem, maybe because of her previous relationship, or the continuous ""appearence competition"" with other girls.</em> (she's following a strict diet to lose weight but does't succeed IMHO because of too much stress, and that is really causing her more frustration)</p>

<p><strong>How I tried to manage the situation</strong></p>

<p>Badly. I already tried to discuss the matter with her by:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Trying to explain that I am not interested in other women. Furthermore I'm only sick of such random encounter which create unnecessary fights.</p></li>
<li><p>Trying to compare our behaviour with our friend/acquaintances in a relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Asked to propose some solutions that would satisfy her but the answers where unfeasible. Example of proposed solution: ""stop where you are when you see one and turn the other direction"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To make everything worse each confrontation we have on the matter could easily escalate into verbal and physical violence, so upon the next encounter I become visibly stressed, and her interpretation is that I'm trying my best to not fall for the other girl.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Sorry If I complicated too much the explanation, if needed I will add/remove details. Now the question (edited to just one):</p>

<p>How can I tackle the situation, possibly by making her understand that I'm not interested or attracted by other women just because of their appearence?</p>

"How to shut someone up while being only moderately offensive when they incessantly criticize my house?","<p>I know I am close to OCD about being averse to clutter.  I put things away in their designated drawer or shelf, or throw (or give) them away if we are  unlikely to use them again.  That is, I am a neatnik to extremes, I admit it.  </p>

<p>I have a couple of in-laws who repeatedly say things like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your house is so sterile!</p>
  
  <p>I like a house to look lived in!</p>
  
  <p>Poor (name of my husband), everything gets picked up as soon as it is put down!  (This is an exaggeration.  The pick-up happens after something has been lying there, unused, for several days.)  How does he ever find things!?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My husband comes from a family of -- there is no other word -- slobs.  Their houses may be clean, I don't know, because I have never disturbed, or commented on, their clutter.</p>

<p>How do I shut these people up?  I don't much like them to begin with, so if I offend them, I don't care.  I repeat, if I offend them, I don't care. They have been offending me for years on this topic, and I am fed up.  I tried once saying I preferred a house that look died in, but they have no sense of humor about themselves.</p>

<p>The answers so far, have me starting off by being pleasant, apologetic, saying I am sorry if they feel unwelcome by the ""sterility"" of my house, advising me not to be defensive or get into a ""my way vs your way discussion"" and even to say that they are hurting my feelings!  What I am in search of is an answer/retort that falls a few notches short of saying ""If you don't like my house, you know where the door is"" and is preferably cutting and witty.  As for their motivation, they criticize (almost) everyone, not just me; it's their favorite sport.  What I have done is say ""Really!"" in an incredulous tone of voice and quickly change the subject.  That works, for that visit, but I am fed up with this obligatory prelude.  I thank the answerers for the thought they have put into this, but their end points, which are good, are about where my start point is. </p>

<p>Clarification: People are assuming I am much younger than I am, and am talking about my MIL.  The in-laws are of my and my husband's generation.      </p>

"How can I deal diplomatically with a feminist neighbor who continuously delivers political speeches in private?","<p><sub> This question is unlikely to have a very strong cultural context so I welcome answers from members all over the world.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>I  met this person (code name Jane D) when I was studying sociology at Masters level 12 years ago. She was much older and a senior graduate student in the subject, and already a very vocal feminist. </p>

<p>We had some social science discussions at the time (she was not part of the faculty conducting the course, and thus not my teacher) and I developed a sympathetically pro-feminist attitude which was conjoined with a new understanding of how <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=patriarchal+societies+control+both+men+and+women"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">patriarchal societies control <em>both men and women</em>.</a></p>

<p>We lost touch for over ten years but she has recently become my neighbor. Both she and her politico-liberal husband (read Marxist intellectual) are full-time university professors while I am doing things totally unrelated to academia these days. However she has become a friend of my mother, who knows her family from long back.</p>

<p>The trouble is that Jane D frequently visits my mother and whenever I meet her by chance she starts delivering strongly political speeches about feminism and patriarchy. Her tone is alarmingly accusatory and she keeps saying <em>""you men""</em> this and <em>""you men""</em> that, despite my repeated efforts to remind her that I am a sociologist myself and not at all a representative of patriarchal society. </p>

<p>A sample conversation which we had 2 days ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jane D: you men have been keeping women down forever! Again and again I see this. You men have the steering wheel of this whole society! Is it your divine right or what? You have no right to say what women should do in this country. etc.</p>
  
  <p>(I say: don't include me! What have I done? <strong>I agree with you completely</strong> so why you think you need to convince me!)</p>
  
  <p>Jane D: you men are all alike. A man can never help a woman. This is another class war like Communism and we don't need your support. Without your support only the women will set themself free! (She is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_feminism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radical feminist</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not even a sensible political discussion, and really upsets my mother, who is a retired doctor and totally not interested in politics. She cannot be bothered about anything that distracts her from her health and her family, but she hesitates to be strict with Jane D because she considers her a friend and was close with their family from long back. </p>

<p>Note: Jane D is absolutely convinced that men are the class enemy of women but she has nothing against me personally (friendly enough when <em>not</em> politically fired up, which is like 15% of the time) -- her husband is aloof and never accompanies her on these visits nor meets with us on any other occasion. I don't really know this person but considering Jane D's personality, he is very unlikely to be of any influence in this matter.</p>

<hr>

<p>Summary: I don't want Jane D to be talking about feminism and patriarchy all the time, and I especially resent her categorizing me as part of patriarchal society, but she resists our repeated hints and efforts to change the subject. It is not in my personality to be aggressive and clash argumentatively with her over this issue. Mother has also requested that I should not tell Jane D directly not to discuss politics when she visits us, because it is impolite from the point of view of Indian hospitality, which tells us never to offend a guest or neighbor.</p>

<p>So how do I diplomatically deal with Jane D's this habit of continuously delivering political speeches about feminism when she visits my home?</p>

<p>My dog's reactivity takes the form of fear aggression: when he's afraid, he barks or lunges and barks (no bites... yet). I have a trainer, I consulted with a dog behaviorist, and my dog ""Bob"" is a lot better with people, but he is still reactive to new dogs. What a relief to get the fence! No more pulling the leash out of my hand and chasing after a jogger! No more wrapping a leash around my waist now every time I take him out! </p>

<p>My new next door neighbors have two dogs (""Yesss!!!"", I thought to myself.) When they moved in (about a week ago), I went over and introduced myself (my dogs were inside), made a bit of small talk, offered to help in any way I could, etc. </p>

<p>Two days ago, new neighbor ""Ted"" is out with his dogs in his yard. ""Cool,"" I thought, I'll introduce my dogs! I put a leash on ""Bob"" and headed into my yard. As soon as ""Ted""'s dog (about 30 pounds heavier than ""Bob"") sees ""Bob"", he starts barking, which sets ""Bob"" off. He yanks the leash out of my hand and flies towards the fence, barking like a crazed animal.</p>

<p>Now, the fence wasn't cheap. It's a metal fence, 4.5"" tall, with (metal) balusters 3 7/8"" apart. (The 'hood HOD allows only two types of fence, this and vinyl.) So I was apologizing for my dog's barking as I ran after ""Bob"". </p>

<p>Then something unbelievable happened.</p>

<p>""Bob"" pushed and twisted and <strong>got through the fence!</strong> ""Bob"" is not tiny; he's a 40 pound, muscular dog now. And this furry Houdini is barking in ""Ted""'s barking dog's face. And ""Ted"" is (understandably) swearing at me, and I (understandably) am frantically trying to open the (unbeknownst to me; it was a new fence) locked gate and get to ""Bob"", because unlike him, I can't squeeze through it. Finally I figure it out, grab my dog (who is no longer barking or snapping, but is now smelling ""Ted""'s dog's butt and acting 1. like a normal dog and 2. like nothing out of the ordinary just happened. I, on the other hand, am falling all over myself apologizing, swearing at the fence, apologizing again, swearing at my now sweet dog, and babbling like an idiot while ""Ted"" turns from red to a normal color (I am still beet red with embarrassment.</p>

<p>I would like the neighbors to think well of me. Though I apologized profusely and said I'd look into what could be done to the fence to prevent this from happening again, I think more is needed.</p>

<p>What can I do to underscore my apology to ""Ted""? Flowers? A bag of dog treats? A BarkBox subscription?</p>

"My significant other has stuff from a past relationship that is also part of his work","<p>My significant other got rid of old stuff and things he not longer needs from his house, that included things from past relationships.</p>

<p>But I saw the other day in his desk some songs he wrote to his ex, I didn't say anything since he is a musician and his job is to make music. However, it feels as if he kept them to entertain nostalgic sentiments for his ex. </p>

<p>I am concerned and wonder why he has kept stuff from other relationships? I always get rid of past relationship things, but I can't expect for everyone to do as me. I don't want to cause trouble, but i do feel uncomfortable, since he keeps contact with her due to parenting. I don't want to be the person that demands him to get rid of things that he worked on. I'm sure if I bring this up he will throw them away or at least change their name. </p>

<p>My question is, how do I talk to him about this? What do I say in a way that he does not become defensive or offended?
I will talk to him but before that I want to think this through.</p>

"How can I ask my ex's parents how my ex is feeling after the break-up without making it too awkward?","<p>My ex-boyfriend and I had a difficult break-up. We haven't talked much since but I recently got a message from him about how he can't even enjoy watching TV shows anymore because this is something we used to do together. I assume he is still having a hard time... I haven't responded to him yet because I don't know what to say. If I said I understood, I would be lying because I'm not going through the same emotions (though it hurts to know he's suffering if he still is), but I don't like ignoring him either. (I'm guilty of not responding to him right away thinking it would be more painful if I kept in touch). </p>

<p>On top of that, his parents are visiting from the United States and they want to see me. I'm planning on meeting them and I'm looking forward to it. His parents have been really nice to me in the past and I do appreciate and respect them a lot. They are discreet and private people and I don't think they will ask me questions which might put me on the spot (e.g what happened with my boyfriend or if I am single). Americans are different in that they aren't as involved in their adult children's lives compared to parents from the Mediterranean region, which I hate. </p>

<p>However, I do want to ask about my ex, how he is actually doing/feeling and I am not sure if I should. If I don't ask at all, I'll feel like a jerk. If I do ask, I might feel I have to explain to them why I ended the relationship (though I'm sure they are aware of problems with my boyfriend) and I don't want to sound apologetic. For some reason I feel I should say something.</p>

<p>How can I show I still care about my ex, how he is actually/honestly doing/feeling? (e.g. Is it weird to ask if he's over the relationship?)</p>

<p>If I do ask and all I get is, ""he's doing fine"" (ex is living with his parents now), <strong>should I insist</strong> on knowing <strong>how he is really feeling</strong> and what's the best way to do that? </p>

"How do I clarify that the gift someone gave me is mine when they are asking for it back?","<p>I have a friend - let's call her Jane. Jane's a nice gal. We get along, meetup from time to time (when she doesn't decide to cancel at the last hour) and is someone I actually like hanging out with. As of late I've been turned off from trying to do anything with her because 3 times out of 5 she cancels.</p>

<p>A couple months ago she gave me a video camera after I asked to borrow one for a project. She said I could keep it and after I sheepishly asked if she was sure she said it was really okay because it was old/she had newer equipment/was getting a new one for her birthday. I accepted the gift happily.</p>

<p>This next part probably isn't so relevant but it bothers me; I had a showing for my video, something that she knew I worked hard at for months. She RSVP'd as going and cancelled a few days before the premier. </p>

<p>Anyhow Jane messaged me to meetup so I can explain cryptocurrencies to her. It ended like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also - could you bring my camera? I'm working on a few projects that require multiple recording devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the read of it, I'm unclear whether she:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wants to borrow the gift she remembers giving me</li>
<li>Wants to keep the gift she remembers giving me</li>
<li>Wants to keep the gift she does not remember giving me</li>
<li>Wants to borrow the gift she does not remember giving me</li>
</ul>

<p>This puts me in a strange spot because I don't know whether I'll get the camera back and, even though replacing it wouldn't be trouble, it still kind of sucks that a friend would take a gift back... but I don't even know if that's what she intends to do. </p>

<p>How do I clarify that the camera is mine (which us uncomfortable to say since it was hers) and that I would like it back in a way that isn't super awkward?</p>

<h3>The ideal outcome</h3>

<p>Jane and I are still friends (even if just unreliably so)</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I ended up going in with a combination of Val's directness and LinuxBlanket's show of appreciation. I said something along the lines of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, thanks for letting me use the camera! It really helped out :) Of course I'll bring it. Do you think I can have it back? Or should I buy a new one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the end, while I'm still not sure that it's ""mine"" I feel like that doesn't matter - I can use it more or less when I need to and we're still friendly.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice... for a little bit hearing everyone out felt like playing <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pokemon twitch for relationships</a> but it all worked out :)</p>

"How do I learn to pick my battles a little better?","<p>So... As I'm sure many of you have noticed by now, I have a nasty habit of locking onto an issue and not letting it go. </p>

<p>I asked my brother about this, and he seemed to think I was just born this way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As soon as you started talking you just pitbull-ed in on things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, this is often a blessing and a curse. It's made me a fighter and that's helped me survive at points. It also helps me to fight for the things I believe in. And it helps me to openly challenge authority.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are obvious downsides... Some things aren't worth pursuing to such a degree, and it definitely alienates people.</p>

<p>I guess when it comes to a ""would you rather be happy or would you rather be right?"" I usually choose:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right, 'cause I am, and I don't care if I have to argue with you about it all night!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is... How do I learn to pick my battles a little better? Should I learn to let things go? How do I figure out which things to let go?</p>

<p><sub>(I'm aware that there are three question marks there, the second two are there to expand on the first. More explanation than actual questions.)</sub></p>

<p>Ya... It just occurred to me that I've been doing the exact thing that I'm trying to learn to avoid, <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/posts/4776/revisions"">with this very question</a> and <a href=""https://interpersonal.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1824/was-the-question-about-learning-to-pick-battles-handled-appropriately"">the related meta post.</a> This is probably a really good example of the way I tend to lock in on things when I think I'm right. I rarely do it when I don't have a leg to stand on, but often the cost outweighs the gains and I end up aggravating a lot of people about an issue that seems really important at the time, but in retrospect probably wasn't worth alienating all of those people. I still think I'm right, 'cause I am, but I've got to learn when to take a step back sometimes.</p>

<p>So... um... For all those that insisted on an example there it is... Sorry about that.</p>

"How do you deal with someone who's pushing you without explaining yourself?","<p>There are certain people, especially family members you see from time to time or other close relatives, who simply don't know where to stop when offering you something. Usually it's about drinking alcohol, eating cake or other things I <strong>must</strong> do because everyone else does that too.</p>

<p>When they ask me whether I want it, I just say <em>""no, thank you""</em> and then it starts... it turns out it wasn't a polite question but actually an order so they start digging why I don't want to drink with them or why I don't eat this delicious cake?</p>

<p>It never stops until it's too much for me and I end the conversation with <em>""It's enough now, I won't drink it!""</em> or I simply throw in <em>""Stop, it's not your business""</em>. </p>

<p>I know they are the ones being rude by insisting on me doing something I don't want to but still, I wouldn't like to end it this way and prefer them leaving me alone without starting an argument or insulting someone with a pretty impolite response... or maybe there is no other way?</p>

<p>I don't want to explain myself why I refuse to do something (like many answers suggest: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/12209/15939"">one</a>, <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/11929/15939"">two</a>, <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/11852/15939"">three</a>, <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/8479/15939"">four</a> - please don't get me wrong, these are all good answers, however not for this scenario). It's not their business and I don't want to discuss this with them. </p>

<p>I really don't know what else to say but explaining my self like: <em>I don't like it</em>, <em>I already ate</em>, <em>I'm tired</em>, <em>I'm allergic</em> (not really, but sounds like a good excuse), or even <em>I prefer not to drink from this cup because it looks dirty</em> etc. etc. which usually doesn't work well because they very quickly will crush it and come up with an <em>anti-reason</em>.</p>

<p>In case there is no good way of handling this without excuses maybe there is some ultimate universal excuse that cannot be undermined easily and will stop these pointless conversations before they escalate?</p>

"How to refuse to shake hands without offending the other party?","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I don't like to shake hands and I'm looking for suggestions about how to turn people down without seeming rude or stand-offish; or how to prevent a handshake gesture from being initiated at all.</p>

<p><strong>Personal background:</strong> I live in the UK, am British, and have grown up in a ""typical"" White-Western culture.  I'm 30-years-old.  These facts may or may not be relevant to people's choice of answer.</p>

<p>No general problems with germs as a rule; some mild social anxiety on occasion unrelated to hand-shaking, but nothing of concern; some mild difficulties with social interaction that a few people (in a non-professional capacity) have likened to resembling a mild form of autism.</p>

<p><strong>Details of Dilemma:</strong> I don't enjoy physical contact with most people, particularly strangers.  At the top of the list of physical social interactions that I find unpleasant—to the extent that it makes me uncomfortable or sometimes upset—is hand-shaking (sadly, something that most often occurs when meeting someone for the first time).  To be clear, I have no negative feelings about others shaking hands—seeing it take place doesn't offend me.  I just do not wish to have to do it myself, although I'm not incapable of obliging someone and remaining outwardly unfazed, despite inwardly recoiling.</p>

<p>I think it's reasonable to say that there is a societal expectation/pressure to accept someone's handshake.</p>

<p>My three main modes of action, in the order of most-to-least commonly performed, are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Accept the handsake</strong>, and the negative feelings it generates inside me.</li>
<li><strong>Directly decline</strong>, stating that <em>""I do not shake hands""</em>.  This would be a great option were it always as successful as I would wish it to be.  A few rare individuals seem to respond well, out of respect or admiration for having asserted my preference against an accepted norm.  But, more often, it creates an awkward response in the other person, leaving them not knowing what to think or say to that.  It likely creates a poor first impression for these people, who I tend to feel are then less likely to want to engage with me socially thereafter.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore the offer</strong>, pretending as though I did not see them extend their hand (perhaps timing it with a turn away to point out something as a distraction).  This is basically a lie of omission, which is fine; somewhat cowardly perhaps; but something I'm quite unskilled at doing effectively and making it look natural.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is there anything I could or ought to be doing differently in order to minimise the risk of causing offence or dissuading others from wishing to engage with me further ?</li>
<li>Are there any good strategies to prevent handshaking from being offered in the first place ?</li>
<li>Does anyone else share my dislike of this social practice ?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Don't feel obliged to answer each and every itemised question.  A general response is fine, too.  I broke it down for clarity.  Thank you in advance for any insight people have to offer.</em></p>

"Conventions for small talk in Germany as a non-German English speaker","<p>Small talk is something that I have trouble with. Most advice that I can find is quite US-centric, like asking people what they are looking forward to. In my country this would be quite strange. Conversely, ""where are you heading?"" is quite acceptable here, but may be considered suspicious elsewhere.</p>

<p>It seems small talk conventions are quite culture-specific. I'll soon be moving to Germany for work. In what settings is it appropriate to make small talk there?

"How can I ask a new date to not smoke around me?","<p>I can't stand smoking, like, at all.</p>

<p>I get repulsed by someone's smoking nearby or coming close to me after smoking. It's purely due to the smell, which I find about on par with eating foods I hate the most, if not worse, and ends up consuming a large portion of my thoughts - I don't have a moral problem with it. Spending too much time around smoke can also give me a headache. I might have hyperosmia (a heightened sensitivity to smell) - the smell of smoke isn't the only smell I have a problem with, but it tends to be the most consistently problematic.</p>

<p>Now I've recently found myself interested in someone who smokes ""sometimes"" (whatever that means).</p>

<p>Ideally I would like to find out:</p>

<ul>
<li>How important their occasional smoking is to them</li>
<li>How often they smoke</li>
<li>Whether they could be convinced to try to work something out that involves not smoking around me (on the hope that their interest in me outweighs the desire to smoke that often)</li>
<li>Maybe find out whether it's strictly vaping or weed (which might not bother me).</li>
</ul>

<p>I <strong>don't</strong> want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Give up on them before having brought this up (even if that might be the best idea)</li>
<li><p>Date them if they're going to smoke around me or before hanging out with me.</p>

<p>I might consider one or two dates if that would put me in a better position to bring it up, but I doubt it would help and during that time it could become painfully obvious that I can't stand smoke if either they smoke or someone nearby smokes, which would prevent me from getting in ahead of it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If possible, I'd also like to <strong>avoid</strong> seeming like I am:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trying to get them to stop smoking altogether (that would not be some ""ultimate goal"" of mine for either short-term or long-term dating, even if I would obviously prefer it that way)</li>
<li><p>Trying to ""fix"" or change them</p>

<p>I want to present them with the fact that I can't stand smoking (like telling someone you're deaf, or really disorganized, or a Republican), and let them decide whether that's a problem for them or they're willing to compromise. This would be different from asking them to cut down on smoking because e.g. I think it's bad for their health (like wanting someone to become a vegetarian because you dislike animal cruelty). Now you could probably argue them being a smoker is as much of a fact as me not being able to stand it, but maybe they already smoke rarely enough for it to not be a problem, or they can change that fact, if they want to.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking a moral position about smoking (which is not true and may offend them)</p></li>
<li>A negative person</li>
<li>A sickly person</li>
</ul>

<p>So, how can I find out how important smoking is to them and ask them to not smoke around me considering all of the above? When is the best time to bring this up, assuming we're at the initial chatting phase and they haven't agreed to a date yet?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I know some people are asking: ""does this even matter?"" and to answer this, maybe it doesn't, however, I think in social settings it is nice to know what a person's gender is. It helps you to judge how to appropriately talk to them and interact with them.</p>

"How can I know whether a female house guest is interested in more than a friendly visit?","<p>We have met around 4 months ago, we both are from the same country and are on an internship abroad. She lives quite far from me (around 400 km). We have chatted a bit since we've met and our communication in real life has been nice.</p>

<p>We are in our early 20s and I like her and would be happy if her stay would result in something more (sex), but I also don't want to be inappropriate and make this visit an uncomfortable experience - I don't know if she is interested in me but I can't be sure she is not interested either. She's single and we've talked previously about her visiting but I was already busy at that time. Now that we've figured out our schedule, she will stay for 2 or 3 days and she'll be seeing my town and do some short trips to the nearest cool places.</p>

<p>I had mentioned to her before that she could come if she wanted to and I'd be glad. She accepted and then (a month after) I asked her if she wanted to come over for a weekend. It was supposed to be a weekend for more people actually, with a car rental and more invited friends but she was the only one who was interested in the end.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that I can read signals from women right, so the questions are:</p>

<p><strong>Which signals could she give me to show her sexual interest? And how to read them right? How do I give her a signal that I am up to more, without making her visit uncomfortable?</strong></p>

<p>I do have two beds in my apartment, so she wouldn't need to share with me if she wasn't interested.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: We spent almost 5 nice days together (its a long Easter holiday in Germany). There was no signs of sexual interest from her side (or it seemed me so), no touches and she didn't seem to appreciate them from mine either, she also avoided to look me in the eyes and meet my double-meaning compliments with strange/uncomfortable looks. So i decided to focus on having a good time with her as friend instead of thinking about having sex with her.</p>

<p>Thank you all for the answers, I learned a lot and had a great time. I hope that this question will help someone in the future.</p>

"How to react to clerks mocking me in the grocery store?","<p>It was a time when I was struggling with my OCD, and as this felt like enough trouble, I lightheartedly let go of social norms. I wore my hair mid-length (under a baseball hat; I am male), as the illness made it fairly difficult to groom it. I suppose my appearance, as well as my behavior, made me look kinda out of this world (although never displayed any overtly OCD behavior in front of the clerks in question).</p>

<p>I had recently gotten into the habit of shopping for meals at the meal stand at the local supermarket. The clerks at that stand were usually the same 2 women, maybe 30 years my senior. One of them (or maybe both) looked like they're stuck with a crappy life and are thus bitter, though they behaved normal on the surface.</p>

<p>Every day I went to that stand and said ""Hi :) <em>this-and-this meal</em>, <strong>in a plastic bag please</strong>"". I'm not sure how this sounds to english ears, but I said it in my native language, and it sounded fairly normal to me. In my language I didn't need to use the word ""plastic""; it was implied.</p>

<p>The meals in that place are supposed to be taken home. The clerks put them in a flimsy, leaking plastic box for you, so if you don't take precautions, a big fraction of the time the meal (or at least its grease) gets smeared all over your other purchases as you carry it home. That's the reason I had taken to requesting my meal box to be put in one of the (small, free, tied) bags they usually use for sausages. I have no idea how common my request was, but I do know other clerks put the box into such a bag for me without me even having to ask.</p>

<p>On maybe the 10th or 15th day, I had only gotten to saying ""<em>this-and-this meal</em>"" and the older woman turned to the other, did an ugly grin and said in a hushed, mocking voice ""...<em>in a plastic bag please</em>"". The other woman joined her in her hushed mocking. I pretended I had not heard her, but I felt hurt.</p>

<p>Now, since I was not well mentally, I felt that if I came to that stand again, I would get intrusive thoughts about how they mocked me, and I would feel very awkward, since we both would know that they don't respect me.</p>

<p>I never went there again for maybe 3-4 years.</p>

<p>Now I'm glad to say my OCD is hardly present anymore, so I shop there again with little negative feelings.</p>

<p>But now I'm afraid that if something similar happens (in the 5 years since that incident, nothing of this magnitude has), I'll feel pressured and will again suppress all of my possible reactions, leading to bad feelings and future awkwardness.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to learn some ""social hack"" to utilize in such situations, that lets me both maintain my dignity and not ruin my relationship with the rude person. So I don't want to report the rudeness to the store manager.</p>

"How to handle finding out your friends are getting together without you?","<h2>Some Background</h2>

<p>I'm a college student, currently a junior. Part of a large-ish diverse group of friends, split across two six person suites. I've been in this group and friends with these people, for a little over 2 years now.</p>

<p>Obviously the entire group doesn't hang out all the time, everyone has different schedules, workloads, lives, etc. But often smaller sets of people hang out, and sometimes larger meetups.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>I noticed this semester that I wasn't really seeing anyone/hanging out with anyone this semester, and just thought it was because everyone was busy and we we're all only occasionally meeting up.</p>

<p>Well it turns out that a lot of my other friends were meeting up several times a week to hang out, eat, and do stuff, including at night. At first I was a little jealous because I was, for some reason not invited to these, but marked it off as being with just a few select people. Then it turns out that it is quite a bit more people than they let on who are actively getting together/meeting up.</p>

<p>I also noticed that it is only me initiating  online conversations, so I just stopped being the one to put in all the effort, and what do you know, nobody messages me.</p>

<h2>How do I react to this?</h2>

<p>I feel extremely hurt by this, and my first thoughts are that maybe I was an asshole? Offputting? Or something else going on that they not only don't invite me to anything, but kind of cover-up or go out of their way to minimize or not make a big deal out of these things (as well as the fact that nobody is messaging me).</p>

<p>I asked a few people and told them to be brutally honest with me if there was some issue with me/if I was a jerk, etc. And they just said that it wasn't me, it was the group being bad friends, but i'm not really convinced.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long post. I'm not sure what to do, how to handle this, as I'm feeling extremely lonely while theoretically surrounded by people.</p>

<p>To help paint the picture a bit better, earlier in the semester a bunch of them were organizing some massive day-out in the town nearby or something, that was supposed to be a great day of doing some things in town, and drinking and hanging out. When I heard about this all they said was that it was invite only. Later, when I brought it up (they were talking about it) they just ignored me and changed the subject. So realizing I wasn't going to be invited, I planned to go to a conference that weekend. Of course, the day before the weekend, they find out in going off to a conference and <strong>then</strong> say that I'm missing this event and that I should go, knowing full well that I can't go, and that I was not invited in the first place. I'm pretty sure they just did this so they could act/say I was invited in the first place, knowing full well I never actually was.</p>

"How to deal with Friends With Strict Parents?","<p>I have a friend that I'm quite close to and I'm in danger of loosing her as a friend. Her parents are very strict and protective in spite of her being 19, they let her go out as often as my parents let me go out when I was 14; even less so.</p>

<p>Before in school it was fine because we saw each other everyday. I didn't mind as much when she had to cancel plans last minute for some reason due to her parents (pressure to study/work on her portfolio, needing her to cook for and babysit her 14 yr old brother) even when we planned the event well in advance.</p>

<p>The outings we organised and she had to cancel were mainly meeting for coffee or food or to exchange presents and were in safe neighbourhoods near to her house or on her bus line: no nights out drinking. So there was no reason for her parents to feel as though it was not safe for her to go out.</p>

<p>But now I have moved on my own to study in a different country. When I announced I was moving she said many a times that she would visit even though we both knew it would never happen (due to her protective parents). So I visited home a couple of times so that we could still meet up. Only the times I've come home she hasn't been able to make it in spite of months of planning. Others in our friend group gave out to her one of the times for the silly excuse of having to make dinner for 14 year old brother while her parents were working that night. There was apparently no way she could make the food and ask her brother to heat it up later or get him to order food in. She then felt quite attacked and felt as though we were judging her family so we backed off.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do to salvage our friendship. Since I've moved it's been difficult to keep her in a conversation online. I had hoped that her visiting me and getting a taste of the independent lifestyle would maybe inspire her to demand more freedom from her parents. But even after finding the perfect dates for her to visit and even offering to pay for everything, her parents still refuse to let her come.</p>

<p>Some times I worry as though she has stopped asking for permission and everything has become and automatic ""my parents say I can't"". What if she is just using her parents as an excuse and doesn't want to hang out with me anymore?</p>

<p>I once thought I could help her ""break free from the tight clutches of her parents"" but because of them, we've become so distant that it's not my place to even suggest that she contradict her parents judgement (it doesn't seem as though she believes her parents are wrongly denying her of any freedom).</p>

<p>How do I tell her that her parents are getting in the way of our friendship without coming off as judgmental of her parents or family?</p>

"How to respond to a gossiping friend?","<p>There's a friend of mine, let's call her... Rachel. We're very close (platonic) friends, and we'll frequently hang out as part of a larger group of mixed gender (including both my girlfriend and her boyfriend). We're all in our young 20's.</p>

<p>She has a habit of bad-mouthing people/gossiping a lot, and I've tolerated it so far, but it's really starting to get on my nerves. For example, some things she's done in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>She'll complain about her family drama a lot, and complain about her brother.</p></li>
<li><p>She badmouths one of my friends.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've never told her that this bothers me.</p>

<p>Last night, the group was hanging out and Rachel made a very snide and judgmental comment about some of her friends (who I don't know very well) having premarital sex. (Rachel is very religious) I felt like this was the last straw. This comment really bothered me because </p>

<ol>
<li>I barely know these friends of hers </li>
<li>I don't care if they were sleeping around, it has no effect on me. </li>
<li>I consider comments like these nothing more than gossip.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd tried responding with ""Why do we need to know?"", but I don't think this effectively discouraged gossipy comments because the rest of the group seemed to respond positively. </p>

<p>I'd like to know how to respond in moments like these, not just to Rachel, but also to anyone else in the future. What's the best way to respond to gossiping/bad-mouthing people that makes it really clear that I don't want to hear it?</p>

<p>I don't want to come across as disapproving; if that's the way they want to talk, I""m not gonna stop them. But I'd prefer that if they want to gossip they'd save it for when I'm not around, as these comments really bother me and make it hard for me to want to be around Rachel anymore.</p>

<p>I'm also considering texting Rachel about this and letting her know it bothered me. But I'm worried because I don't know if that would improve things, and I don't know how to do this in a tactful way with out coming across as judgmental or disapproving.</p>

"How best to avoid politics at family gatherings?","<p>Live in the United States where my family (on all sides) are extremely polarized.   Often at family gatherings (holiday, birthday, etc.) family discusses their political views in strong terms.  This happens for both in-laws as well as blood family.  Extracting myself from conflict from conversations is difficult.  This doesn't have any bearing to the actual political leaning as some family is strongly liberal, and others strongly conservative.</p>

<p>Example 1:  At family reunion.  Say hello to a family member that I have not seen for > 10 years.  After hugging and saying hello, the family member makes strong politically charged question as first words ""So you think we should drill!""</p>

<p>Example 2:  Birthday party at In-laws.  Family cuts cake; sings happy birthday. The family sits and turns on a news station and discusses polarizing political issue. </p>

<p>How do you politely bow out of the conversation altogether without ruffling feathers?  If I say ""I don't have an opinion"" then that creates a whole line of discussion why I should have an opinion.  If I basically don't agree 100% with whatever opinion being discussed then the line of discussed turns to saying why I am wrong.</p>

<p>When you're pressed for your political view at a family gathering that you are forced to attend (be a warm body), how best to steer the general conversation away from politics?  Or, how to verbally steer around point-blank political questions where you can't physically extricate yourself from.</p>

"How to switch conversations in mother tongue/native language to English at office","<p>I am an Indian citizen residing in India. I am exposed to quite a few regional/native languages, few of which I am fluent in. My preferred language for verbal communication is English at the office. </p>

<p>There are a few colleagues/peers who speak in regional language, most of the time, especially during team/casual discussions at the desk. I respect them for their language choice, but they expect me to reciprocate in the same language and me conversing in English reflects in a different way; And sometimes, a member or two push the conversations in the native language to only check if I can ever speak in that native language. When I sense that, I do end such conversations by saying that I have something important to do and would talk to them later, etc. </p>

<p>If this matters, most of the conversations at the team meetings do happen in English. So, there is not much of a problem there except for conversations beyond the conference rooms. </p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> </p>

<p>I feel that I might be coming across as condescending or rude while I am conversing in English. It is a mode of communication that I am comfortable with just the way they are comfortable with their own. </p>

"How to deal with bullies who are teacher's pets?","<p>I am a 13-year-old boy of eighth standard. I am neither very unpopular, nor very popular in school. E.g., everyone knows me because I am a ""good student""(because I get good grades), thus I am popular. But, I am not really good at gossip, chitchat etc, thus I am unpopular. Also, I think everyone likes me and stays by my side when someone bullies me.</p>

<p>Among my school friends/mates, I like almost everybody. But there is one friend whom I am having a lot of trouble with. He is a kind of bully, rather emotional or mental than physical. Once, another mate in school spread a rumor about me that I winked someone of my opposite sex(which is considered flirting in our class), he then spread that rumor further and also bullied me a lot of times regarding it. Since, he is way more popular than me, a teacher's pet and he gets more grades than I do. I found it very difficult to complain against him to the teacher for about seven months. Then I finally did, but the teacher did not take any actions(she might have forgotten it). But like before, he has found a lot of ways to harass me, e.g., calling me a miser(which may be evinced from the situations that I don't carry pocket money or I don't use a lot of pages for homework), snatching my glasses, calling me stupid, slapping me, insulting me in front of my other friends, taking credit for things I did etc. Also, when I tell a word which is not a swear word but he and others thinks it to be so, he tells it to everyone; which he does not do for others. I used to enjoy all these some days ago before the rumor was spread. But I do not do it now.
I have told him a lot of times that I did not enjoy that, even after he apologized, he started it again.</p>

<p>My problem is, he sits beside me and I want to tell my teacher to change my place to someone sensible, but I am not getting the courage to do it, so how do I tell it to her? Also, if she disagrees to do so, how do I make myself happy with him?</p>

"How do I encourage my family to talk more and watch tv less when I'm visiting?","<p>My husband and I are visiting my family for Christmas. I moved out and have lived separately from them for 10 years or so. We're staying with my parents. The TV in their home is on all the time. We don't have a TV at home and generally find the constant noise in the background to be disruptive. Nonetheless, I can live with that. It's their choice and their house and I can cope with the TV noise for a few days.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, It seems like whenever all of us are together (8 or so of us) and the TV is there, the default is ""let's watch something"". It almost feels like the laziest option. I don't want to watch TV. I want to talk to them.  My husband and I didn't drive 3 hours to watch TV. We drove to visit them. To talk to my family and spend quality time with them.</p>

<p>A few months ago my family came to visit at my place and it was so great! There was no TV and we sat around chatting and it was so nice! Last night I sat there watching random stuff on TV and just thinking ""why can't we just turn this rubbish off and talk?!""</p>

<p>I know that my family have a very different view on TV. We didn't have a TV for years and when we did my parents were pretty strict about it. And perhaps they do view it as quality time even though I don't.  Since becoming empty nesters it seems it has become a big part of how they spend their time.

"Sick grandparent(s) moved in and are now inciting anger and stress","<p>We're a family of three, my mom, my dad and I. My dad's father has recently been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and, based on what we know so far, there's no chance for a recovery and not much life is left in him. Both my grandma and grandpa are over 70 years of age. They moved in with us about three weeks ago.</p>

<p>Due to an unexpected incident, my grandpa had to be taken to the hospital in the middle of the night via ambulance about a week ago and is currently undergoing treatment there. However, my grandma continues to stay at home with us, which is very taxing on us emotionally, especially my mom. My dad works overtime practically every day to keep us from going bankrupt, so he often comes home around 10-11pm and by that time his parents had already gone to sleep, so he's barely exposed to anything that's happening between the two.</p>

<p>Before they moved in we didn't use to have long-winded conversations and we just did our own thing, me doing schoolwork while mom did the chores, and I helped her out whenever she needed it. Now that grandma's with us and us alone, she insists on helping mom, but she is clearly saddened by her husband's state. She would not stop radiating that sadness to my mom in the form of her attitude, and it would seem like her drive to help is fueled by the fact that she has someone to vent to while doing so.</p>

<p>On the first day of her husband's unexpected leave, when my grandma asked mom ""Is the food ready yet? I'm hungry."" my mom replied ""I'm working on it, I cannot cook it any faster"" and my grandma told her ""Oh, so you don't want to cook for me, I see."" which my mom took great offense on. Just today my mom told my grandma that she might not be awake by the time she returns home from a hospital visit (she was taken there and back by my dad's sister) to which my grandma replied ""Oh, so you don't want to let me in, I see."" despite her knowing full well that I will still be home and could let her in regardless. She's also been speaking ill of dad's sister to us behind her back, which my mom also does not appreciate. All of this takes place when I'm not there to hear it myself, and on the rare occasions when I'm part of the conversation such things are never said by her.</p>

<p>All this looks to me like she's trying to guilt-trip my mom for petty things which are causing a great deal of anger and stress in her. Back when we used to visit them semi-weekly at their old home, grandma and grandpa would constantly argue, and grandpa has even told us recently that he'd rather be dead than deal with her any longer.</p>

<p>It's got to the point where mom asked me to secretly record a conversation between them to let dad know what's going on because she does not want to talk back to grandma due to her unconditional respect for the elderly. While we should generally be understanding with elders, if this trend continues, my mother will be an emotional wreck by next month, and I feel powerless in the situation.</p>

<p>Is this within the extent of what needs to be tolerated from an older person?
What could I do to stop grandma from constantly venting to and taking her sadness out on my mom? Is there any advice I could give my mom on how to avoid the stress that comes with the situation?</p>

<p>My boyfriend and I decided to help out an overwhelmed friend Lily who has already adopted several cats by adopting a male cat, she found outside her house. We agreed to do this because Lily was going to cover the cat's expenses including the neutering. She has been doing that for multiple cats that don't get adopted and are released, so my boyfriend figured she's trustworthy. I had my reservations and from day one I had a feeling she wouldn't deliver on her promise. 
Several months went by, and Lily did nothing to take care of what she promised. </p>

<p>I talked to my boyfriend about confronting Lily. In the meantime, I found a place that would neuter the cat for free, two weeks or so ago. I tell my boyfriend who initially prevented me from doing that (cat wouldn't get picked up the same day) by suggesting we wait for him to borrow the money to take the cat to a vet near our house so we can pick up him up the same day.
However, due to changes in his work schedule, he has to wake up early in the morning and because we are both worried about the cats mating, we separated them. That didn't work. We are awakened every day by the female cat scratching the door and the male crying. I'm stressed out. 
My boyfriend finally admitted that I should have made an appointment with the non profit.</p>

<p>I call again and make the appointment. Unfortunately, this is going to be ten days from now. So again, without this being my fault, I thought of possible solutions. I asked my boyfriend's mom but she couldn't take the cat. </p>

<p>I couldn't keep Lily off my mind. I finally couldn't resist and told my boyfriend that it is really unfair for me not to be able to sleep because he won't confront Lily. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, you need to call Lily and tell her that your schedule
  at work has changed. You need to be able to sleep. Ask her to
  take the cat until we find a solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm upset with my boyfriend's indecision and having to deal with the consequences, but I'm more upset with Lily and, <em>I</em>, whether it's my job or not, would like to confront her. </p>

<p>How can I tell my boyfriend ""I told you so"" (about the whole thing) without sounding rude and <strong>then that I would like to take care of this <em>my way</em> or I don't want to hear about the cats waking him up ever again?</strong> (He gets angry easily especially when I mention Lily).  </p>

<p><strong>My way</strong></p>

<p>I don't want to call Lily. Ideally, I would like to send her a message asking her to take the male cat until we find a place that will neuter him for free (I don't want to tell her I have found one yet to see what she's going to do).</p>

But I was appreciative about how her parents bring her up and when I mentioned it, everybody, including the girl herself, thought that I was teasing her. </p>

<p>I had to stop everyone (kind of) to make the air clear, that I actually complemented her parents.</p>

<p>Later, she was able to explain things very clearly, unlike me :(.</p>

<p><strong>So, how to clearly express an idea in a group without confusing listeners??</strong></p>

"Taking space and engaging in casual group conversations","<p>I often have difficulties taking space in casual group conversations, like when I go to the pub after work with a couple of friends or similar, even though I'm completely comfortable with the company.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>

<p>I do generally find casual social interactions challenging, maybe both due to a little bit of autism (but I have no problem reading people) and a lack of experience during upbringing. I'm doing fine with professional, technical communication though, and I'm fine with talking in front of groups people.</p>

<p>I do have issues with small talk one-on-one as well as I never really gotten much stimulation of that kind of superficial chit-chat, humor displays or nerdy discussions that usually goes on. On the other hand I do have a talent of steering the conversations I do engage in to more intimate discussions about life or things that really matter to me or the other person. I can find real stimulation in digging down into people to find the things that make them tick, to see what goals and problems they have in life.</p>

<p>It's not unusual with comments about this like <em>""Wow, I've newer told anyone this""</em>, or <em>""Hey, have you guys started a philosophy club or what?""</em> etc. This is where I'm most comfortable, but I've noticed that other people aren't used to this, and that some are as lost and uncomfortable here as I am with the more superficial chit-chat. Even the ones that at the moment earnestly engage with me in this seem to almost get physically tired after a while, and almost lets out a sigh of exhaustion before going back to chit-chating again.</p>

<p>I also think a lot during conversations, and place weight on my words. I like to think and analyze, I like to understand things. This all most often works in my benefit at for example dates, but...</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>I'd like to function well in the common social situations, like to engage in common fun and lightweight group interactions. This is challenging since these are often fast-paced chit-chatty in nature, with a required dose of humor and nerdiness. I really don't get the dynamics of this, where others seem to fluently navigate in finding and changing topics, inserting jokes every now and then, etc. This leads to me often zooming out, and I feel like Bambi on ice when I try to force my way back into it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think that the best way to describe me is simply that I'm quite boring.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p>I want to learn how to engage in chit-chatty group conversations in a natural way. I need to learn to appreciate it, and I need to learn how to take space instead of just zooming out.</p>

<p>Can you give me some recommendations for strategies for how to go about this? Where do I start? What are the key points to focus on here?</p>

"How can I safely talk with my sister about her health?","<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>

<p>I have grown up in a very athletic household. Every season, a different sport. On vacation, our family would constantly be biking around, swimming at the beach, skiing in the winter, hiking in the spring and fall.</p>

<p>Growing up, I resented this, but today I am incredibly grateful for the passion for sports, athletics, and outdoors that my mother and father instilled in me. Growing up, I was a bit chubby, but now I have found sports that I love, that fit my lifestyle, that allow me to be in good health and great athletic condition. I am happier, healthier, more confident, and more comfortable in my own skin.</p>

<p>My father is an incredibly blunt and forceful type A personality. A leader at work and at home, he expects obedience in all facets of life. He has an idea of how every person around him could change to suit his liking. He is a loving, caring, and good man at heart, but with a very ""my way or the highway"" philosophy. I again used to clash with this during high school, but have since come around to many of his points of view, acknowledging that he is right in many cases, despite his harsh and tactless delivery. Living and interacting with him, I have been forced to learn how to work and communicate around problems I cannot face head on, around people I cannot change.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>My sister is much more like my father. She is strong willed, hard working, intelligent, and motivated. She has always clashed with my father due to their unwillingness to compromise and make peace. She has a good job, a good boyfriend (my father would disagree of course), a good degree, and is happier than ever. However, she has always been a big, much like I was growing up. After high school, she stopped participating in high intensity athletics, and has gained some weight. Out of our family, she is the only one who is not in good shape, the only one who does not participate in high intensity athletics 4+ times a week.</p>

<p>She is obviously uncomfortable with this, and tries hard to be healthy (to limited effect). Every time my sister comes home for holidays, there is conflict on this front. My father will bluntly and honestly tell her that she could lose some weight, that it is unhealthy, etc. This leads to big fights, where my sister will yell about how dare he bring it up, how hard she tries, etc, and my mother will come in to protect her kid.</p>

<p>My father blames my mother for being an enabler, and it hurts their relationship. It obviously hurts the relationship between my father and sister, who otherwise have been getting along much better since she moved out. It hurts my relationship with my father, as this behavior is unacceptable and uncivil.</p>

<p><strong>I do not want to tell my sister what to do. I do not want to tell her how to live her life. I do want to resolve this conflict that is damaging my family</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>

<p>By (the absolutely crazy) American standards, my sister would not be considered particularly fat. However, I am sure she wants to lose weight and be healthier. She has stated to me personally, and to my family at large, that that is a goal of hers. My father wants this, I want this, it would be a good thing. However, I believe this conflict makes it less likely that my sister will be able to make this transition.</p>

<p>I cannot change what my father will do, what he will say, how he will act. It is not feasible, and I do not wish to attempt to due to the conflict it will cause. I don't really know how to move forward. I am worried that any attempt to reach out to my sister on the subject will immediately be interpreted as an action of my father (and she would be right, he has often asked me to take his side) and rejected.</p>

<p>Is there a solution to this problem? I have thought about talking about my own experience, changing my diet, my portion sizes, and finding athletics that I enjoy, but I don't know if it will work.</p>

<p><strong>The easiest solution is for my sister to cut contact with my father. It is what I had planned to do when I was in the same situation. Is there a solution that will not damage our family (however deserving this damage is)?</strong></p>

<p><strong>I'd also like to say that I have been largely silent on the issue, not attacking my sister as is implied in several answers. I would like to intervene, but I do not know how.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> If there is anything I can do to improve this question, please let me know. Please do not downvote without giving me the opportunity to improve my question.</p>

"How can I explain to my partner that my online interactions are important to me to reduce their frustration when I talk about them?","<p>How can I explain, to my partner, that my online interactions, particularly here on Stack Exchange, are important and of value to me with the goal of them not feeling frustrated that I'm ""wasting"" my time?</p>

<p>My partner gets really frustrated hearing me talk about — or even seeing me on — Stack Exchange. It most often comes up in a conversational context. They'll mention something that relates to a question I answered or an interaction I had on Stack Exchange and I'll relate that experience. As in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, I just answered a question about something like that...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they tend to not see online interaction as valuable or relatable as ""real life"" interactions. I would understand simple disinterest in online communities, but disinterest in common causes and topics <em>because</em> they're tied to online interaction seems a little odd.</p>

<p>SE is often meaningful to me because I like the altruism of it. Where else in your day-to-day life do you get to reach across oceans and continents and help someone with a question that's been bugging them?</p>

<p>There's also the community, or social, side of it. Over time you get to know people around the sites you frequent. Occasionally you even grow to like a few of them.</p>

<p>With Interpersonal Skills specifically, it gets a bit more meaningful... for me at least. One of my goals is to be the sort of person that I needed when I was younger. To reach out and help people dealing with some really difficult stuff. IPS gives me opportunities to do that. Offering an answer and a few kind words to someone on the other side of the world who's going through something that I've been through... Well that's some pretty good stuff right there.</p>

<p>I've explained all of this to my partner, at great length, over and over again. They still seem to think that it's a waste of time, and that I could be doing more meaningful things, in real life, like joining an activist/volunteer group, to accomplish some of those same goals.</p>

<p>I've ended up deleting the Stack App and cutting back my time on the network considerably, to be accommodating, and to make my time with them uninterrupted. I figured that it was just a time management issue at first, but it seems like they just don't understand why Stack Exchange is a little different than the usual internet forum and instead see it as a complete waste of time and energy to be involved in <em>any</em> online community.</p>

<p>Is there a polite way to explain why I use Stack Exchange to my significant other in a way that they'll be a little more inclined to accept that it's something that's important/valuable to me?</p>

"How to apologise for not recognising someone","<p>Recently I was at an academic conference where I met a famous academic in my area during the banquet dinner. However, for some reason I haven't recognised the name and the physical figure of the person (he looks different in the picture that usually comes attached in the ""about the authors"" section at the end of a paper). If I had, the discussion would've went to other routes as I have many questions about his work. </p>

"How could I determine if one simply could not or also would not like to go on a date?","<p>I am not particularly good at picking up on social cues, and, regardless, a question of what cues might indicate the answer to my question would be more opinion-based.</p>

<p>For context, I am an 18-year-old male college student in the United States.  She is also 18.</p>

<p>We met a little less than half a year ago during orientation.  We talked some, but I was not interested in her at the time.  When school started about a month later, I noticed that I was running into her rather frequently, and we got to know each other a bit.</p>

<p>I finally decided to ask her out roughly three months ago.  She said that her family would be in town, and, thus, she could not go.  Suffice it to say that this was true.  Now, what I had been planning for us to attend was a monthly event, and some schedule changes of mine made it far less viable for me to attend in the future.  Still unfamiliar with the local area, I could not think of much in the way of a substitute.</p>

<p>I had the same question then as I do now: I was not sure if she would have liked to go in the first place.  I did not want to risk being bothersome to her, so I took a cautious approach and did not reschedule.  Take this as a sub-question: in such a situation, would it be best to try to reschedule the date?</p>

<p>As the semester intensified, my schedule became more erratic, and I saw her far less often.  About a month or so ago, though, she sent me a text out of the blue, and I started running into her a bit more frequently.  After some time, I decided to try to ask her out again.  Having learned from the first attempt, I first checked with her that her schedule was open.  While she initially could not think of any conflicts, she later said that she would be busy with a group project.  Again, this was true.</p>

<p>While it would be nice to know for this situation in specific, I ask in general: what strategies could I use to determine whether one would like to go on a date when an attempt at asking the person out has failed due to a schedule conflict?  Should I attempt to reschedule?  Should I simply ask?  Is there some kind of wording that I could weave into the original attempt that would make an ambiguous situation such as this less likely to result?</p>

"How to stop friends from coming in my holiday house?","<p>I have the following problem:</p>

<p>I own a house near the beach, in which I go only in summer. Every year, friends ask me (or try to manipulate me to invite them) to come and spend their vacations there. I have already invite some of them once (or even twice at some cases).</p>

<p>Every year they tell me things like ""You are so lucky to have a house like that"", ""I was thinking about coming there again"", ""Can I come this year as well?"", ""Can I come because I had never been there and seems amazing?"".</p>

<p>These behaviors literally make me very angry, because I feel like they use me. I haven't said anything until now because I usually avoid confrontation, and also because we are friends lots of years I don't want to tell them something that would deteriorate our relationship.</p>

<p>But at this point, because I feel like that is going to continue forever, I find that is very important to communicate with them that:

b) That it's tiring to have guests every year
c) Stop them from inviting themselves in the future.</p>

"Father have a drinking problem, how to talk to him about it?","<h1>A bit of backstory:</h1>

<p>I am a guy in my twenties and living in quite a family-centric culture. My own family is not necessarily very traditional, however there is still some influence from outside. </p>

<p>My father always had a drinking problem. I was quite severe several years ago with constant fights with my mother and sometimes even with me (I was about 10 at the time). The situation has become more stable in the recent years since he managed to find a decent job, however the root problem of his drinking (which I presume to have something to do with his psychological situation, but its hard for me to judge) has not disappeared.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago he got extremely drunk and was acting quite horribly harassing my mother and being extremely loud. It was very late at night (about 5 o'clock) and the fighting awakened me. I got out of bed and asked my father to calm down, only angering him more. Understanding that nothing I could do would be effective I decided to return to my room.</p>

<p>However my father only became angrier to the point of almost taking down my door. I jumped out of my bed and confronted him, which was probably a stupid idea, but I couldn't bear it. I came through the door and said something in the lines of ""what the hell are you doing?"" and got quickly hit in the face. The blow wasn't too hard (still left a bruise) but I got extremely angry and hit him two times with some force. He calmed down and went to catch some air.</p>

<p>He returned and said he didn't understand why would I want to hit him or why would anyone have something against him. I understand that this went through his mind due to him being extremely drunk but I do believe that this is what he grew to actually believe (that he is actually innocent and I just wanted to fight him). He accused me of being outright evil and a horrible son etc.</p>

<p>After some talking, crying and calming down I thought that hitting him wasn't the brightest idea and when we all cooled down I apologized and so did he, both with teary eyes etc. It looked like everything ended well. We didn't really talk much in the following days but gradually returned to the status quo and everything went well. </p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, I don't know if all the details were actually necessary but I thought the context may be important. </p>

<h1>Fast forward to couple of days ago:</h1>

<p>He again got very drunk it being New Year and all. I tried to avoid him but eventually had to sit down at the table with him, and sure enough in an hour or so he brought up the fight. He said something in the lines of ""a man should not hit his father"" but in a bit more extreme fashion, and accused me of not regretting hitting him. </p>

<p>He also tried to manipulate with my emotions in other ways (which he does when drunk) but  I don't remember what he said. He also rambled on and said that he knows some people (as I understood he meant some ""prestigious"" or ""important"" people) and did not want them to think of his family as a family where a son and the father fight. </p>

<p>It was surprising for me that he brought that up, since it really had nothing to do with the problem at hand and I don't understand why would he even think about it. But I do hypothesize that this may have something to do with some of his insecurities (knowing prestigious people being a status symbol).  I don't know if he truly believes what he says. Anyways the fact that he said it has had a huge impact on me. I'm becoming more depressed and I'm losing any will to talk to him. I haven't talked to him after this incident and it's been 4 or 5 days. </p>

<p>I know that this can't go on, and I will have to sit down with him in the near future but I don't know what to say. I do think that he actually believes at least some of what he says, and that he most certainly doesn't want to admit to himself his own, at least partial guilt in whatever happened. Situations like this happened before and he always comes up with a way to seem innocent at least to himself. </p>

<p>I do believe that he has psychological problems but when my mother told him that visiting a professional might help him, he said that he is afraid of it. He said ""visiting a psychologist would ruin whatever he has built in his mind"" or something like that.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>I think that just talking to him would be fruitless and I do think that he has to first admit having a problem and then agree to work on it. But I think that if I mention this to him he will become defensive and aggressive, which he often does. </p>

<p>So, how do I talk to him about this so that he won't become defensive and will instead (hopefully) agree to work on the problem?</p>

"How prevent repetitions of the same story?","<h1>How do I prevent someone telling the same story again without being rude?</h1>

<p>I once had a neighbour, a lovely elderly lady who was very communicative. The first time we talked  she told me a story about her life as a young girl and how she met her husband. It was a wartime story, very interesting,  and I listened with undivided attention. The problem was, she repeated the same story each time we talked. Stir the conversation into a different direction proved to be impossible. I also tried expanding her subject, asking questions related of the era of her story, but she had no interest in those, only the specific events relating to her. We somehow always returned to her subject.  The lady wanted to tell that story, and not any other.</p>

<p>Some of my coworkers display similar behaviour - they recite stories, usually featuring them in some funny or stressful situation again and again.</p>

<p>Are they <em>aware</em> they had told this story already?  In some cases they must be, for example when their audience recounts the elements of the story with them (' I rememer that one!  Then you told the guitarist - ') but still, it won't stop the flow of the memories. </p>

<p>Reminding them outright that you already heard the story <em>might</em> stop it for that specific instance,  but good chances are that the story will resurface in another week or two.</p>

<p>Is there a way to prevent this behaviour? <em>Should</em> it be prevented at all,  or it's simply the way some people chose to communicate and those stories are integral part of them and an interruption would make them sad or frustrated? Would it better to tell them in case they're not aware, as in some cases coworkers tend to comment behind their backs in the cafeteria ('That bore Polonius was at it again, telling us that dusty anecdote about his meeting with Fortinbras, no one cares that they'd met in 1602.')</p>

"How can I get a drunk person to understand that I don't want to talk to them?","<p>Today I was busing coding/programming in a bar/pub, had my headphones in (as I always do), trying to concentrate on my work.

<p>The guy starts asking me about me laptop - ""<em>oh cool laptop, is that Windows 7, 8, 10?</em>"", to which I politely respond, ""<em>actually none of those, it's a Macbook, an Apple product so it doesn't use Windows</em>."" I was hoping the conversation would stop there. Alas, the guy asks me what Apple is, then starts a conversation about phones and asking me if I know a way to get free (by this he means permanent, and illegal) wifi on his phone.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I didn't want to have this conversation, but I politely diffused by saying ""<em>oh I'm so sorry but I'm not from around here and I don't know how phones and connections work here</em>."" At this point I should mention that I'm American and living in northern France, where random drunken people trying to start a conversation with me (read: a total stranger) is far more common than any other part of the world I've been in.</p>

<p>Long story short, how can I - without offending the person who is drunk - diffuse the conversation into something like ""<em>""I'm sorry, but I'm busy (and not interested in talking to you right now)</em>""?</p>

"How do I tell my parents ""I don't want to go to church"" over the holidays?","<p>This is a little bit of a complicated problem.  My mom and dad are both Catholic, and they have a tradition - every Easter and Christmas, they take the immediate family (themselves, me, and my sister) to Church.</p>

<p>There's just a few small problems: neither me nor my sister get anything from it.  And in <em>my</em> case specifically, the incense they use in church triggers both my allergies and my asthma, which introduces a major health risk (not to mention makes me highly irritable).</p>

<p>There's a secondary issue here: I have a confirmed and diagnosed anxiety issue.  Without health insurance (of which I do <em>not</em> have because I had it through school and I've graduated and don't have any health coverage until I can apply January 1 with my new full time job), I can't get the medication to keep it under absolute control within my budget.  Which means every time we go, there's screaming children, and every time the screaming noisy children make a noise, it drives my anxiety levels up exponentially.</p>

<p>So, the core problem is, I've made <em>many</em> attempts to make it known that:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's a health risk with the asthma and allergies, and</li>
<li>There is a safety risk both to myself and others with the anxiety (which in extremely high amounts can reveal itself explosively), and</li>
<li>I don't get anything from church (I'm in the beliefs category of ""Religion is just a bogus a mythos just to give you 'rules of behavior', and has archaic traditions that are worth nothing to me""; also known as the ""I don't believe in any religion at all"" category), and in addition to forcing me to do something I absolutely do not want to do, making me go is equivalent to torture because of points 1 and 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, in <em>every case</em>, when I bring this up, there's absolutely no 'wiggle room' within my parents to actually <em>accept</em> the points.  They indicate that ""Oh, you can fix the asthma problem just bring your inhaler"", or ""Just suck it up"" for the second point, but point #3 they just completely ignore.</p>

<p>I currently live with my parents, until my apartment is habitable and well stocked with food and stuff, which can't be done until I receive my first paycheck with the full time job I recently got. After January, that shouldn't be a factor, and solves the problem, but until then I'm living with my parents and so this is still a problem.</p>

<p>So, I'm stuck in a dilemma - every time they force this upon me, I become a very angry person for the rest of the day, even if it is twice a year.</p>

<p>How do I go about telling my parents in no uncertain terms ""Traditions be damned, I absolutely refuse to go"" for the above reasons without getting into a ""But this is tradition!"" fight with my parents?</p>

"How to avoid an awkward situation when someone just thoroughly slammed something you like?","<p>To put it broadly, this is about guilty pleasures, that are not accepted in one's social environment. This excludes more serious topics (politics, religion, legal/moral questions etc.). Think of movies, music, sports teams, books and the like.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I refrain from using actual examples to avoid a discussion about them (""But he is right! They are the worst team ever!""). This could be changed upon request, but I don't think it's necessary.</p>

<h1>Situation</h1>

<p>I enjoy music by band ""so-and-so""*. Now I have a nice talk with ""Bob"". Bob is a good acquaintance of mine, and also a real music connoisseur. Somehow, the discussion strays away a bit from positive topics, and he notes the decline in musical taste. His prime example is, you guessed it, ""so-and-so"". So he rants about them, their inferior music, lack of talent, cheesiness etc. </p>

<p>I listen to him patiently. He can't know that I like them. And I get a strong impression that he couldn't even imagine it in his wildest dreams, since he knows that I like the music he approves of. And now, that he finished, he asks me after my opinion on them. </p>

<p>I don't want to lie. On the other hand, his critique is spot on, and I don't have rational arguments to support my stance. The ensuing situation is rather awkward.</p>

<p>*Not an actual band, although a quick google search showed, that there are bands of that name, but spelling differs slightly. But I don't know them.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How to avoid, or at least, alleviate such an awkward situation? How to react to Bob to avoid as much of an embarrassment (for both of us) as possible?</p>

"Girlfriend, vegetarianism and me not wanting to change","<p>Me and Alice are back. This is somewhat related to another one of my questions but more about me this time.</p>

<p>I have planned to visit my girlfriend Alice in a few months, during which I will be staying with her and her parents (they offered), and my girlfriend has asked me to not eat any meat while I'm there. Only her father eats meat regularly (1-2 times a week tops). </p>

<p>She really hates meat, once I sent a picture of my dinner which was beef and potatoes to which she replied ""DISGUSTING"".</p>

<p>I told her that I would want to continue my normal eating habits, but she gets angry at me for not being willing to compromise for just over a week. We discussed this at the start of the relationship, and we agreed not to make each other change our diets. But what I'm afraid of is that if I pull through this time, she'll use it as proof that I don't need meat at all and try to convert me.</p>

<p>During my two previous visits she didn't have a problem with me eating meat (her dad cooked) and even cooking (made a dish from my country) meat for her family (her father and sister ate, Alice and her mother are vegetarian). Also we stayed in Dublin alone for a week and I cooked and ate meat.</p>

<h2>Clarifications:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I will be staying with Alice for a bit over a week. My past visits were only 3-4 days.</li>
<li>She did not say that no meat will be served, merely that she does not want to eat meat. Alice and her mother will be doing most of the cooking, so I assume little to no meat will be present.</li>
<li>I originally reduced my meat intake when the relationship started.</li>
<li>We haven't yet talked about her motivations for wanting me to not eat meat.</li>
<li>Her parents have work and are busy, so I would find myself alone at times with Alice for lunch or breakfast where we would have to make our own meals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The question:</strong> My girlfriend wants me to eat no meat/fish when I'm staying with her. How do I not offend her further but keep to my own diet?</p>

<p>An additional question: If I do go through with this, how do I stop it from snowballing into a full-blown conversion?</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>I messaged her and talked more about it. <strong>We agreed on a arrangement where I consume meat in lower quantities but I would have to buy cook and prepare it myself, she doesn't like to touch and feel dead animals, meat included</strong>(edit).There is some semblance of a compromise on both parts here; does this seem like a good one? I'm afraid that she might be saying this just not to start a bigger argument and I don't want her to bottle up her feelings.</p>

<h2>Update#2:</h2>

<p>After some talking on the phone, she has seemed to have softened her stand on this and understand more about how relationships work (I am her first bf). I have accepted an Answer and I will be having an in-depth and serious conversation with her about this when we meet (face-to-face is way better) and examine the relationship.</p>

"How soon after Christmas should I give a gift?","<p>I postponed buying my brother and his girlfriend a (specific) Christmas gift because I wanted to check if they have already bought it.  Then I forgot about it.  When I remembered, the stores selling it had already closed for Christmas.  At our gift exchange, they did not have a gift for us, but my mother included their names on a gift tag for a present she gave us.</p>

<p>No gift giving rules were established prior to Christmas.  The lack of gifts was not discussed afterwards.  The lack of gift exchange between us breaks with tradition.</p>

<p>I would still like to get them this specific gift that they previously expressed interest in.  <strong>How long should I wait before giving this gift to avoid linking it with Christmas presents or lack thereof?</strong></p>

"How can I convey to people that they spell my name wrong?","<p>My name ends with a 'c', while in the country I live in it is much more often spelled with a 'k' at the end.
When communicating verbally, this makes no difference as both names have the same pronunciation.</p>

<p>However, when communicating via e-mail, SMS, chat or other means of written communication, I often find people misspelling my name as they're used to the more common variant.
I have tried to address this passively, e.g. by including my name in an email signature or in my online profiles. I haven't tried explicitly correcting people. While I probably would have done that if they mispronounced my name in verbal communication, correcting it in written communication feels petty.</p>

<p>While it is a minor detail, I want my name to be spelt correctly. Spelling it this way comes from the family and I want to keep that part.</p>

<p><strong>I'm looking for ways to let people know that I care about my name, and remind them how to spell it in the correct way, while not coming across as petty. How can I do that?</strong></p>

<p>I see this as a different issue compared to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1363/how-should-a-young-person-correct-an-older-person-who-got-his-name-wrong"">How should a young person correct an older person who got his name wrong?</a>, as that deals with getting the wrong name, in-person.</p>

"How should I approach a situation were I said something wrong and somebody else reported it?","<p><em>I'll clarify my question right away:</em></p>

<p>I'm 20, from France.</p>

<p>While drunk at a party organized at a friend's house, I was with 4 friends in a room when somebody joked about a girl I brought: ""Hey, you brought here to flirt right lmao?"", which I responded to (still joking) amongst the line of ""Yeah, of course, but seems like a fail for me so if anybody want's to try she's single"".
Except the people I was with didn't hear what I said, but one of them decided to tell her, which got me in big trouble. I sent a message to the guy who told her because I thought he would be quite embarrassed knowing that he brought me in trouble, I wanted to reassure him that I wasn't mad and we were still friends, etc. This is what I sent: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I'm disappointed that you told her, I was drunk, everybody knows how stupid I am when I'm drunk, it was really not useful to tell her except if you wanted to put me in useless trouble... Anyway I'm not mad a you but we probably won't see each other much as <strong>the girl</strong> is mad at me now and you hang out with her most of the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which he replied to with a really hard tone aswell as insulting me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You'd better assume your shit instead of telling me it's my fault, you clearly didn't seem so drunk and even if you was that's absolutely no excuse to talk like this about a girl which you consider as a ""friend"", especially since nobody asked you to open your mouth at that moment.</p>
  
  <p>All I see is that you are dumb enough to find that disappointing when I tell the main party involved about what you said as she didn't ask anything at that moment as well as being my best friend at the party and in general, and you are searching yourself shitty excuses to make it seem right on top of that.
  I am glad you are not mad at me! You fucked up, not me, if you didn't want her to know you just had to shut your fucking mouth, no need to search further.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find that pretty hypocritical for two major reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The guy wasn't that much involved in our discussion.</li>
<li>I could have 'shut my mouth' but what about him?  It wasn't useful at all to tell her.  I feel like he just wanted to get me in trouble which is pretty weird for someone who's supposed to be a friend.</li>
</ol>

<p>To be honest when I read his response I was so shocked I didn't even knew what to respond so I said something like ""no need to be aggressive, I'm completely against all you said except the part where I fucked up"", I basically responded like he was right.</p>

<p><em>Some background context:</em></p>

<p>I was at a party recently and got drunk, as it was the main reason why this party took place. A bunch of friends (4 peoples) were playing action/truth and I decided to join them. I know 3 of them really well and the last one is more of a guy I know a bit, I did hang out a few time with him and we talk time to time but that's all. The 3 peoples i mentioned earlier have the same relationship with him if not worst (2 of them I don't think they know him that much apart from seeing him a few times). A guy joked about a girl I brought, I joked with him as well, and the guy I'm the less close to decided to tell the girl.
She is really mad at me, and since the said guy responded as he did to my message I'm mad at him now.</p>

<p><strong>What should I do about the guy, how should I approach him as he seems very aggressive? I already apologized to the girl but I'm extremely disappointed by the guy for all the reasons above. We will obviously end up in parties together and even if I don't want to excuse him, I don't want to create more useless drama for my friends, I really need some advice on how I should behave in order no to make my friends uncomfortable.</strong></p>

<p><em>I'm still young and social is clearly not my thing... I don't really have anybody I can ask about this. I would be interested in getting advice from peoples more sociable, mature than me. I'am very open to criticism, I'am the one at fault there is no doubt it, my goal here is to get advice on how i should handle the situation, i want to avoid the guy having troubles with my friends and i want him to know i'am mad but can't figure out how to bring the conversation on the table.</em></p>

"Communicating during sex when my partner doesn't like direct questions?","<p>I would like to preface this question by noting that it contains some very specific details that I think are necessary to make the question clear and not overly broad (and thus more easily answerable). </p>

<p>I'm a bit of an overthinker, and I apparently ask too many questions while having sex with my girlfriend, but to my mind, communication and consent are really important.  For instance if we're making out and mutually touching each other, she gets mad when I ask her if she can perform orally on me.  She literally says ""don't ask it!"" and then proceeds to do it anyway.  And similarly when I'm going down on her, I like to check whether things are going ok and that she's enjoying it, so I ask her ""how does that feel?"", to which she again replies ""don't ask!""  </p>

<p>So I'm clearly having issues with communicating during coitus.  My girlfriend thinks it's too much communication while I think that making sure she's ok during the act (by asking her explicitly whether she is or not) is really important.</p>

<p>How can I tell her that it's just my way of making sure she feels safe during intimacy?  She gets so mad that I ask questions while engaging in sexual acts with her, but at the same time consent is always in the back of my mind.</p>

"What can I do to be a courteous guest, when someone says I don't need to bring anything?","<p>My boyfriend made plans for us to have dinner with two of his friends, another couple. Since I have some dietary restrictions, they've decided to cook at home rather than go out (despite me saying I'm sure there were suitable restaurants around). If it's relevant, my boyfriend will be helping with some of the preparation, but I have work and will arrive just for the dinner. He insists I don't need to bring anything, but I feel like it would be rude to show up empty handed, especially since it seems they are cooking because of me!</p>

<p>This isn't the first time I've been told ""just bring yourself!"", but usually it's with people I know better and expect to see frequently enough to repay the favor. In this case I have only met the guy, once and over two years ago, although my boyfriend has known them for many years.</p>

<p>Things I thought about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bottle of wine / six-pack - they don't drink</li>
<li>Candles or flowers - cliche and out of place (they have a house full of board games and cats, this will be a casual get-together)</li>
<li>Snacks / dessert - unfortunately not possible due to other circumstances, and besides they already have a full menu planned</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course I'll verbally thank them, but they are spending time and money on this.. Is there another way to show my appreciation in a material way at a dinner party? Is it <em>really</em> ok to show up without bringing anything?</p>

<p>But, I have no way indicated any interest in said questions (unprovoked), nor' have I spoke about my diet previously, except with the action of cooking in front of him (I guess?). He's just ""giving me his honest opinion"" apparently. </p>

<p>Anyway, the most recent debate he got quite offensive without realising it and I would like to cut the conversations about my diet off before it begins from now on. I want to do it politely regardless of any offence caused, we're good friends and will continue to be so. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When writing an answer, I'm really not looking for your opinion on dietary requirements (whether you praise it, or criticise it.) I would very much just like to emphasise to my housemate that I'm not looking to answer questions on it. It just seems this time my diet is the topic of conversation. </p>

<p>Also, I'm normally happy to answer questions about my diet (if someone is curious) as much as someone who goes to the gym often would. But, I now know where these questions lead with this particular individual. </p>

"How to get along with an obstructive person who believes her nation is superior?","<p>I obtained qualification Q that is demanded in several European countries. Several countries run programs to recruit Qs internationally and I did apply for jobs in multiple countries.</p>

<p>I did not keep secret that I applied in multiple countries. In country C I was told that having a pending application in another country means that I'm not committed to their recruitment program and I was told that my application would not be pxrogressed until I declare that I'm committed to their program.</p>

<p>Now come the interpersonal skills: based on the suggestive wording I assume that my contact person thinks that her nation C is superior to other European nations and she feels offended that I openly consider other countries rather than (pretend to) admire her country only. She invented administrative excuses why not to progress my application and her boss seems to be happy with these excuses. I'm able to satisfy her fussy administrative requirements.</p>

<p>What could I tell my contact person to make her progress my application? I prefer not to pretend that I admire her nation, because I don't like lying and pretending.</p>

<p>In fact there are many aspects of country C that I value and also many aspects that I don't like. I feel the same way about other countries as well. I also think that having multiple pending job applications is normal, and I plan to commit to the best offer.
<hr/>
<strong>Clarification:</strong></p>

<p><em>1. is your assumption that your contact believes her nation is superior based on anything other than your interpretation of this single interaction?</em><br/>It is based on suggestive phrasings in multiple emails. My assumption might be wrong, but even if I'm wrong I would like to get interpersonal.stackexchange answers for the situation I assume to be in. Whether I misjudge the situation is a question that could be asked independenty, but that's not my current interest.</p>

<p><em>2. what frequency and duration of contact would you have with this person once the application process is completed?</em><br/>I have never met her, I will presumably never meet her. But she is in the position to delay or make my application process difficult. </p>

<p><em>3. what has led you to be so certain that the administrative issues your contact has raised are simply excuses she found convenient?</em><br/>I had questions about the future job that I believe she should be able to easily answer. She ignored these questions and focused on certain forms.</p>

<p><em>4.</em> Recruitment of Qs happens at national levels. I'm only considering 4 countries based on the languages I speak, so giving up on country C is not something I would want to do without careful consideration.</p>

"How to prevent annoying questions from coworker?","<p>My co-worker that has often asked me personal questions is annoying as hell, professionally he is incompetent and I do all I can to avoid, evade, and deflect him, his questions and any kind of interaction with him. I wear my headphones and mind my own business, beyond answering work related questions I try not to even make eye contact, let alone say hello.</p>

<p>This evening I made the mistake of saying have a good night as I thought he was leaving. His response was that he is not leaving, followed by are you married? why don't you have children?, and on and on, implying I have no one to be with (which as true as it is, it was none of his business as we never socialise).</p>

<p>My question is, next time when asked a personal question by this co-worker, in response I'd like to ask him what is his wife's name and when they had sex last? </p>

<p>Maybe if he answers then I can answer his personal questions.</p>

<p>Would this approach be ok?</p>

<p>After reading some of the comments here, what if I just tone it down to ""how is your sex life""?</p>

<p>That is also not a good move, I keep wearing my headphones and not saying anything at all to him. My mistake of trying to have any form of civility.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that in the past I helped this guy with work, ended up doing a job that he keeps asking my manager to do. Every single time he opens his mouth he just tries to screw with me, he has friends that together they never speak English in my presence, and his buddy too likes to screw with me. I have been avoiding both as much as I can, but they continue to screw with me in turns to get a reaction out of me. I love my job and help people, but almost as we get close to Friday they know I am tired and lack the tolerance I have on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Next time I am asked a personal question by these annoying co-workers, I'll be asking them about if they are going to fix up the problem with some work they did, and there are a lot of problems with their work, changing the personal conversation to a professional question that can actually benefit work! :) I have plenty of issues with their work that I have kept my mouth shut not to upset them, but I think that is the language that they understand.</p>

"Primary roommate wants me to give him copy of key to my bedroom and I don't want to","<p>A few months ago I moved into a shared house. Things are great. The area is good, rent is moderate, house itself is good, and I do like the people I live with. However, someone is making a request/demand I am uncomfortable with. </p>

<p>There are 6 people who live in the house and share all the areas with the exception that the bedrooms are private. One of these people is the one who signed the lease with the owner and we pay our portions of rent to him. Let’s call him Bob. A couple months ago I had put a lock on my bedroom door. Just as I was moving in one of the other tenants got kicked out. I stayed out of the situation as much as possible, but apparently he was often late paying rent. However, Bob and another roommate (call him Dylan) had entered his room (presumably to find where he was and ask for rent) and told me they found weapons like guns. I don’t feel like I’m getting the full story as I find it hard to believe someone opens the door and sees a gun right there. So I put a lock on my door because 1) someone got kicked out so there’s a chance he might be spiteful (we replaced the lock on the main door so this is less of an issue 2) according to Bob’s story, he and Dylan entered and possibly searched his room without permission (admittedly they thought they had a good reason) 3) I always prefer having a lock on my door, just as an added level of security.</p>

<p>So now Bob wants a copy of the key to my room. Dylan, who was also present during the conversation, seemed to really want me to give Bob a copy. I asked Bob why and he said encase there’s an emergency and that technically he’s allowed into any room (since he’s the lease holder presumably) but he wouldn’t just let himself in because he’s respectful. When I pointed out I got the lock when someone out was kicked out under questionable conditions, he said part of the reason he needs access to everyone’s room is so he can make sure they don’t have guns lying around or haven’t hurt them self. So to me this is saying he will be searching rooms.</p>

<p>On the other hand, landlord’s usually do have a key to every room. Also my lease is month to month so I want to stay on good terms.</p>

<p>I would like to not give anyone a copy of my key. I may consider compromising, if it’s clear when and who will be entering the room and for specific circumstances.</p>

<p>How can I best approach this without making him feel like I don’t trust him or have something to hide? After typing this, it seems clear to me Dylan is butting into business that isn’t his. He does this on other occasions too. How should I deal with his pressure to give Bob a copy of my key?</p>

<p>Dylan is the only other person in the house who has a lock on his door, and Bob has a copy of the key to it. I checked my contract and it says I have exclusive access to a private bedroom, and says nothing about emergencies or keys. Bob and Dylan had also entered another room when the person had gone on vacation and they thought he left the heat on high.</p>

"How can I pursue a friendship by sending a reply to a mass email without having my intentions misinterpreted?","<p>I recently got a very general “Happy Holidays” mass email from an acquaintance’s work email -- imagine a mail merge with “Dear MERGIE, Happy Holidays from everyone here at Acme Widget Co.” <strong>I am considering replying to the mass email, using it as an excuse to get back in touch with the sender, but am concerned about how that might be perceived.</strong> </p>

<p>BACKGROUND: The sender is a prominent person in our shared field and someone I like personally and professionally. We are of opposite gender and know that both of us have spouses, families, etc. Years ago, a colleague introduced us at a conference and we have since developed a pleasant friendship/acquaintanceship. e.g. Several months after we were introduced, we met for breakfast to talk about a work matter. Over the years, we have sporadically emailed back and forth only on specific professional matters of interest to both of us. In so doing, we have shared pleasantries about children, work, etc. The sender also once spoke on a panel of experts I put together at another conference, mostly as a favor although perhaps in part because the organization is prestigious and offers nice exposure, other professional contacts, etc. We have not spoken or emailed for more than a year, probably because there hasn’t been a reason to reach out. We have never been friendly enough to just “check in” without a reason.</p>

<p>GOAL/QUESTION: I would like to be friends with this acquaintance because I find the person interesting and I have enjoyed our interactions. Actively pursuing a friendship, however, is slightly complicated by the fact that we are different genders and that the other person is more prominent than I am in our shared field (though not the same company). <strong>I wouldn’t want any of my actions to be misconstrued as being either romantically hopeful or professional striving (the work equivalent of social climbing).</strong> Should I just hope that there will be future actual reasons to get in touch and that perhaps a friendship can develop?</p>

<p>I am aware that since a friendship hasn’t happened, perhaps it isn’t meant to be or would need to move that way organically. At the moment, however, I don’t have an organic reason to get in touch. <strong>So can I reply to the mass email, for which the sender might not even remember that I was on the distribution list?</strong> In addition to the other complications noted above, if I use the mass email as a jumping off point to re-engage, might it seem as if I thought the sender was actually sending me individual holiday wishes, which would be both presumptuous and make me look like I didn’t know that it was a mass email? </p>

<p>All I want to do is to make the kid happy and help her have a good time, but I imagine sometimes parents are annoyed by the stuff other people give to their kids. If consulting with parents is not an option, <strong>how do I make sure that I am not creating any trouble by giving gifts?</strong></p>

"Should I tell someone exactly what to say?","<p>This question came about because of a comment someone made about an answer I posted recently. I'm aware that this site deals in specifics but I do feel that the question itself is specific while it pertains to situations generally. Please bear with me while I try to explain.</p>

<p>I was born in the early seventies (I recently turned 46) and so, being a teenager in the '80s and a young man in the '90s, didn't have access to a resource such as Stack Exchange. If I encountered a problem with another person, my options were: 1. ask a friend for advice, 2. read a relevant self-help book or 3. wing it. Imagine this scenario where I'm discussing the issue with a friend:</p>

<p>Me - 'This person really upset me recently. They said some hurtful things. I'm not sure what to do.' Invariably, the advice would be something along the lines of: 'You need to let them know how you feel.'</p>

<p>My friends answer is quite general, but informs me how to proceed. I need to examine how I have been made to feel. I then have a think about how I might articulate those feelings. I would then approach the antagonist, for want of a better word, and tell them what I think.</p>

<p>I see this process of engaging with feelings, articulation, and subsequent confrontation as normal, healthy behavior, which allows me room for growth and an opportunity to feel good about myself for having dealt with the situation in a mature, constructive manner.</p>

<p>Back to 2018! 
If someone asks for advice, whether posted on here or out during my day to day, is it better to provide a general indicator as to how to proceed, or to furnish them with specifics? I wonder if any other 40yrs+ readers have thought about this; that because of generational differences, the very nature of advice giving has changed? Am I wrong in thinking that the ""old"" way was better?</p>

"How to say to my ex that I understand her?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>3 years ago I dated with Clara, my ex-girlfriend. Her situation (borderline personality disorder + Taoism + her own personality and ability) makes her worldview quite unique, and when I met her I had known that what she has in her mind was the key to solve a problem that even contemporary science is struggling with. In fact, one big reason we couldn't work together to solve her black and white thinking was because there is no satisfactory answer to what we saw, not just because of our pasts. On the surface her line of thinking is really sharp and reasonable.  </p>

<p>However, because even contemporary science still struggles to understand it, what she saw was so abstruse that it would take a lot of time to decipher. To understand what she saw, I really need a lot of time to concentrate, and a (dysfunctional) relationship is really a chain. So after 6 months of dating I decided to end it because I didn't see any point to continue.   </p>

<p>In order to have a legit reason to pull the trigger, I decided to intentionally hurt her. By doing so I could control the situation, avoid all unwanted problems, and focus on the ""facts"" that I was inadequate, shortsighted and selfish. This made her feel like it was her to decide to terminate the relationship and have control over me, thus mitigating the disappointment and frustration of trying so hard but still fail (the self-fulfilling prophecy). As how it was planned, the breakup was quick and efficient. She accepted my offer to end the relationship immediately, because she did see that there was an invisible wall that was so transformative that we couldn't analyze it.  </p>

<p>We resonated each other not just because we shared some common interests or personality, but because we both saw ""something"". If one sees something but no one around them can see, then they will have a loneliness that follows them for the rest of their life. In the last 2 years I didn't only live in rumination and resentment, but to research what she actually saw. Her mood would be fleeting, but when it couples with ""that thing"", then even if she had forgotten about it, it's still written in her core, and the analysis will never be outdated.   </p>

<p>Susan, a friend of Clara, said to her that she had never seen an anger of her that could be so long after any breakup. In her previous breakups she forgot right after that. It was Clara who told me this, which I think was an effort to protect me from her anger of disappointing. I can give evidences that she hasn't changed since the breakup, but it's quite private so I guess you have to bear with me on this.  </p>

<p>I have consulted my friends (one male, one female), and they both agree that Clara will come back (with around 70% of confidence, because they don't know Clara in person). Here are the points that I can convince them:  </p>

<ul>
<li>She is a big fan of Zhuangzi, and it was her to say that I was like Zhuangzi, when I knew nothing about him. Now I know who he is, and I claim that anyone can be like him.  </li>
<li>She wished that she could have the courage to face her fears, but she couldn't. If I want to be her role model, then I need to prove that with logic one can fear nothing.  </li>
<li>She said that she wanted to know the difference between real love and pseudo-love. With the new understanding I can now answer that question.  </li>
<li>She wished that she could have had an attitude to life as simple as mine. I had it, but I couldn't explain why I had it, or knew how to transfer it to other people. With the new theory I hope I can do that now.    </li>
</ul>

<p>The reason that I don't fear the relationship would be dead forever is because if my work really has values, then people will help me to spread the words. However, even in the best scenario that it is accepted by the scientific community, then it would take a lot of time to get to her. And if it isn't, then my mission is still completed. I can now verbalize what we see, and can answer what she deeply askes. I don't see any reason to wait longer.  </p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>One year ago I messaged Susan, but she said that there was no hope, that I was not Clara, and that I should have focus on my happiness first. (At that time my research was still primitive, and I hadn't found an effective solution for the rumination and resentment.) For the rest of the conversation she just kept silent (Facebook's messenger ""seen"" status). Recently I've sent her this message:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I now have the answer for the question: ""you are not her, how do you know what she wants?"", and by that she won't be hurt anymore. Do you want to hear?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And she still keeps silent, as expected. It's easy to see the inefficiency of this message: it doesn't prove how I actually understand Clara, only say that I can understand her. It only talks the talk, not walks the walk. But I'm not sure if saying any other message has any more efficient than this. When one want to solve their own skepticism, they have to assume that they are wrong in order to initiate the effort to listen, or else any honest words will be dismissed.   </p>

<p>I don't think trying to answer again is stalking, because stalkers (or any person with fixated thoughts) let their emotions distort their rations. Doing research, on the other hand, requires you to prove you are wrong first before proving you are right. Only with self-reflection that persistence is meaningful and useful to others. If you want to talk about stalking, then look at Einstein, who spent 30 years to build a satisfactory theory without success. Comparing to my situation (2 years with a satisfactory theory), I think I'm more lucky than him.  </p>

<p>Another approach is to contact another friend of her. This is possible, and I do think that if Susan insists to not listen, then this is the only way. But I think there simply exists a way to convince Susan, and thus there is no need to involve other people. An intellectual problem needs an intellectual solution, and that solution always exists if we search hard enough. I'm aware that persistence and stalking can be synonym, and I don't want to see myself be perceived as harassment.   </p>

<p>So, how can I talk to Clara (or Susan) that I understand her?  </p>

<p><br>  </p>

"How do you open/close a friendly personal message to somebody with a terminal illness?","<p>Somebody I have a close but not entirely personal relationship with (think long time boss, landlord, doctor, etc.) was recently diagnosed with grade 3 brain cancer, ending their career.

<li>Wishing you the best! (The best what? Peaceful death? :( )</li>

"How do I let someone I'm romantically interested in know I think we wouldn't work out because I am not straight?","<p><strong>Background:</strong> I was born female and I am hetero-romantic, but I'm starting to think that I might be both <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality"" rel=""noreferrer"">asexual</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderqueer#Definitions_and_identity"" rel=""noreferrer"">agender</a>. I have always been uncomfortable with the idea that I am ""supposed"" to look, act, and feel certain ways because I am female, but I don't want to be male, either. Overall, ""gender"" just doesn't make sense to me. I also find the thought of reproduction absolutely repulsive. I dislike listing myself as something other than straight, and it's a really new idea for me to do that, but using the term seems to help other people understand my position on the whole ...<em>situation</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> Now, I have this straight male friend whom I've known for over 12 years now. I have had a crush on him for at least the last four years, and I am fairly sure he likes me as well. He asked me out once, but I never actually answered him, and we've continued being ""just friends"" since then. We have started seeing more of each other lately, and I'm starting to get the idea that he wants to move things forward romantically.</p>

<p>The problem is, we talk to each other about all kinds of things, and one time our conversation turned to LGBTQ issues and gender dysphoria. He explained that he didn't really ""get"" the whole concept and found it really weird and unsettling. If I had to choose one word to describe him, it would be ""gentleman"". He holds the door open for women, took cotillion classes as a kid, and hopes to someday have a wife and kids. Although I have mentioned that I dislike being called a ""woman"" and the idea of physically having kids, it was always in a semi-joking way, and I don't think he is aware that I was serious.</p>

<p>I really like this guy and I enjoy having someone to talk to with virtually no subjects off-limits. But I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place: either keep a really massive secret from him or risk alienating him. In addition, if he does ever ask me out, should I even pursue a relationship knowing that he will always want someone without reservations about sex or her role as a wife. That is all pretty far away, but it just seems cruel to enter a relationship thinking there is a 100% possibility of both parties being hurt and no chance of achieving the ultimate ""goal"".</p>

<p><strong>Question(s):</strong> Do I tell my friend I think I am not straight? Do I pursue a romantic relationship with him with or without sharing that secret? Should I risk losing him as a friend by possibly breaking up with him later because we are just too different?</p>

"How do I avoid making my friend feels like she has to ""fake happiness"" for me?","<p>Often in my life, I feel like I have to act happy for the benefit of the person talking to me. This happens with acquaintance and coworkers, but also with close family members. So, whenever someone asks me ""how are you?"" I tend to always answer ""I'm fine, thank you"".</p>

<p>Now, I have this very dear friend (let's call her Diana) with whom I talk every day online. We get along very well and share personal details. We both have some days where we aren't doing so well and we both have to deal with anxiety/depression.</p>

"A friend gifted me a relatively expensive present, what present is appropriate for me to give him back","<p>I've been given a smart-watch as New Year present by a friend. I didn't expect it and didn't think our presents are going to be in that higher price range. Now I'm conflicted about what to do. I hate being indebted, so I feel like I must get him a present at least in similar price range. </p>

<p>I wonder though what can be done to prevent such situations in the future - when you are given an expensive gift which forces you to retaliate with something of similar value, even if you didn't budget plan it? Or is it really necessary to do - from etiquette point of view?</p>

"How can I talk about my problems without having people exaggerate their gravity","<p><em>Note: this is not a call for help or anything, I'm doing fine :)</em></p>

<p>I want to open up and talk about my problems, anxieties and depressive periods. The thing is, I'm used to it and it's often not as big a deal as people see them as.</p>

<p>Here's an analogy: imagine someone born with only one arm. When people meet them, the conversation can be something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-Oh you lost your arm? That must be so hard!</p>
  
  <p>-Well I was born with only one arm so I'm used to it, it's fine.</p>
  
  <p>-But there must be so many you can't do! I would be devastated if I lost an arm.</p>
  
  <p>-... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>People tend to compare it to how it would make <em>them</em> feel and not how I feel it.</p>

<p>Another example: sometimes when I'm sleep deprived I will sleep 5h a day during the week. People react very strongly to it, but I need 6h30, 5 hours will seem much worse to someone who need their full 8 hours.</p>

<hr>

<p>The last thing I want is for people to worry and feel sorry for me. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do I open up without making people worry more than that should?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I be factual but make them understand how bad something is compared to <em>my</em> standards, not theirs? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that those people care about my well-being tends to accentuate that even more. Also, the more casual I am when I say things the more they seem to overevaluate how bad they are.</p>

<p>I had to put that note in the beginning because I didn't want you to exaggerate the gravity of my examples either ^^</p>

"How can I help someone over the loss of their dog?","<p>I have a sad situation with my girlfriend; however, I think a bit of context is needed to know for better understanding.</p>

<p>We have been together for 3 months now and I am actually her first real serious relationship (she's 20 and I'm 21).</p>

<p>By “serious” I mean that we both want something real and for the future. That we love each other<br>
(<em>I know I know... Please don't bother commenting how that is too soon for the word *love*. Just trust me on this one</em>).</p>

<p>Because this is her first time (only had one relation before and he cheated on her) it took her some time to get used to that intimacy in public and she was also a little bit scared to let me close in the beginning (emotionally and before we were in the relationship) but that is past now. I think this is important to know for what follows now.</p>

<p>Her beloved dog is getting put to sleep today...The dog had a real happy life and was such a sweetheart. Even I really fell for him really fast. </p>

<p>I know that everybody deals with these things differently and reacts differently... I just want to help her to get through this time. I can tell how hard this is for her. I was at her place yesterday and she really held back crying and tried to hide that fact to me. I don't mind that though. That's her decision and right, I don't wanna pressure myself onto her and so I decided to leave and let her have the last day on her own with the family and the dog.</p>

<p>I told her that I am always there for her and no matter what time she calls me, even in the middle of the night, I will directly drive to her if needed and skip work or arrange with my boss to be at work later. I also said that I would be there to just listen, or talk, or just hold her if that is what she needs and she really just needs to say it, otherwise I decided to give her some space and message her less the next few days (didn't tell her that though). To let her decide if she feels like talking/messaging and let her take all her time she needs to say goodbye and to process it.</p>

<p>However, we originally planned to do something cute/nice on Thursday and Friday. I wrapped my whole head around what I could plan for these days to maybe distract her and make those days just for <strong>her</strong>. I know what she likes generally and would directly know what to plan if not in these circumstances but right now I don't know what to do. To cancel the days, or plan something and if what to plan because of the events...</p>

<p>How can I help her deal with losing her pet? I never had to deal with such a situation since I was alone for the most time in my life (relationship-wise) and only had to deal with the loss of loved ones myself but never had to help someone close to me with such a situation. What can I do if I want to distract her on Thursday/Friday?</p>

"Housemate's boyfriend speak loudly at night","<p>I live in a large shared house and it's a miracle things work as well as they do. There's one problem that's come up a few times and I'm not sure how to address it. One of my roommates has a boyfriend who often visits. He has a really loud voice (actually not so much loud, but very deep so you can hear it through walls). Her room is right beneath mine. Oftentimes they stay up late watching movies and I can hear them talking and laughing (mainly the boyfriend). </p>

<p><strong>What's the best way to address the issue?</strong> </p>

<p>Normally I would just ask someone directly, but since this is a guest of someone else, it seems different. I was thinking of leaving an anonymous note. Should I single him out, as it really is only him who speaks loud at night time, or should I word it as a general request to whisper after night time? What specifically should the note say? My goal is to not be disturbed by his voice while resting and not offend anyone or make enemies with his girlfriend/my housemate. </p>

"How can I help my friend who is depressed and isolated?","<p>I have an old friend who has, over the past few years, gone through several cycles of depression, burnout, and isolation to the point of barely leaving his room. Often I don't find out how bad it's been until afterwards. I'll send him a couple of texts over a period of weeks or months with invitations to hang out and get no reply; eventually he'll get back to me explaining that he had another meltdown, we'll meet up and hang out like normal, and the cycle will repeat. He's especially unlikely to show up for any activity involving more than two people, even just coming over for dinner, despite the fact that my fiancée also really appreciates hanging out with him (he's described it as a periodical social phobia).</p>

<p>Although we've known one another for more than half our lives (we're both 30), our relationship is still developing in the sense that we share more and more of ourselves, unlike when we were younger and only talked about video games, comics and in-jokes (although I do still really value that shared reference base, and don't get it as much from my other friends). On the one occasion that I managed to coax him out on a walk recently (one of only two times in all of 2018), he told me lots of new things, e.g. about how events in his childhood have affected him long-term. Our relationship has also developed in the sense that instead of not answering at all, nowadays he'll answer (after a week or two) that he's currently in a bad state and won't be any fun to hang out with.</p>

<p><strong>I'd like to see more of him, partly for my own sake and partly because I want to help, but I'm unsure how to proceed.</strong> He has other friends, but I don't know any of them, and I'm unsure of how many they are, how close (geographically or emotionally) they are, and how much they see of one another (by the sound of it, right now he's not seeing <em>any</em> other human being). Should I be insistent and try to communicate to him that I don't mind seeing him when he's in a bad place, or should I take a step back and give him space until he's ready to hang out?</p>

<p>Related question: when I do meet him, <strong>how much should I share about my own life?</strong> Sometimes I worry about talking about my career or personal projects, in case I make him feel bad about his own life seemingly not being as on-track by comparison.</p>

He’s also not very good with computers. He told me he got a message that his gmail account had been compromised, and recently his laptop has been acting slow. He went to network and sharing center and noticed that a printer with my name was there. He takes this as a sign that I have access to his laptop (which of course I don’t).</p>

<p>He had a 10 minute conversation with me and was beating around the bush saying things like ""privacy is important in a shared household"". He finally directly said ""I need to know you aren’t downloading files to my laptop"" which I replied no, but I get the feeling he doesn’t trust me and holds prejudice against me.

"How can I get a friend to stop calling me all of the time?","<p>My friend has been there for me through the worst times of my life, and to the point where no one really helped me besides her. She's going through a bit of a rough time now and I've done everything I can to help her. I normally do answer her calls and I can sit on the phone with her for literally <em>hours</em> while only she rants about her problems. But I started grad school and I just can't do it anymore. </p>

<p>She will call me 8-10 times a day. And before I used to answer every time but I genuinely can't now. So when she calls I don't pick up and I politely text her that I'm busy right now and I'll call her when I get a chance. She says okay but then continues to call me profusely. She calls me while I'm in class, even though I tell her every night that I'm in class. She apologizes afterwards but I can't handle this anymore. </p>

<p>She is way too dependent on me and I'm honestly just tired of hearing her problems 24/7. I used to do it but it's been 7 months of the same stuff, and I honestly don't empathize with her. She's suffocating me and I feel like I'm going to explode. I can meet her, spend the whole day with her, and after going home, she will still call me. I used to deal with this but I'm so frustrated now and I don't know how to handle this situation. </p>

<p>She's so so sensitive and I know that if I spoke to her about this, she would absolutely lose her mind (even if I did it in the gentlest way possible). My plan so far is just to keep ignoring her calls and text her saying I'm busy, maybe she'll get the hint after a while (although she hasn't already). And I also feel a little guilt because she was there for me when I needed someone and I needed help in a way I never thought someone would do, so I feel like if I don't answer her all the time, that I'm using her. </p>

<hr>

<p>Some questions answered:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Does she have a job or not?</em> </li>
</ul>

<p>She's not unemployed. She recently found a job after she graduated college last year. However, right after graduation she was hired but then fired because the boss believed she was unintelligent and made too many mistakes. She recently found another job where the boss is making the same criticisms of her and she is getting paid peanuts. She is very upset by this and has been looking for jobs but she never gets any call backs.   </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Does she live with her family?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>She lives with her family. She constantly complains about them as well because they don't support her emotionally but in my opinion every does try to support her emotionally but she just takes it too far and requires too much at a certain point. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>How old am I? How old is she? How long have we been friends and what do we both do?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I just turned 21, I currently have a job as a software engineer and I am in grad school working towards my PhD in pure math. She is 24, has a degree in psychology and is working in a law firm as some kind of administrative assistant. We've been friends for 3 years but only became close over the past year. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Has her mood shifted, was she cheerful before? What triggered this?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>She was cheerful but this past year is when we got really close. She wouldn't have opened up to me this much last year. What triggered this was some friendships ended in her life. She took it so badly. These girls who were her friends gave her advice on how to potentially find a guy because all she complains about is how ugly she is and how much guys don't want to be with her, and she was offended and then they stopped talking to her and she hasn't gotten over it since. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Do you think she is depressed?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I do think she is depressed, I suggested seeing a therapist (as I do) and recommended her to my center. She started going but she complains about the therapist not seeing eye to eye with her there as well. 
I have spoken about this with my therapist but he hasn't advised me of anything yet, maybe I will ask him next session. I don't think she is a threat to herself at all but she will just get even more depressed.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>How does the stuff she's done for me compare to the stuff I've done for her?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't know how to compare but I think they are about the same level but I just feel so indebted to her because I never had someone care so much to help me that much from late night outings to holding me while crying. Granted, I've done the same for her but I still feel bad.</p>

<p>I went to one of the bedrooms to store my luggage and swiftly opened the door. Bob hadn't <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/4872/how-do-i-announce-my-presence-to-someone-who-is-not-aware-of-it-without-frighten"">heard my steps</a> and was masturbating. For sure, I was quite surprised when I saw him and he was startled. I immediately closed the door and went into the other bedroom.</p>

<p>He kept some distance from me for the rest of our stay, as if he was ashamed
(blushing when he became aware of me, avoiding eye contact etc.). Apart from that, we interacted normally, so no one else probably noticed something. My reaction was to not talk about the incident and act, as if nothing had happened. </p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>My goal is for Bob to feel comfortable and not ashamed and to get over it soon.</strong></p>

<p>I do not have a problem with what he did and don't think, that we should make a mountain out of a molehill. But I got the feeling, that for Bob it must have been very uncomfortable, because I ""caught"" him literally pants down and he is a bit shy (I imagine it would have been easier had a male relative surprised him).</p>

<p><strong>What would have been a good response to the incident?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure, if my reaction (acting as if nothing had happened) was the best. What are better approaches to ease Bob's pain?</p>

<p><sub>On a note: Since he is not part of my immediate family, we see each other irregularly.</sub></p>

"When to open a gift / present given in person","<p><strong>Question:</strong> When given a token gift in person (say a housewarming present or a thank you card), is it generally expected that it will be opened immediately in the presence of the giver and discussed, or just acknowledged gratefully and put aside for later? Does it matter if the gift is likely to contain money (or equivalent)?</p>

<p>(<strong><em>Edit</em></strong>: cultural context is USA. This happened to be at work, but I am not looking for <a href=""/questions/tagged/work-environment"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;work-environment&#39;"" rel=""tag"">work-environment</a>-specific answers.)</p>

<p>Either way, as both giver and receiver, I have seen experienced moments of awkwardness during such an exchange when both parties aren't on the same page. Aside from the social setting, it seems to depend on whether others are around (and how many), and the need to balance demonstrating interest in both the gift and the giver - ""I really appreciate <em>you</em> thinking of me"" vs ""let's check out what I just scored.""</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> Today at work I was given a personal thank you note (with small but non-trivial gift card) from a coworker for putting in some unpaid time helping with a difficult client. I made eye contact, said thank you, and set the card aside on my desk while we continued discussing the remaining work for a few minutes, but noticed the other person glance at it once or twice, then they mentioned ""hope you like "" as we started to part ways. I felt like I hadn't quite met their expectations in my initial response, and assured them I did and would likely use it soon.</p>

<p>I feel like the exchange was normal and that neither of us felt awkward about it, but since I happened to have this site pulled up<sup>1</sup> I thought I'd do a quick search for similar questions. Didn't see anything similar so I thought put up the question and see how most people would expect to handle something similar.</p>

<hr>

<p>In contrast / for discussion, at an event where presents are customary from many people at once (e.g. birthday party or wedding reception), there is often a table reserved for placing gifts during the proceedings. Often gifts go directly onto the table with a card naming the giver, and presents handed to the recipient are generally met with a smile and a ""thank you"" before the present is placed with the rest.</p>

"Online conversation vs face to face interaction","<p>There are a lot of articles out there about the dangers of internet and some of them talk about the fact that online interactions are nothing compared to face to face conversation. Those sort of articles often say that online conversations can't fulfill the emotional needs you have and that people should talk to their friends in the ""real world"".</p>

<p>Recently, I was reading those article and saying to myself: ""if they say so, it might be true"". However, I now have a really dear online friend with whom I talk every day online and I'm wondering ""is this really true?"".</p>

<p>So, is there any <strong>serious</strong> research comparing a deep online friendship (with instantaneous one on one messaging) vs a ""face to face"" one? And some explanation as to why an online conversation isn't as fulfilling as a face to face one?</p>

"Partner reading my phone messages","<p>My girlfriend and I are 27-28 years of age. Recently I have caught her going through my phone when I am out of the room and read my text messages, e-mails, Facebook..., checking who I was interacting with and so on. She must have seen me entering my PIN. I told her I did not appreciate this and would like her to respect my privacy. I caught her twice doing this.</p>

<p>Whenever I confront her she gives me the </p>

<p>argument. As someone who works in information security and encryption, this argument sounds nonsensical to me. And I could actually have something to hide! Nothing bad of course, but let's say I just bought tickets to something I wanted to surprise her with.. Or if I have a confidential talk with a friend, my girlfriend would instantly know about their 'secrets'. Apart from this, I hate the feeling of being monitored and supervised.</p>

<p>In any case, I believed I was in the right condemning this behavior until recently when a friend of mine told me his girlfriend did this all the time and he did not make much of it. Of course, this is just an anecdote, and a sample size of 1 means nothing, but I started doubting.</p>

<p>Am I in the right or in the wrong? Did I overreact? Does a partner have the 'right' to do this?</p>

"The etiquette of holding foot traffic up to take a photo in public?","<p>Is there a general consensus that I'm not aware of regarding the etiquette of holding foot traffic up to take a photo in public?</p>

<p>This is most apparent where it is a group photo with a public monument in the background, the photographer maybe 2 to 5 metres away usually perpendicular to the general flow of foot traffic on a sidewalk. Thereby causing an invisible but apparently socially powerful barrier to passage.</p>

<p>It seems that the bigger the group, the more pressure there is not to interrupt it. Often happening around public venues/concerts, places of interest, university graduations, public transportation. <em>Busy</em> places.</p>

<p>Personally, unless the photo is clearly about to be taken, I just walk through the foreground. Otherwise, experience has made it clear that there is always some reason not to take the photo 'quite yet', and you'll be waiting for someone to adjust settings on the camera, get the group to huddle more, someone's missing, so and so's phone just rang etc.</p>

<p>What prompts this question is that I think I may be in the minority? Other folks will stand and wait (!), to the point that there is an impenetrable barrier of actual people that I cannot get through even if I wanted to.</p>

<p>Often the photographer will be gracious at the end, but often enough there is <em>zero</em> gratitude and they simply 'allow' the people who have been waiting to continue their way - which is rude, in my opinion.</p>

<p>When should one wait to cross and when should you just go?</p>

"An extremely confrontational person knows I blocked them, how to avoid confrontation?","<p>I have a friend X who I have had to block on all social media after they have proven themselves to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>intense and demanding (A)</li>
<li>trying to upset me (B)</li>
<li>emotionally manipulative (C)</li>
<li>having angry and aggressive overreactions to assumed slights (D) </li>
<li>extremely confrontational (E)</li>
<li>angrily blames other people when they are at fault (F)</li>
<li>a history of behaving this way towards others (G)</li>
</ul>

<p>X noticed that I blocked them and confronted our mutual friend MF about it. Demanding to know what they had done to upset me because as far as they could see we were great friends. MF managed to evade the questions saying that we hadn't spoken in weeks. MF is due to move home again soon and I worry that X will continue to pressure them for information when they return - knowing that MF will see me as soon as they arrive. </p>

<p>I also worry that I will see X at events based on our mutual interests and they will confront me publicly in an aggressive and angry way [as before] as to why I blocked them. </p>

<p><strong>I don't know what to do when I will see them in public. How do I avoid confrontation? Or what is the best way to disengage from confrontation with an extremely confrontational person?</strong> </p>

<p>The key points are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially this was a primarily remote friendship which evolved from X being reverent to intense, demanding and controlling over the course of about a year.</li>
<li>We have had <em>one</em> in person interaction - X was obnoxious, negative, complaining, angrily overreacted to playful attempts to diffuse conflict, ruined the event we attended, overstayed their welcome in my home by 9 hours, easily the worst guest I've ever hosted, and was angry at me for being too frightened to ask them to leave.</li>
<li>X is unreasonable and thinks that everyone else is being unreasonable [landlord]</li>
<li>X regularly tries to upset me in conversations, ignores me when I say no, is relentless in trying to make me do what they want. </li>
<li>Has previously shouted at me in front of a room full of my friends so seems to not have a problem with public conflict.</li>
<li>X has recently moved to my city and I could run into them at any time - I have had two close calls so far and in both contexts I was in disguise.</li>

"How do I handle being seated at an unacceptable table at busy restaurant?","<p>My friend and I went to a nice restaurant the other night (about $20 per entree). It was busy and we had to wait a good 15 minutes and there were people waiting behind us as well.</p>

<p>The host took us to our table but it turned out to be right next to the bathrooms and I really don't like that so I asked if we could get a different table but was told no because the restaurant was full, and the host was not very nice about it either, which was kind of embarrassing to me.</p>

<p>I thought about asking if we could get back in line and wait for a better table but I couldn't come up with the words to do so, and being turned down for that as well would have made the situation much worse and I'm not sure if they have a procedure for that and the whole procedure would be awkward as well. I didn't want to disrupt our evening so we just sat down and had the meal.</p>

<p>I really didn't enjoy the dining experience as people kept walking right next to our table going in and out and we could hear flushing noises and it was just uncomfortable. I was kind of annoyed to have paid so much (bill came to $70 after everything) for such a poor experience.</p>

<p>At the same time I understand that under the circumstances the restaurant is not to blame. But then why did they put a table there to begin with? I doubt anyone seated at that table enjoys their experience.</p>

<p><b>Edit</b></p>

<p>The question: How do I insist to get a different table or be re-inserted into the wait queue so as to get the next available acceptable table?</p>

<p>I'm thinking that as we arrive at the table instead of sitting and taking the menus from the hosts I might say ""I'm sorry but this table isn't going to work for us, I'd prefer to wait for the next available table after this one.""</p>

<p>Could someone with restaurant hospitality experience say how this would go over, whether a procedure exists for this? I'm imagining being walked back to the front and the next people seeing us and then being upset when they get to the table...</p>

"How to get to know a service staff without interrupting her work?","<p>On friday night I was out with some friends of mine, we often go to a hookah lounge (which are quite common here in germany, I don't really know about other countries - basically you can smoke hookahs, have some drinks and enjoy your company with your friends).</p>

<p>There was this new service staff, which seems to be new since I've never seen her before. To me, she was stunning. Still can't get her out of my head. So my goal definitly is to get to know her. The question is, how do I do this, without interrupting her work?</p>

<p>This lounge, as the name suggests, isn't really oriented like a bar or something similar. Basically there are many couches where you can sit with your friends. There is like a counter, where you can order drinks but usually the staff just comes right up to you if the notice your empty glasses. Also, in most cases, it's not possibly to stand at the counter without annoying other customers, because there are couches in front of that counter too.</p>

<p>As I said, I dont want to get in the way of her serving other customers. I don't want her to get in trouble with her boss.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Edit (forgot to include that information):</p>

<p>Atleast I already know her name. A friend of the friends I was with there knows this girl quite well. But I've never seen him or the girl ever before, so I can't just go ask him or something :/</p>

"How do I politely let a professor know she has offended me?","<p>I am very seriously religious, but never mention it to others because I notice it makes them uncomfortable. Plus, I don't want anyone to feel that I am telling them my beliefs are more right than theirs and hurt their feelings. If I feel someone <em>else</em> is overstepping their boundaries, I usually either joke to change the subject or ask them a question about why they feel that way, so they realize I'm a little bugged and (hopefully) drop it.</p>

<p>However, two times in the past few years, I have had professors step over the line in the middle of class. The first time, I had a professor who had told the class several times that she converted from my faith because she thought its tenets were wrong and she felt it too oppressive. On this particular day she told the class a ""fact"" about what my faith holds which I knew to be wrong. I raised my hand and mentioned that I was ""pretty sure that xx's <em>do</em> believe yy"". The teacher asked me how I knew, and I said I learned about it in a class (true, just very vague about circumstances). She then said that she knew I was wrong, and several other students chimed in to support her position. During the rest of class, she kept harping on this idea and mentioning how she had converted because of ""wrong"" ideas such as this one. I started to feel really bothered about the negative way she was portraying my religion, but I never said anything to her.</p>

<p>The second time, a different professor had been similarly clear about how she disliked my faith, except she cited the fact that people of my religion had often oppressed her/tried to convert her/mocked her ideas/etc. She generalized this to the idea that people of my faith tended to impose their ideals on people of hers, rather than just her. Her most popular examples were where coworkers ""insulted"" her and she mentioned the fact to a supervisor.
 (Tangentially-related: She was also very political and often encouraged students to go to rallies in support of her chosen political candidate or position. Other students would sometimes mention before she came in the room that they felt unable to share their ideas politically because she might dock their grade for being ""wrong"" or insulting to her.) Again, I stayed silent but was seriously bugged. There was never a specific time when she said something <em>objectively</em> wrong, so I never felt justified in speaking up.</p>

<p>I was so bothered at one point that I went to a support group for my faith on campus. They actually mentioned (without anyone bringing it up) that they intended to have discussions throughout the year about the anti-xx sentiments on campus. The group leader mentioned how uncomfortable moments could be great opportunities to reexamine and strengthen one's own faith. Not surprisingly, they did not come up with a miracle cure-all for the discomfort part at that single meeting.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> If this happens in the future, <strong>how do I ask someone in a position of authority to stop talking about my religion?</strong> I don't want to tell them my religion (I feel like it will lower me in their estimation, or put my objectivity into question) or convince them to change their ideas. I also don't want to seem aggressive and get reported to a conduct board. However, I don't want to fight back tears and I just can't seem to toughen up to the point where I can calmly do nothing. Is there any action I can take to make class (or another situation) more bearable?</p>

"How to tell my roommates that I want to move out ASAP when they say they rely on my rent?","<p>I recently graduated from college, out of state from my hometown, and got a job here. A friend of mine and her husband offered to let me stay with them for very little rent until I could find a place of my own. They recently bought a house and had a lot of unexpected financial struggles this year so the money has been helpful to them as they pay off their debt.</p>

<p>I want to move out as soon as possible. </p>

<ul>
<li>I don't like having roommates at all</li>
<li>This friend in particular is very hard to live with (gross habits, controlling, doesn't respect personal space, demands constant attention, walks around undressed -- and I am expected to be okay with all of this because it's her house after all)</li>
<li>They fight a lot</li>
<li>Most importantly my dog can't stay here so I'm having to pay for him to stay on a farm with another family where he spends most of his time outside in the rising summer heat in a city 45 minutes to an hour away from me.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently found an amazing apartment complex to apply for that will accept my dog. They have apartments available at the end of this month, the end of August, the middle of September, and the end of September. My friend and her husband went with me when I picked up my application and took a tour, so they know what move in dates are available and were very vocal about wanting me to wait until the end of September because ""we need your money"". I told them I needed to move quickly because of my dog but they still insisted I should wait until the end of September.</p>

<p>While I am sympathetic to their financial struggles (I have my own), I can't stand living with them anymore, and I am worried about my dog being so far away from me and outside in this heat. I want to move out at the end of this month.</p>

<p>I am submitting my application tomorrow. Basically I've thought of 3 solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I apply for the apartment available at the end of this month. Assuming I get in, I pay them for August's rent as an apology for not giving them enough notice.</p></li>
<li><p>I apply for the apartment available at the end of this month, Assuming I get in, I tell my friend and her husband, [don't pay for August] and apologize for not giving them much notice, but remind them that this was always supposed to be a temporary situation and that I need to consider my dog and my needs first.</p></li>
<li><p>I apply for the apartment available at the end of September. I find another temporary home for my dog where he can be inside and just suck it up until it's time to move.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Am I obligated to stay longer because they are entitled to more than a few weeks notice? If not, how do I say I'm moving out without causing a lot of drama? I have not signed any kind of contract or lease.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I was approved for an apartment and am moving in at the beginning of August. I told my roommates that I will pay the full rent for August even though I'll only be there 4 days and they were satisfied with this arrangement.</p>

In the following weeks he told me multiple times to send the pictures and every time I forgot to do so (I understand completely that this is bad and that I should have sended the pictures when he aked me to).

"How to avoid looking/sounding unfriendly when I don't speak the same language as everyone at work?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I moved to Denmark a bit more than a year ago - from a Western Europe country. I originally did not plan on staying there more than 6 months. For that reason, I did not start learning the language right away. I started learning the language less than 6 months ago. I am really willing to try and am making quick progress, but it is still difficult and I struggle with it.   </p>

<p>About two months ago, I started a internship in a local company. The majority of the employees are Danish. Therefore, most of the people-to-people interaction happens in Danish.  </p>

<p>This is the first real work experience I have that matches my studies and my first work experience in this country. It seems like a lot of things differ from where I come from - here in Denmark it is less formal and more relaxed, from what I have seen.</p>

<p>I am a very shy person. I repeat every sentence in my mind a lot of times before actually saying it. I can do a bit of small talk if someone speaks to me, but I often can't bring myself to talk to someone first. Sometimes I would like to say something to a coworker - not work related, just for the sake of getting to know them as they interact a lot with each other - but simply can't bring myself to do so. When this happens, I usually end up not saying anything because it makes me feel uncomfortable. For work matters, I manage to force myself but it requires a lot of thoughts and stress.</p>

<p>If you exclude the fact that I am very shy, I also take a deep interest in people and really like social interaction (especially 1-to-1 conversation). I enjoy talking with anyone as long as they initiate the first talk(s).</p>

<p>When my coworkers talk to me, they use English. Most of the time it is work related. When it is not, I manage to continue the conversation a bit and do some small talk. All of them have a good level of English and they hired me knowing that I don't speak Danish.</p>

<p>My colleagues interact with each other in Danish. Our weekly meetings are in Danish - myself being the only one talking about my work in English. They have lunch all together and have conversations together at work and at the coffee machine. They sometimes have cake and coffee together, thus resulting in conversations together.</p>

<p>I had lunch with them a few times, but it resulted in me sitting with them and not understanding what they were talking about,  which was uncomfortable. I now have lunch with other non-Danish friends in the same building. This might be a bad move from my side, but I really was feeling too uncomfortable.</p>

<p>When my co-workers are having a group conversation - or any conversation in Danish - I feel like I would love talking with them, but it would be rude to interrupt their conversation to switch it to English. It happened a few times that I sat for 30 minutes in a meeting without understanding more than a few words, and that I ended up leaving the meeting without a clue of what was going on.</p>

<p>After about two months of work, I still don't know what many of my co-workers are working on. Some days I don't speak with anyone apart from the general ""good morning"" and the general ""have a nice evening/see you tomorrow"", because no one speaks to me. One day, I did not congratulate a coworker that had birthday. The reason for that is that the person was having a conversation with 3 other people and I could not bring myself to interrupt them. After that conversation, the co-worker left. I feel bad about this since.</p>

<p>We are a small team - about 10-15 people - and I am worried that they might find me unfriendly, or might think that I have no interest in talking to them.</p>

<p>I don't know how much that would be relevant in Denmark, but all of the people in my team are from the opposite gender. Also, as I understood it, small talk with co-workers seems to be quite important here. I also got the impression that some of my colleagues were uncomfortable when I did try to have some small talk with them - the co-workers I am talking about also seem shy.</p>

<h1>My questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is there a way to know if my concerns are valid and if my coworkers do think I am not interested in speaking to them?</li>
<li>How should I behave to make them understand that I am just shy and not ignoring them?</li>
<li>How could I have more interactions with my co-workers without making them uncomfortable?</li>
</ul>

"Should I overlook a family member ogling my wife, or confront them in hopes it will stop?","<p>Over the past several years I've observed my brother-in-law (my wife's sister's husband) ogling my wife. In the most extreme case, he watched her change into her swimsuit through the window of a motor home. In more typical scenarios, he seems to find an excuse to approach her while she's in a visually-vulnerable situation (i.e.: nursing, swimming, etc.), and linger. It may be relevant that he is flirtatious, although my wife does not respond to it (not intentionally, although it seems he may have taken some of her actions as responses).</p>

<p>While I initially thought it may simply be coincidence, and tried hard to come up with other explanations (for my own peace of mind), I've observed enough obvious ogling occurring to accept that this is intentional. I doubt he would never cross the line of touching her or worse - this question is just about the ogling &amp; flirting.</p>

<p>Here's the twist: my wife has only seen (or accepted) that it happened once (possibly due to her wishing so badly that it was not occurring, as it hinders her relationship with her sister). My wife's parents have never seen it either (they are wholesome, conservative, Christians, who would be shocked by it; but who also may be blind to it). To my knowledge, everyone else in her family regards the man in question as upstanding, and above reproach, and would never think he would do anything of the sort (he is, after all, a pastor). It is making me think I'm crazy... could I be mistaken about what I've seen?</p>

<p>Should he be confronted in order to pursue family unity, or is ogling harmless?</p>

"How to ""break up"" with my toxic parents/family?","<p>this is quite a long text but I think it is necessary to get an insight of where my motivation is coming from and why I want to ""break up"" with my parents.</p>

<h3>The Fight I</h3>

<p>A couple of months ago there was a huge fight between me and my parents:</p>

<p>My grandfather offered me to buy his old car for a very good price (~50% off of its current value) because we were expecting our second child and were looking for a bigger car. Everything was fine until my parents stepped in and told me that if I would buy the car for half the price I would also have to pay my siblings. They argued that my grandfather was giving me half a car for free and this would be unfair to my siblings.</p>

<p>Although I completely disagreed with them (and still do) I turned down the offer since I didn't want my family to be fighting over a car. So while I  turned down I told my grandfather the reason why I could not buy his car. I did not exaggerate anything or discredited my parents. However he eventually got mad at my parents for interfering in this situation, but he accepted my decision and everything seemed fine.</p>

<h3>The Fight II</h3>

<p>A couple of days later my parents furiously called me and acted like it was my fault that my grandfather would not talk to them anymore because I ""falsely discredited"" them. They also told me that my grandfather was totally devastated and was kind of physically suffering from ""my lies about them"". They told me I should call him and ""make things right again"".</p>

<p>I was shocked and after that talk with my parents I immediately called my grandfather again. He seemed really fine and told me that he wasn't able to pick up the phone the day my parents called because he was busy in the garage.</p>

<p>I texted my parents that everything seemed fine with my grandfather and I have no further interest in discussing this car topic anymore.</p>

<h3>The aftermath</h3>

<p>I did not get any reply on this text message. At least three months my parents would not communicate with us. But I was not contacting them either since I needed some time to think about what happened.</p>

<p>I asked myself:</p>

<ul>
<li>What did I wrong?</li>
<li>Why do my parents always play the ""victim""?</li>
<li>Why does it seem that my parents don't care about their grandchildren?</li>
<li>How could they possibly be mad at me?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions were omnipresent in my head and I finally read a book on <em>Transactional analysis</em> (""psychological games"") since I was searching for answers to my questions.</p>

<h3>The realization</h3>

<p>And then it hit me hard: These ""games"" were accompanying my whole life. I remembered more and more similar situations were I always ended up as the ""bad guy"" and had to apologize to my parents (or otherwise they would ignore me). This realization felt really good and sad at the same time. But I eventually decided to cut my parents out of my life for the sake of me and my family and this decision felt good..</p>

<h3>The drawback</h3>

<p>Around three months later my parents called me (they had to because of a family related issue) and acted like nothing had ever happened. I was fine with this strange behavior since I already decided for myself to not ""play those games"" anymore. I was friendly and we chatted for some time and eventually hung up. This was the last time we talked on the phone. I have currently no urge to talk to them.</p>

<p>Now my siblings call me on a regular basis and ask me what is wrong with <strong>me</strong>.  They tell me that my parents keep asking about me and my family and that they are ""totally suffering"". This of course makes me sad but I am not quite sure if they might play the victim card again. They just could call me and they know it (because I told them).</p>

<p>My siblings can not understand me at all. For them I am just acting tough on my parents because I didn't get the car. But I just want my peace and freedom from all of this. When I tell them about my realization (""psychological games"") they tell me that I am ""brainwashed"". They just won't leave me alone.</p>

<h3>The final question</h3>

<p>How can I tell my family in the most politest and sensitive way that I am not interested in participating in the everyday family business anymore?</p>

<p>I want them to know that I am not angry at anyone nor do I want anyone of them to feel bad because of me. Is it irresponsible of me to break up with them?</p>

"Dealing With Unwanted, Repeated, Public Advances","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Meghan, a member of a close friend group, is pushing me to attend an event with her via repeated, public statements. I find these confusing, distracting, and would like them to stop, with minimum bridge-burning required.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>This year, I began to take a class at my college, the class in particular being a rather small one (about 20 people). The gender ratio in the class is fairly skewed, with 4 males, of which I am one, to 16 females of which... let’s call her Meghan... is one. We’ve become a fairly tightly knit group, as we’re in a very high level class in a minority major at our school. </p>

<p>Problems only began to emerge a couple weeks in. There is a social event toward the end of the year that is a highlight of most people’s school year. It is not mine. I find no enjoyment from these sort of social situations, as I am introverted and do my best to avoid this sort of situation. I consider my aversion to be fairly unimportant, just a facet of my personality, but my class does not agree, most of all Meghan. They feel like I am ‘missing out’ on something or other from these social events. I do not feel the same way, and I do not foresee that changing. </p>

<p>Meghan disagrees with me on that as well. About two weeks into the semester, I had to wear business attire for a meeting, and I was running late for class, so I showed up in the attire. Toward the end of class, Meghan asked in front of the class of that was what I would wear when I took her to the event. I was confused, but the entire class found it humorous, so I just responded I was not attending the event, and as such wasn’t taking anyone, and carried on. About a week and a half-ish later, she made a comment about her taking me. Yet again I was confused, and was wondering why she mentioned it in front of the class. I repeated my denial, and carried on. Two more weeks pass, and she takes the tact of texting me, asking if I would ever reconsider not going, and taking her instead. I responded that, should I change my mind and attend, I would consider taking her; after all, why not? If my opinion on something as fundamental as that shifted, my thoughts on who to take would likely have shifted as well. She found this answer quite satisfactory, and left me alone, for the most part. Now, several weeks passed following this without event, however she did make one more public comment, about a week ago, just something passing about the event. I also recently was accepted into a quite prestigious program for our subject, but it didn’t occur to me I should mention it to anyone other than the Professor. But when I made an off handed comment to it about the class, I got a rush of congratulations, and Meghan made a comment in a loud, nigh-mocking tone, asking why she didn’t receive some sort of heads-up. This I didn’t get at all, and responded truthfully- the only people I had told were relatives, those that helped me with my application, and someone I know in that program. She falls into none of those categories. She responded with an ‘Oh, alright,’ but obviously was not satisfied with the answer.</p>

<p>I’m not used to this sort of attention. I’ve never given much thought to my appearance, I’ve always considered myself fairly average in that regard. However, as a quite private and introverted person, I don’t appreciate these repeated public advances: they don’t really serve a purpose (from what I can see), I’m very unlikely to be swayed from my position, especially by arguments of this sort, and I’d appreciate it to stop. However, I have no idea how to broach the subject of halting these public displays. </p>

<p><strong>Possible Answers?</strong></p>

<p>I would not like to burn bridges, I would just like to stop these displays. An ideal answer would show an Interpersonal Solution that would</p>

<ul>
<li>Result in the cessation of the public display, or at least encouraging a more private display</li>
<li>Effectively explain to Meghan I don’t want to attend the event, and that’s unlikely to change</li>
<li>Avoid burning bridges or forming a rift in my class- it’s a tight knit community, and I don’t want it to fall apart due to my action</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you, I appreciate any answer, and I hope to clear this situation up.</p>

"Someone keeps bugging me to come in for a job interview. How to politely decline?","<p>I'm in between jobs at the moment and have some temp work I've been doing to pay the bills. Often time's I work with, or at least see, the same people. The other day someone started asking me all of these interview questions. It was very sudden. The questions were uncomfortable, especially since we were eating lunch at a table with other people. The questions were like 'on a level of 1 to 10, how hard of a worker are you?' and 'if you got paid double, would you work twice as hard?'. He then revealed he's a manager at another company he works for the has a product related to smart homes. </p>

<p>At his request I added him on LinkedIn and we exchanged phone numbers. He's been pestering me by text to set up an interview with him in the next few days. I've been busy with my other work and haven't had a time to look into his company but based on the way he's acting it's a scam.</p>

<p>Given that I probably will run into him again at our 'other job', how can I politely tell him I'm busy for the next little while but will get back to him if I am interested? BTW if he's doing the same temp work I'm doing, he's probably lying about being a manager for another company (I haven't checked out their website yet but just by the over eagerness he had in hiring a random person I'm suspecting it's a scam).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm not sure when I'll be free to come in for an interview</p>

<p>Would just have him continue to text me each day asking.</p>

<p>Also, a little aside, but what's a good way to respond to someone asking these types of interview questions when you're not actually at an interview? </p>

"What should one do when occasionally meeting an acquaintance of theirs with other people being with any of you, potentially unfamiliar with others?","<p>If you stumble upon an acquaintance, then it is normal for you to have a short conversation, or perhaps even spontaneously plan to do something together right away. But if there are people with you who don’t know your acquaintance (or anyone who is with them) or people with them who don’t know you (or anyone who is with you), this is, of course, a whole different kind of situation.</p>

<p>What is the most correct way to behave when it happens? Should you say hi to your acquaintance, or a slight smile is sufficient? Should you have even a 10 second long conversation, or is it better to try to avoid it all? And if they try to talk to you (and this is obvious to you that there are people with you who start to feel uncomfortable), what should you do to politely stop them from having a conversation with you?</p>

"Is it okay to point out someone's keeping quiet in a discussion/meeting?","<p>After reading <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/1787"">a related question</a>, I am rethinking about various discussion/meeting where I, and most other leaders/moderators in the discussion/meeting, call out someone for being <em>quiet</em> and not voicing their opinion.</p>

<p>The meetings were either casual or formal 10, and in both cases, I call them because I don't want them to feel left out, and I value the opinions of everyone. The casual meetings usually don't have a specific goal (hence just a discussion), but more formal ones usually have specific goals (""Where will we go on the next holiday?"" ""What will we do for our charity project?""). <strong>This excludes work meetings.</strong> All people know each other and most are friends, and usually, have only 8-13 persons.</p>

<p>Usually, we go in a circle and start from a random person (or the person next to the leader), then take turns in voicing opinions. Some usually skip (or just agree with another person), or are <strong>skipped</strong> because they take a long time to say something. After everyone has taken their turn, we get back to those that were skipped and ask for their opinion.</p>

<p>However, there might be several questions/agendas, and if the same persons keep quiet when it's their turn, we usually called them</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, Alice, why you so quiet. What do you think about this?<br>
  <sub>A bit literal translation, but the first part is a common phrase in Indonesian</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all cases, the person is a bit surprised, and usually either skip or giving a brief opinion or agree with someone's else opinion. (It may be worthwhile to mention some of them were not paying attention). That is <strong>always</strong> fine, and we seldom press for their opinion after this another line.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Come on, what do <em>you</em> think about this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And drop it and progress to next person.</p>

<p>Although we would do this to all participants (which most are shy), there are some people that more often got pointed out (because they more often keep quiet).</p>

"Is it possible to rekindle someone who lost his spark?","<p>I have tried to find similar topic with no luck. Maybe I just don't know the right keywords to ask. So if there is already an answer to this question I am sorry.</p>

<p><strong>The situation:</strong>
I had a long time friend. We could talk hours about everything and nothing. Then I switched cities for university and we got out of touch. After some five-ish years I got to meet him again while visiting my hometown, we went for a board game session and talked some. The thing is, he looks extinguished. He lost his physical condition, is stuck in a job he apparently hates and uses board games as a last holdout for a semblance of a self-esteem. I know his situation quite well as I have been through something similar myself - took me dropping out from the Uni to wake up.(simplified version)
The thing is he used to be the ""brighter"" of us. He is few years older so he was the driving force behind a lot of stuff we did. I used to look up to him. He used to be handsome. Now he looks like a nightmare. A shadow of his former self.(He wasnt perfect though. Took me a while to figure that out back then.)</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong>
Is it possible to ""rekindle"" someone? Do I have the right to try?
He seems to be semi-comfortably rotting away and I have no education in fixing people. Just some observations from my own case. Maybe the correct solution would be to let him be and hope for the best. But somehow it pains me to see him in this state.</p>

<p>As a sidenote he is not the only person with this disposition that I have met. Sometimes you see it written in the face and in the behaviour. I do not want to become Amelie from Montmartre though. Neither can I take responsibility for someone elses life...</p>

"How to redirect a real-life help vampire to an alternate source of food... um... assistance?","<p>I've recently had some troubles with a <a href=""http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/"" rel=""noreferrer"">help-vampire</a> in the office. She's about my age (late twenties), from India and she doesn't speak Dutch. She works in the same office as me, but not on the same project/team. She was hired on a recommendation by somebody on my team and is currently learning to program in Java. The only coding she does are exercises related to this, she is not working on any project. </p>

<p>She often traps me at the coffee machine, water cooler, during lunch/Friday afternoon drinks or even when I'm on my way to/returning from the toilet. <strong>She always starts with small-talk,</strong> but after two or three sentences she starts asking questions that google can answer. Often, these questions are not coherent or specific enough to answer, even when a language barrier is taken into account. Apparently, she still thinks I must be happy to help her (after all the unwillingness I've shown). It's like she's hoping that by asking enough questions, I eventually will slip in my resolve and do her work for her: provide her with answers to her tutorials/exercises. </p>

<p>Since I've never been very good at teaching, and I certainly don't have the patience to teach her (she's in my opinion very slow on the uptake), I've tried garlic and crosses, and everything suggested in <a href=""http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a>: </p>

<ul>
<li>I've bookmarked StackOverflow and the official Java documentation for her. </li>
<li>I've sent her multiple 'let me google that for you' links, told her to google things herself before asking, even told her I'm not talking until she used the resources I gave her. </li>
<li>I've always been careful to never do her work for her, and just give her the answer. I've always told her to go find it herself. In short, I've never been really helpful to her (which makes the fact that she keeps coming back even more baffling).</li>
<li>I've told her that the answers to her questions are all over the internet, and pointed out to her that cornering me to ask these questions doesn't give me a good impression of her. </li>
<li>I've pointed out all of her help-vampire characteristics as described in the second paragraph. </li>
</ul>

<p>So now, I'm at a loss as to what to do with her. Hopefully, somebody here has dealt with a help-vampire before. How do you get them to feed somewhere else? And if there is no alternative food-source, how do you get them to prefer starving over feeding off of you? </p>

<p>In normal English: What's the best way to deal with her when I want to either get her to use alternative sources of knowledge or leave me alone completely? </p>

"How to ask out a German girl in the college?","<p>So I am an international student at a US university and I have acquaintance with a German girl (of the same age but a different program) through her roommates who are my classmates. We always interact whenever we meet at their or our home for occasional dinner/drinks. We, in a group, have gone to Miami for 3 days and I think we had a good 1-hour conversation along the beach, while we were just 2 of us. I am attracted to her personality: strong mind who takes her own decisions and is inclined towards adventure-travel. So in my mind, I had noted that cool I think I like her as a person. I mostly strike the conversation with her on European ongoing politics and geography because I never had 1st experience of going there. She is mature and I am very impressed. She is cute as well. In Miami, all guys with us went for a lap dance in a strip club, but I did not feel like (could not excite me enough), so I was only chugging beer and she (my interest) got curious and asked me why am I not going? To which I replied: I am not sure if I am going to enjoy that because I am not getting excited. I possibly would be coming when I am having a heartbreak or similar things.  </p>

<p>Now, at someone's birthday party she brought her another German friend (gorgeous than her), who told me in front of her that I am handsome (I was like wow: I come from a nationality (non-muslim) where ladies seldom compliment gents, and its mostly guys who have to take initiatives and take responsibility for most of the things and decisions). I was having kitchen conversations with her friend and her friend moved very close (she was tipsy probably and I was not drinking that day so I stepped back) and found her (my interest) passing behind and looking at me as if evaluating what I am doing with her friend. </p>

<p>I am not sure if she is even giving me hints, but I really would like to ask her out, even more after when her friend found me handsome meant she might be too. What I am afraid is that she may be taking me as a stereotype Indian guy. I have my hobbies (long distance running pretty positive which my Indian friends told me that I am hurting my knees that really turned me off). I dont really appreciate the demeanour of her Indian roommates mostly because when it comes to exams and assignments, they are into mass-plagiarism which is not ethically correct and I am thinking she (my interest) may be taking me as one of them as well (she is enrolled in a different program so I am assuming she doesn't know who's who much inside: we only meet her for drinks or dinners or festivals like Christmas).</p>

<p>What killed me more is that while I will be around in the US for at least a couple of more years, she is going back after 6 months to Germany. She would find asking her out to be practically infeasible.</p>

<p>I am pretty much clueless. She is a good person and I also don't want to taint good camaraderie between us. </p>

<p>So I would really like to know should I approach this girl or not? and if Yes, what should be my approach? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: </p>

<p>Thanks for the help guys. Well, I asked her out 2 days ago on new year's eve for going out to a nearby museum. She said ""yes"" in the night but next day after 16 hours, I got a text from here saying: </p>

<p>""<em>I realized that it's probably not a great idea for us to go...I dont want to lead you on. You are a great guy but I am just not interested in anything at the moment. Sorry for saying yes yesterday and now saying no :(</em>""</p>

"Help required for approaching a crush after awkward scenario","<p>I'm 25 and have a huge crush on this girl who is 29. We were working in the same office and were casual friends. I guess she also likes me as I noticed her staring me several times. Also, she was the first to initiate the conversation most of the times when we met in the office (I am a bit of shy &amp; introvert type). Also, when once we were passing by each other through the office corridor, I just walked straight without making an eye contact with her because of my nervousness, she followed me couple of steps and asked me why just I passed by without greeting or saying anything.</p>

<p>So, because of these reasons I felt there are chances she also likes me. So, once I casually asked her reason for staring, she got tensed and said there is nothing like that and I'm like her younger brother. But I think, she said this in stress because she might have thought I was complaining and I'm younger than her. But I'm not sure about this. Because she asked if there is any gossip of her staring me in the office. She seemed very much worried about that. But there was really nothing like that. I told her. But she did not seemed convinced and I feel she believed about the gossip which never happened. I’m from India and most of the people here are not open minded about such things. They consider the people in love, relationship as spoiled and mock at them. So, because of this, I understand her tension if she believed about the gossip. </p>

<p>I think the question about staring have freaked her out. I agree that was a damn stupid approach. I regret that. But I had no intention of hurting her and was expecting a positive response from her on that question. I have said sorry to her if I have hurt her and told her that I was just kidding, and she said it is OK and have forgotten about that. But still she seemed tensed to me.</p>

<p>She had left our work place around two months ago (for better job opportunities) only making my chances to approach her difficult as hell. Her memories haunts me every single day since she left. She doesn’t have profile on any social media either. She can be contacted only through phone. I have got her phone number from her friend after she left. But contacting her on phone seems somewhat awkward to me because of the weird scenario happened and the fact that I did not got her phone number directly from her.  </p>

<p>My dad works as life insurance adviser and sells life insurance policies, so on her last day I asked her whether she has any requirement of life insurance. She said she had not decided about insurance that time. Now I am planning to text her if she has decided anything on insurance. Will this be a right approach? If she says yes to that I will have chance to meet her at least one time on that purpose. But what if, if she says no to that? How do I initiate conversation/message on phone that will not make her awkward if possible? This time I want to keep communication as natural as possible and do want to sound desperate and not scare or hurt her anymore. Any advice on this?</p>

<p>If she is not having the same feelings as me, I at least want to be friend with her for a long time, for always. </p>

<p>She still responded to my e-mail, at which point I asked if there was another person I could speak to so not to disturb her. However, I struggled to write a sign-off in light of this out-of-office response. Is it appropriate to mention the emergency, or just forego it? My pending response was along the lines of</p>

<blockquote>

"How to get roommates to speak same language","<p>I live in a large shared house. I had to move out of my old home on short notice and as such my new one isn't really a good fit but I'm trying to make the best of it until I leave. The house is rented out by a company that has the business model of renting to 'international people' (e.g. people on working visas and international students). This is totally illegal as it's discrimination against locals, but that's not the point of this question.</p>

<p>I live with 10 other people (more if you count their boy/girlfriends who sometimes stay over). Many aren't good with English but the ones who are still don't seem to speak it. There are subgroups, a few from France who speak French, a few from Hungary who speak Hungarian etc.</p>

<p>I didn't think it would bother me but I do feel uncomfortable when I'm in the same room and people have huge conversations right in front of me in a different language. And sometimes they're listening to music on the radio in a different language, or Skyping in a different language too. This is in shared areas like the kitchen where I'm forced to be around them.</p>

<p>After giving it some thought, one of the reasons I don't feel comfortable with this is because if I want to say something to them, I'm not sure if it's an appropriate time to interrupt (for example I wouldn't want to interrupt when they're disusing e.g. going to a funeral).</p>

<p>How can I politely ask them to speak in English, or at least try to? I'm really ok if they sometimes speak in another language but if we're all sitting at the same table and they're having a lengthy conversation in another language that's when I feel uncomfortable. I notice that people from Czech Republic do this the most even though their English is quite fluent (is it a cultural thing like it's considered 'low class to speak English'?). Should I ask them individually or should I leave a note or send a message by text? What words should I use? I was thinking something like.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, when you're around me do you think we can stick with English if it's not inconvenient? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also whenever someone walks into a room with other people  in it, everyone says ""hello"" in English to each individual person and then everyone switches back to their own language. I find this annoying as if we're not going to say anything more than ""hello"" then we may as well not say ""hello"". Is there a way I can politely suggest this?</p>

<p>I only speak English, but the country we live in is dominantly English and that is the official language. All roommates speak some English and it's the only common language. I can't overemphasize that things feel uncomfortable and there's a bit of a culture clash (for example I share the bathroom with someone who stands out side the door waiting for it to become empty, but that's a question for another time ;) )</p>

<p>I want to make clear I'm not trying to be prejudiced and realize it's hard to speak a new language. But I think everyone would get along better if we communicated more. Responding to one comment ""But asking them to speak English as default won't win you friendship points, that is certain"" consider the opposite: we're not on friendly terms now as no one speaks to each other.</p>

<p>If they already are speaking another language when I enter the room, I get that. I find it more rude when I'm speaking to someone and someone else enters the room and they switch to speaking a language I don't understand. </p>

<p>Sometimes when I am trying to have a conversation with them they switch back to a language I don't understand and have a private conversation in the middle. Also I sometimes get the impression what they're saying does involve me, like wondering if I'm using the oven or pointing at the table I'm sitting at. </p>

<p>I don't actually think I'm that socially anxious. I like being around people, usually feel confident, and talk comfortably in front of groups that I host. So it really feels like I'm just missing phrases. How can I expand my conversational, ""small-talk"" vocabulary?</p>

<p>My only idea at this point is to binge on sitcoms on Netflix. I grew up without TV, so maybe I'm just missing television time?</p>

"Question About Texting Cues - Thumb sign and V Sign","<p>I have always been slow to adapt. I have an inbuilt distrust of anything new... Social media has been around awhile now, but I have only dabbled with it on and off. However, now I have a friend who would like to stay in touch through social media and texting, so I'm learning the things people my age practically grew up with. :\</p>

<p>I have texted for awhile, but the use of emoticons and emojis is something I generally avoided until my friend began using them to message me. As I believe is common, we developed our own ways of indicating the end of our conversations. Between us, it tends to be a thumbs up, 'sounds good' or 'ok'.</p>

<p>But recently, and which is what I'm asking about, my friend suddenly started mixing things up on me and I'm not sure if it still means ""I'm done talking now"" or what....</p>

<p>Rather than just a thumbs up, he now often texts me a thumbs up followed next by a hand making the peace 'V' sign. It still seems to mean the conversation is done, but why the change? </p>

<p>Should I take it to mean: 1) He considers me a closer friend than before? 2) That I'm annoying him. Or 3) He's just bored of using the same three sign-offs we were using?</p>

<p>I'm guessing it's the second, because he seems to use it most when he's busy with something. But maybe I'm reading too much into it.</p>

<p><strong>How can I figure out how to interpret this ""new"" (to me) emoji?</strong></p>

<p><em>More Info: I guess it's worth mentioning that he is not from a culture where the V sign is offensive.</em></p>

"How should I handle awkward workplace situation?","<p>So...this is my situation.. There is a guy who started working at my office a few months ago. His desk was moved into the room I sit in and next to my desk. We started talking a little bit and I started liking him more and more. One day he gave me his phone number and he was occasionally texting me outside of work.</p>

<p>Before Christmas I found out from a 3rd party at the office that this guy likes me and is interested in me and after the office Christmas party he started talking to me more and complementing me about my dress, asking me personal questions, etc. We talked for a few hours and went out to lunch together. When we left for Christmas vacation he suggested getting together if I don't have anything to do during the holiday. Since I live alone and don't have family around here I said sure. I texted him and said I might take him up on the offer and he seemed interested but when I told him when I was available I haven't heard a single word back the entire holiday. Since we came back to the office after Christmas he's gone quiet and hardly talked to me anymore or text me again.</p>

<p>Same thing happened on New Years, my friend convinced me that maybe he's shy and I should ask him out. I offered to get together for coffee and he replied immediately that he would like that but when I texted him that I was free on New Years day he stopped all communication again.</p>

<p>Now I see him at the office and he basically doesn't say anything to me unless I approach him (I can still feel him checking me out when I walk by) and I'm feeling awkward and uncomfortable with all the mixed signals especially since he sits right next to me.</p>

"I'm very introverted and only have one friend, do I ask too much of him?","<p>I'm a male college student and I've really only got one friend. I never know how to interact with other people. I'm quite good at programming but that's probably the only thing I'm particularly good at.</p>

<p>I've met my friend when I moved to a college dorm 6 years ago. We started to get along very well and we had the same courses, so we essentially did everything together.
Which was great because it was much easier for me to just tag along with someone and to learn together instead of doing everything on my own, which I would have done if I hadn't met him.</p>

<p>But sometimes I think that I'm asking too much. Because I feel very, very alone if I don't see him for a few days, which really really hurts me. I mean, I still have my parents to talk to, but I don't feel comfortable telling them about such things.</p>

<p>And I'm a person who is really uncomfortable alone, even though I'm very bad when it comes to social interactions - which I know is a little weird.</p>

<p>We can talk about anything with each other and we've actually talked about this before. But I still don't really know how to better handle these situations.</p>

<p>I'm gonna try to explain how I feel: I mean, I can watch tv or a movie or read stuff online to be busy, or I can work or learn, but I'm getting a kind of anxiety and I can't really concentrate, and I feel like it just hurts in my chest. I feels kind of like heartbreak feels, I can't really explain it.... I don't actually feel heartbroken because my only friend spends time with his family for a few days, but it kind of feels that way. It just <em>hurts</em> to be alone. </p>

<p>I know I can't expect that someone talks to me every day or something like that, but I shouldn't feel like this, should I? <em>Is something wrong with me?</em></p>

<p>Thanks for listening to me!</p>

<p>Some background:</p>

<p>Before anyone asks, our relationship is completely platonic. We are both straight guys and we both had sex with girls before, which is also something we talked to each other about in the past, partly in graphic detail.</p>

<p>I don't have the best relationship with my father. I do get along with my mother very well, but I couldn't talk to her about such stuff in detail, partly because I would rather talk to people who are about the same age as me, and partly because she's got a lot on her plate with my brother who has problems in school.</p>

"How to effectively communicate to my mother that she sometimes suppresses me even if she doesn't realize it?","<p>My mother and I had a serious fight over the holidays. I didn't spend New Year with her because some friends invited me and my partner to join them and they live a few hours away.
It was last minute and the truth is that my mother has her way of making me feel bad ahead of time if I can't do what she would like me to do or if I don't feel how she would like me to feel...</p>

<p>What ends up happening is instead of me saying, ""Mom, I really don't know what I am going to do on that day..."" or ""Mom, I'll let you know if and when..."", I try to please her when I really wish she didn't make me feel I need to. I don't have a problem saying ""No"" to my mother. (I've done it in the past and still do). 
I have a problem when she makes me feel guilty afterwards or makes me feel I did something wrong. </p>

<p>I did mention that we might spend New Year together but only because I felt pressured by her and told her that I really was doing it for her. Her understanding was that I was doing it for myself (she doesn't accept that sometimes people do stuff for others because they feel obligated even if they aren't in the mood) and then she accused me of contradicting myself which I probably was at some point but only because I didn't feel I had the right to just say ""I DON'T KNOW"". </p>

<p>I told her that for me the holidays are just days. And she is the one that gives special meaning to those specific days. Long story short I ended up telling her that sometimes she's a bully (perhaps harsh but I was upset) and that if I can't feel that saying ""No"" to her is OK and this is how boundaries are set (first between parents and children), how does she expect me to be comfortable doing it with others? I told her that she just doesn't understand that she manipulates and blackmails me because she is alone. And she does it very very subtly. 
(My mother lives alone and never remarried after her divorce and I'm an only child). </p>

<p>I understand it might be difficult for her but I just can't seem to be able to communicate to her that I can't always be expected to spend the holidays with her, especially when I see her often and talk to her on the phone almost every day. </p>

<p>Anyway, at some point during the argument she told me that if she is such a bad mother, I should keep a distance and hung up. 
I tried calling back but she has probably turned both phones off. </p>

<p>At some point she also ""threatened"" to involve my boyfriend by telling him that we treated her ""like garbage"" during the holidays. We spent Christmas with her but we were both sick and didn't stay long (She perceives it now that we were trying to get rid of her by doing that early on so we do something better later). </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>How can I best communicate to my sensitive mother that I sometimes feel too pressured and suppressed by her without her freaking out so much? </p>

"Wife wants me to be happy (or act happy) all the time","<p>My wife and I have been together around 20 years, and for the most part, we have an excellent relationship. However ...</p>

<p>Like anyone else (I suppose) I get tired, depressed, gloomy every once in a while. When this happens, I'm not nice to be around -- I don't yell or get violent, but I'm impatient, irritable, snippy, rude, dismissive. In short, I'm an a#$-hole (temporarily).</p>

<p>Typically, my wife notices and asks ""what's wrong"". Sometimes I'm reluctant to say ""I'm tired"" because it makes me feel like a decrepit slothful loser. I have to accept that I'm getting old and don't have as much strength/energy as before. My problem, obviously. Sometimes I just don't know what's bothering me, so I answer (truthfully), ""I don't know"". This sounds like a lie, of course, so the downward spiral begins. </p>

<p>She typically accuses me of ""ruining the mood"" of an event or some other planned good time. She often assumes that she has done something ""wrong"" to make me ""mad"" (her words). </p>

<p>If she yells at me, I try to explain myself quietly and calmly. If she's yelling, and I'm not, it seems to make her even more angry. Occasionally, she will fly into a violent rage, and physically attack me. I defend myself, and try to stop her from doing any bodily damage. I think it's just venting, because I'm sure she could injure me if she really wanted to. If things go on too long, I sometimes get to feel that I've taken enough abuse, and can't control myself any longer, so I yell back. Bad to worse.  </p>

<p>Playing at amateur psychologists, we think that the behavior stems from her relationship with her father. He was violent and abusive with her entire family, and everyone had to be very careful whenever it looked like he was in a bad mood and might explode. When I'm in a funk, we think it brings back memories of these terrible times, and the emotional damage he has done to her. The attacks on me are (maybe, in some sense) what she wanted to do to her father, but couldn't??</p>

<p>Her father was a monster (from what I hear), and it pains me greatly that I sometimes remind her of him. But I can't be happy and cheerful all the time. Some of my ideas for handling the situation are ...</p>

<ol>
<li>Get better at faking happiness? I hope I don't have to do this. I hope that I can show my true feelings to my wife, if no-one else. </li>
<li>Help her understand that my happiness is not her responsibility, and my gloominess is not her fault. I've tried this, but it doesn't seem to work. Inside her, there is a voice more powerful than mine that tells her that she has done something wrong. </li>
<li>Somehow distinguish myself from her father. He's dead, and I'm not him. But we're both men, so (to my dismay and disgust) we apparently have something in common. How do I convince her that I'm different?</li>
<li>Try to be nicer. I can't avoid getting stressed or tired or gloomy, occasionally, but maybe I can somehow prevent this from leading to rudeness and conflict. I've tried. It's very hard, and I fear that I might be too old to change.</li>
</ol>

<p>I understand that no-one here can tell me what I should do. I'm just looking for thoughts or additional approaches that I might consider, or better ways to communicate the ideas outlined above. All four ideas involve some interpersonal skill (faking happiness, assuaging guilt, showing that I'm different, or being nicer when under stress). Apparently my skills are lacking, so looking for ways to do better. </p>

<p><strong>My question: how can I better express the four ideas listed above (or some alternative ones), so that we can eliminate the downward spirals into violence (verbal or physical).</strong></p>

"Reply to an email that does not necessarily need an answer","<p>I live in an apartment building with about 150 small apartments, owned by various private landlords.
For these apartment buildings, there is often a house management company that is responsible for general work around the house, i.e. anything that is not directly related to a specific apartment.</p>

<p>I recently contacted the house management company via email concerning a sewage problem in the bathroom. They politely replied that they <em>assumed</em>  the actual problem would be more within the apartment, so it's not their responsibility. I should contact my landlord.</p>

<p>Even though I disagreed, I decided to follow that suggestion. I now ask myself whether I should reply to their email once again - saying something like ""Thanks for your answer, I'll do so and return to you if necessary.""</p>

<p>There are certainly situations where another reply would be appropriate - e.g. if I had a similar conversation with a friend (via email). Also, you would never just leave wordlessly if it was face-to-face conversation.</p>

<p>But in the end, another answer would not contain any useful information - it's just politeness. And I wonder if a consultant in a company that might receive a considerable number of emails everyday would want to read such a ""useless politeness"" or might think ""why is he wasting my time... :-/"".</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Should I reply to an email when it's not actually necessary and the other person would not receive any new (or only trivial) information from me - just to be polite?
Does it make a difference if they refer to another contact or if they have solved my problem?</p>

<p>Assume that the contact person is company staff that is not personally known and where one would expect they're reading and writing a lot of emails.</p>

"How to find out if my girlfriend secretly wants to get pregnant?","<p>I'm dating an immigrant and there are many issues with our relationship due to her immigration status. Over the last month I have slowly started to suspect that she wants to get pregnant, to keep me as her boyfriend and/or to benefit herself in her quest to become a citizen.</p>

<p>First, when we first began having sex I was reluctant. I'm not a virgin, but I feel like the less you do it the better are the chances that your girlfriend won't get pregnant. Also, other activities can be just as fun in my opinion. She was visibly mad about this and said she really liked intercourse. However, it's not just intercourse she likes, she wants to ""orgasm with me at the same time"". I think this might have been code for ""I want you to ejaculate inside me even if you have a condom"". Yes, I wore a condom, but I still feel better not finishing inside her.</p>

<p>Next, when we had an unrelated argument I said something along the lines of ""I'd do anything for you"". After the argument she got on me and said ""you'd do anything for me? Well I want a baby"". I got quiet and felt cold. She knew I was scared and after about 2-3 minutes she laughed it off as a joke. My mind was racing about the possibility it wasn't a joke.</p>

<p>Finally, she started eating odd foods, things that someone pregnant might eat. She joked that she could be pregnant, then joked again that she's pregnant only if she could get pregnant from my finger. I interjected and said that condoms don't work with 100% reliability and she replied that they are ""pretty much"" 100% reliable. She said that if she did gets pregnant with my child, she'd keep it because I'm such a good guy.</p>

<p>My thoughts are that if she gets pregnant, I would deal with the situation responsibly, but I really don't want a baby right now. I think she either actively wants a baby or just thinks that if it happens it happens. My question is how can I ask her if she actually wants a baby, while having the best chance of getting an honest answer?</p>

I ate dinner at his house along with his family and extended family. I generally enjoy their place except for one thing - lapses in food serving hygiene. For example, yesterday I saw utensils used to handle raw meat being in very close contact with cooked food ready to serve. Hot food was also left out at room temperature for some time before serving.</p>

<p>Today, perhaps not surprisingly, I got the stomach flu with fever, vomiting and stomach cramps. It may have been the food served last night that was to blame. I have known my friend for many years and generally enjoy a good relationship. <strong>I really prefer not to strain this relationship through this incident.</strong> If I directly confront him, I may be perceived as unappreciative and accusatory.

<p>When people say “yeah I like beer” in conversation and I mention that I brew my own, they ask “oh well how does that work?” What seems to happen at this point is that I start talking about the process in a simplified manner: steeping/<em>mashing</em> grains, boiling the resulting “sugar water”, adding hops and flavorings, cooling and adding yeast, and adding primary sugar and bottling - people tend to get annoyed. I guess they believe it should be some short process like making tea... but it’s not.</p>

<p>And when I fully explained the process to a person who seemed interested, it apparently spread around a new group of friends that I was a beer snob. I’m not sure how that happened other than being excited about explaining a hobby to a friend. Now if I talk about beer in any remote way, I’m referred to as a beer snob. This is patently untrue; I just like making it and if people are interested in how it’s made, discussing the process.</p>

So it seems very likely that this isn't just a ""he said, she said"" type of situation.  We've also heard similar reports about Walter's behavior from other parents.</p>

<p>We've spoken with the teacher repeatedly, and she tries to keep them separated, but that seems to be the extent of what she's willing to do.  They'll be leaving to go to different schools soon, so attempts to escalate the matter within the school are generally met with ""it will resolve itself soon"".</p>

<p>My wife and I have been working with my son on how to handle it, and we've started him on martial arts classes to give him more physical confidence, so I'm not worried about that aspect of the issue.</p>

<p>However, Walter's father occasionally tries to be social, and has invited my son to Walter's birthday party.  There's even been talk of play-dates.</p>

<p>I've listened to this man brag about how well-behaved Walter is, and how smart he is for knowing to keep what he's learned from his wrestling lessons out of school, so it seems his father is completely clueless about Walter's actual behavior.</p>

<p>There's no way my son is going to Walter's birthday (I asked him, and he doesn't want to), or over to their house to play.</p>

<p>I'd really like to let this guy know what his son is really like, and describe some of the bullying behavior.  What is the best way to broach this subject with the father?</p>

"How to deal with a classmate that can't speak your language or understand the teacher?","<p>Back in seventh grade I was the new kid: no friends and very nervous. The first day at school, so far, was going quite well. But then, when I chose my seat in Science, an even more nervous-looking kid sat down next to me and said ""Parlez-vous Français?"".</p>

<p>Luckily I could speak some French (6th grade) and he could speak some fragmented English. But still he just couldn't keep up with the teacher's high speed lectures and homework. I tried my best to explain the lessons to him, but it quickly became apparent that he just wanted to copy down my answers, him even getting me in trouble with the teacher on multiple occasions! </p>

<p>But I could sympathize for him; he was now in a new country that had new kids that spoke a new language. So hard did I try to get him to understand his new environment, lessons and assignments, but alas, I eventually gave up and stopped caring when he would peek over and write down my answers.</p>

<p>Not too long into the school year, though (~ 2 months), we got official seating charts and he was put on the other side of the classroom. At the time I was (unfortunately) relieved. But now, a few years later, I wish I'd been a better classmate for him.</p>

<p><strong>How could I have communicated to him that his cheating was not okay and that he needed to do his own work?</strong></p>

"Roommate Upset I Woke Him Up","<p>I encountered a strange situation with my roommate and I'm not sure if I'm the problem and need to change, or if he is just being unreasonable.</p>

<p><strong>The context is this:</strong></p>

<p>We are living in a house which has 6 people and 3 dogs living in it. There is an upstairs and downstairs which are not connected, with 3 people (all guys in their 20s) living upstairs, and 3 people (all guys, one older man, the rest in their 20s) living downstairs. We have two bathrooms, one with a shower, and one with a tub. The one with a tub get's clogged, especially due to my hair, so I use the shower. All my toiletries are in the bathroom with the shower.</p>

<p>But most importantly, the room with the shower is adjoining with the room he sleeps in. It is connected via a door on both sides, and it is a lot easier for him to walk through the shower room to leave his room, then to get around and use another door. (As a sidenote, he doesn't claim ownership over this shower room, we actually have more rooms than people, and so a few months ago he started sleeping in the extra room, leaving a lot of his stuff in his previous room, and said that it was just temporary and we could of course still use the bathroom adjoining his second room whenever we wanted).</p>

<p><strong>The situation is this:</strong></p>

<p>Today I went on a run at around 7pm, and when I came back I went to the shower room to try to have a shower. But, the door was locked. So I knocked on the door to see if he was in there, but I didn't get a response.</p>

<p>I figured he must be sleeping with ear plugs in, amd I was soaked with sweat from my run and really wanted to shower, so I figured it would be no big deal to knock loud enough to wake him up.</p>

<p>I realize this wasn't a super nice thing, but I figured he wouldn't be too bothered, as it was 7pm, it was a shared shower, and he did really mess up by accidentally locking his roommates out of the shared shower room.</p>

<p>After a few minutes without him waking up I realized the lock was actually one of those that you can open by just using a coin (it didn't have a key, it was just to prevent accidentally walking in on someone in the bathroom), so I unlocked it and had my shower.</p>

<p>Sometime later my roommate confronted me and said it was completely unacceptable for me to wake him up when he was sleeping, just because I wanted to have a shower. I was fairly baffled, as although I know it is annoying to be woken up, I figured he would have instead apologized for locking me out and making it basically impossible for me to shower.</p>

<p>I was also confused as to how my roommate could wake up, and then just ignore me when I was knocking on the door. He said he ignored me because he didn't want me to ""get my way"" when I was being so rude. Which further confused me as I wasn't trying to be rude, I figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal to wake him up, especially at 7pm. I didn't know if he was asleep for the night, which would mean I would have to just have to go to sleep sweaty, without showering.</p>

<p>My roommate went on and said he thought I was just waking him up to be mean, because of something I said earlier that day. To explain that I have to get into the second situation.</p>

<p><strong>Second situation:</strong></p>

<p>The 3 roommates living downstairs (which is not connected) have been smoking both cigarettes and weed downstairs, which is completely against the rental agreement. We can smell it strongly through the vents throughout the house, and previous had to block all the vents with cardboard to lessen the smell.</p>

<p>We have been complaining heavily about it to the landlord, and he has been calling the tenants downstairs and telling them to stop. Which resulted in the tenants downstairs finding all sorts of reasons to complain about us. The landlord is trying to resolve the problem by organizing a meeting with all the tenants, mostly to see if we (the tenants upstairs) can find a way to stay in the living situation as opposed to leaving.</p>

<p>The landlord wants to organize this meeting ASAP, so he sent us an email on Saturday asking us what times on Monday or Tuesday we would be available for. I responded with the times I would be available for, and made sure to send a message on the upstairs tenant's discord channel about replying to our landlord with the times we would be available.</p>

<p>About an hour later I was in the common area and saw my roommate was on his laptop, but still hadn't replied. So I asked him if he saw the email, and he said he did, and then I asked him what if he was free either day. He simply said he had work, so I said ""yeah, but you're free evenings?"", and his response was just a really long ""uh.........."" .</p>

<p>I didn't really expect it to be that difficult of a question, I haven't once known him to have anything scheduled after work, and I thought it was fairly rude of him to not take the meeting seriously. It wasn't a social invitation, our landlord needed to know people's schedules right way, especially because the tenants downstairs worked a variety of hours, so they might have to take time off work.</p>

<p>My response was to just tell him ""well, email the landlord with the times you are free"".</p>

<p>And apparently he thought my response was so condescending that he figured I was just looking for ways to annoy him, which he felt included waking him up to use the shower, instead of showering the next day.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong></p>

<p>How can I respond to prevent my roommate from locking me out of other shared resources?</p>

"Trying to limit toxic relationship with family but keep getting dragged back in","<p>This question focuses on my relationship with my mom. Most people who know her find her difficult to be around. She invites me to her place but there’s a 75% chance we get in a fight the first 15 minutes and I have to leave. This is a problem because it leaves me feeling upset and I waste travel time. I find she nitpicks until I lose my temper and then she kicks me out for getting mad.</p>

<p>For example today she invited me over for lunch. Whenever she speaks it’s like she’s giving orders. The first thing that bothered me is how she said ‘put the plates on the table!’ in a harsh tone instead of asking ‘can you put the plates on the table’. I brought over a bottle of wine as a gift and she got mad that I put it on the table so I moved it, but I don’t understand why someone would get mad about something like this. The third thing she did that made me lose my cool was I was touching my food with my fingers and she got mad at me for this. This was bad on my part but I started shoveling food in my face with my hands to prove that she can’t control how I chose to eat my food. She told me to leave and I did. Also, for the short time I was there she didn’t really engage with me except to boss me around.</p>

<p>Shortly after I left I got an email saying she had picked up groceries for me that are still at her home. This makes no sense to me as I was still very angry at her behavior.</p>

<p>This sort of thing has happened before and I don’t know how to stop it. I would like to spend less time around her but she reals me in by saying she has food for me at her home. It’s not really effective leaving when she acts in a way I don’t like as I already wasted a lot of time making the journey to her home. </p>

<p>I’m thinking of replying to the email</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last time it wasn’t pleasant for either of us when I came over. How
  will things be different this time? I’m confused why you get so angry
  over small things like how I put the bottle of wine on the table? I
  really don’t appreciate when you get mad at me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I get her to speak to me nicer instead of ordering me around and using an angry voice? What should I say when she speaks to me in a way I don't appreciate? What should I do when she tries to coerce me to come visit her? When should I blow things off and when should I tell her to stop doing something? For example, with telling me to put the plates on the table in a bossy voice, I can ignore, but after several times when she told me not to eat with my fingers, I blow up. Just to be clear, even if I'm really careful what to be polite, she'll still find something to get mad at me for. </p>

<p>It is a value of mine to maintain ties with family, and that’s why I want this to work. If it was a friend of mine, I wouldn't be friends with them if they treated me like this but you can't chose your family.</p>

"""But you don't look autistic"" isn't a nice thing to say","<p>""But you don't look autistic"" (meaning: ""you don't behave like an autistic person"") is a sentence that a lot of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical"" rel=""noreferrer"">neurotypical people</a> (NT) say to people on the autistic spectrum (usually just after the autistic person told the NT that they are on the spectrum). However, this sentence can be painful and not nice to hear because it can implicitly convey that: ""I don't believe you, you are surely wrong"" (and a lot of other hidden meaning).</p>

<p>I know that I have heard some variation of this sentence before and I always tried to argue against the other person:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are wrong, I have this and that, this is (partially) what allows me to say that I'm on the spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, arguing is exhausting and I don't want to do that anymore. I want people to stop questioning me and my doctor diagnosis.</p>

<p>Telling someone that you are on the autistic spectrum can be hard and I would like people who have such a reaction to <strong>know that it's hurtful and they shouldn't do that</strong> (to me or anyone else).</p>

<p>So, how can I convey that to these people (family, friends, coworkers, etc...)  without ruining my relationship with them?</p>

<hr>

<h1>Note and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>It usually just come up once, but some people like to ""put it on the carpet"" again and again</p></li>
<li><p>I'm expecting the same reaction as if I told someone ""I'm a lesbian"" or ""I'm transgender"". And the reaction wouldn't be ""But you don't look like one!"" but just ""Okay, wanna talk about it?""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I don't want a conversation. I just want to tell them ""you, invalidating what I'm saying, is hurtful, don't do that"" and be done with it.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>To people saying ""it's a compliment"", to me it's not. I don't see any problem with being on the spectrum so <em>complimenting</em> me for not looking autistic is not something I appreciate (I don't want to debate about that).</p></li>
<li><p>Since someone asked: if you have a way to tell someone that you are on the spectrum and this doesn't spark a discussion, I'm all for it (it would be a frame-challenge but I wouldn't mind that in this context) </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>My worst experience with telling people I'm on the spectrum</h1>

<p>I told most of my family via a group chat message that I was on the spectrum.</p>

<p>My sister read the message, didn't say anything about it to me (which was nice) but, some time later, she phoned my mom and went on and on about how she didn't trust my diagnosis.</p>

<p>Then my mom phoned me and told me all about what my sister said (not nice) and how she (my mom) didn't trust that I was autistic anymore and that I certainly must ""just"" have depression. </p>

<hr>

<p>I also had other people doubting my words/being skeptical but it was in a ""nicer"" way.</p>

"Grandpa has dementia, how to include him in conversation?","<p><em>I'm not sure if this is a question that can be asked here (or even answered) but I'd like to try.</em></p>

<p>My grandpa is almost 80 and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's a little over a year ago. Since then I feel like he is loosing interest in life.</p>

<p>He used to be a self-employed and managed his business together with my grandma. He used to be a craftsman who drove around the local area and worked with his hands all the time. He enjoyed spending time with his customers and knows almost everybody in the village he comes from. When he stopped working about 15 years ago his son took over the business which he runs to this day. Grandpa always did some business on the side afterwards, which kept him busy. He has always been helpful, generous, compasionate, loving and funny to his whole family.</p>

<p>In recent months he:</p>

<ul>
<li>had to stop driving, because it became too dangerous</li>
<li>had to stop working, because his body wasn't able to sustain it (to be clear it was a ""hobby"" for him, he doesn't <em>have</em> to work)</li>
<li>stopped caring about news and politics (which he was happy to discuss in the past)</li>
<li>cares less and less about football (which was very important to him)</li>
<li>sleeps for some time in the morning and expanded his afternoon sleep</li>
</ul>

<p>It crushes me to see him like that. So far he still recognizes his family, but I can see his memory slowly fade away. My grandparents get visited about 5-8 times a week by family members and I visit them 2-3 times a month. When we're with them, we mostly talk and spend time with grandma and grandpa sits there and rarely takes part in the conversation. </p>

<p>I can understand, why he acts like this. If my ability to do the things I like (and had been doing for more than 50 years) was taken away and it was difficult for me to learn new things (memory...) I wouldn't know if I was able to keep my spirits up.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is there something that can be done, or do I/we have to accept the situation?</li>
<li>What can we talk about that he takes an interest in, or how to can we invite him into the conversation?</li>

"How to convey a message that will convince an unknown person to not urinate next to my garage door?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>My wife and I rent an apartment and a garage. The garage is on an underground parking underneath the building in which we live.</p>

<p>The garage has a metal door which we lock with a key. The underground parking has a lot of parking slots as well as garages like the one we use.</p>

<p>Now, what is frustrating to us is that there is someone who often urinates just next to our garage door. There is also a car in the slot next to ours, but its owner seldom uses it (it's covered in dust), so it is improbable they would ever notice this.</p>

<p>The parking is always cold, being underground, and so it's always wet and smelly. This behaviour happens often, but we've never caught whoever is doing it. Last Friday we went to the parking right after it had happened and found it very gross. Obviously, something should be done to deal with it!</p>

<p>We're convinced the offender is someone who lives in our building as the parking is only accessible with a key or a remote control.</p>

<p>But we're not sure how to approach this and get results. We can contact the owner of our apartment but he doesn't live here, and we wouldn't want to bother him with something like this. There are also no cameras in the parking.</p>

<p>We were thinking of printing several notes and sticking them in the parking as well as in common areas like the building lobby and the elevator, but we can't think of a text that wouldn't come off as passive-aggressive and thus would cause the offender to continue.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>If we were to communicate with this person through a note we print, what should we say to them, so we encourage them to stop what they're doing?</p>

<p>Or, can you suggest an alternative approach to pass the offender the message they can't continue urinating right next to our door?</p>

<p>My location is Bulgaria. The described behaviour is not considered OK here.</p>

"How avoid a question about women being loyal housewives?","<p>I was in a country in Eastern Europe. I went to a practice-public-speaking event, as a visitor (to see if I wanted to join the group). After the event, all of us went to a small restaurant close to the event, to eat brunch and drink coffee.</p>

<p>An older man (65 years?), from the US, who was part of the group, said to me (another man) that the women there are beautiful and make good and loyal housewives, didn't I think so too?</p>

<p>I didn't like that question, because I don't like looking at other people as housewives or someone's ""servants"". Also, I felt ashamed, because there were many women there (members of the group), and I didn't want to be seemingly participating in a discussion about them being housewives.</p>

<p>How can I reply to him in a way that makes him abruptly stop talking about that? And that doesn't offend him?</p>

<p>If he gets offended I'd be a tiny bit worried he'd start ridiculing me in front of the others. He was referring to one of his children as a social justice warrior (which is a negative/ridiculing phrase), and on the Internet he writes bad things about people from Africa, and calls his other children things like lazy and selfish. All of his three children have broken all contact with him.</p>

<p>Do you have suggestions about what to say / do?  (and how do you think he'd react, if I said that?)</p>

<p>I was a bit curious about who he was, and was okay with continuing talking with him, but about other things. So just walking away, would have felt a bit ... boring, and maybe unnecessarily impolite.</p>

<p>I didn't want to offend him, because </p>

<li>maybe it would be interesting to talk with him about other things, also I got curious and wanted to find out more about him and his viewpoints. </li>
<li>I think if I ""angrily"" rejected his attempt to talk with me, the others around us might have noticed, and ... I was new in the group, my first day. He was a long term member. And I think that, the first day, rejecting a long-term member in a not-polite way could have given a bad impression of me. ... Also, if two people seem to not get along with each others, the others nearby won't know which of them is ""weird"", or maybe they'll think both are.</li>

"How to get housemates to be quieter when video-chatting?","<p>I live in a large shared house with international people. I noticed it’s natural to speak a bit louder than a normal voice when video-chatting (because the microphone isn’t right beside your face). I find my roommates use Skype video-chat a lot and this is affecting my sleep and ability to do work that involves concentration. The walls are very thin where I live but I can hear it very clearly if someone’s Skyping from the kitchen or an adjacent room. </p>

<p>Most people do not speak English well. I feel very sheepish about asking them to keep their voice lower as I don’t want to be insensitive. When and how should I approach them and what phrasing should I use? Should I address them individually or as a group? Should I say</p>

<p>A final concern, sometimes people do it in public areas like the kitchen but they leave the phone or computer and walk around. I sometimes enter the room not knowing they are video-chatting and try to talk to them. This makes me feel a bit uncomfortable.

"How can I convince my neighbour to stop feeding my cat (I've already asked twice)?","<p>I'm living in my apartment for 4 years with my cat and my girlfriend. I have a balcony and since I do I put my cat's litter in there, and I have always left the door to the balcony open so that my cats can go poop and can also walk around without me always opening the door. </p>

<p>I don't mind my cat spending time with my neighbours, on the contrary me and my girlfriend are both working all day so I'm very fine with my cat being not being alone the whole day in my apartment. </p>

<p>But it came to the point where my cat is spending all its time at my very next door neighbor, who is retired and lives alone. I only hear her once a day when she come to do her thing into the litter... My neighbor is feeding her and my cat is getting very fat. She keeps giving my cat some stuff like yoghurt or tuna (from human tin can) and that kind of stuff, no surprise : my cat keeps coming back to her, but it needs some special food for sterilized cat. As you can imagine, what I offer in abundance (sterilized cat food) can't beat what my neighbor has to offer... At the beginning I was fine with it, my cat is a being and I like the idea of her being free to choose whoever she wants to live with, even though it makes me sad, she can choose to live with the old granny next door. </p>

<p>Here's the problem, few weeks ago my cat had some stuff into it's fur, the neighbour came to my place to tell me that may be we should look at it and bring her to the vet... We did it and the vet told us that it was because of the way she was fed. So I came to my neighbour and told her that she had to stop feeding her and that we were going to feed her again. That lasts few days where my cat was curiously way more at my place (what a coincidence!)...</p>

<p>Few weeks later I came to my neighbour to tell her that I'd like to give her the cat for real, so that it was official and I didn't have to think about it anymore as a responsibility of mine. For instance I would be able to go on week end and vacation without thinking of the cat, and I would stop cleaning my cat's poop for nothing. But she didn't want to, she told me it was too much responsibilities and that she would stop feeding her (which she didn't).</p>

<p>My question is the following :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>How can I get her to stop feeding my cat, without being rude since I already ask her twice. And without jailing my cat.</strong></p>

<p>My question is not :</p>

<p>Since this video was released my coworkers are making fun of them and making jokes about being non-binary. I do not want to repeat them here, but they are deeply offensive and spreads threats towards LGBTQ+ people. It goes very far most of the time.<br>
They joke about it <strong>during work time</strong>, in the office, <strong>twice a day</strong> (and for 30+ minutes) since last week. Most of the time I put my earphones in so as not to participate<sup>2</sup> (because I am shy and I struggle to be heard in debates and every time I confront them, they laugh at me and tell me my opinion is stupid), but this week they called me to get engaged in their LGBT-phobic conversation and jokes. It seemed like they wouldn't listen to me when I insinuate it's offensive and makes me uncomfortable (because I am a hetero cis woman), and I really want them to stop spreading those awful jokes while at work (at least when I'm nearby).</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>What can I do to try to get my coworkers to stop their <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/LGBTphobia"" rel=""noreferrer"">LGBT-phobic</a> conversation during work time?</strong><br>
I would like to avoid confrontational suggestions if possible, since I'm gonna be around for a while and I would like to maintain a cordial atmosphere despite our differences of opinions.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>They often start debates (most of the time on topics involving racism / homophobia / rape apology / ...). I'm bothered by the fact they do this during work time but mostly by their opinions themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>My manager doesn't know about it, but they're not managing all of us. </p></li>
<li><p>Yesterday I told them that my mom is non-binary<sup>1</sup> after a very offensive and inappropriate joke. They were saying that LGBTQ+ people are freaks and that we should get rid of all of them, so I just ""dropped the bomb"". They laughed at me and went on. This made me really mad so I just put my earphones back on and didn't talk to them for the rest of the day, but it persisted for at least 30 other minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Those are not ""just jokes"". They actually stand by the opinion held by their jokes. But TBH their hatred seems to be based more on ignorance and fear than real knowledge of LGBTQ+ ""world"", if I may.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not trying to change their opinion. I surely don't agree with them, but it is not my place to try to change their mind, plus I'm not sure I could even change something. I'd just like them to stop uttering death-threatening jokes towards one specific part of the population during work time.</p></li>

<p><sup><sup>1</sup>: My mother does not consider herself a trans woman. She is what we call in French an ftoX, namely ""female to unknown"". There's no such thing in French as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they"" rel=""noreferrer"">neutral they</a> (well, it's only starting with the ""iel"" pronoun but people fight not to use it), so we make a difference between (fe-)male (which stands for the sex) and (wo-)man (for the gender).

"How to explain to customer service they are wrong without being rude","<p>I have been put in a situation where I am quite sure that I am right, and customer service for a country-leading webshop are most likely wrong. How do I tell them that they are wrong without offending anyone or implying that they are bad at their job?</p>

<p>The backstory: 
I am part of a community of hardware enthusiasts who watched a release of a series of products. Almost no information whatsoever was given out about the release in in advance, but through the community I managed to get the point in time where the release was going to happen, and order within seconds of the product page appearing on one of the biggest webshops in my country. An order confirmation was sent out to my email account 2minutes after release. This was just over a week ago.</p>

<p>This was not fast enough to take part of the original stock. And availability is so bad that the webshop did not have and thus give out any information about when the next re-stocks would happen. Just that they might get a handfull of small deliveries until january, and that the people who ordered early will get their packages sent in the order of their ordernumber(corresponding to the time they placed their order). Being sure of the timing of my order being good, I called customer service and asked them if the fact that my order was pay on delivery and picked up at a store of their close to where I live would mean I would have a place in the queue with everyone else, I was assured that I would.</p>

<p>On friday, a small delivery was made and many of the enthusiasts in the community expressed their joy over having their packages send. The status on my order did not change, making me think their new batch is sent and im not part of the lucky few. </p>

<p>After asking the other people in the community at what time they placed their order, many of them had ordered several minutes later than me, and gotten order confirmations almost 10minutes later than me. I asked customer service about this and got the reply that the placement of the order did not necessarily correspond perfectly with the sending of the order confirmation. </p>

<p>So I started asking the others about their order numbers, and while one of them had a lower ordernumber than me, the rest of them did not. I vented my frustration at my situation and one person contacted me telling me he is in the exact same situation as me, and that he has the same circumstances in his order(""pay on delivery and picked up at a store of their close to where I live""). After asking around, it appeared that none of the ones who had their packages sent had that choice in their order.</p>

<p>This lead me to feel that I had confirmed my suspicions regarding pay on delivery and picking up at the store. </p>

<p>After getting this information, I wrong a long email with all my findings and asking them how they can compensate me for this error, although the damage has already been made. After reading through the email I deleted it, thinking it just seemed rude and arrogant, and thinking ""If I got this email as customer service, I would not feel happy to help this person"".</p>

<p>How do I achieve this? How should I formulate my disappointment and tell them how their own process is wrong without being rude?</p>

"How do I to tell someone to stop criticizing what we do?","<p>TL;DR: <strong>How do I to tell a <em>judgemental</em> person with unsubstantiated statements, making it a clear and definitive statement, that she may not move things around in our office?</strong></p>

<p>That person (I'll call her ""Alice"") isn't business-related but is family-related to my business partner.</p>

<p>""Alice"" always criticizes, not directly with words, but rather with small actions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Background: I run a small business with a founding partner (FP) I've known for years and worked with before. We did everything by ourselves <strong>but</strong> one thing: we needed legal and business/marketing advice from someone, and my FP's mother-in-law (""Alice"") had that name in her professional address book. She introduced us to the person, all went fine, we thanked her. Before we opened, we had all the stuff put in the office, from desks to PC to flowers and paintings, well, everything to have a nice and functional environment/workplace. 6/8 weeks later, we set up a small and friendly <em>Opening Party</em>, inviting family, friends, and some neighbours.</p>

<p>What Alice did (twice! before the opening date, and at the opening party) was moving things around, saying <em>it's much better here</em>, <em>it'll look good here</em>, or <em>you can't have this here!</em>. And so on... No matter why <strong>we want and need</strong> things organized one way, for customers or ourselves, she'll step in and mess the whole thing up.</p>

<p>What I did:</p>

<ol>
<li>say nothing, and put stuff back to its place.</li>
<li>say nicely (kind of slightly joking tone) ""we need it here for [ X ] reason, you know..."", and put stuff back to its place.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I didn't know her before my FP suggested he asks her for help <em>once</em> on our behalf.</li>
<li>We often have customers saying that our office is cute, feels warm and welcoming.</li>
<li>To me, Alice's one of the most selfish, arrogant and disdainful people I've ever met. Her words and gestures carry the highest level of lack of respect I've seen in one's behaviour. No need to say I avoid her anytime I can, as I believe she's not, as <strong>she thinks</strong>, the <em>best person in the world, the only one that Earth is worth feeding, with such a good taste, and the only one who knows perfectly how it works and how things should be done</em>.</li>
<li>This happens at the workplace but is more related to IPS as it's not about customer/staff relationship, which I can handle in a professional manner.</li>
<li>FP is 100% with me and will let me handle it my way.</li>
<li>""Alice"" works at a place very close to our office. Her daughter (FP's GF) comes to pick him up for lunch, or after work. They find it convenient to meet at our's. GF thinks her mother's the best on earth, nothing wrong with her...</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, I just talk to my FP and <strong>my</strong> GF about her, and they both agree: roughly, <em>no comment about such a personality and behaviour...</em></p>

<p>Alice is irritating, and now, next time she comes around and starts over again, I feel like I won't be able to remain calm and (at the very least) restrain myself from throwing her a pointed/acerbic comment. I even thought about telling her that she's <strong>not welcome</strong> to visit us anymore. As I don't owe her <em>anything</em> (but respect?), and I don't want to hurt my FP feelings or put him in trouble, I'm looking for a good/better way to handle this irritating situation.</p>

"How to respond when people mock a skill or talent they just found out you do/have?","<p>I am a fairly high level, long time practicing martial artist. Generally when talking to people I don't know, if the subject comes up I get (almost invariably) one of two reactions from people that are not also martial artists.</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh, you do TKD? I took [insert art here] for x months y years ago. I got to [insert low rank here] but had to give it up.</li>
<li>Wow, I guess I better not get you mad then!</li>
</ul>

<p>The first is easily handled, I tell them that's great, it's too bad you didn't keep at it but you can always go back.</p>

<p>The second is pretty much a grit my teeth and smile kind of thing, as to me it perpetuates a bad stereotype that anyone trained in martial arts is some sort of slobbering grobian ready to explode into violence at the slightest provocation.</p>

<p>How can I respond in a way that is tactful and yet lets them know the comment is inappropriate?</p>

<p>To clarify the second part: yes, I can tell when it is just an idle comment, and yes, there have been a <em>lot</em> of the sarcastic/mocking/derogatory tones. Same for the first, if they seem interested I reciprocate, if it is an idle response I go along the lines of what I stated. I am more seeking input on the second type of response.</p>

"How to politely communicate to your manager that what they did upset you and ask that it doesn't happen again?","<p>Related <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3884/how-to-communicate-to-someone-at-work-that-they-are-overstepping-boundaries"">How to communicate to someone at work that they are overstepping boundaries</a>.</p>

<p>This happened recently to a girlfriend, Mary, at work. Mary works as a cashier for a large department store that carries expensive clothes. 
At some point, during her shift, she notices the floor manager, Nina, talking to a customer whom she had happened to take care of in the past, pointing at her. They then approach together, and Nina asks Mary to take care of him.</p>

<p>There were other cashiers available but for obvious reasons the customer wanted my friend to ""take care of him"".  </p>

<p>Mary processes the customer's purchases and upon finishing, the customer leaves her his card, smiles and says ""call me"". </p>

<p>Mary got really annoyed and upset not only with the customer (she thought this was completely inappropriate regardless of her being in a relationship) but also with her manager, Nina. </p>

<p>She remained upset the entire time but didn't say anything. During a short break, Nina approached her and asked her if she was upset. Mary shook her head, and said nothing, though she was clearly affected by what had happened. She was afraid to put herself in a position to be laid off, were she to cause trouble by talking to Nina's supervisor about it and making this a bigger deal (?). </p>

<p>Mary ONLY works the register. She ONLY processes purchases. It's not that she was going to do something different than the other women who also work the register. It's not that she had helped the customer for an hour to choose a suit or something. </p>

<p>Even though the customer most likely didn't tell Nina he was going to ask Mary to call him, common sense tells both Mary and me,  that he wanted the opportunity to talk to Mary and unless Nina is completely clueless, she should have had more tact. </p>

<p>She asked me what I'd have done and I told her I would have talked to the store manager regardless but Mary didn't want to involve them. I, nevertheless, agreed that what Nina had done wasn't right. </p>

<p><strong>How could Mary have politely communicated to Nina that what Nina had done was inappropriate and unprofessional when asked ""Did you get upset?"" and ask that she doesn't do that again?</strong>  </p>

"What does not initiating and not asking questions back mean?","<p>I have an online friend who I have been talking to for the past few months. Let's call her Alice. We get along well and share some interests and can talk about stuff for a while.</p>

<p>I've begun to feel like I'm always the one who has to initiate conversation, and when I'm talking to her, I'm usually the one asking questions (to keep the conversation going) which she answers earnestly. She doesn't sound uninterested or bothered by my questions.</p>

<p>For example, we might be talking about holidays we've been on. I'll say I've been to X, Y and Z, she says she's been to A, B, and C, and to keep the conversation going I'll ask her questions about the places she visited or where else she'd like to travel to, but she doesn't ask me about the places I've been to or any other questions unless I start talking about them first.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My social skills aren't great so I'm trying to learn what different cues mean. Does her behaviour ""mean"" anything like, am I doing something wrong, is this warning of a deeper problem, or is this normal?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I encourage her to initiate conversations and ask questions back?</p></li>
<li><p>From what I understand, you go from acquaintances to friends when both parties care about each other, and she has said that I am her good friend and that she trusts me. But in another friendship, me and a different person asking questions about each other or showing mutual interest in each others' things means ""care"". Is there something that I'm missing with my friendship with Alice or am I worrying too much?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: <br />
I don't think the issue is a lack of interest. She's told me that she thinks of me as a good friend, she's said that she enjoys our chats and is fine with my questions, and she does reply to me with well-thought-out answers. I like talking to her because we have several niche interests in common that we like to discuss at length. We are similar ages and from similar cultures.</p>

"What's the average comforting time after breakups?","<p>I have a friend, whom I'm not especially close to. After his breakup from his long-time girlfriend (> 5 yrs) he started sending me a lot of texts with mostly very mundane contents. I usually text little back (what is there to text, when someone sends pictures of new drinking glasses that look very... well, just normal?).
I understand he's probably lonely after the breakup and seeks alternative attention, but I'm not interested in providing such outside what's usually common between superficial friends. </p>

<p>Since I've already been accused of being very unsympathetic (which I don't deny), but also slowly get annoyed of the constant random texts, I wonder:</p>

<p>Is there something like an average ""expiration date"" up to which one has to be nice and understanding to a ""not-best-friend"" (of opposite gender, if it makes any difference)? If yes, how long would this be? I haven't had any relationships that long nor have I experienced any extremely hard break-ups.</p>

<p>Note: I have the impression, I'm the best (?) female friend among many, many male friends, albeit not being very close. I have considered that sometimes men find it easier to talk to women about emotional topics than to other men, but he doesn't seem to talk about the break-up (I have offered to listen, but haven't pushed after he didn't). I'm actually not really interested, just thought one usually should offer. </p>

"How do I deal with a mother who won't take ""no"" for an answer?","<p>My mother is quite single-minded in getting what she wants.  Unfortunately, she also has only a single tactic: trying to convince me every single time we talk.</p>

<p>Most of these things are products or activities that my wife and I have no interest in.  Yet saying ""no"" is not a solution.  It just leads to us having to explain why we're not interested, and then reply to every single counter she provides to our objections.  Eventually, the topic will be dropped... only to continue the very next time we communicate, at which point we have to start the whole thing over.</p>

<p>Examples include activities like kayaking, one of those food services where they send weekly packages to your house containing all of the ingredients for a single meal along with the recipes, and an expensive ""concierge healthcare service"" that is basically paying someone to facilitate doctor visits and handling healthcare issues. </p>

<p>When I was in my 30's, there was a span of several years where she was trying to get me to buy a kayak so I could go with her.  No matter how I phrased my complete lack of interest, she refused to accept it.  I tried responses like ""kayaking doesn't sound fun to me"", ""I can't afford it"", and ""I don't have any place to store a kayak"".  She had a counter for each one (""try it!  You'll love it once you're on the water... I did!"", ""they're not that expensive, and you can get payment plans!"", and ""you can rent storage with us!"").  The only reason she stopped asking is because she stopped kayaking.</p>

<p>My wife and I discussed the meal service, and agreed that it was too expensive, and not something we were interested in, because we already make meals similar to what they offer.  After 6 months of it being brought up every time, and our responding ""no"" in every way we could think of, my mother gave my wife a gift certificate for the program for my wife's birthday present.  The gift certificate was enough to cover one-and-a-half meals for two (we have a son, and they don't offer meals for three).  After that, every conversation with my mother involved ""so, what did you think?"" followed by audible disappointment when we said we hadn't tried it yet.</p>

<p>We did eventually shell out the money to get 4 meals (there was no option for 2 or 3 meals), paying out-of-pocket for more than the amount of the gift certificate.  We found it wasteful, overrated, and surprisingly inconvenient.  We then had to explain this to her on half a dozen different occasions before she finally dropped it.</p>

<p>The concierge service seems to be trying to solve a problem we don't have (long waiting times for appointments, difficulty understanding test results, forgetting routine visits, etc.), and is expensive.  But apparently my mother and her husband will get a discount if we sign up as a referral, so I fear that this one will keep coming up for months.  We've already politely told her that we're not interested about 8 or 9 times, in a variety of ways.</p>

<h3>How can I get her to stop badgering us over things we're not interested in?</h3>

"How to join in when people are gossiping?","<p>I have been struggling with this for quite a while now. Sometimes, I have to interact with people whom I did not choose as friends (read: family and neighbors). After the last event (a neighborhood barbeque), I had a talk with my mother about me leaving (in her opinion) too early. I told her I didn't like the event at all because</p>

<ul>
<li>the food wasn't especially good </li>
<li>the temperature wasn't nice for having a barbeque </li>
<li>the general vibe wasn't fun, there was nobody there that I felt I could and wanted to talk to. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, we had some more talks about me talking with family and neighbors. Mom stated: ""You always give the impression that people are too dumb to be worth talking to"". This is bothering me a lot, because I don't want people to think that I think I'm better than them. I know I have my flaws and shortcomings as well, so I don't consider myself to be 'above' them. </p>

<p>Last night we talked a bit more about it, and we came to the conclusion that </p>

<ul>
<li>I'm talking about topics that aren't considered fun by them. I like talking about politics, current events, ethics, philosophy, sociology. Just exchanging facts, broadening my horizon, no fierce discussions are necessary (although I do like having those as well, within reason). </li>
<li>They are talking about topics that I'm not interested in at all. It mostly consists of the latest small-town gossip like those people are getting a divorce, they are selling their house and he's homosexual. I come from a small village where there are a lot of people that call themselves Christians, so things like divorces and homosexuality are scandalous and gossip about them can go on for an entire evening. </li>
</ul>

<p>So basically, since I personally don't like gossiping, when somebody brings up a topic of divorce, I usually try to gently steer the conversation away from gossip and to current events or, if we keep with the divorce example, to e.g. the merits of pre-nuptial agreements. According to my Mom, this is considered rude by some people, and others have voiced to her that I'm coming across as more and more haughty/snooty. </p>

<p>I honestly want these people to not think of me that way because I honestly don't think they're 'below' me, and I hate being seen as haughty because I'm always trying to be polite and humble. But I'm not the kind of person that can participate in gossiping either. <em>So I'm wondering if this gossiping is a skill that can be learned. If yes, how do I join these people in their conversations without being seen as haughty? How do I prevent changing the topic to something that would be considered snooty by them?</em> Because if I could join them in their gossip, these evenings would be more fun and more bearable for me.</p>

"Why do people flirt in customer service situations?","<p>I ran into this twice today with two different customers and it's a little strange to me. I almost thought it was just me being aspie and misreading the situation when it happened yesterday, but after today I'm pretty sure it was flirting.</p>

<p>I just don't quite get why a person would feel the need to flirt with someone who's already being paid fairly well to help them. Like it would almost make sense if we were negotiating a price or something, but that isn't the case here, and even then that's ethically questionable.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure they weren't actually shooting for a date, the repeat offender told me that she was married. And I'm not a great looking guy, not hideous or anything, but definitely not someone who normally attracts an awful lot of that kind of attention.</p>

<p>To be clear, this wasn't a sexual harassment situation. Just light, mostly harmless, flirting. Standing a little too close, batting eyelashes, asking when I'd be working tomorrow sort of stuff.</p>

<p>It's probably relevant that I work for a religious non-profit organization. Flirting would generally be considered inappropriate in the environment.</p>

<p>I guess I'm at a bit of a loss as to why people would flirt in a customer service situation and a little clueless about how to respond. Thus far I've been trying to be friendly, but professional like I usually am. I'm not offended, or looking for a way to make them stop, more looking for some insight into why people do this.</p>

<p>So... If you're someone who has flirted in customer service situations, or someone who still does, why do you do it? What's the goal there?</p>

"What to do when a group conversation is not interesting?","<p>Here's a little background on what type of people I'm dealing with:</p>

<ul>
<li>They're all in the same university that I go to. It's a faculty of engineering that has the most strict entrance exam in my country, so we generally all have high intellectual levels (But incidentally outside of class they talk like any average person).</li>
<li>Their subjects include but are not limited to fashion, sports, cars, money/work, or sometimes they just tell random funny stories, which are all topics that I can neither find interesting, nor able to talk about because I'm unaffiliated with anything related to those topics.</li>
<li>Most of them are pretty good at social interaction, so I have high standards to meet.</li>
<li>It's a grand total of 200 people(that are in the same classes as me). Most of the time, they're different groups of 5 that get together between classes or during long breaks. They're not strangers to me, in fact I've spoken to all of them at some point so I wouldn't be intruding by participating in a group conversation. But I wouldn't explicitly consider any one of them a ""friend"".</li>
<li>I wouldn't call them judgmental at all, in fact I think they're a pretty nice and understanding set of people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Leaving is preferably not an option. I'm not particularly good at socializing so I want to practice by participating in as many group conversations as I can. There isn't any group that I prefer more than others; they're all the same to me.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I've already tried sparking up few topics that interest me (Mathematics, history, music, space exploration, controversial topics and sometimes started debates) but each time the conversation dies out very quickly, as opposed to a heated 1-hour debate they'd had on fuel-efficiency versus speed of modern production cars.</p>

<p>Also, I'm aware of other questions asked on the forum that are similar to mine in topic, but they ask very different things.</p>

"How to deal with anxiety/control issues in relationship","<p>Here's a brief rundown of the situation:</p>

<p>I have issues with fears of abandonment that manifest in very strong anxiety triggered by certain things, such as my girlfriend going out partying for the night. I am currently in a long-distance relationship, which does not exactly make things easier.</p>

<p>Now, first of all: I am well aware that this is <em>my</em> issue, and she is in no way obliged to ""not upset me"". That I shouldn't feel this way, and that she's in no way responsible for how I feel. That she should never feel <em>obliged</em> to do or not do something based solely off how I feel about it. And that anything else is very unhealthy and will lead to pain and resentment further down the road, that she never has to ask me ""permission"" to do something, etc. 
And I tell her that explicitly. </p>

<p>But due to her character, previous experiences, and potentially certain mental health issues of her own, she is <em>very</em> afraid of upsetting me. And I cannot hide the fact that I am upset. I do (truthfully) tell her that I would never get angry at her about anything of this kind, and that it's not her fault or her burden to bear, but the crux of the matter is that such things <em>do</em> cause me crippling anxiety (e.g. quite vigorous physical shaking, racing heartbeat, and inability to sleep). So to her, that is a sort of ""punishment"", even though I do not want it to be - effective enough that she on her own actively avoids anything that she thinks might upset me, which in turn leads to her feeling controlled.</p>

<p>I have been having difficulties with this for a while, and while it has gotten better over the years, it recently worsened drastically when my last girlfriend, weeks before we were to move in together, cheated on me and ended the relationship without any prior indication issues (she claims she herself was not aware anything was wrong). We parted ways amicably, since there's no point in blaming her and the whole episode caused her a lot of grief as well, but it reinforced a lot of fears. </p>

<p>The resulting questions are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I communicate to her (besides just saying it obviously) that while this is obviously some kind of trust issue, that doesn't reflect on how I feel about her and is in no way her fault?</li>
</ul>

<p>And, if this is still applicable to this stack,</p>

<ul>
<li>What are strategies to feel less anxious about those things? I receive plenty of affection which I appreciate a lot. And in the moment, it makes me feel alright with those sorts of situations. But having very emotionally heavy conversations every time she wants to go out is not feasible.</li>
</ul>

<p>This whole thing was more or less triggered by her intention to ""dress up like a slut and go to a party"" for Halloween (her wording), and I would greatly appreciate any advice on how not to actively dread that or any similar occasion arising on the horizon, or at least speak to my girlfriend about it in a fashion that doesn't implicitly blackmail her into restricting herself.</p>

<p>This is my first time posting here, so I'm sorry if it is out of place or badly worded. Thank you in advance for any advice</p>

"How to handle being accosted by shop staff when walking past store?","<p>Occasionally I walk past this cell phone store and sometimes when the store is empty there's an employee (or the owner) standing outside accosting passers by. </p>

<p>Now, when it's busy on the sidewalk I just smile and mumble hello and keep going but once when it was just me on the sidewalk I couldn't avoid him so I kept walking and smiled awkwardly and he sarcastically said ""have a nice day!"" as I walked away and I felt like a heel. It's gotten to the point where I take a detour to avoid walking past that store now.</p>

<p>This actually happens with homeless persons too, ""hello sir can I ask you a question?"", which forces you to either be rude and ignore the person, making your next encounter more awkward, or actually stopping and being put on the spot.</p>

"How do I help my girlfriend open up?","<p><strong>So a little background on our relationship.</strong></p>

<p>We've been dating for about a year and a half now. We're now getting to the conversation of marriage and I'm super excited to see what the future holds. However, getting her to open up is like pulling teeth with a toothpick. She's told me repeatedly she really wants to be able to open up but just has a hard time doing so. She won't even tell me why she has a hard time opening up, which I guess is opening up in and of itself. I've never done anything to break her trust (e.g. texting exes, being flirty with other women, etc.) nor has she had a previous relationship so I don't believe she's been hurt by someone in the past. </p>

<p>Our current living situation is a bit unusual. I'm living about 4 hours away for an internship while she lives with my family due to her family living halfway across the world. We see each other about every 2 weeks or so.</p>

<p>I call her just about 2-3 times a day just asking simple things like how was her day, how did she sleep, what was her favorite part of the day, etc. She sends me pictures of her crocheting projects, her watercolor paintings, and I take interest in what she loves to do. I also often ask how her family is doing, if she's talked to her mom and her sisters, and how her brother in the marines is holding up.</p>

<h2>Today</h2>

<p>Well, last night I didn't sleep well so I forgot to call her this morning. So she calls me on my way to work. Meanwhile, she's asking me about my work, the project that I'm doing, asking me to describe it which I really didn't want to do because it would've taken too long to explain with her lack of understanding of the topic. I wanted to just enjoy my morning playlist and the sunrise on my commute. In my groggy self, I just have short responses. She asks me if I'm annoyed with her, and I respond honestly and tell her that I'm not really in the mood to talk and I can call her later. So I tell her I love her and we end the conversation.</p>

<p>Then immediately after, she sends me a text. Here is our conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her: ""Babe, the reason I call you is because I really miss my family
  and having someone to comfort me. I just wanted you to know and
  understand..."" </p>
  
  <p>Me: ""So call your family""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""I don't think you understand""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""What is there to understand? You miss your family so it would be
  natural to call your family""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""And I do. But sometimes what I want to hear from you as the person
  I'm closest to is that you care for me and that you're there for me""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""We talk every day""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""So you think that all I need in life is to talk to you on the
  phone and hear how each others day was or how the other person slept
  and that's good enough?""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""What do you expect me to do? Drive 4 hours every morning?</p>
  
  <p>H: ""That's not what I mean and you know it""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""So then why are you getting mad at me?""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""No. Of course not. I just sometimes need to hear in words that you
  care for me and are here for me when I'm hurting. That's all!""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""I tell you every day so what's wrong""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""I'm sorry I bothered you. Never mind""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""Wait, why am I the bad guy now?""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""You're not""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""You're obviously mad at me""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""I'm not mad, I'm just hurt and lonely. I'm sorry. It's my fault
  that I bottle up my feelings until the breaking point then expect you
  to know what's going on. That's not your fault. That's mine.""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""Why didn't you say something sooner?""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""Because I don't know how to""</p>
  
  <p>M: ""What would you like me to do?""</p>
  
  <p>H: ""Nothing I guess. It's my fault. I'm sorry.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conversation continues a bit. Being the beginning of the workday, I tell her I'll call her during lunch. During that phone call, she tells me for the fortieth time how she has trouble opening up. And again, for the fortieth time, I try to be as kind and as gentle as I can be so she can tell me whatever is going on. And yet, she can't. </p>

<h2>What I've already tried</h2>

<p>I've tried a billion things to help her to open up to me on her terms. I lavish her in gifts. I put off things at work to call her. I call her too and from work. I call her before bed. Whenever we're together, we watch the movies she wants to watch, I take her to go get a pedicure (fellas, I highly recommend a pedicure. They feel amazing) I try my hand at watercolor which I suck at, I cuddle with her the way she wants to cuddle and never make her feel uncomfortable. I make her her favorite tea. I cook dinner for her. I've tried expressing my love for her in all five love languages. I've opened up to her myself telling her about my dreams, desires, aspirations as well as my hurts, struggles, and previous relationships. If none of those above show my care and love for her, I don't know what will.</p>

<p>It's starting to be a burden on me because I'm trying to be available whenever she needs me but then when I want to do the things that I want to do, that's when she calls me and wants to have a 3 hour long Facetime call. And I'll be as straightforward and honest as I can and tell her that I'm tired and want to relax by blowing up stuff in battlefield. And even still, I'll opt for the 3-hour long facetime call over a Dota match with my guys.</p>

<p>To top it all off, my mother, whom I love very much, is quite religious and hates it when my girlfriend and I have any kind of physical affection (because we're not married) and has let us both know how she doesn't want any cuddling in her house. I've respected that rule to a certain extent when I'm visiting. However, being financially independent of my parents and having lived on my own for 3 years now, I have trouble being dictated by someone who used to <em>excessively</em> discipline me (another story). My girlfriend, on the other hand, cannot stand disappointing anyone (except me, apparently), especially both of our parents.</p>

<p>However, it's put a strain on our relationship because 1) my love language is physical affection and 2) whenever we do get a chance to cuddle, my girlfriend gets up and walks away whenever she hears footsteps. So in my mind, she's putting my mother's opinion of her above our relationship, which is extremely hurtful. I've even told her and opened up to her about this.</p>

<p>And now she's telling me that she's lonely which I figured but has never explicitly told me and only does tell me through text.</p>

<h2>My Questions</h2>

<p>Is there anything that I'm doing wrong? What can I do to help her to open up?</p>
"
"How do I answer a question about not enjoying a party without revealing sensitive information","<p>I don't go to parties often, in fact I actively avoid it as much as humanly possible. Still, sometimes social obligations get the better of me and I begrudgingly attend.</p>

<p>Most of the times then I'll be in a corner or somewhere a little off from groups of people and trying to fight back a growing headache / nursing a glass of water. This isn't because these parties are bad or the host isn't trying, they're just not for me.</p>

<p>Here's where my problem starts. Sometimes the host will notice that I'm not having a good time and ask me about why. Is the party bad? Are other people annoying me? </p>

<p>The problem here is that I can't answer these questions truthfully without revealing details about myself I'd really rather not (mental health issues, for instance). I'm not very good at lying so making excuses mostly falls flat for me. </p>

<p>It's gotten to the point where the hosts of these parties sometimes inquire with friends or family of mine about what's wrong with me when I don't give them an actual answer.</p>

<p>Is there a socially graceful way to let someone know the fact that you're not enjoying yourself isn't their fault and they don't need to worry, preferably without revealing things like my medical history?</p>
"
"Told you are wrong when you aren't by a boss","<p>A long time ago I worked for a chef who would ask questions as <em>teaching moments</em> frequently. This is something I have seen a lot of chefs do, and I have done it myself. Something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need you to do A. While doing A make sure you do process B. Do you
  know why we do process B?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However no matter what answer I gave, I was never correct. He would then rephrase my answer and repeat it back to me as the real answer. This was a problem for two reasons. </p>

<ul>
<li>At that point in my career it was important to start demonstrating
that I knew what I was doing and <em>why</em>.</li>
<li>It felt crummy to be told I was wrong all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I never contradicted him. I never told him he was wrong, or more to the point that we were both right. He wasn't stupid. He wasn't simply misunderstanding that we were both saying the same thing. (He was better educated than me.) I wasn't a know-it-all. I didn't act like I knew everything. In fact I used to get so excited when I actually knew the answer because I was only just beginning to be able to answer questions like that effectively.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When making hollandaise it is important to whisk vigorously and
  constantly. Do you know why that is?</p>
  
  <p>Because it keeps the sauce from breaking and helps make it nice and
  fluffy.</p>
  
  <p>No. You have to stir it constantly because if it separates it is
  ruined.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like my steak rare but I eat burgers well done. There is simply more
  of a risk with ground beef. do you know why that is?</p>
  
  <p>Because the biggest concern is with surface bacteria and ground beef
  has far more surface area than a steak. You are also still cooking the
  surface of the steak.</p>
  
  <p>No. It's because the grinding process spreads the bacteria through all
  of the meat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's worth noting in the second example that there is a slightly different answer but they are related and it is not unreasonable to assume that the answerer might understand that. Both answers actually left out the more significant nuance, which is that industrial grinders process far more meat between cleanings and spread the contamination across larger batches.</p>

<p>That was a long while back, and I chose to deal with the situation by moving on. I found a new job within a month and got away from him. What if I had been unable to find another job and had been stuck working there? <strong>How could I have handled him so that he would have stopped telling me I was wrong?</strong></p>

"How do I deal with coworkers messing with me because of my shyness?","<p>I've worked at my job for over a year and I barely speak to anyone. I'm very much a loner and don't prefer socializing or interacting with others, I keep to myself. My other coworkers know this and until recently I assumed they understood and were fine with this, but lately I've noticed behavior from a few that would suggest they are not.</p>

<p>One day when I was coming into work (I work outside) everybody was gathered in a certain area and I was going towards the locker area to put my bag away. As I was walking someone yelled out ""HOW'S IT GOING!!!!"" at the top of his voice, bringing everybody's attention to me. Everybody knows I don't like any attention so he did this deliberately. He did this either to intimidate me or to see what I'd do. Naturally I was intensely nervous and with everybody looking at me listening to how I'd respond, all I could utter was a weak ""Hey"". Everybody laughed and I moved on.</p>

<p>That was the second time that happened to me in a month (the other time was with a different person). Moreover, the person who yelled out at me isn't a workplace bully and hasn't been rude to me before. In fact later during the rest of the day they were being friendly with me and acting like it never happened.</p>

<p>But the incident really embarrassed me and ruined the entire day for me. However, I don't want to go to management about this. I'd rather deal with it directly.</p>

<p>There's the option of going up to the person directly and letting him know that I don't like being called out like that, but I think he's aware of that and it's the reason he did it.</p>

<p>Another option would be the way I respond to being called out in that moment. This I have no clue how to do because my response would have to be calm and confident, which I don't know how to do.</p>

<p>What can I do next time this happens? How do I ensure this doesn't happen again without getting on anyone's bad side?</p>

"I slapped my 8 year old cousin. What was a better way to handle the situation?","<p>I am a 24 year old boy. My aunt was visiting our home. Her son is an eight year old. He is a most uncontrollable, hyperactive boy. For example, he will switch on the television, watch it from about half a metre away from it, at full volume. He is always pestering me to play with me, which I oblige mostly. But when I have my own work, it is impossible if this kid is nearby. I was trying to study in some other room. The adults were in another room talking but he would follow me around everywhere and wouldn't leave me alone for a second. Basically, I cannot touch my phone to even chat cause he is addicted to games and would forcefully take my phone. When it would not open, he would tap it hard. Even if your phone does not have games, don't worry, because this kid will download some games too. He is a bother but mostly I can handle him, when I am at leisure. Thankfully, I don't have to deal with often, as he lives a bit far off.</p>

<p>Today was different though. I had to study and I was under quite a bit of stress. Also, I was under stress due to some other factors too. I tried balancing both (studying and my cousin's attention), would interact with him some and then tell him I have to study now. Sometimes he would oblige, sometimes he would bang things for my attention, or close all windows or whatever. So, I finally gave up. It was almost time for my aunt to leave, so I opened my kindle to read. Now, my cousin comes up and forcefully taps on it for my attention. This was probably the first time he had seen a Kindle, and he wants me to play with him. I said no, so he continues tapping on it. This time I snapped. I slapped him. He tried to keep a brave face and was smiling still, but he was obviously hurt and his eyes were moist by the time he left. I was shocked too. i tried to ask him if he was hurt. It wasn't a hard smack but I had lost control. I tried playing with him but the awkwardness was there. Soon, aunt called for him to leave. Nobody knew about it and he didn't tell anyone either.</p>

<p>I didn't get the opportunity to apologise properly, and I regret the incident. Whatever be the situation it was my failing and I will never let something like that happen again. In retrospect, I should have just kept the gadget inside when he started ""tapping"" on it. [By the way, not a justification but he damaged my old iPad in the past also one of the reasons why I snapped.] </p>

<p>I feel I lack tact when dealing with such situations, like I am very straight laced and not good at coming up with lies, even white ones. Is there any way to make him understand that he should respect other people's feelings too and that there are boundaries. At this age, is it not normal for kids to have grasped these things? </p>

<p><strong>What's the generally accepted social protocol of dealing with recalcitrant kids of this age, especially when they are not yours and their parents are loving the fact that the kid is bothering someone else and not them?</strong></p>
"
"How to get recognition for the cleaning I do?","<p>I live in a shared house with several other roommates. One of them signed the lease with the owner, and thus has authority to kick anyone out. Call him Dylan. Another roommate, Bob, is very outspoken and usually is the one making the actual decisions. </p>

<p>When I moved in I was told there was a cleaning system where everyone is on a schedule and has different chores that benefit the whole house (so not just cleaning up after yourself, but things like sweeping the hallway). I was never added to this cleaning system until several months later when we had our first roommate meeting. </p>

<p>I began to sense a negative vibe and couldn’t get a straight answer out of Bob/Dylan what was wrong. From the way they spoke to me, they seemed mad but wouldn’t tell me why. I spoke with my friend who was the one who recommended me to move in, asking if he could find out what was up. He told me they were mad at me because I hadn’t been helping clean, and they are thinking of kicking me out. My ""friend"" told Dylan I had been complaining a lot, and I guess this pushed him over the edge and he finally confronted me saying I didn’t do cleaning for the first several months.</p>

<p>The following statements are true facts</p>

<ol>
<li>I am bad at cleaning, in the sense that specific ideas just don't occur to me (for example my roommate said he swept under the rug and that idea never occurred to me) and I guess I'm not as sensitive to dust as other people</li>
<li>I would like to continue living in the house for at least another year</li>
<li>I am willing to make a change</li>
<li>On several occasions I had asked Bob/Dylan if there was something I could do to help but was not given a clear answer</li>
<li>Bob and Dylan live on a different floor than I do, so I only share the main floor with them. So this is what they use to assess how much cleaning I've been doing.</li>
<li>I normally try NOT to clean when people are around, as to not inconvenience them. </li>
</ol>

<p>This is my understanding based on my observations: to Bob and Dylan it’s very important people take initiative and not be asked to clean. But it seems that they need to judge whether someone is helping or not. Most other people in the house make a big show of it when they’re doing something, I had assumed this was just their personality but I guess this is some kind of hidden way to prove they are helping. For example when someone was mopping he would say ""come look how dirty the water is!"" or ""I’m going out to cut the grass now!"". My personality is not like that, I think it’s immature to try to impress people by showing them you’re doing work. But, I’m willing to compromise. </p>

<p><strong>So the question is, what’s the best way to get Dylan and Bob to think I am cleaning?</strong> I am comfortable taking pictures before and after and sending to them as proof, though this may be a bit too overt.  (Dylan likes to stress the importance of ""trust"" though I think he’s being a bit hypocritical of this if he’s accusing me of not cleaning enough, so I think a discreet method is necessary).</p>

<p>My other idea is to clean up at the same time another person is, so he can vouch for me. I could play it up as ""I just find it more motivating when I see someone else cleaning"" (which I do).</p>

<p>I find it’s becoming counterproductive: now I see no point in cleaning unless someone is watching me since I’ll still would be accused of not cleaning. Also, being a shared house, I err on the side of caution. There are many situations where I see something that could be junk but I don’t want to through it out or move it encase someone needs it. To complicate matters my assigned chores are currently obsolete (the dishwasher broke down and there is snow on the lawn). Also since so many people are doing other things, I find it hard to find something that hasn't already been cleaned. This is why I tried asking what I can do to help, but they find this annoying. To be clear I always have been helping with cleaning, just not enough in comparison with the amount Bob and Dylan do.</p>

<p>In these types of situations would it help smooth things over if I make a friendly gesture, like buy pizza for everyone for dinner (of course in addition to actually cleaning more)?</p>
"
"How to give constructive feedback to a restaurant owner when they ask after a meal?","<p>So I had a interesting incident recently, and I wonder if I addressed it properly.</p>

<p>My friend and I stumbled into an amazing Mexican place after an event we attended. This restaurant was sort low-key, hole-in-the-wall type of place, super authentic food, and with excellent service. We loved it immediately.</p>

<p>Anyhow, since it was still kinda brunch hours (at least for me) I ordered a coffee, black (""cafe negro"", the menu said) before the main dish. However, the waitress brought me literally <em>a jar of Nescafe instant coffee, a cup of hot water, and a small plastic container of milk.</em> My friend and I, semi regular coffee drinkers, just kinda sat there for a bit, confused... I looked over the menu (which I kept since I intended to later order another drink) and <strong>nowhere on there did it say <em>instant</em> coffee.</strong> </p>

<p>So the food was amazing, and my friend and I dug it. I tried making a half-hearted attempt at drinking that brown and awful tasting instant ""coffee"" but just couldn't. I am no coffee snob, but I do french-press it semi regularly. I also happen to be Colombian (this apparently would matter to the owner, who must have heard my accent while I flirted a bit with one of the waitresses.)</p>

<p>So, after we had finished the meal, the owner of the restaurant came to the table, and we only had great things to say about the food. However, I did mention that I was a bit confused that when I ordered black coffee, but they brought me this jar of Nescafe instant coffee and hot water, that I was expecting a cup of black coffee. I asked if perhaps they had run out of grounds...? The owner seemed unfazed, and a bit offended and asked ""what what was wrong with the coffee they served, since (technically) that <em>is</em> coffee..."" He asked what the difference was, said that they'd always served it like that, and that maybe I was too used to having the best Colombian coffee.""</p>

<p>I was a quite taken a back by his response. So I basically just replied that I was far from a coffee expert, nor was I expecting any Colombian coffee in a Mexican restaurant, but that it was just a bit confusing (and not the same). I added that most people expect non-instant coffee when you order the ""black coffee"" item on the menu. My friend who is American backed me up. I repeated that we really liked his restaurant and so I was giving him some honest feedback since I really thought there was a big difference between instant coffee and you know...well, coffee..? Anyways, he then just sorta thanked me for the feedback and walked off. I was still charged for the ""coffee.""</p>

<p>Anyways, I think I must have inadvertently offended the owner with the complaint about the coffee... maybe Nescafe instant coffee is a popular thing in Mexico?And it's just a cultural thing to call it just ""black coffee""? I really don't know... I've only been to Cancun and around a few places for tours in the Yucatan, but I know that area heavily caters to American tastes, so... I'm unsure. </p>

<p>How should I have given some feedback about the way something was served or appears on the menu? Or am I just a Colombian coffee snob now...? </p>

"How to introduce change in a process while avoiding conflict?","<p>I'm a 23-years-old Q&amp;A engineer who recently started a job in a company who never had Q&amp;A before.</p>

<p>The other day, I was talking with my chief and the chiefs of the development team and told them that I wanted to ask the devs to always write unit test when fixing a bug. This is something that, I believe, is a pretty regular practice and all the chiefs thought it was a good idea.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the daily stand-up meeting, I went ahead and told the dev team:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe you already do it, but it would be good if you write tests for each bug you correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team is composed of several devs (7 I think) and two of them freak out and were absolutely against the idea (""what if...?""). </p>

<p>I didn't think this was such a big deal (after all, they are supposed to write unit test when programming, but I don't know if they are really doing it) and I think I'm up against what is called ""<a href=""https://www.ukessays.com/essays/management/definition-of-resistance-to-change-management-essay.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">resistance to change</a>"".</p>

<p>So, how could I have present this change in a positive light and such that it wouldn't have raised so much defensiveness?</p>

<h1>Note and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>""Write tests for each bug you correct"" -> When saying this, I hadn't had time to clarify if I was meaning ""every bug fix however trivial"" or more of a general rule. So, what I actually meant have no importance here since they had already reacted. (but, if you must know, I wasn't and still isn't decided on that point).</p></li>
<li><p>I know they have <em>some</em> unit test and, for having written unit tests before, adding one is usually quick (unless you have to do something you haven't done before but this shouldn't happen that often).</p></li>
<li><p>They are suppose to have time to write test in their current workload. If they don't, then Manager is definitively okay to give them more time to do that.</p></li>
<li><p>The lead-in I use before the announcement: ""Hey, I have an announcement"". (So, definitively not a great lead-in).</p></li>

"I have a crush on a coworker but won't act on it, how can I tell my boyfriend about it and that I'll remain faithful?","<p><sub>TL;DR: I find one of my coworkers attractive but I know it'll pass over time. I don't want to engage in anything with this coworker, I'm just waiting for the end of the crush. I think I should tell my boyfriend because my vision of honesty tells me it's the right thing to do. How can I explain this to him and assure him I'm faithful in the meantime?</sub></p>

<hr>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>When I was younger I read the story of a woman who had been married for ten years (she met her husband at the age of 16 and got married at age 20, or something like that). In her testimony, she was explaining that remaining with someone you've met at such a young age for such a long time needed concessions.
She talked about the importance of sincerity, and she said that any time she or her husband had doubts about their relationship, were having a hard time or simply were attracted to someone else, they just told the other one, even if it could hurt, even if it could end in an argument.</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I am in a monogamous relationship with my boyfriend, we promised fidelity to each other and we have common plans for the future (we already concretized some of them, for instance we adopted a shelter cat and it feels to us like we had a child together).</p>

<p>I recently began a new job and I'm not insensitive to one of my coworkers (both about his beauty and his personality). I know these kind of things happen and I am not worried, for I know <a href=""https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/getting-crushes-while-married"" rel=""noreferrer"">it happens and it also goes</a>. I do not want anything to happen with this coworker, I'm just waiting for this crush to end. I'd like to stress the fact that this does <strong>not</strong> prevent me from loving my boyfriend, in fact he's the man I want to marry and I have no problem with the idea of spending the rest of my life with him. The thing is, I recently thought about this woman's testimony and I began to wonder if I was faithful to my boyfriend by not entrusting my crush for another man to him.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>I'd like to tell my boyfriend about this because I do not keep many secrets from him and I don't want to hide it from him, even if this crush doesn't change anything about my feelings for him or my behavior towards him. <strong>How could I address this crush with him while ensuring my faithfulness?</strong></p>

<h2>Based on all things specified in comments:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>I'm not asking for help to ""forget my coworker""</strong>. I specifically stated that I know it'll pass, because these things happen, don't they? <strong>I'm asking for help to gently approach the issue with my boyfriend</strong>, to tell him I find someone attractive without making him believe he's not good enough for me, that I'll cheat on him or leave him.</li>
<li>If my coworker would make any move towards me, <strong>I'd not answer it</strong>. I love my boyfriend and I promised faithfulness to him, and I want to stay with him.</li>
<li>It happens oftentimes that <strong>my boyfriend tells me he finds a woman beautiful</strong> while we're crossing the street. I'm not at ease when he does this because I'm not confident about my own beauty, but we both consider it is natural to be attracted to somebody else, both mentally and physically. I'd like to emphase the fact that <strong>I'm not bothered by the fact that he tells me, I'm bothered by my lack of self-confidence.</strong> 
I on the other hand don't tell him when I see someone attractive, because this is not a habit of mine.</li>
<li>We're both in our mid-20s and in France, we've been together for two years, I'm his first relationship and I've known people before him but he's my longest and most serious relationship. </li>

<h2>How it went</h2>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Some of you asked me to tell you how it went. Actually, the way I did approach the issue isn't very reproducible: Bob knows that I'm quite active on IPS, and so <strong>I told him I've asked this question and that I was amused and impressed by the number of responses I got from it</strong>. This joke gave a chance to open up the dialogue on <strong>whether he'd like to know when I find someone attractive</strong> <em>(because as I said many times, we both consider these things happen, even when engaged in a relationship)</em>.  This conversation ended up very well: I knew after that <strong>what he'd like to know or not</strong>, and I had the opportunity to <strong>let him know I'm not at ease</strong> when he comments my friends' attractiveness.  However, this worked because we have an ""open"" relationship, where we can freely speak of mostly anything, and I'm aware that this isn't very common. If it's not your case, I'd recommend to refer to <strong>Daniel's excellent answer</strong>, or to <strong>OldPadawan's very good piece of advice</strong> if your SO has a sense of humor allowing such kind of jokes.</p>

"How to approach someone about possibly not attending an event without offending?","<p>My younger brother is graduating college this spring. His college is halfway across the country from me, and graduation falls on a holiday weekend. I looked up travel options this weekend:</p>

<ol>
<li>~$1000 for flight, hotel, and rental car</li>
<li>~$300-400 for hotel and gas, and spend 24+ hrs driving there and back (holiday traffic!)</li>
</ol>

<p>That's a lot for me, although not <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p>My brother and I are not close and I have no idea how important it is to him that I attend in person. (Technically he hasn't even told me when his graduation is - I looked it up online - so maybe not that much, but I don't want to assume.)</p>

<p>Another complicating factor is that I'm sure my estranged sister will be there, and for multiple reasons I will be very uncomfortable seeing her. On a couple of occasions in the past my family has gotten upset at me for being uncomfortable. E.g. before complete estrangement but after things had gotten bad, my family visited my area to help my sister move; I was told if I was ""going to be awkward, don't come"". I'm not sure if my brother would feel similarly and prefer I don't go and ruin the happy family get-together.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what if he is offended that I'm even considering skipping it? All my siblings went to my college graduation.. of course, they all lived with my parents within an hour drive at the time.. (and personally I wouldn't have cared that much if someone didn't make it, but I know that's not always the case.) Again, in the past I've been surprised by a family member's reaction when I mentioned possibly not going to some event that I (mistakenly) thought wasn't a big deal.</p>

<p>If it is all the same to him I'd much rather just watch the livestream, send a card, and save my money / time / mental health. But if it is important to him and he does want me there, I will go. I just don't know how to figure out how he feels about it, without hurting his feelings if it is a big deal to him.</p>

"Opening up a conversation channel with my fiancee","<p>I've been engaged for 7 months with my girlfriend. We've been in a relationship for 3.5 years, we never got in a fight or went through a breakup, we had great compliance, I spoiled her with gifts, dinners etc.., we were together back in school then we graduated and started to work. I managed to find her the job she wanted (I proposed her profile) as she started in a job field that didn't suit her scholarship field. After 2 years I got a job offer in a different country and we both decided to move to that country together and she wanted to move more than I did.     </p>

<p>Before moving together to that country I did find her a job (I was the one answering the interview questions as she could'nt) but in a different city far from where I live, So we've been in a long distance relationship since then and for the last 3 months we only talked 3 or 4 times and some of them only through texting, and I can't understand why she ignores my texts, why doesn't she call me or ask me about my day?</p>

<p>I did ask her why she changed. She said she feels like we got engaged quickly (altough she was the one who say we should get engaged). She confirmed that she wants to marry me but not now, and she said that any girl would wish to have a guy like me. I don't understand her motives as she seems to be contradicting herself.</p>

<p>My feelings are hurt, I started to ignore her as well and we haven't talk for more than a month now. I don't understand why she wants to marry me if she can't even ask me about my day? I know that she's not with somebody else.</p>

"How can I avoid the awkwardness of a returning player who wears a low-cut shirt?","<p>Sometimes I run RPG events for strangers, advertising on meetup.com to get people.  At these events, I spend around three hours asking the players what the characters are doing and narrating the results, trying to tell an entertaining and fun story.</p>

<p>I did this three weeks ago.  Of the four attendees to my game, one had a very low neckline, and several times I caught myself staring at her chest.  I felt bad about it and wanted to stop.</p>

<p>At the end of the game, the other players said things like ""thanks for the game, that was fun"".  This player just stood up and left.  I suspected that I had offended her.  I was sad, because I had wanted to run a fun event for everyone.</p>

<p>This coming week, I posted another RPG event to the meetup.  She has signed up again.  I guess in some sense this is heartening -- I guess she wasn't that offended?  But in a different sense, there's an awkward interpersonal situation here.</p>

<p>I want to avoid being distracted by her chest, and I want her to not feel uncomfortable by my glancing at it. How can I approach this situation in the least awkward or least offensive manner? I've considered saying some of the following to her:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, sorry I was staring at your cleavage last game, I felt really bad about it.</p>
  
  <p>Hey, maybe you could wear a higher neckline next time?</p>

"How to repay someone for a favour when it was their fault they had to do it in the first place?","<p>This happened to a friend of mine (I framed the question differently to make it shorter). She told me about this and I'm wondering if she did the right thing given the situation.</p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>My friend had an international flight which would be departing from a different city (not the one she lived in). She booked an airport shuttle to take her there. She had to board the airport shuttle at a common drop-off point, and planned to take a taxi to get to the drop-off. However, a friend we have in common, Kay, volunteered to drive her to the drop-off point, so she agreed.</p>

<p>On the day of the flight, Kay did not show up on time. My friend phoned her several times with no answer. She was about to call a taxi when Kay phoned her, saying she had overslept and misplaced her phone (she was calling from a different phone). Kay ended up arriving about 30 minutes late.</p>

<p>As a result, my friend missed her airport shuttle and had no other way to get to the airport. Kay volunteered to drive her, and asked her boyfriend to help as well because it was a long drive.</p>

<p>In the end, Kay drove my friend to the airport and then drove back to her home city (total 8 hours driving). My friend thanked her, but did not give her any monetary compensation. She says that she paid $45 for the airport shuttle, which is nonrefundable, and Kay ""owes"" her for making her lose that money.</p>

<p>I feel she should have reimbursed Kay, because Kay drove the round trip, rather than the one-way trip my friend paid for.</p>

<p>How should Kay be repaid without making her feel bad for her mistake? Should she be reimbursed for the cost of gas? What about the value of her and her boyfriend's time?</p>

<p>Additional notes that could affect your answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kay is chronically late and can't keep appointments on time</li>
<li>Kay has financial troubles and only makes enough to support herself</li>
<li>Despite the initial delay, my friend did not miss her flight</li>

"How do I correct my daughter's teacher's grammar?","<p>An email I received from my daughter's 2nd grade teacher has a grammatical error. The teacher wrote ""your daughter can meet with Amy and I"" where he should have written, ""your daughter can meet with Amy and me"". The email was cc'd to other teachers but not other parents. </p>

<p>I do think that it's important for teachers to use correct grammar, but I don't wish to embarrass or antagonize the teacher. FWIW, the teacher is a native speaker of English, and we are in California. The school year is just starting, so I don't know the teacher well; nor do I know if he makes English mistakes often.</p>

<p>How can I make sure the teacher is taught the correct rule in the least offensive manner? (I personally would want someone to correct my English mistakes, privately if possible, but I know from experience that not everyone responds well to correction.)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I decided not to correct the teacher. He was so kind to my daughter at their meeting that I don't want to risk hurting the relationship. If he makes the mistake again and again, I may say something gentle, along the lines of some of the suggestions. I appreciate getting answers both to the question I asked (<em>How</em> do I correct my daughter's teacher?)  and the question I should have asked (<em>Should</em> I correct my daughter's teacher?).</p>

"How to tactfully turn down demands from a demanding friend?","<p>I have a deaf-blind friend, and she is very sweet. Because she is deaf and blind, there are many restrictions on what she can and can't do, and she has a mitochondrial condition that causes her balance to be off, so she not only can't see where she's going and can't walk without some assistance. </p>

<p>The only issue I have with her is that she is very demanding. A recent text conversation about her coming to a deaf social and her needing help with transportation to get there: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: The place is at the corner of X and Y street, you can easily get there by bus, because the bus stop is next to it. </p>
  
  <p>Friend: I can't take the bus myself yet because my boyfriend was there last time to help me, and now he's not visiting for another X weeks because of work. </p>
  
  <p>M: Look into having an assistant go with you to ride the bus with you, to make sure you know what's going on and that you can ride the bus independently. I had that experience when I was just starting to ride the bus. </p>
  
  <p>F: maybe. How come you couldn't ride the bus out here to her home and then ride back with me?</p>
  
  <p>M: The bus company sent someone to help me, the person was paid to help me, I couldn't possibly do that. I am not a professional paid by the bus company. </p>
  
  <p>F: But you're a friend and you know how to take the bus... I couldn't use a person from the bus company that doesn't know sign language.</p>
  
  <p>M: You also understand that I can't miss church to take the bus to you, get you, bring you to lunch and then bring you back. You'd be taking the bus twice, I'd be taking it four times, and about an hour each trip, that's four hours. That's quite a long time. </p>
  
  <p>F: awww.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She has made demanding statements before, and I've had to tread carefully to not be abrasive but also express to her that I'm not going to drop what I'm doing and help her every time.  </p>

<p>Additional notes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Driving to her from the lunch place would take a good 20 minutes one way. </li>
<li>The deaf social occurs once a month, and I am a well known attendant. She understandably wants to socialize, because her life is generally lonely. </li>
<li>The deaf-blind friend's family and mine are very, very close. Her late father was my sister's God-father and his wife (still living) is her God-mother. They are close friends. The mom is very aware of her daughter's demanding personality. </li>

"Polite way to ask how to pronounce name with sounds outside local language?","<p>In my experience, it is not common practice for native English speakers in the United States to attempt to pronounce non-English sounds, such as gutturals or trills.</p>

<p>So say I meet a new colleague whose printed name I did not recognize. I will interact with this person on a daily basis for the foreseeable future. I ask the person how to pronounce the name, and the name has a sound which does not exist in English.</p>

<p><strong>Where do I go from here?</strong> I am able to pronounce many non-English sounds, and I'm happy to do so (or at least try) for a person's name. But is there a straightforward and polite way of finding out whether I should? And when I say ""should"", I mean either</p>

<ul>
<li><em>most people pronounce it with the non-English sound</em>,</li>
</ul>

<p>or </p>

<ul>
<li><em>the person would prefer that it be pronounced with the non-English sound, even though most people don't</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some ways I've thought of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking how <em>most</em> people pronounce the name.</li>
<li>Asking how they prefer others pronounce their name.</li>
<li>Avoiding addressing the person by name until I hear how most others
pronounce it.</li>
<li>Asking how they prefer I pronounce it if I have trouble pronouncing the non-English sounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some outcomes I would ideally like to avoid: </p>

<ul>
<li>I wind up with an idiosyncratic pronunciation - one that is not correct (and not really close), and also not a standard alternative pronunciation.</li>
<li>I'm the only one who pronounces the name correctly, and the person doesn't care about how people pronounce their name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, this amounts to me not wanting to stick out at work. I've looked at other questions related to this (<a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/6191/how-to-clarify-how-to-pronounce-someones-name-when-youve-just-met"">1</a>, <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/6737/how-to-pronounce-a-collegues-name-when-the-pronounciation-is-unusual"">2</a>, <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3833/how-to-politely-receive-someone-when-you-dont-know-how-to-pronounce-their-name"">3</a>), and they don't seem to quite address this specific issue.</p>

<p>For the specific interaction which prompted this question, the person's name had a guttural sound. I do not know whether this person is from the US or not. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I <em>did</em> follow up with something to the effect of ""how do most people pronounce your name."" Which I immediately felt was rude and/or presumptuous - from the person's perspective, that may not be relevant - they might want their name pronounced correctly, regardless of how most people say it. So that's why I'm asking.</p>

"How to tell girlfriend that I don't like hypothetical and silly questions?","<p>My girlfriend has a habit of thinking of scenarios that will never happen and then asking me a question about them usually about our relationship and then getting upset if I don't answer correctly. </p>

<p>One such example is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were watching an episode of Doctor Who and she asked, If we were both married until we were 80 then you were made into a 20 year old body again would you still love me forever even after I died?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now of course this is never going to happen and I said well I don't know and its possible I would eventually love someone else I mean I could live for a really long time after you died if I was 20 again and she was 80.</p>

"How to politely correct a teacher?","<p>I'm a high-school student in the United States, and from time to time a teacher makes a mistake while writing on the board in front of the class. Usually, the mistakes are minor, such as forgotten punctuation, but sometimes there are more major mistakes.</p>

<p>To give an example of the latter, I took an informal math class during the summer. The teacher, only a few years older than me, was working through a problem on the board, which we were expected to copy down as he wrote. It was fairly convoluted, and most of the class didn't seem to be paying attention.</p>

<p>At one point, the teacher made what I was 90% sure was a mistake in logic. As far as I could tell, one step of the process would work for some numbers but not others, although he claimed it'd work for all numbers. I noticed the mistake early on, but I was hesitant to point it out because a) I wasn't entirely sure it was a mistake, and b) I couldn't figure out how to correct him without being rude and setting myself up as better than him. (In the eyes of the rest of the class, too — I'd previously gained an arrogant reputation, and given that he was a math major at a prestigious university, I definitely didn't know more about the subject than him.) On the other hand, the flaw in logic might confuse other students.</p>

<p>Finally, seeing that no one else was going to see/point out the mistake, I politely asked him to explain his reasoning. He used an example number, which turned out to be one of the numbers that worked. I asked for him to work another example, this time suggesting one of the numbers that I thought wouldn't work. Seeming slightly thrown by my forcefulness, he tried the number — and it didn't work. He then realized his mistake in logic and corrected himself.</p>

<p>I didn't feel right about the way I'd handled it, and afterwards, when I described the situation to others, they said I'd wasted everyone's time  and would've been better off directly pointing out the mistake rather than asking him to explain it.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Is it even worth correcting a teacher's minor mistake</strong> in situations like this, or does it just make them look bad?</p>

<ul>
<li>Related to that, does it depend on how minor the mistake is? And if so, how can I tell what kind of mistake is worth ignoring?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If it's worth it, <strong>how do I do it politely?</strong></p></li>

"Is it right to ask someone to keep the curtains drawn if we're claustrophobic? If so, how?","<p>In my classroom, there's a student who wants to keep the curtains closed/drawn all the time. When the sun starts peeping in through the windows, she draws the curtains, keeping the sun out. </p>

<p>As an outside person who is claustrophobic, I feel extremely congested in a room where I can't see the sun. Many other classmates also want the curtains drawn away so that we can see the sunlight. The classroom has a lot of light, but it's the electric white color which looks nothing like the warm glow of the sun.</p>

<p>Whenever this classmate draws the curtains, closing out the sun, I try to tell her that I'm claustrophobic, and that I don't like the ugly whiteness of the electric lights, but she says she absolutely hates the sun, and that she just won't keep the curtains drawn away. This irritates me, but neither my other classmates nor I am able to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Am I right to ask her to do this? Or is it wrong to ask her to draw them away, as she doesn't want the sunlight coming in?</p>

"What is the etiquette about how/when to Stop Conversation with other matches when dating online?","<p>I don't believe this question or an answer is specific to OKCupid, but that's the particular platform I have been using in case there are any answers/advice that is specific to that site.</p>

<p>In OKCupid sending messages is asynchronous in the sense that you might send a message to some one and they won't be notified or see it unless they independently come across your profile and ""like"" you back. So, I assume it is quite common to have sent multiple messages out to many people before getting any responses. And then even once you've started talking to some one, you might carry on multiple conversation with multiple people on the site at any given time, especially since you might not know if you actually want to meet even a single time until you've had a chance to chat online a bit first.</p>

<p>My situation: I'm monogamous, and I've been chatting with a couple of people who are also marked as being monogamous on the site, both of whom I'm fairly interested in, enough that I'd go on at least a first date with. And while there's not yet been any talk with anyone about actually being in a relationship yet, nor have I yet gone on a date with any of them, I want to be as honest and forthright as anyone would expect me to. I don't want to hurt or betray anyone's trust and end up in a situation from some sitcom where some character is actually dating multiple people at the same time. I want to make sure I've done the right things by people when the time comes. And I don't want to just prematurely cut some one off completely especially if it becomes clear very quickly that things won't work with another person.</p>

<p><strong>The question: When and how should I tell some one I've been talking to on an online dating site that I'm now seeing some one else when all parties involved consider themselves monogamous? What is common courtesy in these situations? How is it commonly handled?</strong> </p>

<p>As soon as I have a first date scheduled with some one, after that date happens? When a second date is scheduled? When I'm more formally in a relationship?</p>

<p>If at all possible I'd like to do so in a way that doesn't cut off all possibility of dating the person in the future. After all, if I date some one and realize it's not going to work after a date or two, or even further down the line, I'd then be interested in continuing to talk to and possibly date some one I was already interested in and had talked to. But of course I wouldn't want that second person, when I tell them or later if I tried to restart talking with them after having dated some one else for a bit, to feel like they were just a ""backup choice"". And I'd prefer not to just ghost some one I was talking to and leave them wondering why I suddenly stopped talking to them.</p>

<p>On one of those visits and during a conversation ""Bob"" touched my thigh. I didn't pay much attention at first, though to be honest, I didn't expect it and I felt a bit violated. My partner has other male friends whom I hang out with and they haven't made me feel that way. Well, the same touching ended up happening again that same night. I felt uncomfortable and didn't know if I should have said anything and how. I spent the rest of the night thinking what he touched my thighs for.  </p>

<p>The following day I discussed this with my partner and I asked for his advice. He told me that if this happens again I should just tell Bob I don't like it.

"Should I thank my private teacher after qualifying and ask for having my books back?","<p>I had a personal home-tuition teacher who used to coach me since I was in 9th grade.</p>

<p>At first, he was a very sincere teacher, who always gave me sufficient homework, gave me extra practise questions, and generally helped me do better at his subject (Mathematics). In return, I tried to be a sincere student, and did all the homework he gave me :), and also tried to give him the study material that he asked me for, as I had a lot of extra study material lying at home. My teacher would see these, and he would ask me for a copy of those. I would (or rather, my parents would) take a copy of them, and pay for the copies themselves, as there is a tradition in India that the teacher is to be respected even more than God himself (see <a href=""http://www.region7saicenters.org/saidocuments/Seven%20Stories.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>As time passed, my teacher stopped helping out so much, and began increasing his fees while delivering lower quality of teaching. He even began asking me (again, my parents in reality) for payment even for the extra material that he used to provide me with.</p>

<p>In course of time, I wrote and qualified for the second stage of a certain examination, which I did partially with this teacher's support, and partially with support from my school. However, a few days before the actual examination, my tuition teacher said that he had gone abroad for a business trip, when in reality, he had gone for a holiday with his entire family. I got to know this from a really reliable source. This really made me furious, because I had multiple doubts to ask, and at that time even my school was closed for the same holiday (Dusshera and Diwali, if anyone wants to know).</p>

<p>Then, when I was preparing for the second stage examination, which happens a few months later, this teacher began providing me with substandard quality of questions as my parents had made a delay in making the payment. Nevertheless, I continued to help him, and one day, he asked me for some really good and expensive study material, for a ""few"" days.

"How can I convince my family to go out without me?","<p>Some background: I live in a state in the coast of Mexico with my mother, my cousin (lets call him Pete) and my grand mother. Pete's family (his mother and 2 sisters) lives in another state and came to visit during Christmas/New Year's eve and they'll be with us for a few more days.</p>

<p>I will try to be as clear as possible with the situation.</p>

<p>This weekend during new year's eve we had some more relatives joining us to dinner and celebration, everything nice. Then they came with the idea that we all should go to the beach next morning, Pete's family said yes, I said multiple times I didn't want to go, so did Pete and my mother, but the rest were very insistent saying that all of us had to go to be together and that sort of stuff. In the end they accepted that we were not going to go with the excuse that somebody had to stay home to look after our 93 years old grand mother (so far so good).</p>

<p>Next morning our grand mother said that she would go too (I don't know if she came with the idea or my family did, it doesn't matter), sooooo the problem appeared again. I was woken up at about 9:00 am to go to the beach with them even when we went to sleep until 3 in the morning or so and I clearly said I did not want to go. I stayed in my bed until 11 hoping that they would go without me, but my mother came and said grandma and her were going to go too and that we should (had to) go with them, at this point Pete still didn't want to go. </p>

<p>Pete and I tried to convince them that we wanted to stay home, I stated that I don't like (almost hate) the beach because I always return full of sand and sunburns if I get into the water. We both stated multiple times that we preferred to stay home and do something here (rest, watch TV, play videogames, read a book, any other thing), I even said that I wanted to rest because I had to work the next day because I was not on vacation, but they were too insistent, they wouldn't leave without us, in the end we accepted.</p>

<p>When they were ready to go (everybody was on the truck we'd use) I tried a last effort to stay and said I was going to the bathroom and I waited there hoping they would run out of patience and leave without me (I think this was rude but I was desperate), it didn't happen, they came and knocked the door and asked me to hurry up. At some point my mother suggested to leave me and go without me but somebody said that if they did then all the time they waited would be in vain, this made me feel guilty so I finally got out and took a book with me to the beach.</p>

<p>Later when we arrived to the beach they all went to swim and the ones who didn't want to go and my grand mother stayed at the table eating, this bothered me because they were so insistent to be ""all together"" but they left us anyway. We played some boardgames when they came back while they waited for their meal.</p>

<p>The trip to the beach was OK but the return trip was HORRIBLE, 3 more people (a cousin's relatives) returned with us, so the truck was completely full and we had so little space, not to mention that it took so much longer because an accident happened in the highway and the traffic slowed down a lot.</p>

<p>In the end they asked ""you were glad you went with us, didn't you? you enjoyed your meal"", which I answered ""not so much, the food was good but I could have eaten the same in a restaurant in downtown any time"".</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>I would like to know what approach I should take ( or could have) if something like this happens again. I have more family in other states and when they visit they ALWAYS want to to go to the beach and spend the whole day there.</p>

<p>What do I do if they keep insisting? I wouldn't like to lock myself in my room and ignore them because I'd feel like an as*hole, and if they don't go because of that they'd surely blame me.</p>

<p><strong>Edit for bonus</strong></p>

<p>I'd like some advice to make my family understand and accept that I do not want to go with them and that we DO spend time together when they come, we had a nice dinner in christmas and new year's eve, we also went to the cinemas and ate an ice cream.</p>

"Introvert needs help to avoid giving unintended offense","<p>I am an INTJ and pretty far on the scale of introversion.</p>

<p>I am frequently approached by others to either ask questions or obtain my help.
I do enjoy helping others, particularly with computers or electronics questions.
Not infrequently, I am asked for my opinion in the course of offering assistance. This usually has one of two outcomes:</p>

<ol>
<li>I think for several seconds trying to craft an answer that will be inoffensive, and the other person gets uncomfortable with the long pause.</li>
<li>I respond with my honest opinion, not expecting a problem. And the other party calls me elitist or acts as if I was condescending.</li>
</ol>

<p>Examples: </p>

<p>At the local hackerspace, someone has an Arduino project that I help them with. They are then pleased that their gadget they made using a $10 computer board works. They ask me ""Don't you think arduinos are great?""
I answered, ""No, not really. I would rather build a micro than buy one.""
The response was ""Well, I guess you think my project is pretty stupid.""
I didn't and was very surprised to get this reaction.</p>

<p>An extroverted friend of mine is very involved in maker fair events and has asked me a couple of times to attend, which I declined. He then asks why.
I am not really interested in going and say so. Another why query results.
It takes me several seconds to respond, because I am thinking about why.</p>

<p>In the course of that time I remember:</p>

<ol>
<li>People asking me to help them come up with a new idea for what to build for a maker fair and thinking internally ""That guy is building something to impress people instead of for the thrill of making something.</li>
<li>People at the hackerspace broke tools because they did not have what they needed to do a job properly, but were nevertheless determined to get something done in time for a maker fair.
No more than 10 seconds pass without my answering and he says, ""Never mind the question, you elitist!""</li>
</ol>

<p>Same guy sends me a link to a video where Adam Savage toured the makerspace at MIT. URL:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaHMDNf56W4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaHMDNf56W4</a></p>

<p>He then bitterly complains about the professor at MIT being condescending to Adam Savage. He seemed very surprised that I did not think the prof was condescending. I told him my take was he probably was really enthusiastic that someone was interested in what he was working on instead of their eyes glazing over with boredom, and as result wanted to share what he knew. He rolls his eyes and said, ""I should have expected that from you.""</p>

<p>I am asked for help with a computer problem and invite this person to my apartment. As soon as they walk in the door they see that the living room is dominated by bookshelves, shelves of tools and parts and a couple of workbenches. She comments, ""I see where you work, but where do you live?""
 I reply, ""What are you talking about?"" She replies, ""Never mind""</p>

<p>Edit to narrrow focus and clarfiy due to comments:
I am often genuinely puzzled by other peoples reactions to me.
I do not feel like I am a snob, and am surprised that this was mentioned in the comments.
What I am hoping for in an answer is to get a response that helps me:
A) Better understand some of the confusing responses I receive.
B) Have some idea how to behave a little differently to get along with others better.
The first answer has already given me a helpful start in mentioning empathy.
Eg. It did not occur to me that I was raining on the arduino guys enthusiasm.</p>

"How to cope with a partner having different opinions and way of thinking in arguments","<p>I happened to engage in a discussion with my partner about a topic that we both think we know about. In this discussion she initially made statements that were not my opinion, and that I at that point
believed to be wrong. The problem there was that the discussion was about a music genre, which is something that is more difficult to argue about than laws of nature, for example. Of couse there is less of a right or wrong on certain statements, but I wouldn't go as far and say that there is no right or wrong there. </p>

<p>The discussion continued and we both explained our opinion on the subject. I was carefull to tell her what parts of her explanations I did find convincing, but also, afterwards, what parts where still needed for me to approve her opinion. I was not convinced, and I said so. Eventually, the discussion became more heated, and then she made a statement that to my eyes at that point was 1. Completely wrong and formally disprovable by simple facts (that we both knew), 2. To my eyes diminishing the music of a Music-Group I really like. </p>

<p>I quickly looked up the facts to be sure, and stated them, as I thought that those would prove me right. She then became angry, and accused me to never be moving in an argument, and be pushing her, and be trying to ""win against her"" everytime we have a discussion. 
Of course the situation made me angry, and after a while kind of helpless, because I realize I can't know I'm right. I'm kind of caught in my own (possibly wrong-thinking) mind, and as mutch as I'd like to know I'm right, I can't. So how do I cope with this situation? In the process of thinking about this happenings, serveral questions arrose to me that I'd like to post here: As they are all related to this happening, I want to state them all, so it is clear what I'm thinking about:</p>

<p><em>Question 1: How can I accept that my Partner has a different Opinion? Especially when she bases her opinion on seemingly unlogical reasoning, that I not only do not understand, but furthermore feel to be ""wrong"" in a formally logical sense</em> What seems to be so easy with stranger people on the street becomes a big problem with people who I'm closer with. I'd like to respect her opinions, and not be bothered, if she displays reasoning that has some mistakes, but I am bothered, and here is why: 
I feel that in those situations, my partner is being an irrational person, that I feel can't understand my way of thinking about things. I'd like to rely on her, and to have faith in her being able to understand me in situations where I need her to understand me, or in situations that we both have to decide something together. This faith is broken in situations where I feel she isn't thinking in the same rational way I do think. </p>

<p>I'd like to have answers to the question taking into the account the assumption that I AM formally right, and my partner is not. I am well aware of that it might be otherwise, but I'd like to treat the cases where I might not be right in the further questions.</p>

<p><em>Question 2: How can I express that I have an other opinion, without at the same time demanding her to give up on her own opinion</em>
Let' say I acknowledge she has an other opinion on the subject, for example because I'm not sure that I in fact am right. As I am not yet convinced by her position, I'd like to let her know what arguments are still there, that speak against her position. I want state to her the obstacles, that are still in my way to actually tell her she's right.
Furthermore it would feel like lying to just give in and tell her she's right, when in fact I still have my own opinion on the topic. It's kind of a status update ""where we are"", to tell her by what points I'm not yet convinced. 
<em>She perceives this constant feedbacks as an attempt I make to disprove her opinion, and I'd like to know what I can do so she stops thinking that.</em> </p>

<p>The last Question adresses my general insecurity on being right: My Partner accuses me of being stubborn, hard to convince, and just wanting to ""win"" the discussion. Of course my impression was that she did exactly the same things I did. While I'd really like to just think ""I'm right, she'll have to learn it"", I can't think t hat. Because I can never know if I in fact am right, as well as I can't know I actually am ""just wanting to win the discussion"". I can't think of an objectiv argument that would prove to to me (and, more important, to her!) that I'm right. Her head inside probably looks similar to mine. She's probably thinking ""I'm right, why doesn't he see this"", as well, and I can't never know who actually is right or wrong. </p>

<p>To cope with that, I try to stick to very formal logic, and communicate every little step of thought, in order for her to spot eventuall logical mistakes that I've made. I as well try to always state the initial assumptions that my arguments are based on, to see if we don't agree at those, for example. But besides that, <em>Question 3: How can I find out in the ""best way"" wether I'm actually trying to contribute to a thoughtful debate, or wether I just want to ""win the discussion"". If I come to a conclusion, how can I show her  who of us is trying to win over whooom?</em></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Since I can only ask one question at a time, I'd like to know ask question 2 here: <strong>Question 2: How can I express that I have an other opinion, without at the same time demanding her to give up on her own opinion</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Her statement was along the lines of ""The music of a band is based on a machine machine that they built, and produced by this said machine"". Which is not true since the first (and only album up until now) was produced in 2013, while the machine they became famous with 
was finished and showed to the world in 2016. Of course I had a contradictory opinion. </p>

<p>The general discussion was about wether the said band belonged to a certain musical genre. Her opinion was that the band belongs to a musical genre, because they have serveral machines on stage that produce part of the music. I think that the band doesn't belong to the musical genre, because employing machines is just kind of a weak indicitor for the musical genre. Furthermore, the overall sound of the band differs so mutch from other bands from that musical genre, and she is the only person I have ever heard to connect the band to this musical genre. </p>

<p>Further Clarification: If I talk about different opinions here, I mean opinions and statements that can't coexist because they proof each other wrong. I'm aware that there are many cases, where in the end ""both people are right, in their respective view of the things"". I'm explicitly not talking about this occasions here, but instead about 2 opinions, of which at MAX 1 is the right one. </p>

"How to deal with a colleague who tries to undermine me?","<p>It's been 4 months since I joined my new company. There is a colleague (let's call him Bob) who joined with me. 
Bob and I were colleagues in my previous company and we both accepted interviews from our current company and cleared them. </p>

<p>From my experience with Bob in my previous company, he plays the politics game way too much, which is one of the reasons I disliked him and I have called him out on this albeit in a joking manner, so he realises it. This did not work at all and he got a lot of the desirable work that I yearned to get.</p>

<p>Now, the same scenario is playing out in my current company as well. He has gotten the project from the supervisor, to top it off he speaks the same language as our supervisor, so it gets worse now. </p>

<p>Recently, he is trying to portray me as a junior (read inferior) in terms of experience (when we have the same exp in the tech we are working on) and told me to my face that I will only get very basic tasks while my supervisor gives him the meat of the work. I was infuriated at this. </p>

<p>Which leads me to my question, <strong>How can I deal with this person?</strong> I have already started minimising my interactions with him, but I notice him keeping tabs on what I am doing and listening to my interaction with my supervisor.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>After reading the comments, I would like to narrow this down to a specific question. Since Bob and I are friends, <strong>How can I convey my feelings to him in the best possible way without making it a confrontation ?</strong></p>

"How to ask a new friend about his sexuality?","<p>A few weeks ago, I met a guy, and we started a friendship. We're still getting to know each other, but as time passes I have more and more reasons to believe he has <em>different</em> interests than I (a heterosexual guy) do, though we met in person only twice, and he never told this explicitly. </p>

<p>To be clear: I like him as a person, I'd have absolutely zero problem with it if he <em>is</em> LGBT, and I already made light, indirect hints to this. Still, it'd be good to know if that's indeed the case for sure -  hell, I myself act jokingly as if I am gay rarely with close friends - though I've never done this around this friend yet and he hasn't met the friends.</p>

<p>I don't want to treat him differently. But if he's homosexual, and he didn't ""come out"" to me yet, there are topics to avoid, like relationships... (he's not in one).</p>

<p>Of course, I could just ask ""hey, I'm not sure about your sexuality, are you gay?"", but I'm afraid of him finding this offensive/uncomfortable if he isn't; and if he is, this leaves no room if he doesn't want to tell. </p>

<p>How, if, could I <del>ask him</del> make him explicitly say if he's homosexual, without risking our new friendship? Should I even ask him at all? Are there any alternative ways of finding an answer?</p>

"How to figure out why a stranger is being angry and irrationally insulting you?","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I'm asking this in the context of playing the computer game <a href=""https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/game/overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Overwatch</a> and therefore internet-anonymity as one problem has to be kept in mind.</p>

<p>When I started playing the game I got as soon I had some experience a typical command giving a player who just blamed others for not following up commands and strategies when it wasn't running according to (my) plan.</p>

<p>After a bit of self-learning, I learned that it is important to keep everyone's morale up by pointing out what went well and only pointing on mistakes if they happen repeatedly and might be caused by unawareness of the problem.</p>

<p>I learned that it is important to neither have a team of 6 commanders nor have a team of 6 followers. So I learned to try to grab the commander role as I feel most comfortable with it, but if someone else is not willing to follow I follow his commands to prevent splitting a call following the team.</p>

<p>Also, I'm clearly and neutral communicating (and always trying to do it without any judgement) what I see might be a problem.
And if I have no idea I ask the others if they have an idea what actually is causing trouble.</p>

<p>If the response is calm and objective, that leads sometimes to great changes mid game twisting it to our advantage.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Sometimes others simply deny communicating what they think is going on.
And I think most of them are playing in a competitive manner the game as I do as they<sup>1</sup> want to win. So why won't they communicate their observations? Instead of at some point just breaking out in blaming some specific player in a very subjective and most of the time even insulting way.</p>

<p>If I'm able to abstract their worries from such statements I try to argue and/or fix it if I agree with the problem. But in a situation where a player just starts to insult me and subjectively blames me for losing the game I feel like I'm losing control of the situation and since this is a typical fight or flight situation where flight would be penalized by game mechanics, I react to it with an outbreak of counter insulting aggression and totally losing focus of the game. (Which I totally hate, as it will take me up to several hours to calm down again.)</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<p>How can I keep control over a before mentioned situation, prevent myself from throwing tantrum and in the ideal case pulling the subjectively motivated offender to mention objectively his point of view instead of figuratively provoking me to flip the gaming table?</p>

"How to clarify questions to professors without seeming condescending?","<p>I often ask questions to professors outside of class, on technical topics (I am a  student in STEM) that I want to explore into, and I value their input. When I ask a question about something that is unusual in the technical sense, often the professors do not understand my question properly, leading them to not answer my question, but talk about something else (answering what they think is the question, but is not). Possibly this is due to the weirdness of the question, as in no student has asked this sort of question before, and I do have a tendency to ask unusual technical questions (often outside the syllabus of that course). In the middle of their answer, I know they are talking about something else, and I want to clarify the question again.</p>

<p>The question is: How do I interrupt them to clarify my question, without looking condescending and insulting? Or do I just wait till I finish their answer before clarifying it again?</p>

<p>PS: Although this is in the context of academics and student-professor relationships, this could potentially be extended to discussions between colleagues in the corporate setting, or any sort of mentor-mentee relationship as well.</p>

"How to make sure I understood a work assignment correctly?","<p>Due to my conditions as Aspie, I noticed quite a few times, in working environments, that I have a big communication barrier when it comes to task assignments. Most of the time, I have to work on a project multiple times, as the assignment was meant differently as I understood it. The main problem here is that I'm failing to understand the scope. Or I'm not aware of solutions for problems I just encounter while work is in progress.</p>

<p>A classical (but technical) example that should demonstrate it quite well. I once was designing a visual analyzing tool in Qt. One of my written tasks read like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visualizing the main graph in a Qt frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my project had an additional Qt frame object to be added, as I was new to Qt, I looked up the capabilities of that specific Qt frame object, found that it is able to initialize as an OpenGL frame (what technically, as I know now, works differently as the Qt one). So I realized the whole feature with an OpenGL frame, loaded into the Qt frame. Afterwards my boss wasn't so happy, as he dig up the written assignment and told me, how I can come up with using an OpenGL frame, if we wrote down ""in a Qt frame"", probably this is the common sense I'm missing, as I can't understand how using an OpenGL frame as feature of the Qt frame, violates ""Visualizing the main graph in a Qt frame.""</p>

<p>Most of the time, I get the following advice: ""<em>But if you aren't sure, just ask!</em>"". But I was sure. I wasn't aware that the Qt frame had other means to solve this problem. I just found a way to solve my problem, that respects (supposedly) the requirements. So why should I go on searching for other means to solve it? And if doing so generally, how would I know, when I found the best solution and can stop looking for others?</p>

<p>So how can I make sure having understood a task correct, where I lack the experience to know what ways are available to solve the task and my boss thinks he is clear enough in his wording?</p>

"How to convey ""special needs"" in a positive way for a job interview?","<p>I'm job hunting again because, in my current job, things went horribly.</p>

<p>People were not being aware of my Aspergers or of its impact and so I was on a team that simply was unhealthy for me.
I'm looking for a company that is able to get along with me on long terms.
It is clearly set for me that I will tell interviewers about my condition, to prevent getting in a situation like I'm in now, again.</p>

<p>The 2 major points I identified so far as problematic here, are when talking about the work of others,
I come across as very critical without actually intending to do so.
So others generally get very defensive towards my ideas or when I try to get help understanding something.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to justify this behavior in any way, but I would like to clearly communicate that things like this might happen,
and that they are a consequence of my Aspergers, not just the ""<em>personality traits of a troublemaker</em>"".
I'm working on this with a therapist, but for now, I have to convey that I need people that can understand this as something that ""just happens"" and that I'm working very hard on it to prevent it from happening.</p>

<p>The second problematic point is understanding tasks assigned to me correctly, as described in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/5481/32"">How to make sure I understood a work assignment correctly?</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to communicate to a future employer that things like this might happen, but also make them understand that there are ways we can work on these situations.</p>

<p>I don't want to dictate how I have to be handled. I want to explain/ask that I need a very structured working environment to be most efficient,
that they have to consider my Aspergers when planning to let me work for them as it might affect my performance tremendously.
Once there is a working routine set up I can/could rely on, I will be very efficient. Furthermore, especially such an achievement would be very attractive for me to stay with a company on the long term.</p>

<p>I would really like to communicate all this in an interview, without making it appear like a demand. I think I communicate ok verbally, but I fear I might express nonverbally something different and hence the verbal part could be not strong enough. So, given all this, I'd like to ask: </p>

<p><strong>How can I convey this message in an interview, without appearing like I'm demanding them to hassle around with that?</strong></p>

"Is a verbal response that directly expresses anger always the wrong choice?","<blockquote>
  <p>Me: I understand, I'm just saying that I had plans but cancelled them because you said you were gonna show.</p>
  
  <p>Him: Well if I knew you were going to be such a baby about it, I would have told you I wasn't going to make it.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Well @#$% you then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I once sent that text to a long time buddy of mine who had a habit of ruining my plans by cancelling on me at the last minute or showing up significantly late. I'm omitting all of the dialogue that lead me to reach that level of anger but my point is that the response that followed, albeit days later, was a genuine apology. I think that my consistency in avoiding anger-fueled communication made this particular emotionally-charged text convey to him that I was sincerely, well, pissed.</p>

<p>With that said, social norms in America discourage responses driven by anger. <strong>But is expressing non-violent, non-personal (e.g. not name calling) anger always the wrong decision?</strong> </p>

<p>Directly relating to and inspiring this question is a current dilemma with another long time friend. She treats us (our group of friends) with constant suspicion, only calls when she's drunk, and will occasionally be outright insulting. She has many redeeming qualities and we care about her so we'd like to preserve our friendship. Thus far, simply talking about it doesn't work and the last time I tried, she ignored me for a few weeks and randomly came back into my life by sending me a meme, pretending like nothing had happened.</p>

<p>She's a more aggressive individual so I wonder if a response expressing a more aggressive emotion (anger, not pain) would get through to her, as I've noticed it has with some people who simply don't react to calm, heartfelt communication. Again- <strong>non-insulting, non-violent, non-personal</strong>. Something like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You don't get to just @#$%ing walk back into peoples' lives whenever you feel like it.</p>

<p>So, is expressing anger in this way always the wrong decision?</p>

"What could you possibly say to a friend who cooked a meal you didn't enjoy at all?","<p>Some friends invite you to their home. There's just the 4 of you (2 couples). S/he is cooking.

<p>They are good friends, the meal is standard food for the country.</p>

<p>I don't want to hurt their feelings. </p>

<h3>Is there a polite way to answer or deflect the question?</h3>

<hr>

<p>EDIT (from comments / more details):</p>

<ol>
<li>my 2 cents: she asks because nobody made compliments during the meal.</li>
<li>It happens all of a sudden, I was stunned by a question that I didn't expect.</li>
<li>It's quite common to ask in Western Europe (from experience: with people in/from UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy).</li>
<li>Host is a standard cook with average experience.</li>
<li>Dishes: salad as an appetizer, chicken with ""sauce"" (?) and vegetables. Sweets weren't homemade. Nothing too spicy/salty/bland, just an unpleasant taste.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I have put into practice a method based upon a mix of some answers. Long story short: good meal with (closer) friends, but did like it was not <em>in my mind</em>. Asked my host right away: <em>what is this taste in your dish? looks like you put [ name it ] in it</em>? Her: <em>this, and this too. Why?</em> Me: <em>tastes different, I never expected that it would do this.</em> Her: <em>but did you like it?</em> Me: <em>maybe it would have better matched MY taste to put less of it, or none at all, because I like it [ your taste ]. Don't worry, I'm curious, it's just a question, not a big deal :)</em></p>

<p>All went fine. Then I told them the whole story, that the meal was very good, and apologized for making them part of an experience, to which they laughed. As they were curious about it, we even talked about this awkward situation, and my previous experience, and what one should do. Like some others I asked to, they said that you should be very careful when you answer, and that deflection was the smartest way to do it, in their POV.</p>

<p><strong>2nd try</strong> : I brought this in an unformal talk: <em>how would you react if...?</em>. Most people said: <strong>don't tell it's not good! Either you deflect or you white lie.</strong> (but to me, liying is not an option though).</p>

They are staying in program-provided group dorm housing in a single. I've visited them a few times and hung out in common areas with the other participants living there, helped my partner cook, things like that. Everyone I talked with was friendly in person. I'm very used to a ton of diversity and I didn't even notice that I was the only person who was not a person of color in the room, nor did anyone insinuate so. I'm not the smoothest, socially, but I mostly just listened and laughed at jokes sometimes. </p>

<p>My partner overheard others talking about me later, and told me the direct quote, ""Get out of here white boy. This is a program for minorities."" My partner said it was a joke, and I trust their judgment of the tone, but still, they say it hurts them a lot, and it hurts me, too.</p>

<p>I recognize that this space is home for people who often feel silenced and definitely isn't mine to claim, but I'm conflicted because I'm hurt and alienated and I can't visit the home of a person I love without feeling ashamed of my race/appearance/cultural background.</p>

<p>1) Should I do anything here, or is it more important to acknowledge my privileged comfort everywhere else I go? I also risk embarrassing my partner or making their home life harder.</p>

<p>2) If so, how? I thought about asking one of the program participants for a private conversation on e.g. whether I'm really not welcome there because I'm white and how it would make sense to maintain my relationship with my partner, but it isn't those folks' responsibility to spend energy solving the problem I have with their relatively normal humor. I also don't know which person to talk to. They're acquaintances at most.</p>

<p>Part of me also wants them to apologize to my partner, because my partner is suddenly very uncomfortable where they live and that seems like pretty concrete harm to me that won't be diffused easily. I'm thinking that will be better served as my partner's initiative, though.</p>

"Making brand new friends without coming across as needy","<p>I live in a large city on the west coast of North America. There is a reputation for people here to be unfriendly. I'm trying to make new friends or even a new group of friends. The reason I am doing this is because</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to</li>
<li>A lot of my old friends I had since high school haven't grown up or matured</li>
<li>Two of my close friends were in a car accident which left them with permanent injuries. They are very self conscious about being in public and I'm looking for people that are into more activities (like going to the beach or on a hike).</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people see it as impolite or unacceptable to go to an event where you don't already know most people there. One time I was living with roommates and the people in the basement invited us to a barbecue in the back yard. I told my roommate I had steak in the fridge and he said ""oh, that would be better if you already have a reason instead of just showing up to hangout with them"".</p>

<p>I know this is an open ended question but is there anything that should be kept in mind when hanging out with people where you only know one or none of them? Is there any way to communicate I'm just interested in meeting new people without coming across as needy or lonely? </p>

<p>I recently made friends with one person and asked what he was up to. He invited me to a bar with 5 other of his friends, none of which I knew. It was nice but I kind of felt like I was intruding as everyone else already knew each other. Perhaps when meeting new people it's best if there's an activity that's not just sitting and drinking? </p>

<p>In response to comments, I'm not looking for specific instructions on how to meet people or how to ""forge a friendship"". I'm more looking for a response to give in a situation when I'm new to a group and someone asks ""if you don't know anyone why are you here?"" when the actual reason is I'm trying to meet new people. </p>

"Asking not leading questions without sounding cold and/or detach","<p>Following <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/20633/21067"">this question</a> about not asking leading questions, I tried to apply the advice in my day to day life for all kind of situation (including online conversation).</p>

<p>However, I find that I am now asking awfully vague questions, the kind of questions you would ask if you hadn't been listening to what the other person previously said.</p>

<p>For example, let's assume that one of your friends participate in a festival at the weekend.</p>

<p>The non-leading question would be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, how was the festival?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then, if you know that such an event could make your friend terrible tired, you would also like to inquire specifically about that. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wasn't it too tiring?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this is a leading question, which means that your friend might feel pressure to answer in a certain way, which is less likely to happen if you ask a non-leading question (like, when someone asks ""did you understand?"" you feel pressure to say ""yes"" even though it's not the truth).</p>

<p>So, you could say instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is your tiredness level?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, honestly, this is the kind of question your doctor might ask and, as a friend, I would feel weird asking that (at least in the cultural context of France).</p>

<p>So, assuming it's possible, <strong>how can one ask non-leading questions without sounding (too) cold/detach?</strong></p>

<h1>Note and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Asking about the festival is fine, even if it can be a bit vague. And, as someone with tiredness issue, I know I mostly never talk about how something made me tired unless someone specifically asks. In those case, I'm happy that the person asks but it doesn't mean that I will not be tempted to undermine the truth (in order to ""protect"" the other person from the truth).</p></li>
<li><p>The example above is mostly a real example. But it was an online, asynchronous, conversation where I decided to ask ""Hey, how was the festival? Not too tiring?"" in a single message.</p></li>

"How to have a casual conversation with new colleagues?","<p>I've recently started working with a new company, and it's great. Every few months, they'll organise for everyone to meet-up in a pub after work for drinks.</p>

<p>There's a meet-up coming soon which I'm looking forward to attending, but am concerned that after the whole ""How's it going? Are you settling in alright?"" palaver, the conversation will run dry. It might be worth noting that about 80% of them are of a completely different, older generation to myself; I think it'd be unlikely that we have similar interests. </p>

"What would be the correct reaction in such situation?","<p>First need to tell that I am an Arab muslim and I live and have a fiance in a European country. We've been dating for about 3 months. We have a really good romantic relationship, no conflicts have been during this time. She tells me that she loves me and etc.</p>

<p>And then one day she told me that her coworker (their team leader &amp; manager at the same time) at work after finding out that she has a boyfriend and he is Arab, told her that he searched in the internet and read that Arabs hit &amp; abuse women and that he wouldn't recommend her dating an Arab/muslim man. She did not answer him anything because he is like a boss to her and she does not want to be in bad relationships with him. After a couple of days she asked me to promise her that I'll never abuse her. I made a promise. But there are some things I don't like in this situation, I'll tell what I think and it would be much appreciated if you people share your opinions. Where am I wrong and where I'm right.</p>

<p>Things I don't like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why would her team-leader care this much about her relationships that he even spends his time searching the internet about Arabs ? I think this is abnormal to care about your coworkers romantic relationship. Probably he has feelings for her.</p></li>
<li><p>I think this is incorrect from her side that she did not defend our relationship. She closed her eyes on her manager trying to ruin our relationship and he's telling racist things. This wrong I think she should have told him to mind his own business. Or am I wrong?</p></li>
<li><p>She started doubting me now. Even we never had conflicts and etc, she asked me to give her a promise. I think this means she doesnt love me. She maybe thinks she does, but in reality she doesn't. I think I should end this relationship because it is wrong to be in a romantic relationship with someone you doubt.</p></li>

<p>This is what I think. Please correct me if I am wrong and share opinion. Thanks!</p>

"How can I communicate to a friend that he should apply to more jobs?","<p>An acquaintance of mine is a teacher. </p>

<p>Because of a change of rules at his school, all the teachers will have to reapply for their jobs next year. I'm sure he'll get his job back, but if he does not, he'll probably be given a different post elsewhere in the school district. </p>

<p>I've told him that, in addition to reapplying at his school, he should apply to other teaching jobs at nearby schools.  With his experience, I think he'd be highly desired and possibly get a better salary. </p>

<p>He says he shouldn't bother. That other schools would rather hire someone less experienced and cheaper. And if he did get the job, he wouldn't have the same seniority.</p>

<p>I've got more reasons. Maybe other schools won't have the problems he complains about at his current place; maybe an offer from another school would give him bargaining power...</p>

<p>...but you know what? I think he's just being pessimistic. I've known him a long time, and it's a trait of his. That's why I'm here instead of Workplace StackExchange.</p>

<p>I understand that filling applications for the first time in years is intimidating and scary, but the upside could be great. Besides, he does have to fill out one this year anyway.</p>

<p>How can I tell this possibly pessimistic friend that he should, at least, try for more opportunities?</p>

<p>EDIT: I discovered that I was unclear about my friend's reasons for not wanting to apply elsewhere. He says that the last time he checked, no other school districts offered benefits as good as his current one. (This is in addition to the seniority issue.) From my POV, I feel he should update his research and see if this is still true. (I suppose I could do it for him, and gently inform him.)</p>

<p>ADDENDUM: The problem has kind of solved itself. I had assumed that this application would be due during the summer vacation, when he'd have only a few months to find another job if necessary. Instead, the application is due now, near the start of the current semester. If he doesn't get the job, he has plenty of time to apply elsewhere. I'll bring it up at that point if necessary.</p>

"What is the most polite way to ask someone if they understand English?","<p>If I'm communicating with someone online via email or on a website and they clearly do not understand English, what is the most polite way to ask them if they understand English or to ask if they understood my question? Perhaps, there's something else that I should be asking them that I'm not yet aware of. I've attempted asking several people online if they understood English or if they understood my question and they've become extremely defensive and offended even though it was obvious that they weren't understanding me to begin with. The same thing happens if I say that I'm not sure that they're understanding me.</p>

<p>I've encountered this online many times, especially when I'm asking straight-forward questions on sites like Quora or Reddit.

Let's say that I ask a question such as this: ""I'm just seeking unbiased opinions. This is a yes or no question. I'm asking this as a question since I don't see an option to create a poll or survey. Do you think it's rude if a stranger approaches you in public and calls you fat?"" The responses I receive are philosophical rants about society, religion and spirituality that have nothing to do with my question and they are written in broken English.</p>

"Asking questions about sexism without sounding like I'm... 'part of the problem'?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm a cis white male, and I have never directly witnessed any kind of sexism in my academic world, even though I hear that it is a very real problem in this precise context. I've <em>heard about it</em>, a lot, sure, but always through the media and about people in different institutions, but I have never seen it or heard it directly. </p>

<p>If anything, it felt like the universities in which I've worked before were quite ""progressive"" on all things related to gender and race, compared to other work environments. Just to give you two small, non representative examples: I work in a small STEM program in which over 80% of the people recruited in the past 3 years are women (much more than in industry) and the university's yearly stats demonstrate the total absence of a pay gap since 2009.</p>

<p>Of course, like everybody else, I'd like to be ""one of the good guys"" and I <em>feel</em> like I'm not contributing to gender inequality - I'm equally mean to everybody :) I <em>think</em> that I would react if I witnessed something that I perceive as sexist. But here's the thing, I really don't see any of it on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Now feminist theories also tell me that I may not see the problem <em>because I'm a man</em>, etc. Truth be told, I'm a hardcore scientist and the whole ""<em>you don't see the problem and that's proof that it exists</em>"" really bugs me a little (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"" rel=""noreferrer"">Karl Popper</a> much?). Being genuinely interested in educating myself and being more aware about these things, I would like to be able to identify daily sexism. For instance, maybe I have a hard time telling <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining"" rel=""noreferrer"">mansplaining</a> apart from healthy criticism (which is an important part of science)? In other words, I need concrete examples to help me be more aware of inequality issues around me.</p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>The other day I was having dinner with colleagues; one of them was telling us everything about their (?) gender reassignment surgery (<a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TMI"" rel=""noreferrer"">TMI</a>, to be honest) and said something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have no idea how hard it is to be a woman in academia; nobody ever takes you seriously</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not very specific, and I felt like asking them to elaborate, because that's quite a strong statement and I simply didn't see where that came from, so I wanted to learn more. Which brings me to the question:</p>

<p><strong>In polarizing issues like sexism, race etc., or any other context in which right and wrong seem to be very... binary values, how can I (a cis white male), ask for specific examples without making people defensive?</strong></p>

"How to say I will not be participating in the current system of sharing costs (because I don't think it's fair), when people are easily offended?","<p>A few months ago I moved into a shared house. The house used to be a kind of community house for (where people would eat dinner together and roommates are found through the church). I'm not religious but most people in the house are and there still is an expectation to be respectful and trust each other.</p>

<p>I don't think I've been treated fairly when it comes to money. The first month I move in the lease holder  had to kick someone out and asked me for money to change all the locks. The next month he wasn't able to find someone to occupy the now vacant room and again asked for money. Then the utilities bill was very high compared to the previous year. There was talk the garage needs to get cleared out and we need to chip in money to rent a truck.</p>

<p>Here is where I draw the line. When I moved in I was told we use a system where if someone buys a household supply (like garbage bags or dish soap) we write our name on the receipt and put it in a pile. This sounded like a good idea to me and I agreed to it. After several months someone went through the receipts, and posted in the group chat how much everyone owes each other. I was a bit surprised how much I owe some people as I had no idea they purchased anything. After doing some investigation, I find there's a few things that aren't fair in the way the costs were divided:</p>

<ol>
<li>Someone had bought some supplies for a Christmas party we had, and I had been under the impression each person was contributing out of their own pocket (for example I brought two bottles of wine and didn't expect to get reimbursed).  </li>
<li>Someone broke the vacuum while using it, bought a new one, and now is sharing the cost with everyone. I said I didn't think this was fair but the response was ""the  vacuum cleaner was old and ready to go anyway""  </li>
<li>Someone purchased close to $200 in cleaning supplies at once. The receipt doesn't have enough information to really tell what the items were (for example often times it just has a brand name).  </li>
<li>It's just silly that people owe each other small amounts that are awkward to pay, like $1.38</li>
<li>I had been told the receipts would be processed each month, but in reality it happens once every several months. This makes it hard to track down what the costs were for.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you may tell from my writing, I'm not good at stating a case that comes across as polished.  The person in charge of this system is Bob. When I got home Bob was talking to another roommate who was trying to convince Bob of a better system. Bob was using arguments, which IMHO, hold no weight (like ""this is how we've always done things"" or ""person-so-and-so wouldn't agree to this""). I tried to support the new system, but Bob got offended. I think this is what led to him making <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/20688/how-to-deal-with-people-who-make-absurd-accusations?noredirect=1"">nonsense accusations</a> and yelling at me.</p>

<p>I had asked to see the receipts and Bob got offended at this too saying he triple checked the numbers and wasn't trying to rip anyone off. I tried explaining I wanted to see receipts so I know what was purchased but he was too mad to listen.</p>

<p>I need to make absolutely clear to everyone in the house if someone wants me to help pay for something, they need to ask me before buying it. <strong>What's the best way of doing this considering some people get offended I don't trust them?</strong> I could play it up as ""ask me first because I may know a cheaper place to buy it or have a friend who would lend/give it to us"" but this may not always be applicable if I don't think we need the purchase in the first place, or if its something consumable like food for the party (though would work well for things like a mop). </p>

<p>I would like to get a new system that is fair in the sense everyone uses it the same way. I think it's much better to purpose an alternative instead of just saying ""your way doesn't work"". I tried purposing a new system but Bob got very defensive and used lots of arguments that made no sense to me, like ""we tried this before and it didn't work"" to which I replied ""there's only 2 of the same people still living here"" I think I was rude in the way I phrased it but I also think it's true. What is a good response to ""we tried and it didn't work"" when the conditions have changed? He also argues ""this wouldn't work for person X"" but I'd prefer if people spoke for themselves. </p>

<p>Bob is not the lease holder and in general I have a problem with how he thinks he can tell people what to do. Often he phrases things in such a way that makes it sound like everyone else has agreed and he's just relaying the message, when in fact only one other person agrees. Also I made a purchase that other people refused to help me pay for.</p>

<p>To summarize, my hope is we can agree on a system like everyone pays $20 at the start of a month and any leftover is evenly returned, but until such a system is in place I must insist people ask before expecting me to pay for a purchase. </p>

<p>Response to comments:</p>

<p>Q. are you looking for a better system to implement, or just a way to communicate that you won't participate in this system anymore?</p>

<p>A. primarily a way to communicate I won't be part of their current system anymore, but I think the best way to achieve this is getting people on board with a new system</p>

<p>Q. consider the scalability of people getting permission for purchases - does someone need to ask every other person in the house before buying a roll of paper towels?</p>

<p>A. In this post I'm not asking about what systems might be good in it's place, I'm asking how can I respectfully communicate I won't be part of the current one</p>

<p>Q. How much longer are you intending to live in this house?</p>

<p>A. At least another year. It's a very nice place and aside from the roommate politics everything is great, I even enjoy the roommates company when we get along.</p>

<p>Q. Do you ever have house meetings with all of the roommates together?</p>

<p>A. Yes but often times at least one person can't make it</p>

<p><strong>Q.</strong> Are there any formal/public documents about house expenditures and budgets, or is it all up to Bob?</p>

<p>A. First off Bob isn't the landlord and I feel like he's acting in a position of authority he doesn't really have. Sometimes Bob, and other people, write things down and leave them in a public area. Usually these documents are unilaterally created and just because someone makes a document doesn't mean everyone has to follow it. </p>

<p>Q. Do you talk to any roommates other than Bob about these issues, or just Bob? </p>

<p>A. I talk to the others and most agree with me but have very passive or neutral attitudes. </p>

<p>Q. Are you prepared to compromise on issues, or are these hard stops for you?</p>

<p>A. It's a hard stop for me that I won't be paying anymore unless I agree to it first. My hope is I can change this position once everyone agrees to a new system. </p>

"How to find out if my friend is ignoring me or if I have the wrong contact info?","<p>A couple years ago I moved away from the city in which I went to university. During my time in this city I made a friend, let's call him Bob. I felt my friendship was very close with Bob. We had gone on several trips together and knew each other's family. After I finished school, I moved to another city. I tried keeping in touch with Bob through text messaging, but he didn't really seem into it. After a while he stopped replying altogether. I sent him a text wishing him a happy new year, and got a reply that he doesn't know who I am and I got the wrong number. I replied ""is this Bob?"" and he replied ""no"". I then went to a mutual friend to get Bob's number, and from this response I got the same number I had been using all along.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to do next. Bob is a carpenter and doesn't have social media like Facebook or email, and in general doesn't like technology. I don't want to put mutual friends into the middle of this. If Bob really doesn't want to be friends with me, I'll accept it, but I'd like to know for certain. For example, it is possible that my mutual friend isn't aware of Bob's new number. </p>

<p>My other friend I made while going to school, we talk on the phone frequently and reply to each other's Facebook posts. Bob just has a different personality, he's very non-technical and finds it difficult to type on a keyboard. If he's just not into exchanging text messages, I get that, but I would like to know that if we're ever in the same city we'd visit.</p>

<p>BTW, one of the reasons I think Bob may be pretending not to know me, is because if a person doesn't recognize a number they usually say ""who is this?"" not ""I don't know you, you've got the wrong number"" (especially to a thing like ""happy new years""). I guess I could phone him and see if I get his voicemail, but that doesn't seem like the right thing to do. </p>

<p>How can I find out whether or not Bob still wants to be friends with me, and get back in touch with him without putting mutual friends in the middle? </p>

"Tactfully telling my cousin that she might do too many of the chores in her household","<p>My cousin is a wonderful person, she is a feminist, ecologist, etc.. activist, she cares a lot about people and I really love her (I see her and her family ~once a month for the weekend and I spend some holidays with her. I also spent two weeks at her home when I was looking for an apartment).</p>

<p>As a feminist, my cousin knows a lot about ""mental load"" and the problems with chores distribution in a couple's relationship. However, since I'm at her house very often, I couldn't help but notice that there is a chores distribution problem in her relationship (she seems to do much more than her share). </p>

<p>I know such subjects can be sensitive and I don't want to ""make a mess"" of her relationship with her husband. However, I believe that she might not be really aware of this fact right now and I think that, if she ""knew"", she could talk to her husband which would (at least partially) fix the issue and life would improve for her.</p>

<p>So, how can I tactfully talk about that with her, without coming off as someone who likes to ""put oil in a fire""? I just want to help her see that there <em>might</em> be a problem here (but if she tells me there isn't one, then there isn't one).</p>

<h1>Notes and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>I don't know if this causes problems in her relationship. However, it might very well be the case and, even if it isn't, she will probably be happier if she had fewer chores and more free time.</p></li>
<li><p>I see no reasons why this would have been mutually agreed upon, since her and her husband basically do the same job.</p></li>
<li><p>Why don't I just mind my own business? Because I care about her and want her to be in the best relationship possible </p></li>
<li><p>I'm not planning on making any accusations, I just want to tell her something like ""Hey, I have observed that you do a lot of chores, I was wondering if there is an issue there?"" </p></li>
<li><p>I don't think my cousin should be unhappy, I'm wondering if she is. I know talking to someone about your problems can be helpful and I just want a conversation here.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The answers here made it clear to me that you have no idea what my relationship with my cousin is.

"How do you choose holiday gifts for relatives","<p>I am laughably bad at choosing gifts for people. It’s very, very hard for me to come up with gift ideas, even for people I know well (most relatives, including my wife.) It’s almost like a form of aphasia! When one of my kids develops a new interest, I can use that to help choose, but most of the time I either have no ideas, or bad ideas. Having just been through another disastrous holiday season, I’m determined to improve. </p>

<p>So my question: could you please explain, as if to a Martian, how you’d go about choosing a pile of presents for your significant other for a birthday, etc. How can I choose eight gifts for Hannukah? Where do the ideas come from?</p>

<p>Note that I’m not interested in gift suggestions!</p>

"How can I get my upstairs neighbors to stop stomping on my ceiling?","<p>I've read about <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/7185/how-can-we-ask-neighbours-to-be-more-quiet-without-escalating/7186"">asking neighbors to be more quiet</a> but none of the answers help my situation.</p>

<p>I live in an older apartment building and my neighbor(s) upstairs tread very heavily when walking on their floor, and this causes my ceiling and even floor to <strong>vibrate</strong>. Listening to music doesn't drown the thumps, and earplugs haven't helped either. It feels like small earthquakes all the time, from when I come home from work to 2am and sometimes even later.</p>

<p>I've never met them, and I've already asked the property manager to kindly ask them to be more mindful, but nothing has changed in over a week. The thumps started months ago, so I guess it's a new neighbor who perhaps ate a fridge, because I haven't had this problem before. Knocking into the ceiling with a broomstick hasn't helped. <strong>Perhaps I should knock at their door and say... <em>what</em>?</strong> I'm pretty sure they don't do this intentionally.</p>

<p>Are there some good solutions for this situation?</p>

"Are ""pleasantries"" in emails still ... ""pleasant""?","<blockquote>
  <p>Hi [your name here]!<br>
  It's been a long time since we last had a chance to catch up and I really hope you're doing well. Everything is great on my end [. . .]<br>
  I'm writing because I really need someone to help me out this week with a project and I was thinking you would be a great option with your experience in this subject [. . .]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I regularly have to edit in these sorts of ""pleasantries"" or ""greetings"" or ""niceties"" at the beginning and end of emails right before I hit send because I <em>always</em> forget them but don't want to sound like I don't care about the person I'm communicating with. I find this is generally more common in emails after a break in communication. The example above is a bit extreme but I often find myself wanting to add something more than simply the name of the person I'm addressing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Happy Monday, hope you had a great weekend!</li>
<li>Good morning!</li>
<li>Welcome back from your vacation! When you've had time to catch up . . .</li>
<li>Thanks for your help!</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday I had a chat with someone and they told me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In email and other forms of digital communication it's becoming increasingly rude to include such niceties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that email has become a pretty laid-back form of communication but is it now so laid back that I should cut to the chase, get to the point, kill the kindness?</p>

<p>Is there any evidence in the form of a sourced article that these niceties are going the way of the dodo?</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't want anecdotal evidence for this. Everyone has their own writing style and preference. I want a study that supports either using or not using them. I've found email writing guides that make statements one way or another:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.brazen.com/blog/archive/career-growth/10-tips-for-writing-effective-emails-that-will-help-you-get-what-you-want/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brazen.com</a> 2014</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You wouldn’t walk into a friend’s house for dinner and bark out a command. The same is true for email. Niceties can go a long way.</p>
  
  <p>Pleasantries aren’t dated constructs; they’re valuable warm-up phrases for effective communication. Start your messages warmly, comment on your recipients’ latest achievements and wish them well:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hope all is well in your corner of the world! If Facebook’s telling me the scoop, it looks like you had an eventful month…</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/email-etiquette-when-being-impolite-at-work-pays"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> by  The Daily Beast in 2011 disagrees:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Niceties, Shmiceties: How E-mail Etiquette Could Be Holding You Back</p>
  
  <p>I started with email, where I had often signed off with a chipper “thanks!” or apologized for inconveniencing someone with a request or for taking a while to reply. I was no longer sorry it took so long to get back to anyone. Neither did I feel either regretful about asking them to do something or grateful to them in advance for doing it.</p>
  
  <p>I painstakingly reread every message to make sure neither polite phrase had sneaked through. And after I’d carefully excised each self-effacing slip, I hit send with a new set to my jaw, a hard glimmer in my eyes.</p>
  
  <p>The effect was immediate: Colleagues began to treat me with more respect. Celebrity publicists—a notably power-aware lot whom I often contacted in my job—were more responsive. Even interns (those pecking-order experts) seemed to regard me with a new sort of awe.</p>

<p>Though, this article is one person's experience rather than a broader study and it's also specific to women.</p>

"How to avoid writing Yelp reviews","<p>I'm a fairly social person. Occasionally I'll engage with a local business owner (or manager, service rep, etc) when I really appreciate their service. Here's a couple quick examples...</p>

<ul>
<li>While eating at a local lunch spot, I ended up chatting with the manager. I love the food, but it's always pretty quiet in there.</li>
<li>We had our air conditioner replaced, and the guys who did it did a great job. The supervisor was very nice and friendly.</li>
<li>Got our car fixed at the local shop down the street. Again, the service was excellent.</li>
</ul>

<p>In each case, I tell the representative how great the service was, and how much I appreciate it. And in each case, <strong>they ask me to write a Yelp review</strong>.</p>

<p>This is where I get stuck... because I really do <em>want</em> to write them a good review, they absolutely deserve it. And almost every time, I tell them ""sure!"" But the sad truth is... I absolutely never write the review. I don't think I've ever written a product review in my life.</p>

<p>I've come to the realization that I will truly never write these reviews. Despite my good intentions, life (and habit) prevents me from ever dedicating time to something like that.</p>

<p>But I am also a person who values honesty. I don't like lying to these folks if I know it's a lie.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the real issue... How should I respond to them?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Option A:</strong> Lie to them. Passively agree to write a review, but never actually follow through with it. I don't see any of these people frequently enough to get called out on it.</p>

<p><strong>Option B:</strong> Tell them flat out I won't do it. Apologize and let them know that I'm not a ""reviews"" kinda guy. The conversation could potentially get awkward after that.</p>

<hr>

<p>This seems to happen fairly frequently these days... I'd love to figure out a good semi-prepared response. Thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT (moved up from comments)</strong></p>

<p>While I appreciate everyone saying ""just do it, it's easy"", that kinda misses the entire point. Regardless of how ""easy"" it is, I have many other factors in my life (work, family, hobbies, etc) that I'd rather dedicate that time towards. Plus the fact that I've never reviewed anything in my life (and therefore have no habit/pattern to build upon), and it's just painfully obvious that I won't be posting a review. So... ""just do it"" isn't really helping.</p>

"How to ask a friend to repay me?","<p>I have one friend that always borrows money. He has been one of my closest friends for most of my life, and normally he's pretty trustworthy when it comes to paying me back. However, as of late, he has been letting his debt to me rack up. I understand his financial circumstances and I am not in any rush for him to pay me back, so I let it slide for several months. </p>

<p>Recently, his behavior has changed, as if he prioritizes paying others back over me. The tipping point was last weekend, where he asked another friend to buy some limited edition merchandise for him. He didn't hesitate to offer to pay the other friend back as soon as he got his paycheck, leaving me in the dirt. </p>

"How to stop family from pushing me to forgive and forget?","<p><sup>(Some similarities to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2426/what-to-do-if-my-family-keeps-trying-to-fix-my-relationship-with-a-family-member"">this question</a>, except that I <em>have</em> explained, and my family is <em>not</em> on my side.)</sup></p>

<p>I have been avoiding / ignoring my sister for the past ~6 months, after she seriously hurt me. <em>I am not ready to forgive her.</em> What she did was the sort of move that people end best friendships over; if she was not related to me, I would have cut her out of my life immediately and never looked back. She has shown no remorse and made no attempts to apologize, although she has sent me trivial texts (e.g. ""Happy national ice cream day!"") now and again. For context, we are both mid-20's, living independently from our parents.</p>

<p>My parents know why I was hurt and the sort of feelings the situation brings up (including physical symptoms, loss of appetite, insomnia, nightmares, to give you an idea of the intensity), but have taken her side and are pressuring me to make up with her anyways. They have a variety of tactics:</p>

<ul>
<li>It makes your mother so sad to think of her family never having a big happy get-together again</li>
<li>You're being selfish, your sister's choice made her happy, don't you want her to be happy?</li>
<li>Well, I can see why what she did hurt you, but you shouldn't have done XYZ in the first place</li>
<li>It's been months/years, this is how things are now, you need to accept that</li>
<li>She's reached out with those texts and you're not even giving her a chance, so the rift is really your fault now</li>
<li>But she's your only sister, you don't want to end up like [estranged extended family member], do you?</li>
<li>It must be <em>exhausting</em> holding on to all that anger for so long, I can't even imagine..</li>
</ul>

<p>FWIW there is a religious component; I stopped following my parents' religion a few years ago whereas she is still devout. It is true that this situation would not have hurt me as badly if I had followed their religious tenets, but to any secular observer I did nothing ""wrong"".</p>

<p>Perhaps some months or years from now I will be able to forgive her, but my parents pressuring me will not speed it up. In the meantime, I'm at a loss of what to do the next time they bring up the subject. I don't want to argue or reveal yet more personal background, I don't want to let my sister sweep this under the rug, I don't want to reach out to her. (Why should that be my responsibility? I don't want a relationship with someone who would do this and doesn't think they need to even clear the air.)</p>

<p>What can I tell them? How do I respond when they try to get me to go to family events with her? Do I just have to accept they will view me as the bad guy for not accepting her ""compromise"" of sweeping it under the rug?</p>

"How to tell someone you don't trust that you are going to stick with written communication","<p>At the start of the month I moved out of my old house which wasn’t working (hooray!) but the landlord still hasn’t given my damage deposit back (boo!). I sent the landlord a text message the day I moved out and only yesterday he contacted me asking questions about where I left my key etc. The landlord keeps sending me messages “contact me soon”. I think what he means is he wants me to give him a phone call. I have a bad feeling about where this is going because the landlord never made an appointment to inspect the room to see that no damage was done. However, I took pictures that show it was in good state. </p>

<p>Given that I do not trust the landlord based on his history, I would prefer all communications be done in writing so I have a paper trail.

"How to deal with a person that's not able to argue based on facts","<p>It's a bit of a long story. TL;DR at the bottom</p>

<p>I am in a martial arts club for ~10 years. My trainer is not a friend of Japanese dojo style but he made the training more open and like a workshop, which was appealing to me. Over the course of the years we became friends and we did some projects where I helped him in various situations.</p>

<p>He was often seen as kind of strange to other people, e.g., he would hold unconventional viewpoints and cared little for the reaction of others to said point, or he would phrase things in a provocative way and say that it is not his problem if people react to his provocations. At first this all happened within certain limits. You could argue in favor or against his viewpoint but it was not vastly disturbing.</p>

<p>Over the years this changed. He always had quite a strong self-esteem but he began to exaggerate. He'd make mistakes and not deal with them. Then he began to shift the blame to others. Over the last 5 years he gradually became a person that is completely unable to take critique and is not able to admit mistakes whilst always blaming you for something you did.</p>

<p>As stated before we did some projects together. We managed to make a bit of money through these projects and he would always promise me to give me a share. This was fair as I invested a good amount of time and some money. </p>

<p>However I never got any money or anything else. He'd say that he was waiting for the money himself. He'd say that he has it but that it's only part and he'd give me my share when he got the full sum. He'd say he hadn't calculated how much I should get and that I should give him a list of hours I worked on a certain project. I gave it to him and he wanted some clarifications. I added them, then he said that I should talk to another member of the club because she had a different view on the project, and so on... As soon as I delivered something he wanted he came up with the next issue. I completely understand if you want to do things correctly but if you always come bit by bit and start bringing up things that were not mentioned when he first requested the list, it is irritating.</p>

<p>A few months ago (this went for more than a year) I stopped yielding to his requests. I'd say that he has every bit of information he needed and that after over 5 years I at least want money for the things that were clear.</p>

<p>He began to accuse me of being sloppy and brought up some mistakes I made. I did make the mistakes he stated but they all were minor, like twice I was not able to make it to training and I called him only two hours before. Nothing major, nothing loss incurring.</p>

<p>Whenever he wrote me, his messages were full of accusations. Whenever I tried to disprove or question them, he came up with more. He'd accuse me of not being constructive, that I waste his time, that I am not a grown up but more of a child (I'm 29 btw). Even when I present him facts he simply glosses over them. I have the feeling that he doesn't even read my messages. He simply picks some points I make, twists them and accuses me of attacking him, e.g. I told him that he could buy a pool for his garden (privately) and quite buying expensive equipment for the club whilst I was waiting for his payments and that he at least could have paid 50 bucks a month. He answered that it is none of my business what he buys privately, that the equipment was for the club where I am too and that I should mind my own mistakes I made.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR and question</strong></p>

<p>A friend of mine is refusing to compensate me for projects we did together and when I try to talk to him about it he constantly blames and belittles me. He is completely immune to arguments based on facts and uses every little thing I did wrong as an excuse to delay all payments.</p>

<p>How can I deal with such a person? I simply want to clear things up and make a clean cut, as the events of the last year have shattered my trust in him and his club. I fear that my investment into our projects is lost as I trusted him and we made most agreements personally, not in writing. </p>

<p>I'm not a psychologist but he shows many symptoms of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder"" rel=""noreferrer"">Narcissistic personality disorder</a> such as over exaggerating his own successes whilst always criticizing his surroundings.

"How to find friends as a programmer (teenager)?","<p>First, I want to apologize if I'm posting this in the wrong site, but I hope this is the right one.</p>

<p>My question ""how to find friends"" might be very unclear at the beginning, but it's very common in many forums and most of the answers include things like involving in different communities in order to find people with the same interests, but I don't think that it works for me. </p>

<p>First, let me tell the background information. I am a 16-year-old (I'll be 17 in a few months) kid living in a poor Post-Soviet country (mentioning this so that you understand that many Western standards don't apply here). My hobby is computer programming, I've been learning programming since the age of 12. I'm currently studying computer programming at a vocational high school. </p>

<p>While being 16 years old, I look much younger. I am very weak and skinny, in fact, I don't do any sports at all (that might be one reason why nobody wants to be friends with me). I don't have any friends, I am not outgoing and I always feel alone. Also, I find myself being a busy person that doesn't have time to go out and meet with friends (although I don't have any).</p>

<p>I have very good grades at school, but it's not that I am studying a lot after school to get a high grade in tests. In fact, after school I don't dedicate any time for learning, I usually do my homeworks and I'm done. I'm good at remembering certain things, so I'm almost always ready for every test even without preparing. In my class, I am the only one who has a lot of experience in programming (see information about my experience below). Since I have very good grades and I know a lot about programming, nobody really wants to be friends with me at school. This is that kind of a situation when one only wants to be friends with the ""cool guys"" (people that have bad grades, do stuff like drinking, smoking, etc.). I am not that kind of person. I hate alcohol, smoking and all that kind of stuff. I have asked some people in my age about how they get friends, most of them answer that they go to parties, walk around the streets with their friends at night, smoke with friends (here being a smoker means being cool), etc.</p>

<p>While still being a high school student, I also have a job as a part-time programmer. I work remotely, so I spend 4-5 hours a day while working. I have school from 8:00 in the morning until 15:00 in the evening. I work from 16:00 until 22:00 (I also count having breaks, eating etc) and I go to bed at 23:00. That is how I usually spend my day. I work because I need money to buy things my mom can't buy me. In fact, my mom is the only one who supports me financially. She gets the minimal salary, so that's clearly not enough to fulfill my needs for me as a teenager and a tech person at the same time.</p>

<p>I'm not even trying to brag, but I'm a really good programmer. I know many programming languages, I code better than some people who've been programming for even longer time than me, I often get compliments from other programmers about my skills, I have even won a country-wide programming contest. And since there are no such programmers in my age, it's impossible for me to find programmer friends that would be interested in me (they often want programmer friends that are on the same level as they are). 
If I ever get a chance to make friends (regardless of whether they're programmers or not), they often distance from me because we don't really have anything to talk about. If they ask me ""so, what are your hobbies"", all I can answer is programming. Then, if I start explaining them what I do, they are not interested.</p>

<p>I am studying in a different city, so I go home every weekend. Rest of the week I spend at a dorm with my roommate, who also happens to be a ""cool guy"". At home, my mom is the only person that I can talk to, but we usually don't have anything to talk about either. Since my parents are divorced (my dad lives completely elsewhere and doesn't care about me), she lives with her boyfriend and mostly spends time with him rather than with me. I also have a sister, but she's 23, doesn't live with us, has a boyfriend, so she doesn't have time for me either. And even if we get to talk sometimes, again - we don't have anything to talk about. If she asks me how I am, what I'm doing and when I start telling about my programming stuff, she becomes uninterested and doesn't pay attention to me.</p>

<p>There's much more things I can tell about me, but I think that what I've told is enough to get an understating about how my life works. The reason why I want friends (or at least just one friend; I don't think I'd like having ""a million friends"") is that I need someone to talk to, tell them about my problems, about my life (and of course, hear about their lives, problems), someone that would be interested in hearing me out.
I am so alone, that I often imagine there's another person in the room and talk to them loudly, tell them about my life and my problems, so that I can feel a bit less alone.</p>

<p>So, <strong>how to find friends?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Should I give up programming and do something else? Something, with what it'd be easier to find friends (like music, arts, etc)?</li>
<li>Should I give up my job (and respectively, the extra money I'm getting to fulfill my needs) to get more time after school to engage in social activities?</li>
<li>Should I start being interested in something else (but without giving up programming) so that there's something else I could talk to people about?</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do in this situation? I'm hoping that I'll find a solution to my problem.</p>

"How can I make my parents (and parents-in-law) accept that I don't want to have children?","<p>First I would like to give a bit of context:</p>

<ul>
<li>My companion and I are 25 years old; we will probably get married in a few years</li>
<li>I luckily have a comfortable situation, and have been working for 2 years</li>
<li>My companion still has to study for 4 years (but she'll be working and will have an income)</li>
<li>I get on well with my in-laws, and things are okay with my own family</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I am an only son</li>
<li>My SO has a younger brother (16 years old) and an older brother (27 years old). Neither of them will ""provide"" (probably) grandchildren anytime soon. So this is a bit more pressure for my partner</li>
<li>Everyone here is French (a bit of Mediterranean/Spanish culture on my side)</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, my parents-in-law suggested that now that my companion has almost finished her studies ""She should be ready to have kids soon"". On my side it's pretty much the same, I am expected to have kids since it is ""how things should be"", but there is a little less pressure.
My companion is not sure whether she'd like to ever have kids, and we have been hearing that ""We will change our minds"" over and over again.</p>

<p>Currently, the only real idea I can express is that the prospect of ever having kids does not make me happy, and that I don't want people around to pressure me into doing something I'll probably not change my mind about.</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered this problem and managed to make it accept to family without too much conflict?</p>

<p>I also have heard other ideas against my wish coming from aunts/uncles:</p>

<ul>
<li>""People who don't want kids don't like themselves"" -> That's not how I feel, do you know examples who might corroborate this idea?</li>
<li>""You won't be satisfied by life if you don't have kids"" -> I think my career, personal life and hobbies can largely be enough, am I wrong to think that? Is there a way to make our families feel the way we do about that?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>A comment rightfully suggested that I should add what I already tried. So here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had the conversation about having (or not having) kids with my part of the family and tried the ""I just don't feel like having kids ever"" argument</li>
<li>It did not go well and escalated really quick, that's when I heard the arguments I am quoting in this question</li>

"Is it rude to not ask for a reason first when receiving a gift (chocolate) from a colleague?","<p>Little bit of backstory: My colleague gave me a fancy looking chocolate (not a whole box) which I accepted saying ""Thank you!"" but then she asked ""You are not asking, what's the occasion?"". I did ask for the occasion afterwards.</p>

<p><em>Was I rude for not asking occasion before receiving</em> as my understanding was that the person sharing chocolates should give reason for sharing. For example in case of my birthday, I would say ""it's my birthday"" while sharing chocolates.</p>

<p>So, should I have asked for reason first or the person sharing chocolate should give reason while sharing?</p>

"How to handle situations which demands odd behavior","<p>Consider the following 2 scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After entering either a big shopping complex or high rated restaurant, there will be a queue and have to wait till our turn and buy/order items and then exit after completion.</p></li>
<li><p>After entering a local market or small shops, there will be no queue (randomness) and buying things or getting orders depends on the <em>penetration capability</em> of the individual such as giving order with high pitch/loud voice, asking repeatedly or getting work done without caring who are waiting before him/her etc.,</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How do I handle situations like the second one which need some sort of indecent or rude behavior? In such scenarios it will take either lot of time for our turn or may never get it.</p>

<p>I face this problem lot of times. If I go to local shops or hotels or juice points with friends, one of my friend gives order and get things done. If I go alone, I may wait for long time or leave from such place without completion of work. The annoying part is that my girlfriend takes initiation in such scenarios because I can't. </p>

<p>How do I handle such situations effectively being not rude, not loud, formal, polite and descent?</p>

"How to handle degrading neighbour / acquaintance couples?","<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> How to handle bullying partner in a group discussion where he is bullying and degrading his partner in plain sight of everybody?</p>

<p>This situation is some time past me, but is still nagging me, because I was very uncertain on how to react, and I still am. Also, it was already the second time I didn't know how to react.</p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong> BBQ in our Garden. 2 or 3 other couples with kids are there as well. We know each other because our kids share the same kindergarden. Not some precious and old relationship, but since the kid of Alice and Bart is best friends with our kid, we developed some kind of friendly relation towards Alice. When the food was served it came to my attention that Bart was always degrading his wife Alice in front of the entire group, who all knew each other at a basic level. Especially announcing foreign heritage, and how she should at least use it to teach their kid an additional language. And that she was not able to take care of her self, and how clumsy she was, and how embarrassing on another occasion, and how she could not speak the language well. (I can't tell that she is not a native speaker) This was not the only incident he used to pressure her in front of all others, and you could really feel the awkwardness gaining control of everyone else. I sort of spoke up, but not in the way I intended, or that I deemed neccessary. I gave a slight sign of disaffirmation and then switched the topic.</p>

<p>Later on my partner and me discussed this, and we couldn't find a satisfying solution to this. Is it right to <strong>confront the bully</strong> in the moment he is bullying and to stand up? How to weigh <strong>victimizing Alice</strong> in this situation? She might feel weak and like not being able to take care of her self. </p>

<p>I am not trying to be their defender, or fight their fights for them. But it is a kind of behavior that I totally despise and that I think is totally unacceptable. No one should talk to somebody else in that manner, and given that this was their ""beloved"" partner, who was attacking (Especially when being the host...)</p>

<p>The very first incident was another neighbour who told his partner how thankful she should be that ""we"" have her in this country... And I was like... Wooohh FIRST don't include me in this ""we"" you used, and WTF!?! You have a degree in social studies and I need to explain to you what a person can decide on birth and what not? </p>

<p>Again, I wasn't the main target of the attack but absolutely thought that I NEED to say something. </p>

<p>Feel free ask further information, I guess it is confusing. I'll try to explain further if needed.</p>

"Socializing at workplace","<p>I am a kind of a reserved person who minds her own business at the office. I do not socialize much at the workplace and feel it awkward to talk about the daily soaps or interfere in one's personal life or for that matter even talk about the ongoing political affairs of the country or the world. I feel that these are out of our scope and we have no say in it at all. It is more of, something would happen irrespective of my opinion. So, I keep mum during those kind of discussions or avoid if possible. But, there are instances where I can speak about a topic I know for as long as enough. May be this kind of attitude makes people call me as a moody one. </p>

<p>It even happens that a lot of information gets passed around during these conversations and most of the times, I am the last person to know. This makes me feel aloof and I get sad sometimes. </p>

<p>At the same time, there were instances when people spoke to me only because there was no one else to speak to. I was more of a fallback person and that makes me more uncomfortable. And there were times, when people would take advantage of me, try to get work done from me and not talk later. Basically, I was being used. I was not able to differentiate between a casual talk, fallback talk and 'getting used by them' talk. </p>

<p>That is a hotchpotch of thoughts in my mind. I want to change this attitude and socialize more in the office. What I want to do is '<strong>How do I effectively socialize with my co-workers</strong>' without interfering in each others' personal lives?</p>

<p>I have browsed through the site and found this question. <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/6217/as-an-intern-how-do-i-make-friends-with-full-timers/"" title=""1"">Socializing with full timers</a>. It did give me a few pointers. Since, mine is a more elaborate one, I need more help. </p>

<p>I have thought of a few options. But, I have doubts about it. Kindly advice me w.r.t these. 
Also, please add a few of your own ideas which you think might help me. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Meeting at the water cooler or have lunch together.</strong> There are always
groups in the project. How do I know which group I need to move
around with? </li>
<li><strong>Tea/Coffee break</strong> I do not drink tea/coffee and having such break seems
odd to me. But, I am willing to forgo that and hang around.  </li>
<li><strong>Cracking jokes now and then</strong> seems to be a good option but I have no idea
when/what to crack one/about. How do I ensure that I don't come
across as a silly woman?  </li>
<li>I do not socialize much during weekends and hence the week starting discusssions are really awkward to me when people ask me how I had spent my weekend. My answer is a simple one sentence and people get disinterested very soon.</li>
<li>There are times, when co-workers of one group indulge in open blasphemy or various kinds of 'isms'. This is one topic that binds a group together and I am not comfortable with any kind of 'isms' let alone talk about it. Or for that matter, it could be a love/hate towards a person or a group that binds them together. Though I do not share my thoughts with them, I am not comfortable being in that group, and I end up being alone, again. I have no idea if such discussions can be dodged and if yes, how? These co-workers could be my superiors whom I report to directly or could be any random colleague. I do not want to end up being <strong>Yes (wo)man</strong>. </li>
</ul>

<p><em>This might come across as a too broad question for IPS. But, my question is 'How do I effectively socialize with my co-workers'</em>. The other sub questions are the ways for that question but do not divert from the main one. Kindly do not vote down or close it. I am ready to rephrase it to get the right set of answers. </p>

"How to deal with a possibly abusive stranger?","<p>Recently, I was on a trip to a town that I didn’t know well. I play Pokemon GO, which has “raids,” a sort of social feature that requires people to gather in one place to coordinate in-game activities. I was out doing some raids, using a chat app to find out where they would be. Since I’m gregarious and felt safe, I asked some of the people&mdash;an adult woman and her father&mdash;I met at the raid whether I might get a ride to the next raid, and they agreed. I’ve done this a lot before without any issues&mdash;it seems to be pretty common in the Pokemon GO community, where not everyone has a car to get between raids. </p>

<p>While I was riding with them, though, I began to feel very uncomfortable. I’m not the most socially perceptive of people, but the father seemed to me to be acting in an extremely angry, critical, and maybe even abusive manner. </p>

<p>He was constantly angrily criticizing his daughter for the littlest things, even blaming her for following the directions on Google Maps, or not catching a Pokemon for him, and he always tried to make it seem like it was her fault. She wasn’t being at all confrontational or doing really <em>anything</em>, so far as I could tell. </p>

<p>He also said things like “Don’t make me curse at you”  (and it sounded like a genuine threat, not a joke) and “Why are you making me angry?”. And all this with a stranger in the car! </p>

<p>I felt so uncomfortable that I asked them to drop me off early, but even then I was second-guessing my decision.</p>

<p>What was the right strategy? Should I have done what I did, and just tried to get away from that situation as quickly as possible? Should I have said something, and if so, how? </p>

"How to get along with European roommates?","<p>I am a white male engineer born in Brazil and lived also in United States and France. I usually opt to live with roommates since it is more affordable and also I like the atmosphere of a shared living. The only problem that I have is that, despite rarely having problems with my multinational roommates from all continents, except Oceania so far, and races, I noticed that I do fairly poor with roommates (and at times also neighbors) that are originally from Europe. To list the problems encountered so far:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>German roommate in United States complained hastily that me and my Chinese American roommate don't buy toilet paper promptly as it finished. It warranted to me be yelled at being accused of being reckless of leaving the house without TP. The other roommate (and me) found his rant disproportional and we agreed to buy more TP while the German roommate didn't want to join. This roommate also accused another Vietnamese roommate of lying about being a doctor because he had tattoos. He had a shady past, but seemed to have got over it since. The Vietnamese roommate came to talk to me about that very upset about the situation and said that he ""would get mean with him"", so I felt it was urgent to broker a reconciliation which happened fine.</p></li>
<li><p>French neighbors in student dormitory in France came often to knock at my door in the middle of night and sometimes they entered the room drunk to make noise. They appeared to be targeting by Brazilian roommate. We had to file a complaint with the dormitory manager. After a while the Brazilian roommate left and a Lebanese roommate came in, and one day they knocked the door again (I had told him about the facts before) and he went to answer the door with a knife. Thankfully they had left by the time he picked his knife and went to answer the door. I don't blame my roommate about his defensive attitude, I just didn't want to get involved in such case.</p></li>
<li><p>Female French roommate in France caused a lot of noise at night, stole my food, had nervous breakdowns and acted very rudely with me. She appeared to be psychologically troubled.</p></li>
<li><p>Female French roommate (for only a few days, since I arrived just before she left the house) said that my habit of cleaning up common areas that appear to be neglected by the others could become a source of conflict. My Tunisian roommate mocked that she and other former roommates of the house (3 French and one Italian) neglected the cleaning and we did a major clean up ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p>French roommate in France got upset when he saw me doing his dishes. The first time he had prepared a diner with friends and he said that he was too tired to wash them at night but he promised to wash them next day. Next day at noon the dishes were still to be washed so I washed them without expecting anything in return and I didn't say anything about it, other than, when he said that he would owe me that favor, he could return it by mopping the floor of the kitchen, which was left quite dirty after the dinner (so he already had this obligation anyway). He said that felt being a trouble if I do the dishes for him. The next week he saw me washing a pan that looked one that he had just left in the sink and told me to stop washing his dishes until he realized the mistake. He said that he would fell bad if I do the chores for him, which, whenever I do I never expect anything back and most my other roommates so far never complained about that or sometimes even praise me.</p></li>
<li><p>French roommate was thrown out of the house by landlord (who lived in the house) in Brazil after he brought a girl to his room. It didn't appear that they were in the room to talk about Jesus. I didn't see the situation and cannot say who was right, but the landlord appeared to be mad at him.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I fell that it looks like I am a trouble maker for European people and I can't see what am I doing wrong. I don't have any particular rant against Europeans in general, but it seems that their values are simply too complex for me to understand, even after being used to other even more diverse cultures, like the Chinese, African and Arab. I do have some opinions that are less acceptable in Europe like I don't enjoy alcohol and I am pro gun rights, but many of them didn't even know that before causing these troubles to me and other people I know usually simply do not agree without causing trouble. What am I doing wrong? Am I just unlucky?</p>

"How do I deal with the problem of people who aren't listening to what I'm actually saying?","<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>I've spent many years gauging my interactions with other people, and a commonly reoccurring theme is the other person already has presumed what I'm saying or going to say, or has drawn up some imaginary alternate scenario that doesn't jive, and isn't listening to the actual contents of my words.</p>

<p><strong>Things I've tried</strong></p>

<p>The frequency suggests the problem is on my end, but I've tried various methods to rectify this to no avail. So far I've tried and failed with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Emphasising key details that are different; they continue to talk
about their own imaginary version.</li>
<li>Asking if they understand what I've said; which the classic line is
'yes'.</li>
<li>Asking a follow-up question to test; amazingly they parrot back
exactly what I've said, but they ignore the actual content of what
was said.</li>
<li>Simplifying statements; I rarely use 'technobabble'. The shorter the
statement, the more likely I am to be interrupted with their own
assumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these have worked.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>

<p>Some examples, if ironically what I'm saying here isn't understood. Note that context, person, etc is irrelevant; I've had it happen a wide variety of situations.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<p>Me: 'the <em>white</em> kettle is a lower wattage than the current one'</p>

<p>Family member: 'the new one? We should probably use it.'</p>

<p>Me: 'I don't know if it's new, but it is the <em>white</em> kettle on top of the fridge.'</p>

<p>[Family member uses the 'new kettle' which is stainless steel grey and wasn't on top of the fridge. I didn't know what it looked like.]</p>

<p>Me (confused): 'Why do you have a stainless steel kettle?' [I check the wattage, find it's the same as the old one; similar model.]</p>

<p>Family member (still acting on their imaginary dialogue of what I said): 'You said the newer one was a lower wattage, didn't you?'</p>

<p>Me (internally facepalming): 'I said the <em>white</em> kettle was lower.'</p>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<p>Me: 'Do we have the docume...'</p>

<p>Manager (interrupting): 'Look, there's no point attacking [X] department because...'</p>

<p>Me: 'No, I'm not talking about attacking [X] department, I wanted to ask do we have any of the documents by the p...'</p>

<p>Manager (interrupting, still going on about 'attacking [X] department'): 'There's no point arguing with them about it!'</p>

<p>Me (trying to ignore derailment): '...Do we have any of the documents by the pharmacy signe...'</p>

<p>Manager (still going off on his imaginary tangent of me 'attacking' a department): 'Look, we can argue with them until we're blue in the face.'</p>

<p>Me (frustrated): 'I just wanted to confirm we've got this [dodgy development thing] signed off by the appropriate people' (IE senior management)</p>

<p>Manager: 'We don't worry about that. That's not our problem.' (this is despite the fact said manager encourages the sign-off on development processes and it is our problem.)</p>

<p>Me (frustrated): 'But do we have some sort of documentation of orders from somebody above us telling us to do that?'</p>

<p>Manager: 'Like I said, not our problem.' (Even though, clearly, it is.)</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I find it incredibly frustrating to have to constantly restate myself, have to re-explain points, and I get blamed for being irritable (and seen as anti-social) as a result. These are just two out of a sea of many examples. I find it occurs in the medium of written statements too.</p>

<p>How do I deal with people who aren't listening to what I'm actually saying? How do I get them to take onboard the content of what I'm saying?</p>

"Is it weird that I sometimes don't respond to comments / jokes?","<p>When someone makes an off the cuff remark, joke, or observation to me, I sometimes just laugh and nod along. I realized this silence might be kind of weird. I typically don't respond because I don't have anything clever to say back, so sometimes I'll just say ""That's pretty funny"". Most often though, I don't say anything back. Is this weird? How can I respond in a productive way?</p>

<p>For example, as I was leaving my apartment for work, I bumped into my neighbor who had been walking her dog. Her dog started excitedly sniffing me, and she made a comment along the lines of ""Wow, she really likes you!"" I just made eye contact with her, laughed and smiled along with her, and maybe said ""oh"" in a surprised manner, before I continued out the building. I feel like this is really weird of me, but I kind of freeze when these things happen.</p>

It can take anywhere between two minutes and an hour to stop the bleeding, and there's no way to tell at the beginning how long it will take.</p>

<p>I've got to meet (repeatedly) with some people (most my age (15), others 17/18). </p>

Then again, if I catch it in time, and just hold the tissue there people don't have to see the blood. I'm hoping that it <em>won't</em> bleed, but what should I do if it does?</p>

"How do I become closer with my brother? He feels like a complete stranger","<p>Growing up, I didn't get along very well with my elder brother. In addition to the usual sibling rivalry (fights and insults), I was always compared to him by everyone including teachers (we went to the same school) and parents because he was great at studies, athletics and socializing (literally a model child every parent wants to have). I on the other hand wasn't that great - average grades (which was considered to be very low here), barely 2-3 friends and not a lot of interest in sports. So this made me hate him even more and I never talked with him much, preferring to spend time with my cousins instead.<br>
Time went on and we became more mature and the fights stopped. He joined a good university and went abroad for his masters. Now we barely even speak with each other (2-3 times a month, that too mostly over WhatsApp texts). We only speak about my future plans and nothing much else. Whenever he visits home, he feels like a complete stranger. I don't have any sort of emotion towards him as I do with my cousins. Just to put that into perspective, I feel more sad when my cousins (whom I can visit anytime I want) leave rather than my brother who can only visit once a year. I want to have a normal sibling relationship with him and have the same family bond I have towards my cousins. What steps should I take to improve the relationship?</p>

<p>I'm 20 and he's 23 if that helps</p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
My main goal is to converse with him more frequently (once a week?)<br>
I've tried to engage in topics such as sports, music,  work (etc.) but I can never manage to carry on the conversation. I've tried watching sports with friends, attending parties, going out and exploring but those simply don't appeal to me. Believe me I want partake in those activities too but I've tried a lot and those simply aren't for me. Basically, we have nothing in common</p>

<p>We're extremely casual with our cousins, joking about friends and relationships and my cousins act as a 'bridge' between both of us. I want the same to happen directly between us. My parents also say I'm distant from him and he's made a lot of attempts to reach out too, but there's something nagging in my mind that prevents me from opening up to him</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br>
We have been working together for a few years; she was single and I was not. I became single a few months ago and I noticed that she could be interested in dating me. I liked her and we went out once or twice as friends. She invited me to a happy hour with a few of her friends and long story short: she left with another guy in the end (yes, I was mad!). The next day I called her and she obviously regretted, blaming alcohol and apologized...  </p>

<p>The problem is that we work together and we always had a very good relationship at work and even though I see that she is hoping to get me back, I believe that I need to tell her that we will never be more than friends now.</p>

<p><strong>My goal</strong><br>
I want her to know that what happened has ruined any possibilities of moving beyond friends (without blaming), but still keep our good relation at work.  The other possibility is not to tell her anything, but I am afraid she will try to get me back and it might hurt her more in the long run. I don't see an easy way to talk about his.</p>

"How to tell a patient I don’t want to discuss a personal detail?","<p>I work an introductory job as a technician in a busy hospital. I manage equipment, conduct various tests on patients, and record information I obtain. </p>

<p>Because I’m directly working with the patients, communication is going to be a large part of the process; especially since I want them to be relaxed and comfortable.</p>

<p>Normally it just involves simple descriptions of what I’m doing or questions/answers that are isolated within a medical context. Occasionally though, I’ll receive a personal question.</p>

<p>Most times they’re just simple questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How did you start working here?</li>
<li>Where are you from?</li>
<li>Do you like it here?</li>
</ul>

<p>Although, there’s a few extra talkative patients who like having more involved conversations. Most of the time, I actually enjoy obligingly answering and responding to what they’re saying. </p>

<p>However, I recently experienced a patient asking me about my relationship status. They were talking about their own child (who was my age) and mentioned how they were getting married and how I stood in that area.</p>

<p>I recently have undergone a pretty rough breakup and talking or thinking about it isn’t something I’m currently comfortable doing with anyone; especially a patient.</p>

<p>For this occasion, I politely smiled and said I’m still single and then told them I had to go check some details (which I did luckily in this case). However, there may be cases where I’m forced to stay there to finish a process. This is a question I expect to be asked more, so I want to narrow down a graceful way towards handling it for the future. </p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>How can I let them know I’m not comfortable with talking about that part of my life?</p>

<p>I <em>don’t</em> want to leave it open to discussion or their pity; subtlety is important to me.</p>

<p>It’s also very important I don’t negatively impress them at all because my job depends on professionalism and keeping patients happy. </p>

"How to apologize for sexual harassment in the past?","<p>Every now and then, I'm reminded about something awful or embarrassing that I did, and this, sadly, includes sexual harassment, mostly in the form of - but not limited to - drunken messages or phone calls.</p>

<p>I understand that the best thing to do is just to not harass someone in the first place, but what can be done after the fact?</p>

<p>My first thought would be to write a message, apologizing for the unwarranted and most likely unpleasant advance, but I don't even know whether or not the victim remembers what happened, or if she would appreciate the apology - or being contacted in the first place.</p>

<p>Some points:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not talking about physical assault</li>
<li>I have no way of knowing whether or not the victim really experienced it as harassment</li>
<li>I do know that I feel terrible about it</li>
<li>I am specifically thinking about something that happened several years ago</li>
<li>I am not thinking about a workplace interaction, or one where either one of us is in a position of power</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything I can do (besides not repeating my mistakes), or is this now completely in the hands of the victim?</p>

"How to ask the girl I am dating if she likes me?","<p>I am mexican working in Germany (31), I got to know an amazing german lady 3 months ago (26), we started texting eachother since, it is awesome, we always have something to talk about and we both love joking around.</p>

<p>We have had 4 dates already, always a great time, she always wrote me afterwards something like ""today's evening was awesome I enjoyed a lot thanks"".</p>

<p>I have to say, I really like her so at the end of our last date I told her so, of course I added some ""spice"" first and then I told her loud and clear ""I like you"".</p>

<p>Her answer made me come to you for some counseling and suggestions, I am quite confused; here her words ""<em>I am pleased that you tell me that, it makes me happy, I enjoy a lot texting with you, every time I see I have a message from you I get excited and when we go out I have a great time, thank you for telling me this</em>"".</p>

<p>I was expecting maybe ""I like you too"" at the end or something and I didn't ask her ""do you like me?"" or ""how do you see me?"" maybe I should have done it but I though ""I should never put a lady under pressure, if she feels it too, she will tell me without me asking, if I ask I could put her on the spot"" so I didn't ask.</p>

<p>After that we kept texting eachother normally, there was no change on her side, always smiley and energic writing me about her day, which made me happy but on the other hand... I find myself like ""floating on the space"" if you know what I mean, with thousand things on my head, I just really want to know, what does her response is supposed to mean? Do I like her or not?</p>

<p>I really want to know if she likes me but I am not sure how to ask without putting pressure on her or making her feel ""under attack"" so I kindly ask for some advise from you:</p>

<p><strong>How can I ask her if she likes me?</strong></p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance, cheers.</p>

"How to tactfully request girlfriend's family to give us more space?","<p>I have been dating my girlfriend for about 1 year now. I love her for her caring nature, intelligence, and sense of humor. However, since I met her parents about some months ago, they have much more involved in our relationship than I would like. Questions have arisen such when are we setting down, how our relationship is doing, and whether we have committed yet to each other yet.</p>

<p>This degree of involvement makes me feel uncomfortable, and sometimes the behavior/attention given by my potential future mother/father in law feels controlling. I love my girlfriend, and we get along very well, but just want to develop our relationship at our own pace. We are both in our late twenties. I don't think a little bit longer until we marry will make a difference. I am invested in <strong>her</strong>, and while I understand family may eventually come into the picture, <strong>I don't want to be involved in too much of an family affair</strong>. I grew up in the United States and she is originally from Eastern Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Update to answer questions in comments</strong></p>

<p>To answer the questions posed by @MlleMei, my girlfriends parents say that it is about time we settle down and consider marriage. When I see them, they often push for details such as what we talk about when we see each other, and stated how they themselves married at a young age. When I deflect by stating how I would like to go at our own pace, they still state that we should consider settling down soon, and that benefits are greater. Its almost like they don't trust our relationship, and downplays what I say.</p>

<p>Marriage is a big step, and I want to be sure that I will be happy with my choice of who to marry. <strong>I want to marry someone because I truly love that someone and know that person well, not because of pressure to settle from outside influences</strong>. I will need to live with this person, not them, and feel my potential mother / father in-laws should understand what I say is not about them personally.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>Without alienating my potential future in-laws, how can I communicate the desire for my girlfriend's parents to be less involved in our relationship and give us more space to develop individually?</p>

<p>And how can I communicate that while mitigating the risk of being perceived as rude or insensitive?</p>

<p>Perhaps could this difference in thought be due to a culture issue?</p>

"I have to sack a temporary worker. How to communicate it?","<p>I contracted a temporary worker for two weeks, to cover vacations of another person. There is no contract, only a word agreement. His work is to cover a turn during the night, checking some systems during his turn.
The problem is that in his first week, this worker did some things that deserve a sack. He left the working place for several hours, he allowed two of his friends (two girls, I don't have details) to enter to the office and, finally, he had an argument with these friends, that demanded the intervention of the guards of the building.</p>

<p>The point is, since I have to sack him, how can I communicate him that I have to sack him? While explaining him that he made several mistakes, in order to make him peacefully accept his fate?</p>

"How to convince someone to share the free weights at the gym?","<p>How can I make someone give me the weights they're not using at the gym?</p>

<p>Last night I went to the gym and there was one of the regular guys there hogging about 8 different sets of dumbbells and two barbells and I needed to use one of the dumbbell sets he had so I went up to him and I asked him if I could borrow the 20kg dumbbells and he said ""No sorry I am using the 20kg dumbbells"" so I said ""Ok"" and left to do a different exercise while I waited for him to be done with the 20kg dumbbells (I needed these specifically because they are the perfect weight for my exercise that I needed to do).</p>

<p>I waited about 30 minutes, and occasionally glanced over and he used the 20kg dumbbells ONCE during this time.</p>

<p>After 30 minutes he took the dumbbells back to the rack and I could finally use the 20kg dumbbells but my real question is: if someone is just holding the weights in their area and not using them how can I make them give them to me?</p>

"How to ask my boyfriend's family if it bothers them that I'm coming along","<p>I am in a romantic relationship with a very close friend of mine (we are both French and in the early 20s). We have been very close for years and we have been living together for a few months now. We spend almost all of our time together (nights and weekends).</p>

<p>When he visits his family who lives three hours away from our place, I am unsure whether I should come along or not. I came with him the last few times and <strong>it went well</strong>, I appreciate his family and I think it is reciprocal. However, I think it would perfectly reasonable if his family wanted to spend alone time with him. </p>

<p>My question is: <strong>How do I know whether his family would prefer me to come or not?</strong></p>

<p>I would like to know because I would personally prefer not coming if it is what his family wants. They don't see him very often (once in a month or two months) and I don't want to ""spoil"" his visits. Also, in general, <strong>I hate being somewhere where people don't want me around</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>My boyfriend wants me to come</strong>, and on his point of view his family has no reason to want alone time with him (but he's close to the description of Asperger Syndrome, and he may be missing some clues or something)</p>

<p>Giving that his visits are always informal, there is <strong>no proper invitation</strong> from his family: he just comes and they are happy with it. </p>

<p>It is a quite difficult topic to talk about since if he asks them honestly ""Does it bother you if X comes with me?"" , they can't really say ""yes"" because it wouldn't be polite and he might respond ""OK, so <em>we</em> are not coming"".
I suggested him to phrase the question differently, like ""Would you like to have alone time with me this weekend?"" but he assures me that his family would take the question exactly as the previous one.</p>

<p>Is there a way to find out whether my presence is unwanted? Things to ask, or signs to spot when I am there?</p>

<p>Tensions between my sister/dependent and our roommate have continued to get worse, and have finally escalated to a point in which I feel we have to move. The problem that I am having now is if I should tell him that I am looking for a place even before a place is secured. He can be very impulsive, and I worry that if he knows I am looking he will take it upon himself to initiate our 30 days notice, or worse, before I am ready. It is also important to note that the roommate/landlord and I were close friends before moving in together, and I feel some modicum of respect is due to him.  </p>

<p>So my question for you all is: How do I tell my current roommate/landord that I am looking for another place to live? </p>

"Will an hour's drive place too much of a barrier on a relationship?","<p>Yes, I've heard of the stories of people from different US states having long-distance relationships and eventually flying to each other and meeting up that way.  But I get the feeling that this is very atypical.  So the question is, <em>typically</em>, what is the furthest distance you should consider travelling for a relationship with someone if it's to stand a good chance of success?</p>

<p>I am dating someone who is about an hour's drive away and they have stated that they're concerned about the distance.  We both have cars so it's about half an hour's drive to meet up half way.  It doesn't seem like too much distance to me but am I being unrealistic?  What hurdles would this kind of distance present long-term and would they be likely to cause the relationship to fail. Furthermore, if these hurdles are not too bad, how can I communicate to the other person that the distance is not prohibitive?</p>

"Is it rude to ignore everybody else in a chatroom and only talk with one person?","<p>I've been a member of an online community that's mostly aimed at kids - although we've got members aged 8 to in their 20s - for almost four years now. There's a live chat available (with some pretty aggressive word filters). Now, I don't drop in very regularly - I drop in around one every couple weeks, usually. I used to be much more active on the forums, but most of the people I know there I know from like 2 years ago (of those who are still around) - I don't know the younger generation very well.</p>

<p>Now, when I drop into the livechat, I'll often just talk to the few people that I know... ignoring the rest of the people. Now, most of the time the other people in the chat aren't actually interested in <em>chatting</em>; they're more interested in role-playing. But I'm more interested in chatting with the people I know, like discussing one girl's YouTube channel and stuff like that. So I'll often just put everybody else on <em>ignore</em> (because it can be hard to keep track of a conversation when you've got a stream of unrelated messages).</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is: Is this rude to the other users of the room? If they try to talk to me I won't even notice, because I have them on ignore... and this could be 'clique'ish, because it's basically just two or three users who've known each other for a couple years ignoring all the newer people. (This is... at least a year and a half after the oldies vs. newbies war that left the site in ruins and with a severely depleted population, but I <em>really</em> don't want to cause it to resurface.)</p>

"Etiquette question regarding conveying enthusiasm in email communications - used in academic settings","<p>I have a friendly, close relationship with these professors - we are research collaborators and communicate daily.  Our communication scope on emails is never personal, it's <em>strictly</em> about research progress.</p>

<p>I notice that when math and physics professors send me emails that start with the greeting </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi D.Hutchinson!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>such emails evoke happy feelings and enthusiasm, rather than the more formal </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dear D.Hutchinson,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the usage of exclamation points in email greetings, in academic settings, appropriate to use, <strong>if I am not in a position of authority</strong>, e.g. I am not the professor responding to a student's email regarding research progress?  For example, would saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi Professor Thompson!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>be considered appropriate etiquette?  Or does it risk sounding unprofessional?</p>

<p><strong>The goal is to sound more upbeat and to convey enthusiasm</strong>, when replying to professors.</p>

<p>Personally, I've never used exclamation points for email greetings in any professional settings before, but I would like to do so and match the enthusiasm of the professors.  </p>

"Under what circumstances is it okay to not hold a door open?","<p>So, we’ve all had a situation where someone is coming into—our out of—some place, we notice someone coming towards the doorway we are in… At what point is it safe to just let a door close an not hold it open?</p>

<p>By my benchmark, if I make eye contact with someone who is close to me (behind or in front) or I see they are struggling with bags and things they are carrying—or are physically impaired in some way—I feel I should be able to hold the door open. But if someone is out of eyesight—and not struggling carrying bags or items or physically impaired in some way—I can let the door close.</p>

<p>Or is the solution just to not even think about this and just walk through the doorway and let people “fend for themselves” when it comes to opening a door for themselves?</p>

<p>For context, I am talking about doors to buildings and physical structures that don’t automatically open. I am <em>not</em> focusing on doors to subways, trains and elevators. I am located in a major city in the northeast part of the U.S. if that adds context.</p>

<p>P.S.: I am also not talking about “access control” or restricted areas or anyplace that is supposedly “climate controlled.” I am not asking to explain the obvious in common sense situations like that. This is simply a question about normal social expectations in a situation where access is clear and open; possibly public as well.</p>

"How to intervene in a random abuse/harassment situation?","<p>To be clear, this is not a situation where it is an abusive relationship. This was an interaction that took place in an impromptu manner in a public setting.</p>

<p>I was relaxing at an outdoor area in a local open air shopping mall, when a group of four late teens/early twenty-somethings stopped near me and began taunting someone about their assumed background and intentions based on the clothing she was wearing and skin tone (Appeared to be of Arab descent, wearing a hijab).</p>

<p>They didn't appear to be physically violent, their rhetoric was mainly along the lines of associating her with terrorist acts and asking ""how soon before you snap?"" and similar. The lady was clearly uncomfortable and refusing to engage in conversation, which seemed to encourage them to provoke some sort of reaction.</p>

<p>I did intervene in the conversation, choosing to talk the group directly in an attempt to get them to stop. Abuse was transferred, and even though I used moderated tones and non aggressive postures, they didn't appear willing to back down at all. Security came by and escorted the group away, so the situation was resolved.</p>

<p>However, is there a better way to intervene in a situation like that? Is there a way to defuse a situation such as this without the risk of escalation?</p>

"How to deal with depression privately and how to let my family know about it?","<p>First of all, I come from India, from a place where depression is not at all recognized as a disease. I have never met or heard a person from my place even mention the word ""depression"" </p>

<p>Anyway, moving on to the matter. I really do not know if I suffer from depression or not. I took 2 or 3 online tests for depression and all the tests have come out positive.  I am pretty ashamed of it and I do not know how to talk about it with my family. To top it, all entrance exams are coming up and my family and everybody else I meet just stresses on my exams. I used to do well in studies but nowadays I am like extremely poor in studies and am feeling hopeless and I feel that I won't be able to get anywhere in life. </p>

<p>I have read about depression on the Internet and it says that I need to see a doctor. The problem is that I don't know if we have a doctor here that looks after that sort of problems, and even if there is one, since I am still in school I can't go without anybody knowing about it. </p>

<p>I have tried talking to my mom :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me : "" Mom, I feel sad all the time and I feel anxious about
  what my life will turn out to be"".</p>
  
  <p>Mom: ""Just don't worry sweetie, just pray to God and all your
  anxiety will be gone"".</p>
  
  <p>Me: (After a while I start crying after a lot of comforting words)</p>
  
  <p>Mom: (A bit angry) ""You are just overreacting and you are just
  wasting your time by crying. Now instead of wasting your time go and
  do something useful. You know very well that you have only these many
  days left before your exam. Just pray to God. Why don't you do that?""</p>
  
  <p>Me: (in my mind ) ""God, please help me deal with this.."" But
  a voice inside my mind asks me ""Do you even deserve that? You are
  not worth anything. You are just better off dead.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just an example and I would like to highlight that this is not exam stress since I have been like this for about a year now. Whatever I try to do a voice inside me just makes me feel alone. How do I deal with this?</p>

<p>If there isn't any way that I can solve my issue without having to consult any doctor, <strong>then how do I confront my family about these issues? I have tried but if I just tell them, they just laugh it off or maybe even ask me what that means?</strong> </p>

"How can I communicate that I am getting frustrated when people tell me their problems?","<p>People like to tell me their problems, I'm not sure why, but everyone I know does it a lot. Such as friends, family and partner. </p>

<p>The issue I have is that when they moan about something or tell me an issue, I get frustrated when they don't actively take steps to fix the issue or problem. It's especially worse when it's a repeating issue with one, such example being my mother, talking about one of her co-workers. </p>

<p>Her problem is that co-worker does not do some of the things required from her role and she has to pick up the slack. Now this is a weekly if not daily issue and she tells me about it all the time. But when I asked her what she has done about it, she told me that she did nothing. I said she could talk to the co-worker in question and explain to her the things she is missing or talk to her bosses and explain what is the problem. </p>

<p>Every time I give her a solution she point blank, refuses to do anything and just accept it as a problem but still rants about it every other day. This frustrates me to no end and cannot see why someone wouldn't take action to resolve an issue that is upsetting you. This can cause arguments and upset her sometimes. </p>

"How can I help my Significant Other to overcome his fear particularly when I don't understand it?","<p>Everything is in the title but in case it matters here is some context:</p>

<p>I don't fear things (spiders or snakes or blood or needles or whatever) and I don't really understand how/why people are afraid of those things.</p>

<p>My BF on the other hand IS scared by some things.</p>

<p>A typical example is <em>needles</em>: I donate blood and he agrees with me on how important it is, but he never joins me because of his fear of needles (he sometimes comes but doesn't stay with me while they take my blood). He WANTS to, but he can't (I have never pushed or pressured him about it, he genuinely wants to do it, because he thinks it is the right thing to do).</p>

<p>So our problem is: Sometimes we/he can't do things we/he WANT to do because of fear.</p>

<p>I do understand that fear is not something rational and I'm talking about fear of things ""you can touch"" (like animals, object, not fear of dying or fear of heights or fear of accident/car crash).</p>

<p>What I have tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Being rational about those things: He agrees, but it won't go further (OK the spider won't eat/kill me but I won't touch it anyways (I still need to be around when there is a spider in the house))</p></li>
<li><p>Work on the origin of fear when possible (worked pretty well but not always applicable; sometimes there is no rational reason behind the fear or I just don't get/know where it comes from)</p></li>
<li><p>Being pushy and show him afterwards ""See it wasn't a big deal"": Kind of worked once for a small fear, didn't worked AT ALL for a bigger one - I won't try this again</p></li>
<li><p>Be an example: Same as number 1. He watches me deal with the thing, says it's OK but it never goes further.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So the main question is:</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can I help him overcome his fear? (When he wants to get over it or at least want to do things even if he is scared. I won't try to help with a fear he's not ready to face.)</strong></p>

<p>Subquestion: How can I have a better understanding of his fears wich may allow me to help him?</p>

<p>Edit 11/01/2018 : </p>

<p>To those saying that these fears are minor and we can live with it : Yes, I agree, we can and we do. But there is plenty of them, some that he wants to get rid of and some that really annoys me. Main goal is to help him with those he wants to face and maybe later when he'll be over them he may want to face those that annoy me or I can gently convice him it would be good to work on them.  I/We need advices because it will improve some/a lot of stuff in our life if we manage to deal with some fears, but if not we won't break up over it. </p>

<p>I'll take a couple of hour to process every answer and I'll follow the advices about exposure, and taking small step (and not mothering him too much) and I really appreciate the time you took to help me. Thank you all :) I'll accept an answer soon (a lot of good answers !) and I'll try to come back in a few days/weeks to give a feedback on the situation !</p>

<p>Again thank you all !</p>

"How to tell other people that my job is only a job to me?","<p>I don't know if this question may be confusing to some of you; so I will try to explain myself as well as I can.</p>

<p>I have been interested in informatics and technology all my life. When I was young I started learning how to code. I spent time tinkering around developing little projects involving servers and OSs. Eventually, and unsuprisingly I started to study coding and went on to get a degree with a solid grade. </p>

<p>Now I find myself in my 20s in the first development related work experience I've ever had. I got this job quite soon after finishing my studies. I'm currently developing for a website development company.</p>

<p>The problem is that I keep getting the same annoying questions from coworkers, bosses, friends and/or people I get to know:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Do you like your job?""</p>
  
  <p>""How is it working on something you really like?"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>or the most annoying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""How is it getting paid for something you would do for free?"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reason I find those questions so annoying are that people seem utterly confused, and some cases even annoyed when I tell them that I don't enjoy it THAT much, <strong>that it's only a job for me</strong>. </p>

<p>I still love learning new stuff and tinkering on my own technologies and stuff that I'm interested in, but my job (in general) doesn't excite me <strong>THAT</strong> much. So I have been feeling a uncomfortable when being presented with these kinds of questions.</p>

<p>Since apparently you <strong>HAVE</strong> to love your work when working in the IT/Development industry. However I don't think that me not ""loving"" my job is causing any trouble with my performance or the quality of my work. This is because that as a job, I take it very seriously and I put in the required effort. However clearly it doesn't seem to be enough for most people; they all seem to be pressuring me to conform to something that I don't agree with. I'm fairly certain that this same kind of behaviour is directed at people in other industries. Like for example cashiers, construction workers or regular administrative workers. Each of which ar eall equally valid jobs.</p>

<p>So how should I reply to those sorts of questions? How do I tell the people that to me, my job is just that, a job?</p>

"How to deal with someone that pigeonholes others?","<p>A close relative was recently engaged to this very sweet and friendly woman (aged 24) who happens to have a rather bad trait. She's very quick to pigeonhole people. Meaning she places people in categories without fully getting to know them or acknowledging all their qualities. And then proceeds to treat them with that misconception.</p>

<p>I know this person for about two months and didn't have much contact with her until recently since my wife will be in charge of wedding preparations. I was flabbergasted last night when I overheard some of her conversation with her friends during a family gathering. </p>

<p>A couple of examples regarding her behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of a good friend of my nephew came up as being maid of honor. Her reasoning for saying no was that she dressed provocatively, thus she will steal her husband. Preventing said friend from being part of something wonderful in her friend's life.</li>
<li>Another occasion was regarding another relative who's in his teens and not that social. My nephew wanted to ""hire"" him to rearrange his library but the fiancee declined because he would access have to their bedroom and go through her things. Although she never really interacted with this boy who happens to be this kind and respectful person.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were several racist remarks, comments about how people dressed (thus judging their financial situation) but not sure if these classify as pigeonholing. </p>

<p>Some of her comments got back to the people she was talking about, like the friend of my nephew's boyfriend overheard and told her - which made her leave the party. The teen boy was also a perv from his other cousins as a joke but it still hurt him. Similar situations happened all around.</p>

<p>I discussed it briefly with a couple of family members and we're pretty much sure that she doesn't know that she's doing it or what she's doing is hurting others.</p>

<p>I caught up with my nephew the next day over coffee and discussed the issue with him, not talking about specifics but generally asking if he has noticed his fiancee being quick to judge people, hold unrealistic images of them in her head and act upon those assumptions. Something that he denied but from his body language, I realized that rung a bell.</p>

<p>For that reason, I decided to go to the source of the problem and talk to the fiancee. I realize I can't change/make her change this trait of her personality. But I would like to ask/achieve her being a bit discreet about it and not discuss things like that in a family gathering.</p>

<p><strong>How can I approach her and let her know that what she's doing is hurting her relationship with others and especially me, as her soon-to-be family? How do I handle her if she keeps doing this at family gatherings?</strong></p>

"How to explain my friend that my gaming is not interfering with my life and I enjoy it?","<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>I'm 26, born and since living in Barcelona, I share house with 2 other guys, lets call them Bob and John. Bob is my best friend since 7 years ago and John  is a friend I knew  2 years ago from a friend in common, we have a good relationship and share a lot of tastes. </p>

<p>Me and my best friends are natural competitors, we met each other on a tournament of a Card game, and have been game pals since. We've competed at high level on several popular games and we really enjoy the thrill of competition. I do this on my spare time, I work 30h/week as a software developer.</p>

<p>The other flatmate is more of a casual player, who plays just for fun. He also has less time to play games since he got his last job which has a really heavy schedule.</p>

<p>Lately, after a break from competing in the last card game we were focused on, we decided to start training hard again and try to win tournaments and get good results. Therefore we spend more time practicing and playing in those tournaments. </p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>This creates situations where Bob and I spend whole afternoons of the weekend playing long tournaments, or just spending tons of hours playing during the week if we have an important tournament coming up. </p>

<p>John sometimes brings up that Bob and I waste too much time on that and instead - as really smart people - we should be investing our time in other more productive things. </p>

<p>We've had a few discussions about this. I try to explain to him that it isn't the same  playing a game for fun as playing to compete among the best players in Europe/the world.  We just don't get the same satisfaction if you cut the number of hours you invest because you usually see your performance decreasing as well, and honestly that's a feeling I don't like. When I compete at something, I like to do my best among the parameters I can (I won't quit my job to have more time to compete since my developer career is a safe path and well paid). </p>

<p>Conversations usually go like this :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>John: But don't you see that with that brain of yours if instead of playing you were using all that time to study or doing your own projects or business you could do whatever you want?!</p>
  
  <p>Me: I know. it's just a matter of preference. I enjoy competing in games; I've been doing it since I was 14 years old and I really enjoy it. I don't feel like giving it up for an improvement over my financial life, which you know, is perfectly okay.</p>
  
  <p>John: Yeah, but think how much could you make and all the interesting things you could investigate if you used that time productively like in this Machine Learning book you bought recently.</p>
  
  <p>ME: Well, I'm interested in the subject and I'll be studying it and trying to learn and see if I can make a jump to it in the next years but I won't give up the thing I enjoy the most in my life. </p>

<hr>

<p>He's usually the one who brings up the topic and I like to discuss quietly about things. But he just doesn't seem to understand that our perception of competing in games is really different from just playing for fun. </p>

<p>The only solution I can see is trying to compare it with something he really cares about like music (he plays guitar and he's been doing it for 14 years, so he's pretty good at it). </p>

<p><strong>Clarifications</strong> (may be adding new ones if I see it necessary)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During 2 years of college I had addiction to one of the games I was competing in, which ruined my college years and I sabotaged myself from finishing it. I didn't realize this for a while but when I did, after working on it, I quit playing for some time and tried to learn from my experience to avoid that happening again. Now I invest a little less hours (they're still a lot), but it's just when I feel like it. For some days I just don't play at all since I don't feel like it. And therefore I don't think I have a gaming addiction anymore, since the way I mentally approach it and how it affects on me are really different.</p></li>
<li><p>I've told him a hundred times I understand completely his concerns about our future, but the things is even if I follow my current path, I have a quite successful path, Bob isn't in the same situation so I understand his concerns about him and I've spoken with him about this issue, so I don't see why is he so bothered with me, just because I could ""aim higher"". But yeah, I don't see any of his attempts as attacks but rather trying to help us.</p></li>
<li><p>Bob and I talk about the game a good amount of time but we also discuss tons of topics (politics, psychology, philosophy,etc) so it's not like we're always and exclusively talking about that.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can I better explain how Bob and I feel about this so that he will accept our point of view or, at the least, get him to stop trying to make us feel guilty for playing them so much?</strong></p>

"How to distance yourself from someone that is growing overly attached","<p>Me (M,18) and my best friend (F,18) have become friends with <em>Amy</em> (F,17). We do not really like other people, but <em>Amy</em> was recently distanced from her usual group of friends, so we decided to <em>adopt</em> her. <em>Amy</em> is not mentally stable and has dealt with anorexia and depression. It is going better with her now, but she is now going too far into our personal zone:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Amy</em> shares extremely private information with her parents about us.</li>
<li><em>Amy</em> constantly asks about personal stuff that we don't want to talk about.</li>
<li><em>Amy</em> cancels her already well-planned birthday party to try to invite us to her birthday party, despite that we have said multiple times that we don't go to birthdays because of religious reasons.</li>
<li>Waiting upwards of 2.5 hours to bike home with us for only 7 minutes.</li>
<li>Getting angry when me and my best friend hang out without her.</li>
</ul>

<p>She has said that me and my best friend are her only real friends, and that she would still have depression and suicidal tendencies, if we weren't there.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> How do you distance yourself from a emotionally unstable person that has become too attached, without hurting her?</p>

<p><em>Amy</em> reacts to normal social interactions as if they are extremely weird and awkward. She can talk hours about how someone looked at her funny, while in reality it was just someone that wasn't even looking at her.</p>

<p><strong>So what do we want?</strong>
We would like to distance ourselves from <em>Amy</em>, to the point were we don't really hang out, but still talk when we bump into each other (We go to the same school, and see each other at least 4 times a week). We're seeking advice how to do this without hurting <em>Amy</em> and while being extra careful because of her mental state and history of being pushed away.</p>

<h1>The Greater Backstory</h1>

<p>I've been in a relationship with my significant other for a little more than 12 years now, they are in their late twenties, I'm in the mid thirties. We've been living together in our rented apartment for about half that time. It has not always been easy and there has been a significant breach of trust on their behalf on several occasions about two years ago. I do not believe there has been since and we have recovered from this. We usually get along quite well.</p>

<h1>The Current Situation</h1>

<p>About two years back, I finished my PhD, moved into industry and am rather successful at it and happy with the job I am doing. They have finished their bachelor's degree quite awhile ago and started the master's at a German university in our vicinity. While they are still technically enrolled they have expressed the intent to not finish and have ceased all coursework since for a variety of reasons. They are not actively looking for a job inside or outside field and would rather prefer to work on a self-employed basis. I am happy to support this but while they get the occasional job/contract I observe a clear lack of effort required to really kickstart their business. Right now, this is going nowhere.</p>

<p>They rather spend most of their free time, of which they have a lot, doing the things they like which includes what I would regard (they wouldn't) as an excessive amount of social media and contact with online acquaintances.</p>

<h1>The Actual Problem</h1>

<p>Talking about serious and important things has always been difficult with them from the beginning but things are at a whole new level recently. This includes distancing them from close friends who really care about them (because they might raise some uncomfortable questions/topics such as their studying or business progress) and spending a lot more time with loose acquaintances with whom they only speak jovially.</p>

<p>I would wish to discuss our future with them; like moving to a bigger apartment, improving the quality of our relationship and communication skills or, maybe, marriage. I would also like to encourage, motivate and help them to spend more time on and move forward with their business. </p>

<p>I am desperately trying to have this conversation for about four months now and it is going nowhere, to the extent that they would completely ignore me and any approach to bring up the topic. I have tried in person and I have tried in writing (when we routinely spent some time apart due to my business trips). This can include anything from simply dismissing my message text to them locking themselves up in the bathroom to avoid confrontation if I push too hard.</p>

<p>I have tried to let them know that I want to be patient if this is hard for them and that they can bring up any of the topics at any time. This has not happened. I have tried to let them know that this behavior is deeply hurting me, that it is aggravating my insomnia which consequently affects my time at work. They have neither reacted nor have they expressed any signs of remorse.
I have tried to let them know that this cannot go on forever and that I have contemplated ending the relationship or at least moving out of the apartment for now. They are aware that I have started to look at some single apartments as I have been very open about all the steps I take.</p>

<h1>How to Approach</h1>

<p>At first, I thought they were simply trying to break up without being the active party and I have, on occasion expressed that, although I love them, this might be an option if we cannot improve things. I do, however, no longer believe this is the case. We get along well if we're not trying to be serious and they do make joint plans for the medium-term future. No life-changing decisions, obviously, but things like holidays or concerts. While not being able to give much of it back, they are also currently looking for a lot of affection from my side (I have a hard time with this though, because of constantly hurt feelings).</p>

<p>I tend to believe I might be happier if just walking away from this relationship and if their acts are deliberate this would probably be the only option for me. However, I truly care about them and I do not wish to aggravate a situation that is already difficult for them.</p>

<p>At the moment, I honestly think they cannot talk, rather than they do not want to talk and I believe there might be depression at the root of this.</p>

<p>Hence, my questions is:
<strong>How to discuss future with disengaged and possibly depressed partner?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h1>TL:DR</h1>

<p>My significant other avoids any form of serious conversation about important topics for our future and currently leads a life of suppressing everything they do not want to think or talk about. This has been going on for months now. Hence, we're neither able to talk about any serious and important topics in our relationship nor about our communication issues.</p>

<p>What is a good way to discuss the future with my disengaged and possibly depressed partner?</p>

"What is the proper etiquette for sharing menu items at a restaurant?","<p>When I dine at a nice restaurant (not fast food), I frequently ""collaborate"" with another in my party so that between the two of us we can order two different items from the menu and then we each the have an opportunity to taste two different menu selections.</p>

<p>Half way through the meal we switch plates. We have been doing this for years in the U.S. and have not noticed that anyone else at the table was offended by this. One time at a restaurant in Paris one of the party that we were dining with was clearly offended when we did this. </p>

<p><strong>Is this improper etiquette? Does it vary by country?</strong></p>
"
"How to deal with comments about my likes and dislikes","<p>Let me try to explain. I have certain food items that I really dislike. I am not allergic to them, but their taste I just can not bear at all. They include some foods that people tend to have in too many meals, and the best example is onions (in any way, green onions, leek, cooked onions, etc.). Overall I am not a very picky eater, but even a tiny bit of onion will spoil any dish for me. I know I am not alone in this, I have several friends also totally disliking onions, but in general people like them, obviously.</p>

<p>So whenever I am at a restaurant and I have to mention food should be cooked without onions, they sometimes forget it, then I remind them I asked, and the waiter either says something like: ""But it compliments the dish!"" or ""But there's not much of it!"", or they pick the most obvious pieces out, but it remains there.</p>

<p>Whenever I am with friends or I meet new people in a friendly gathering and someone cooks for everyone, every time I am being mocked - in a friendly way, but - about it. I have, unfortunately, zero sense of humor, even though I try to cultivate it and am a good-natured person, so I can never think of a witty or a proper answer.</p>

<p>Whenever I am visiting my granny, she loves to cook for me (as grannies are) and at <em>every</em> <em>single</em> <em>meal</em> there will be a talk how I should try onions and how food is not eatable without them and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>I know this is my own problem, but I get <em>really</em> frustrated from all these comments and situations. I know I can not change everyone around me. I can definitely not change granny or any new people I meet, and I can not force my friends not to joke about it since it's their way of expressing friendliness towards me, light jokes. But it seriously angers me and makes me feel like an idiot. I can not control my food dislike, that's a given.</p>

<p>Any advice of how I can behave in such situations? Maybe how to answer properly to stop the conversations at the very start, not being too rude, but effective? I hope I have made it clear enough.</p>

"Alternative for ""What's the worst thing that can happen"" (dealing with anxiety)","<p><strong>How can I help calm someone's performance anxiety?</strong></p>

<p>We know that self-assurance in a speaker encourages audiences to be more receptive from the start. Conversely, people who look insecure on stage raise doubts about their competency immediately.</p>

<p>In companies and social groups, we often want to hear from those doing the work, with first hand knowledge of the issues involved. Unfortunately, these people can be too anxious and self-conscious in a group to do justice to their own expertise.</p>

<p>In small groups, I start taking notes to demonstrate how I value what they are saying. Later in a discussion I may ask them, not what they think, nor what answer is best, but which stood out to them — minimal challenge.</p>

<p>We may need such people before a larger audience only on isolated occasions, and they will never be public speakers.</p>

<p>One option is to interview them on stage. They are having a one-to-one conversation still, just with a crowd listening in.</p>

<p>Someone told me it helps the nerves if we imagine the audience in their underwear. I will not be suggesting that at my local church.</p>

"How to stop people from touching me without having to freak out at them","<p>I have a problem that I haven't been able to find an amicable solution to so far. I really don't like being touched, to the point where if someone is touching me unexpectedly I get confusion rising to panic if they won't stop. Over the years I've learned to keep myself under control somewhat, and to stop myself from reflexively shoving people away or hitting them. It still causes intense discomfort and is thoroughly unpleasant if people touch me. Most people that know me well know this and avoid excessive touching due to that.</p>

<p>The problem is, many acquaintances (friends of friends or colleagues) don't take this seriously at all even after repeated explainations. </p>

<p>In fact, some of them make a joke of it ""Heh he doesn't like to be touched lets group hug him from behind"" needless to say, it always makes me uncomfortable and it's really stressful and tiring and also sometimes I can't help myself and shove people away forcefully. </p>

<p>I've tried explaining several times that I don't like to be touched and that it causes me great discomfort, but to very little effect. Many of my acquaintances just don't take it seriously.</p>

<p>Short of throwing them across the room or having a mental breakdown in front of them, how do I convince them it's serious and I actually <em>really</em> don't want to be touched and am not just saying that? Is there any specific way I can phrase that request to convey I'm dead serious?</p>

"Is adding “let me know if anything is unclear” to an e-mail really necessary or is it redundant?","<p><strong><em>(Note that I originally asked this question on the English Language Stack Exchange and was told that it belonged here (Interpersonal Stack Exchange), so I removed it from the EL SE and manually moved it here.)</em></strong></p>

<p>I am a data scientist and I regularly receive e-mails from people (our office is split between London and New York) requesting things.</p>

<p>I often find that in the majority of cases, the people e-mailing me add a line at the end that is something along the lines of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Let me know if anything is unclear.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, if I am unsure about something, I will <em>always</em> ask for clarification.</p>

<p>Who wouldn't?</p>

<p><strong>My question therefore is this: is adding such an obvious sentence necessary?</strong></p>

<p>I should add that I have worked with the same colleagues who have requested things from me for several months, so we aren't strangers and, as mentioned, I always ask for clarification if I am unsure about something.  I appreciate that it might be automatic on their part (like ending an e-mail with ""Kind regards,"", ""Best wishes,"", etc.) but there is an element to it that I just don't understand which is why people continue to state the obvious.</p>

<p>It's the same logic as asking somebody a question in an e-mail and then immediately beneath that writing, ""please let me know"" - the former clearly implies the latter.</p>

<p>Surely if somebody who is given instructions is unsure about a particular part of said instructions, then they would be competent enough to ask the requester for clarification.  If they <em>wouldn't</em> ask for clarification unless prompted, then it implies that their competency levels aren't high enough to warrant a role where they are asked to construct things for people who lay out clear, coherent instructions.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some people have said that the question is not clear, so in an attempt to make it clearer I will summarise below.  Also, please note that I am not ranting - I am in fact curious and keen to understand why some people add this sentence to e-mails even if they genuinely know for certain that you are perfectly capable of the task/s they request from you.</p>

<p>The question is simply this: given that you know that somebody is definitely capable of doing what you ask them, and given that you specify clearly what you want, is adding such a line to an e-mail necessary?  The reason I ask this is because it sometimes comes across as patronising - I'm sure that's not the case in most instances, but nevertheless it does come across that way sometimes.</p>

"How to avoid conflict refusing to honor kid naming traditions","<p>I live in Eastern Europe and in my country we have a common practice of naming baby boys the same name as the father's father. While generally not an issue, I have entered a serious relationship and though we are not planing to have kids in the foreseeable future my father has started to apply a lot of pressure for us to have a kid and specifically naming the kid in his name, saying things like: oh ""When are you planning for little Borat to be around?"" or even directly asking ""You are naming your potential kid Borat, right?"" on numerous occasions. (Name changed for privacy and comedy reasons)</p>

<p>I don't mind the ""When are you going to provide me with a grandchild?"" part but my SO is not from the same country so she doesn't follow the same naming tradition and generally I don't think naming a kid (even a hypothetical one) should be a one person decision. I have discussed this with my SO, but since my opinion is that I don't want to honor the traditon her responce was something like ""Ok, good"" and it was not discussed further. </p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>I have tiredness issues (possibly/probably linked to my autism) and I will have to inform my manager or boss about that at some point. My original plan was to wait for the end of my probation, wait until I have the ""disabled worker recognition"" (having this recognition takes time and I probably won't have it before my probation ends) and then tell my manager or boss (and ask for a part-time in the same time).</p>

<p>However, things are not going according to my plans, I'm more and more tired (and less and less efficient) and I'm afraid I will have to inform my manager or boss about my tiredness issues sooner than planned (because they will notice my lack of efficiency and tell me that it's a problem). </p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How can I do so without making them feel like they made a mistake when hiring me? </p>

<h1>Side notes :</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm planning about telling my manager, but I'm not sure if just telling the big boss (who is also the HR) wouldn't be a better plan.</p></li>
<li><p>""How might your boss react if they were told you were seeking a diagnosis for tiredness before they saw medical proof?"" -> No idea</p></li>
<li><p>The company size is of ~30 people.</p></li>
<li><p>I feel as comfortable talking to my manager that I am about talking to the ""big boss"". I just don't know who is the ""logical"" person to talk to about that.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe that, me asking for a part-time (instead of working full time as I currently do) would be more easily accept if I have the ""disabled worker recognition"" (asking for a part-time is really badly seen in France, especially when you are an engineer).</p></li>
<li><p>By part-time, I mean 50% (that's an ideal situation).</p></li>
<li><p>Someone pointed out that my question was a duplicate of <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/20494/communicating-tiredness-issues-to-your-boss"">my previous one</a>. I believe it's not. There is a difference between telling my boss ""after this day at Disneyland I'm too tired to go to the restaurant"" (the previous question) and ""I have tiredness issues which impact my performances"" (my question now).</p></li>
<li><p>I have a diagnose from the fact that I'm on the autism spectrum. On my diagnose it's also noted that I have some level of tiredness. I don't have a diagnose from my tiredness. I also didn't really talk about that to my doctor yet but I'm planning on doing that soon (my doctor is the one who will help me get the ""disabled worker recognition"").</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important note</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking to work remotely some days a week could be a worth trying short time solution (in the company 2 of 30 people work remotely at least 3 days a week). But note that I still want to disclose my tiredness issues, even if I ask to work remotely after that (instead of directely asking to work part-time).</li>

"How to approach discussion with wife about a possible ""emotional affair""","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>My wife and I have been together for about 8 years now (married for 6) and we have two gorgeous children. My wife, unfortunately, has been suffering from mild depression for quite a while, long before we even met so probably about 15 years. It comes and goes, some months she's fine and others she isn't. She hides it well so it's hard to know when she is feeling down unless she mentions it.</p>

<p>Before we had our children, I gave her my utmost attention and affection. We would do all sorts of things together constantly like going out, watching films, playing games etc. When we had our first child (4 years ago), I regretfully changed. Obviously having kids is a major event in any mum's or dad's lives but I became more distant towards my wife. I didn't think of it at the time, I gave our first child a lot of attention and not enough towards my wife. This continued with our second child (2 years) ago.</p>

<p>During these 4 years, she mentioned to me several times that I wasn't being there for her. When she told me, I would be more attentive towards her but this only lasted for maybe a few weeks then I went back to how I was.</p>

<p>I had an epiphany a few months ago and made a promise to become a better husband. So I started to hold my wife more, hug and kiss her. Gave her more attention. After a few weeks, she told me I was trying too hard. That I was suffocating her and not giving her enough space. She also mentioned that she pretty much gave up on wanting to spend time with me because I did the same to her previously which is understandable. So I try to take it slow and be with her when she's not busy.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>:</p>

<p>For almost a year now, she has been fairly addicted to an online video game. She would play on average between 6 - 10 hours a day easily. Sometimes she would play from 8pm to 4am. She has made contact with other people and has gotten quite personal with one person. So personal in fact that they would talk about sex. Not in general, but having sex with each other. How I found this out is not relevant but my wife told me that these were just jokes, that it was only a fantasy and not real. She admitted she was doing this for attention (which I clearly did not give).</p>

<p>This caused me, and still causes me, so much pain. I found this out a few weeks ago. I would not have minded much if they made lame generic sex jokes. But describing what sexual activities they would do to each other made me almost physically sick and now it's all I think about. Day in, day out, at work and at home. I get distracted thinking about this and everytime I see her playing her game, I keep thinking what sexual thing are they talking about now. </p>

<p>She tells me she loves me and that she wouldn't leave me or the kids. I trust her but at the same time, I'm not sure if I should tell her how this whole conversation thing makes me feel. She told me if I did the same to her, she would not like it but it's not a big deal as going to see the person physically. I am afraid of creating more tension between us and she getting closer to her 'friend' if I told her how I felt. But she also doesn't seem depressed when she talks to him so maybe it is good for her to have this fantasy?</p>

<p>I don't know what to do. I haven't stopped giving her attention and affection and I feel I could do so much more but I don't want to do too much too quickly in case she rejects me. I have told her how I utterly regret my actions during the time I neglected her. That it was completely wrong of me to do so and how I want to desperately make it up to her.</p>

<hr>

<p>I guess what I am trying to accomplish is for her to stop having sex chats with her friend. And if she wants that kind of attention then she could get it from me. But I don't want her to think that she should stop talking to him (she won't since it is her choice). I am afraid that talking about this with her would result in an argument and could potentially cause a rift between us. I am trying my best to ignore the negative thoughts I have about this but I feel it will come to a point where I might just breakdown.</p>

I'm not sure she will be happy to know that I'm looking (even to) her legs, her bottom, her body in 'that' way, because she can think that I'm not interested in the dance but in sex and in that situation I think it would be stupid to think of sex, because she's not dancing (just) for me, I don't even know her and I will probably never meet her again. Maybe she likes to be looked at, but I don't want to pass for stupid or rude or maniac (I'm not) and I don't want to make her uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Sometimes I look just in her eyes but I'm not sure it's the right thing to do because it becomes very personal. Also, I want to watch the dance...</p>

<p>What do you think? Are there some dancers who want to share their sensations?</p>

"How can I tactfully approach not wanting to read someone's unpublished/self-published book?","<p>A lot of people who know me know I like to read, I read a lot of different things, and I read quickly. I also like to post about what I read on Twitter or my Goodreads profile. </p>

<p>The problem is, people seem to mistake my ability to read quickly and the fact that I have read things in a number of genres (although I do have preferences, but reading fast means I just get through more books than a lot of people, so I have time to read from a greater variety of genres and sources) for the idea that I will read just about anything tossed my way.</p>

<p>This means I get well meaning people I know asking me to read their (often) unpublished work, or their self-published work and for me to give them my opinion. I've realized this often means they basically want to use me as a free editing service. This isn't something I'm interested in doing, and I don't want to get into a place where if I do read their work, where they expect me to give them free advice on how to make it better, or what have you. I also do have some sort of mental selection process - so I might not even be interested in their book at all.</p>

<p>I've tried outright refusal by just telling them I won't read it, which usually ends up with them nagging me because they feel I should as a show of friendship, or causing fights about how I don't value the time and effort they have made in writing the work. I've tried stating it's not of interest to me, which only works if it isn't in a genre I actively read - otherwise, they'll push back. I've tried saying I don't have time, but since I read so many other things (and this is visible to anyone who sees my Goodreads updates), they get mad that I have time for other books, but not theirs.</p>

<p>I've also tried limiting myself to only reading the first chapter or so of something, to see how I feel about it, or to placate someone. This usually ends up in people telling me ""well, you started, might as well finish, right?"" or claiming I didn't get to the ""good bits"" if I say it's not to my liking. </p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way I can avoid reading things that I have no interest in (either because the book isn't appealing or I don't want to get into the free editing trap) without causing ridiculous rifts in my friendships. </p>

<p>I don't work in any sort of writing/editing/publishing related field (I currently work in tech support), I don't have a lot of people who follow me on GoodReads or Twitter because of my reviews or anything, and I don't get paid for anything I read or maybe review. When I do write reviews on Goodreads, it's often just like the star rating and maybe a sentence or two if something really struck me (good or bad). On Twitter, I usually just tweet when I particularly like a book or a particular passage really struck me, but again, I don't have a lot of followers and I am not really intending to be like a serious contender in the book review world, I just share about things I like in the books I read the same way I'd share on Twitter about movies I liked or random cute animals I've seen.</p>

<p>Is there some sort of tactful approach I could use here, beyond what I've already tried? </p>

He also does not have a very close relationship with my friend. I don't have any interest to keep greeting him in passing so I just stopped doing that by avoiding him or pretending not to see him (I have little bit of social anxiety which could be a contributor).

"How do I deal with a neighbor who stopped talking to me?","<p>I recently moved from 20 years in an isolated location (no neighbors in sight) to a suburban neighborhood (we can all easily see into each other's windows.) This alone made me anxious; meeting and being social with so many 'strangers' in such close proximity is not a routine situation to find myself in, and I feel clumsy navigating the dynamics of being the new person here. There are no fences on our block, so it's one big yard.</p>

<p>The worst is over and I've made friends, but I have a neighbor who has stopped talking to me (except when she wants medical advice.) If I say ""Hi"" or wave, she looks away. She was friendly initially, but she's icy now. (Her kids - 12, 8 &amp; 4 - used to talk to me all the time, and come over. When she stopped talking to me, so did her kids.)</p>

<p>I've tried talking to her in the least accusatory manner I could (""Are my dogs being annoying?"", ""I feel that I might have offended you; can you tell me what I've done?"" kind of thing), but she says, ""No, no, I have a hearing problem"" (which doesn't explain ignoring waving) or gives some other innocent-seeming excuse. She is pretty friendly with all of the other neighbors. If her dog runs into my yard (he's welcome to; I think he's a hoot, and it seemed fine for him to come over in the beginning), she literally screams at him to get back.</p>

<p>I asked one neighbor if they knew of anything I might have done to upset her, but they said no. I don't want to ask anyone else; I don't want to put anyone on the spot.</p>

<p>I feel very uncomfortable being in this situation; my personal philosophy is that how one handles conflict can bring people closer together or drive them apart, so I try to handle conflict and find a compromise, not ignore it and let resentment build. </p>

<p>How do I handle this breakdown of communication between my neighbor and myself when she won't even acknowledge it?</p>
"
"I gave a ""gift"" back to a friend after he asked for it back, and now he is trying to tax me for using it","<p>I'm usually good at this sort of stuff but I don't know how to handle this situation. I'll start from the beginning.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Backstory</h3>

<p>About 2-3 years ago, a good friend of mine, Henry, stole a grinder from another ""friend"" of his and gave it to me. I didn't want it at first but he convinced me to take it as he was ""only going to throw it away"" because he wouldn't be able to use it in front of the other ""friend"". Not being directly involved with this situation or the other ""friend"", I then took the grinder and used it myself for the next year and a half.</p>

<p>Fast forward to about 6-9 months ago, Henry and his ""friend"" are no longer friends and he decides he wants this grinder back. Now, Henry has been a really great friend to me and although I thought that asking for a gift back is pretty damn rude, I decided I'd give it back to him and buy myself a new grinder. I ended up buying the same model, which cost me €45. </p>

<p>It didn't bother me to buy a new one because I had plenty of money at that time. It did bother me that he asked for it back, but because Henry can be quite confrontational at times, I decided that arguing about how I felt wasn't worth it and it'd be all forgotten about shortly after.</p>

<p>Up until now, there was no issue. I had my grinder, and Henry had his. However, Henry decided to swap the top compartment of his grinder with mine - initially, this was just as a prank, but when I asked for the top part of mine back, he told me that he thinks it's fair that he keeps it because he gave me the grinder to use all that time ago. I mentioned to him how most people don't usually return things they get as gifts and that it was nice of me to even give it back. ""F*** ***"" was the response to that.</p>

<hr>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>Now, I don't care about money, and the functionality of the grinder is identical, so as far as practical impact goes, it really doesn't make a difference for me. However, I can't help but feel completely disrespected from all this. I didn't want the grinder in the first place, and if he had told me the day he gave it to me that he was just going to ask for it back later, and try take a part of my new grinder as tax, I wouldn't have taken it - why would I make a deal with little to no benefit to me?</p>

<p>Regardless, this feels similar to entrapment and that is <em>not</em> okay with me. I'm losing out here and I've done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>The other important factors are that I do a lot with Henry. We both live in the same locality and attend the same college an hour and a half away. We're also living together for this year of college. He organized the house to live in and as I don't drive he's my only way of travelling up and down from college each week. This also saves me a phenomenal amount of money as public transport in my country is extremely expensive and unreliable, especially when living rural. <em>This puts him somewhat in a position of power over me</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>This is where I need some advice. </p>

<ol>
<li>I want to tell him how scummy and selfish I think it was of him to request what I thought was a gift back from me simply because it suited him best, and then stealing a part of my grinder and trying to pass it off as tax for something I had thought was over already. This will almost certainly end with him telling me about how he does so much for me, then him telling me to f*** off. I would then have to deal with an awkward house and pay 60% of my income on travel. Not the best outcome IMO.</li>
<li>I say nothing, bottle it up and hope that this bottle doesn't overflow.</li>
<li>An option where I can get my point across and not risk losing a friend or having an argument.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm probably going to go with option 2, because it creates the least hassle for me - but being in a position like this is grinding away at me and making me feel powerless - enough to the point I've come to ask the internet for help!</p>

<p>What's the right thing to do?</p>

<hr>

<h3>More info</h3>

<p>Just to clear some stuff up:</p>

<ol>
<li>Accommodation in my country is very, very difficult to get. There is a national housing crisis right now and students are some of the worst affected. The idea of being able to secure, let alone afford, a one-bedroom apartment is out of the question.</li>
<li>Getting a car is pretty much out of the question too. Although I have almost obtained my full license, the price of insurance for a first time driver in my country is in excess of €3000 - not including the price of a car. It is simply not clever at this point in time to spend my entire savings on one.</li>
<li>I don't drink or smoke. I just vaporize cannabis. This makes the habit very cheap for me.</li>

"How to politely ask someone not to spread personal information?","<p><strong>A bit of backstory</strong></p>

<p>My parents are separated and my Dad has a long-term partner who he has been with for over 10 years now. She (my Dad's partner, let's call her Eve) has a close group of friends who she sees on a regular basis. One of Eve's close friends (let's call her Annie) works at the same place as me, in different departments but we occasionally see each other at lunchtime. </p>

<p>Someone in my family, Adam, has a mental health condition which sometimes means the way they behave is not the most polite, can come across as rude etc. I mention this because it has caused issues in the past. Eve has found Adam's behaviour to be 'unacceptable', has told my Dad, who has then told Adam which has caused a lot of grief and loss of trust. I think this goes to demonstrate how sensitive Eve can sometimes be about a person's perceived behaviour, which is why I want to avoid as much as possible any conflict.</p>

<p><strong>My Problem</strong></p>

<p>Adam had recently been going through a 'down period', whereby I mean their mental health was not in good shape for several reasons. I would talk to my (our) Dad about this when I would see him. Sometimes Eve would be there too, but I felt like there was no reason not to trust her with the information. In essence, Adam was not sure if he wanted to go on a family holiday because he wasn't feeling great, I felt it was important to tell them because they would need to be aware and available had that been the case.</p>

<p>So, on a couple of occasions at work, I have bumped into to Annie at lunchtime and she has asked me about a specific 'event' that either myself or Adam would have discussed with my Dad. My Dad may have discussed this with Eve which I don't see a problem with unless it was explicitly stated to be confidential between my Dad and Adam. I do however take issue with this for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The information I shared with them, was shared with confidence that it would be private between those present. It was not explicitly stated but I definitely would expect that to be the case.</p></li>
<li><p>I hardly know Annie. She is a lovely person but we are not close and she isn't a close family friend. On the contrary, she is only friends with Eve, not my family and certainly not someone who I would divulge such personal information to.</p></li>
<li><p>When Eve and Annie normally see each other it is with a large group of friends. So if Annie knows about this then it is likely that everyone else present at the time also knows. People who I don't even know. And who knows who else could have been told.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As nice as Annie is, and as much as I like her, it is not her (or any of Eve's other friends') business to know the inner workings of my family or Adam's personal information and I need to make sure that Eve doesn't do this sort of thing again.</p>

<p>This has only happened twice. With the example that I mentioned above and with another example.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier Eve has a tendency to be very sensitive about matters such as these. How can I go about asking her not to share such information? In the meantime, I know that I can refrain from saying anything with her present, but I know that I <strong>do</strong> need to tell my Dad important things. But then I would have to tell him explicitly not to share this with Eve which raises the same problem. </p>

<p>This is especially important to me because if Adam were to find out about how Eve had been 'spreading his secrets' it would cause a lot of conflicts and unnecessary grief in our family.</p>

<p>How can I make Eve know that she can not be spreading personal family information such as this with strangers?</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

"Is it okay to ask for a different doctor if you don't want to be treated by your current one?","<p>I am having superficial dental work done that's not related to any health issues. There are two doctors at the practice I go to: </p>

<p>1) dr. who I've had more interaction with during my various visits to the practice, and </p>

<p>2) dr. who got assigned (because of my availability) to my case over a year or so ago when I first went started visiting this practice. I've seen dr. 2 less on any occasion (or not at all), and the times I've had any interaction with this dr. it has been uncomfortable- I was never put at ease or assured about any concerns.</p>

<p>Naturally, I prefer if dr. 1 would take over my case because I want the dr. who works on something that's going to be the front focus of my face for a long time to put me at ease and be able to have a good conversation with me without me feeling like a burden or uncomfortable.</p>

<p>I am an awkward person with little grace, and I didn't handle this transition smoothly. I got the sense from the receptionist that they didn't want to transfer me to dr. 1. I literally had to say that I would feel more comfortable being with a dr. who I've had more interactions with and who puts me at ease about the procedure. In the end, the receptionist agreed and I've got an appt. with dr. 1. <strong>Was it okay to be so direct about this request?</strong></p>

<p>I understand the hesitation to transfer me- dr. 2 has been on my case for more than a year (though I've seen dr. 2 less, but the time span is long because I stopped going to the practice for a long time).</p>

<p>And there's probably an inter-colleague courtesy thing where these drs. don't poach each other's patients. <strong>Should I care about this, though?</strong> I just want the best treatment for my long term aesthetics.</p>

<p><strong>Should I feel guilty or awkward for dropping dr. 2? What would have been a better way to do this?</strong></p>

<p>The reason why I am asking this here is because I think my lack of social graces rendered me incapable of navigating this situation smoothly, and not making it awkward for everyone. I honestly don't believe it should be awkward because I just want to choose who I think is the better dr.</p>

<p><strong>What can I, as someone who desires an apology, do or say to make it easier for the other person to apologize?</strong> Inversely, what phrasing or behavior on my side make it harder for the other to apologize and should thus be avoided? The apology should still be genuine, emphasize with my point of view, and at least honestly consider to change the behavior that has hurt me.</p>

<p><sup>To narrow the scope of the question: I am not particularly interested in a discussion of whether someone who desires an apology is morally <em>responsible</em> nor not to make it easier for the other person to say they're sorry.

We've reached out a number of times both through text and in person to ask them to come take their stuff.  They always say they'll come soon to get it, but then they don't.  In some cases, this has gone on for years.</p>

<p>These things have ranged from insignificant, like dish soap, to more expensive things, like a desktop computer, though nothing as big as furniture.  Each person's things should easily fit in a car.  Nevertheless, we don't want to be storing these things long term.  Some things that I've thought about doing (but haven't done yet) are:</p>

<p>Through the internet I got to know a woman also living in my town, actually just 10 min per foot away. We wrote a few days and met a few times. The first time it was just standing and talking for 2 hours and then me getting her back home at 2am. The next day she got me out of bed at 10pm to go visit her, and we spent part of the night together and I left at 3am. We laughed and talked and had fun and during this I made my first attempts on touching her, and she let me, which I deemed as a good sign but left it at that because I were to meet at a concert and go out afterwards in two days.</p>

<p>During all this time we wrote almost the whole day with each other. And yesterday evening/night was the concert. We were in a group of 5 people, had tons of fun and with time and alcohol, I started touching her more, she did the same thing, and after the concert at a friend's home, we started making out, for the whole time we were there, so not just for a couple of minutes. </p>

<p>But sadly (might have had too much beer) I really got a stomachache and left to the bathroom because I thought I needed to puke, but actually fell asleep for like 10-15 min or so until she came in because she was worried about me, and encouraged me to puke so I would feel better and really refused to leave as she had no problem with this sort of thing, bound my hair back (have long hair, was a metal concert) and was really caring. Sometimes I stood up when I thought I felt a bit better, and we kissed and made out again an hugged and stuff. I didn't puke but I really really did not get better after some time and because I only had to walk 3 minutes home I left and went to bed. At the door she hugged me for like 5 min straight until I said I need to go out to the air because I'm getting really sick again. </p>

<p>She wrote me if I came home safely but I didn't see that and wrote with her today morning again. It was totally normal writing, to the sorts of yesterday was fun and so on and on, but what my problem now is..... Where do we stand? When I meet her the next time, which will clearly be in max 1-2 days if not today again going for meal with a few guys, where do we stand? Is it at a place where we could (just for sorting into categories) make out again when we were alone, or is it back at this light touchy thing, because when we made out we were drunk/she not that drunk actually.</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> We both would be interested in relationship, but it does not need to be, at least from my part as I just don't want something complicated again. But if it fits and thats okey.</p>

<p><strong>PPS:</strong> And I really hope this belongs to IPS as I have no idea where else to ask.</p>

"Colleague making me feel bad over a game","<p>A group of colleagues and I are friends outside of work. We like to go out together. We found out most of us play the same online team-based, player vs player game. We added each other as friends and started playing together. Myself and two colleagues play often, the rest jump in occassionally. Let's call those two Tom and Peter. We only play non-ranked games together. There is a ranked mode in this game.</p>

<p>I tend to enjoy the games I play with Peter. We play together well. I'm starting to enjoy games with Tom much less lately. Tom found out I am ranked slightly lower than him in the ranked mode, while Peter is ranked slightly higher than him. Since that point, he started changing his behaviour towards me. In the office, he keeps reminding me of my low rank, even though I haven't played the rank mode since the time I was just starting out the game (so my low rank won't change and I don't care), insinuating I'm that rank because I am a bad player. In the game, he tends to make me feel bad when I make a mistake. He never does this to Peter or other colleagues and even compliments them at times, so it does feel like he's singling me out. </p>

<p>Tom often indirectly targets me, like ""Why am I top healing while I am in a damaging role?"", when the game just started, I am playing a healer role and he's playing a character with self-healing, he took some damage and healed it himself. Sometimes he targets me directly, for example after I died, he said ""Of course you would die if you do that, can't you see that?"" Another time we almost lost a game but an action from me got us the win after all, to which Tom said: ""That was so close, but we played very well together, Peter!""</p>

<p>My goal is to create a nice office and gaming situation for myself again. I could refuse to play with Tom. This will improve my gaming situation, but Tom and Peter are both direct coworkers. I'll have some explaining to do. And it may not stop his nabbing in the office. I could also talk to Tom about his behaviour. But I'm not sure how to handle that. </p>

<p>I could block all my coworkers on the game and pretend I stopped playing it, but I do enjoy playing with my other coworkers, like Peter. I consider this  a last resort and would rather not do it. </p>

"Leaseholder suddenly increased everyone's rent, saying when he renewed lease with owner, they increased it","<p>I live in a shared household. One person signed the lease with the owner and we pay him money for rent. He gave postdated checks to the owner. The lease recently was up for renewal and the owner raised the price of rent for the house. The lease holder wants to forward this expense to us so everyone's rent is going up.</p>

<p>I don't consider this fair. My agreement was I pay the leaser holder $x / month and any deals he made with other people has no affect on me. Where I live the law is a landlord can raise the rent once 12 months. Since I'm technically not a landlord-tenant relationship, but more of a roommate relationship this doesn't strictly apply. Nevertheless, I have lived here for well under 12 months and it wouldn't be fair if I just moved in a month ago and the next the rent is up 50%. (the increase was actually $22/month)</p>

<p>I am willing to negotiate in that I will accept this rent increase if the lease holder signs a new contract with me which outlines everything exhaustively. I would like this because (as seen in my other questions) I think most of the problems come from a mismatch of expectations and if I have a contract that says it's complete then any future disagreements I could point to it. I do have a short, simple agreement in writing with the lease holder, but given what's been transpiring I need something more comprehensive in writing. I have spoke to him in the past about this but he seems reluctant and just puts it off without giving a clear reason or says ""why do you need this?"". </p>

<p>So, I'm thinking of having a meeting with the leaseholder and saying ""I don't believe I need to pay $20/mo more because this was not the agreement I made with you. However, I'm willing to make an exception and do this if we agree on a new ‘roommate agreement' in writing"". If he does not sign a new agreement, I will not pay the increase. However, I don't know if this is the best way to approach this. <strong>I want changes to stop being made unilaterally. How can I be polite but still firm?</strong> Since the current agreement is month to month I'm afraid he would kick me out if I upset him (however, when he kicked out someone else had to pay extra rent because he wasn't able to fill the vacancy soon enough)</p>

<p>I know with all the other questions it seems this place is not a good fit, but please don't suggest I move out. Due to my work location and financial situation, I would really like to continue living here for at least a little bit longer.</p>

"Replacing broken item when price has changed","<p>My 12-year-old cousin knocked over and broke a somewhat expensive TV at my place. After we cleaned up the mess, his parents offered to replace the TV. I told them the figure I remembered paying for it, and although they didn't look happy about it, they offered to give me a check the next time they saw me.</p>

<p>Then I found out that the TV, which I had purchased on sale, was no longer on sale. I shopped around and couldn't find it anywhere for the price I originally paid for it; at minimum it would cost several hundred dollars more to replace it. I would like to get the same TV again, as I spent a lot of time researching TVs before buying that model and was very satisfied with that exact TV.</p>

<p>What's the appropriate way to handle this? Am I justified in asking them to give me the current price since the TV is no longer on sale? Or should I only ask for the amount I paid for the TV on sale and eat the difference?</p>

"Who should identify themself first on the phone: the caller or the person called?","<p>This may be a generational thing.  I was taught that the caller always identified himself first.  The person answering says ""hello"", to establish that contact has been made, but is under no obligation to identify herself. She is at home, minding her own business, and has been interrupted in what she was doing by the caller.  It is the caller's obligation to identify him/herself first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caller: Hello, this is ab2.  May I speak to yz2, please?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With close friends, who recognize your voice over the phone, one could be a little more informal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, Mrs. Smith.  This is a, may I speak to y, please?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you were calling from a company or an office, you'd be more formal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is ab2 from IBM Corporation.  I'd like to talk to yz2 in Quantum 
  Computing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the calls I get now, except from close friends, start out by briskly asking me who I am (Note that ab2 is now the callee; above she was the caller):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is this ab2?  I need to talk to ab2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which I reply; ""Who is this please?""</p>

<p>Frequently the caller will, after a start of surprise, identify him or herself. But some don't.  They make another try to get ab2 on the line before giving  any information about themselves.  They seem to think they are too important and too rushed to waste time talking to someone who is not their target. I  will usually make another attempt to find out who the caller is, but if they insistently ask for ab2, I hang up.   </p>

<p>I am perfectly content with the way I handle the calls.  <em>They are never important.</em> But I am curious as to when and why this home-invasion model of phone calls developed. </p>

"How to align personal interests with family?","<p>I'm transitioning to the father role which is not going great. I'm facing the fact that I have less time now to follow my personal interests like watching soccer games on weekends. My wife is constantly pushing me to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>spend more time with the kid</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand her desires and agreed with them, but the need to totally throw away my own personal space makes me frustrated time and time again. And that leads to conflicts as the things we are forced to do are not enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>So the question is:</strong></p>

<p>How to discuss with my wife that I really need some time to my interests? How to approach this time inside the family? Is it right to have a schedule for work/personal/family? How to make this schedule to work and align it with wife's and kid's desires? How to organize that inside the family? </p>

<p>All the community tells that the parent should spend time with the kid but does it means the <em>whole</em> time? <strong>I don't want to be a bad father. I love my kid and my wife.</strong> I understand the need of sacrifices for the family needs. But still, I'm really frustrated. Maybe it is a sign that I didn't grow up. So I need just ""eat this situation"" inside and keep living with frustration?</p>

<p><strong>Notes on comments</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm the only working in my family. I am responsible for a certain quality of living which we both want.</li>
<li>I'm working 8 hours a day, spending 10 hours in work (time to eat at work and get to the office). I have 2 rest days in a week. So it is pretty much common.</li>
<li>She totally doesn't understand my interests in computer games for example (that's my hobby - she thinks it is not appropriate at all). If I will just sit and read a book - she will look at me with complaints and I'm feeling guilty.</li>
<li>Well, I initially did not necessarily want a child, but life happens. <strong>Now I love her and cannot imagine a world without her.</strong></li>
<li>My child is 2 years old and for 2 years I feeling more and more frustration. That's the whole point of my question.</li>

"How to let someone know you can't talk about a subject on the phone because someone can overhear?","<p>I don't really like my living accommodations and have several roommates.</p>

<p>I was talking to my mom on my cellphone and she started asking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is your house any better? Are your roommates still really noisy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The walls are paper thin and the person next to me was home (I know this because I could clearly hear every word of his Skype conversation that's been going on for the past hour). I tried to hint to my mom we should talk about something else but she didn't get it and I had to hang up.</p>

<p>She does this a lot. My grandma complained she doesn't get that some things shouldn't be discussed over the phone because the answer may be offensive to the other people who can overhear the conversation.</p>

<p>What's the best way to address this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi mom. I couldn't answer your question about my house because my
  roommates are close by and I don't want to offend them. These
  situations happen quite a bit. Do you want to establish some code word

"I got a job, how should I pay for my girlfriend?","<p>I've been dating with my girlfriend since almost 4 years. In the beginning, I was paying for both of us when we went out, so all of the couple-related expenses were covered by me. For example, if we went out for dinner or to the cinema, I was paying both dinners or both tickets, but if she wanted to buy a new dress she liked, then she should have paid for it.</p>

<p>After just a few months, we decided to split equally (50/50) the couple-related expenses. This decision was taken because we were both students and I had no income, just as she didn't, so it seemed more fair to us to head this way.</p>

<p>Now I completed my studies and found a well-paid job, but she is still a student and will continue studying for at the very least more 5 years. We previously decided to split the expenses because I had no income, but since this precondition is not valid anymore I want to pay the couple-related expenses.</p>

<p>However, I don't think my girlfriend would like to depend economically from me, or from someone else. In fact, her parents don't give her any pocket money; she only need to ask them to obtain the money she needs, but she really dislikes to ask for money, so I bet she would dislike that I pay everything for her too.</p>

<p>I was thinking of giving her pocket money, so that she can manage those money and will be able to pay her half of the expenses and probably to save something too. I'm not sure if that's appropriate and how much money should I give her. </p>

<p>Can such an idea be considered appropriate? Or am I expected to just pay for her? And should I give her pocket money, should I just give her what she needs to pay the couple-related expenses and let her ask for money to her parents to buy other things, or should I give her a little more than what she needs, to also allow her to save money?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your opinions :-)</p>

"How do I tell a relative that I don't want them to spend their vacations in my house","<p><strong>Context</strong>: I'm a 26 years old South American, and up until mid last year I lived with my parents. In June I moved countries (7,000 miles) because of work and now I live alone, and so far I very much enjoy it. My parents visit me every now and then because they can get cheap air tickets. I've also been visited by my sister, who has no intention of coming any time soon, and my aunt. </p>

<p>The only time my aunt came to visit me she stayed 2 weeks in my apartment, and for me it was not a nice experience. My aunt is a widow and she has problems with her only daughter, and this makes her unpredictable. E.g. the first night she stayed she started crying a bit over dinner because she'd have liked her husband to see my home. And I just froze because I never know what to say to comfort her. The whole 2 weeks I was with her I needed to watch my every word because I feared something I said would make her remember her problems with her daughter. It was mentally draining. I never ask her questions about her life because I fear it will spark a tantrum, but she brings up the subject in passing at very random times.</p>

<p>So to summarize, I would very much like for her not to come back, or at least not for two weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: my aunt has made it clear that she wants to come back, and she's already SMS'ed me twice asking 'if we can have a video call"". She doesn't want to explain via SMS why she wants to call me, but I'm 99% sure it's because it will be harder for me to say no to her face to face (she is slightly manipulative). So far I've avoided her requests.</p>

<p>I also feel a bit angry that she's ""inviting"" herself. Granted, when she left the first time, she asked if she could come back and I said yes because I didn't think she'd want to come back (it's an expensive trip). And also because, well, how do I say ""no"" to her face?</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: how do I avoid conflict with my aunt when I tell her I don't want my house to become her vacation getaway? She seems to make all these plans around it, like going on a road trip and such, and I've already told her I don't want to do that. </p>

<p>I feel like if I tell her ""no""...</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm being awfully selfish, because I would only have to take her for a week, and she looks like she could use some company to distract her from her problems</li>
<li>she'd probably resent me</li>
<li>she'd be confused as to why my parents can come any time they like and she cannot (it's because I get on well with them)</li>
</ul>

<p>But at the same time: it's my life and I should be the one to decide who I share my house with.</p>

"How can I stop enabling my brothers without my mom exploding?","<p>My parents are away from home for little private holidays on a quite regular basis (once every 2/3 months), where they leave me home alone with my 2 brothers for 2-5 days. I'm a 26-year-old female, my brothers are 22 and 16. </p>

<p>Since I joined IPS, I have seen some questions and answers about 'not enabling bad behavior'. These struck home, as I've basically been doing that every time my parents are away from home, and I'm home alone with one or both of my brothers. I have been enabling their laziness by cleaning up everything their lazy asses leave behind, just to avoid mom's wrath. </p>

<p>When everybody is at home, everybody pitches in to do the chores that need to be done that day. Problem is that my brothers don't show initiative, and have to be reminded of their part of the job by mom and dad. <em>The general rule when mom and dad are away, is that everybody cleans up their own mess, to keep the house in the state it was in before my parents left.</em> I've reminded them of that several times, but because I had been enabling them before, I think they didn't take me seriously this time. </p>

<p>So, my parents have just returned from their weekend off, and my mom exploded at me because apparently, I haven't taken my responsibilities seriously. Even though <em>I warned both my parents and my brothers, that I wouldn't be enabling their laziness anymore, and that I'm done being the little house-maid when my parents are away.</em> </p>

<p>Here's what I did: </p>

<ul>
<li>Not cleaned the kitchen. I used it once, to prep all my meals for the workdays my parents were away so I could take my meals with me to work as I always do due to a long commute. I cleaned it afterward. Although I saw my brothers making it into a bigger mess each day, I didn't clean it.</li>
<li>Not cleaning their muddy shoe prints in the entrance hall. I used the backdoor the entire time they were away, so the pawprints weren't mine. Thus, they were not my problem. If necessary, I can pretty easily prove they were from them, because we differ a lot in shoe sizes and the pattern matches their soles. </li>
<li>Usually, when my parents are out of town, I shower last. When done, I make sure I dry off the shower cabin glass, the showerhead and faucet, to prevent them from getting stained with limescale. These days, I didn't wait for my brothers to shower first, after all, they are old enough to dry off these things themselves.</li>
<li>Didn't empty the trash can when it was full, or throw away any of the trash accumulating on the kitchen counter. Okay, so the trash can may have been a bit petty of me, but trust me when I say that if 3 things in there were mine, I'm exaggerating. Same goes for the kitchen counter, I had already prepped my meals and wasn't home these days, so nothing there was mine.</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically, mom just returned to a kitchen, hallway, and bathroom that are a total mess, and she takes it out on me by saying that I'm the oldest, that I should feel responsible and that the mess, therefore, is my fault. I basically told her: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We talked about this before when you returned from previous trips, I told you that I was always the one cleaning when you were out of town. You always told me it couldn't be that bad. So, <em>before you left, I warned you that this time, I wouldn't be cleaning up any messes my brothers made,</em> if I didn't have a hand in that mess as well. Now you've returned, you can see the chaos and mess they made, and you're still blaming me? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her answer was yes, she's blaming me for not taking responsibility. <em>I'm usually great at talking with my mom and getting her to understand me,</em> but this time, she's being very irrational and <em>nothing I say or any of the tricks I know that she usually responds well to are working.</em> </p>

<p>I'd like my mom to understand that I'm not responsible for the mess she found when she came home. I'd like her to understand that the boys accountable for their actions/mess. I'd like to reach a point where at their next little holiday, the boys clean up their own mess (because mom told them to, I'm not expecting them to show initiative) and we don't have to go through this again. <strong>How do I follow up on setting this boundary and asserting it?</strong></p>

<h3>Addendum:</h3>

<p>For everybody that thinks it strange that a 26-year-old female and 22-year-old male are still living at their parents home: </p>

<p>I moved out when I went to university. After graduation, I couldn't find a job at my education level for a long time and was forced to work retail. That was only a part-time job, I was unable to get a fulltime one due to being 'too educated'. Since then, I've started going back to school and I have been working as a software developer for the last 1,5 years. Except for the last 1,5 years, there has been a few years where living on my own and paying my own rent/mortgage simply wasn't possible. Now that I'm sure I like my new job, I'm currently looking to buy an apartment and move out.</p>

<p>For my eldest brother, he was living in his own apartment until about 3 months ago, when he landed his dream job: zoo-keeper. He quit his old job and apartment since they were farther away than our parents' house, and was invited to move back by my parents. He did and will be looking for a new apartment once he passed his probationary period. </p>

<p>That said, our parents don't go out for more than a day if there isn't at least one of us home/near that the 16-year-old can contact in case of emergency. </p>

"How to talk to my brother-in-law about my concerns about his intent to propose to his girlfriend?","<p>I was born and raised in Italy and got married to a wonderful girl from Spain whom I met in the UK. A year ago my brother-in-law has met a nice girl from Italy and held a long distance relationship with her for about a year. A month ago she moved to live with him in Spain and he's about to propose to her. </p>

<p>I have been asked a few times by my in-laws the simple, very straight question: ""<strong>what do you think about her?</strong>"" and I provided my honest answer: she's a lovely person, easy going, good looking but I couldn't find much of an intellectual depth. To be more clear, every question that I have asked her she summarized in a word or she was unable to articulate a convincing argument to anything. She doesn't even speak Spanish while she lived there for over a year (she was there 3 years ago). </p>

<p>I have the feeling that it's too soon to propose and too soon to get married as they don't really know each other. They are both in their early/mid 30s and the age factor, at least on her side, pushes him to go ahead and foster the relationship. This family is very dear to me for many reasons, they are very famous and well respected in Spain and they really care about my opinions in general. From my conversation with other members of the family, I would say that we're all on the same page - she's nice, but she lacks something fundamental for a relationship and that is the intellectual capacity. </p>

<p>They are completely in love without control (which makes me very happy for them) but I think he deserves a much better girl; forgive me for being so blunt here. </p>

<p>How do I talk to him about my concerns about her without losing my relationship with him and/or with the family? </p>

<h2><strong>Edit 1</strong></h2>

<p>The answers below are very valuable to me! Just to sharpen my question a bit more: I was <strong>requested</strong> to provide my thoughts about the girl by both father/mother AND the brother-in-law. They asked me to tell them what I think because they know I will tell them my humble opinion. It's a tricky question and hence I need to formulate an answer that is honest and direct on the one hand while diplomatic and unharmful on the other hand. </p>

"How do I motivate my partner to study a certain field?","<p>Background:</p>

<p>I am an engineer, but I like to do more than that. I have some hobbies that also bring some extra cash.
My wife, on the other hand, she doesn't work right now. She is looking for a job, but unsuccessfully so far. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, while reading some information about one of my hobbies, she read as well and then she asked if I could teach her that. I've explained some things about it to her and then I've asked her if she likes it, because there is no point in doing something if you don't like it. She said that she loves it. I again said that there are plenty of things to read as it is a vast field, and you need to spend much time in order to learn something that could turn profitable later. She said she'll do it. Time passed, she read a bit but it's not even 1% as she should've, considering she wants to make money. I've told her that she really needs to be more disciplined, to read more, practice more and focus more. Every time she said that she'll do it, but... not now.</p>

<p>In the end, I've told her that in this way, she'll never learn it. Obviously, she got mad at me. I've tried to explain that it's not that I'm not supportive, I am, but she really needs to spend more time to learn and practice these things as they are really difficult. I also helped her and explained every time she asked.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>How can I motivate her to study a field more that she said she likes and would like to try?</strong></p>

<p>PS: I accept tag suggestions, since I don't even know where to put the question.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Does she have trouble understanding the subject on a (to her) satisfactory level?</p>
  
  <p>A: There isn't something too difficult that she could not understand. And she hasn't shown signs so far. When she didn't understand something, she asked. I've explained and she moved forward.</p>
  
  <p>Q: Are you confident your wife genuinely wants to pursue the hobby with the same zeal as you?</p>
  
  <p>A: Yes, I haven't forced her, as <strong>she</strong> had the initiative. I only explained that if she wants to be a pro, she needs to spend more time learning, otherwise it's a waste of time, since she won't know enough. We had a serious talk on this matter, and she said ""Yes, I'll do it!"" a few times already. Those were the moments when I've told her that she needs to study more in order to get there.</p>

"How to follow up on a party invitation from an acquaintance given weeks ago?","<p>I work at a small company where most people are friends with each other. I get along with a few of my co-workers in the office and at work organized parties, but wouldn't call any of them friends.</p>

<p>I had been invited to a couple of parties organized outside of the office when I was a new starter, approximately 3 years ago, but my health declined soon after and so I did not spend very much time socializing with them over the years. My health issues also negatively impacted my social skills so I kept to myself during the bad times, often sitting in silence in the lunch room while others conversed. Occasionally I would try to re-integrate with conversations in the lunch room, lunches out at restaurants (a daily occurrence at this company) and after work drinks when my health was slightly better. Even at the best times during this period, I did not feel completely integrated into the group.</p>

<p>I also lost touch with my friends outside of work because of my very inconsistent health, and for unrelated reasons, I have no desire to get back in touch with them.</p>

<p>My health issues have been going on for closer to 6 years, and so I feel like I've missed out on a significant portion of my 20s, and that I have catching up to do in terms of forming friendships and having the experiences I've missed out on. I do not feel comfortable sharing this with any one of my co-workers, as I still don't know any of them too well, and frankly it's embarrassing to talk about a problem where the most visible symptom is ""inconsistently worse social skills"", as it just sounds like a bad excuse. (For what it's worth, I've recently told upper management about my health, it didn't affect my quality of work, but I do need flexible time off for treatment).</p>

<p>Starting from the past couple of months, my health has been getting better, in fact the best it's been for a long time, as I am finally getting medical treatment after several misdiagnoses. A few weeks ago, one of the beloved members of the group left the company and I revealed my health issues to him, apologizing for not being sociable as we'd gotten on very well in and out of work for the first few months that I'd joined the company.</p>

<p>At his leaving drinks, he said to me that he'd be holding a party and he'll be sure to invite me, as he did remember our early interactions fondly, and understood putting my health above everything else. The date of the party is coming up very soon, and I'd expect that invitations have already been given out to many of my co-workers.</p>

<p><em>Does the invitation seem like hollow promise made in the spur of the moment or a genuine one? If it was genuine, would it be too forward to ask the host directly, even though we haven't been in touch since his departure, or should I ask someone at the office about it, even though the people I know best are acquaintances?</em></p>

<p>However, I don't want to put anyone in an awkward situation where they only invite me because they feel like they've been put on the spot.</p>

  <p>Guy: ""Well then, why don't you smile for me? You look mad.""</p>

<p>Personally, I find it annoying <em>at best</em> to feel like a stranger is telling me how to present myself. I end up feeling like my personal ""bubble"" has been somewhat invaded. <strong>It's not anyone's choice but my own if I choose to share a physical cue of (emotional) warmth with them</strong> and being asked to do so makes me immediately disinterested in everything about the person in question.</p>

<p>However, <em>I really don't know what to say next when people put me in this position</em>. I don't want to ""lash out"" because I feel that often the people doing this may not understand why it can be inappropriate, but there is absolutely no way that I am going to smile for them, let alone continue a conversation with them.</p>

"How do I anticipate whether using the expression ""of color"" will be received favourably or not?","<p>I am European, and I seem to understand that in North America it's particularly common to use the expression ""Person of color"" instead of, for example,  ""Black person"".</p>

<p>I understand that it's meant as a positive expression, that conveys respect, that was used for the first time by American activist Martin Luther King Jr., and especially in the United States, is often associated with the social justice movement. So it does not seem to be an expression intended or expected to show arrogance or superiority towards the person ""of color"", at all; on the contrary, it's meant to show respect.</p>

<p>But doesn't ""<em>Of Color</em>"" mean ""<em>Non-White</em>"" ? It <a href=""https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/person_of_color"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">certainly</a> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">does</a>. Nothing more, nothing less, just precisely that.</p>

<p>So does saying ""Person of color"" actually convey more respect than saying ""Black person"" ? Doesn't ""of color"" imply that the only thing that matters is whether you are white or not, and if you are not, it doesn't matter what you are ? There are the whites at one side and all the others at the other side, will this be actually perceived as more respectful ?
In fact, as I would have expected, there are instances where people take issue with being called ""of color"", for example as per the second quote in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/1685/11347"">this answer</a> .</p>

<p>I would like to avoid calling people ""of color"" or anything in general that means non-white, because it would make me feel like I'm coming across as an empty arrogant as I am white, and because I do think that people have excellent reasons to react annoyed to being described as ""of color"".
But at the same time, although my own logic would tell me so, the vast majority of times that doesn't seem to be the case. Apparently it's most often meant and received as respect.</p>

<p>So how do I pick the right expression to avoid an annoyed reaction ? Is the ""annoyed"" reaction an edge case ? Or maybe that type of reaction is only common in individuals from specific groups, so that this can be taken into account to pick the expression to use ? Or are there alternative and less controversial expressions that could be used instead ? The latter would be the easiest to implement in my case because I already feel that ""of color"" is objectively a poor choice and I don't think I want to use it anyway.</p>

<p>I am thinking not only of cases where I am speaking directly to the person ""of color"". I am also thinking of cases where I am speaking with persons ""not of color"" to whom I still don't want to give the same impression of arrogance and poorly concealed self-superiority that I get when I hear other people using that expression (as a non-American unfamiliar with the usage of this expression).</p>

"Writing supply conditions that define customer's deadline","<p>I'm a freelance since 10 years and I develop hardware and software.
Usually the pattern of a job is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>A customer contacts me asking for something</li>
<li>I submit him a quote with the <em>proposal</em> of my supply conditions</li>
<li>If he accepts and signs the quote I do my job</li>
<li><strong>He helps me to validate the project</strong></li>
<li>Billing and payment</li>
</ol>

<p>Some words on point 4: in most cases I cannot fully test the board or the software without some support provided by the customer. I.e. if the board has to be connected to an industrial machine I need to go there with his technicians, and so on.</p>

<p>One of the worst problems I often face is when the customer receives the stuff (pcb or software) but doesn't actually test it - even for 9+ months. And he doesn't pay me because ""he hasn't tested it yet"".</p>

<p>One day he wakes up and requests me to be <em>immediately</em> available because ""my project doesn't work"".</p>

<p>Well, sometimes this is known and expected because as said I actually need to complete the development on field, others he changed his mind in these months and he wants something different.</p>

<p>My supply conditions look like these:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the delivery date is guaranteed if I receive all information and support as described in the quote</p></li>
<li><p>after 30 days from delivery the project is assumed to be completed and fully working if no feedback is provided back. Billing will follow.</p></li>
<li><p>any change to the specifications of the project should be discussed and might lead to extra costs</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(They are actually written in Italian - I apologize for any grammar error).</p>

<p>When I point out these conditions in such a situation, these are the most common answers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don't care/read them</p></li>
<li><p>The project doesn't work as <em>I</em> expect, hence it's your fault</p></li>
<li><p>Because I wasn't able to use your project for N months (well because you didn't use it!) you will be paid after other N months</p></li>
<li><p>These conditions are not acceptable to me (so why did you sign them?)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What do you suggest to prevent these uncomfortable scenarios?</p>

<p>Of course losing a customer is a valid option, but too many of them show this behavior. Perhaps there is something wrong in my pattern?</p>

"Chronic illness at work; navigating genuine ""how are you?"" questions","<p>I'm a 23-year-old woman in the United States. I have several chronic illnesses that in turn manifest in more short-term symptoms. I doubt all the particulars are actually relevant here (correct me if I'm wrong) but my laundry list of issues generally boils down to daily on-again off-again nausea, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, exhaustion, anxiety and brain fog. I am on treatment plans and actually in a great place health-wise compared to a few years ago, but some days are inevitably rougher than others. </p>

<p>I have the great fortune to work for an incredible startup with very empathetic people doing work I love. They've been very understanding about my illnesses and very forgiving with my work schedule and tasks - suffice it to say I love it here. My coworkers and bosses are all very personable (it's like a big family) and therefore concerned for me.</p>

<p>I often get people (both at the same level as me and above me) at work sincerely asking after my health. On the one hand, I feel they deserve and are actually interested in how I'm doing, and I should, therefore, give a genuine answer. On the other hand, I've been trained all my life to say ""I'm fine"" and not show weakness; particularly to those who owe you paychecks. </p>

<p>As my issues are chronic I am perfectly comfortable saying ""I'm fine"" when I'm in a less-symptom-heavy period. I can go for months at what I'd consider baseline health and function completely normally. </p>

<p>What I'm stuck at is some way to resolve the internal struggle I have when I am in a downswing and people are asking me every day or three if I'm feeling any better. The answer is almost always ""same as yesterday"" until it's not, and I can't always tell if my responses come across as being a downer, looking for sympathy or otherwise subtly begging for time off, less work, etc. Plus I don't want to respond in a discouraging way; the support is amazing and I don't want to in any way belittle or shut them down for genuinely caring.</p>

<p>A typical response I'll give might be something like;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slightly better than yesterday which is a great thing!</p>
  
  <p>Not too great but I'm getting along. (and then I change the subject)</p>
  
  <p>Pretty bad today so I might need to go home early, but I wanted to come in and make sure I finished xyz task first.</p>
  
  <p>Didn't get the best results on my last test/visit/etc but I'm staying strong!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I try to put a positive spin on things wherever possible so I think it balances out but I'm not sure. As you can tell, I am a worrier by nature. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> My chronic illness means I'm sometimes sick for long periods of time (2-6 weeks at a stretch) and my workplace is full of genuinely concerned people. Am I handling responding to their questions of ""how are you?"" appropriately? If not, how do I answer without outright lying, but also without appearing to be a 'Debbie downer' looking for sympathy?</p>

"How can I support a friend with healthy weight loss?","<p>I caught up with a friend recently, and she mentioned that she is trying to lose weight (she is overweight). She told me about the program she is using for it which sounded great and supportive. But then she confided in me that she was worried she was developing unhealthy habits which could turn into an eating disorder if left unchecked (e.g. bingeing on a 'cheat day', obsession with tracking calories).</p>

<p>I don't have any experience with eating disorders and was a bit taken by surprise by the whole conversation, so I didn't really know what to say. I'd like to support her in losing weight in a <em>healthy</em> way, but I don't know how to do so without accidentally encouraging unhealthy dieting behavior. (Plus if it's really an eating disorder she should probably see a professional, right?) She also didn't specifically ask me to help keep her on track, so I don't want to come off as pushy if I send her a healthy recipe, or talk about another type of diet, or something like that.</p>

<p>For context, we work in the same office, and although we haven't hung out very often, I think we'd both like to become better friends.</p>

<p>What are appropriate ways to support someone who is trying to lose weight? How can I encourage her in a healthy way?</p>

"How to start a conversation with an introvert/nerdy classmate?","<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I am a 16-year-old introverted boy and rarely talk to girls (if ever). I like math, awkward in any conversation 90% of the time, am Asian, not very good-looking.</p>

<h2>Story</h2>

<p>I go to the school library alone to do maths as usual and I used to walk past the same girl frequently. Then, I eventually started to like her. </p>

<p>She appears to be an introvert, likes reading (I think), a grade younger than me (year 10), respectful towards friends (i.e. stops what she's doing and gives her attention), she feels comfortable with her friends (ie.. does cute love hand gestures and quick dances), usually hangs out alone (from observation).</p>

<h2>My problems</h2>

<p>How can I approach/start a conversation with her? I just wanted to get to know her and develop our relationship from there. Maybe teach me how to maintain a conversation? </p>

<p>I'm asking because today I lost my greatest opportunity (i.e. library not crowded, she's alone, my friends are not present). I thought of saying (but didn't):</p>

"How do appreciate people's creations that take very little effort","<p>I find that I generally appreciate people's creations the more effort I think was required. To give hopefully an easy to understand example, if someone offers me a drink of tap water I would appreciate their hospitality where as if they offered me a piece of homemade pie I'd appreciate both the hospitality <em>and</em> the effort required to make the pie.  </p>

<p>And so, when it comes to other creations, in particular creative creations, I generally find it hard to appreciate things that require almost no effort. I'm not saying simple art, especially of the type in a museum, has no place. There's a different type of appreciation for people that manage to get their simple art in a museum. Rather I'm talking more about friends, acquaintances, that make digital art that, sorry to use this phrase but I think it expresses my pov, art that they farted out. Nearly zero effort required (say 10-30 mins) and that anyone remotely competent in the same field could also fart out just as easily. They then go around on social media and are ""Look at what I made! Look at what I made"" and get lots of kudos online for things that are seriously low-effort.</p>

<p>To go back to the water vs pie example, the analogy is as though the person giving me tap water is asking for praise on how delicious they made that water even though they had nothing to do with it being delicious. Maybe they choose which glass to put it in? Where as the person making the homemade pie actually did need some skills and required effort to make a delicious homemade pie and so it's easy to have appreciation not only for receiving pie but for the skills and effort of the pie creation itself.</p>

<p>Is there a way for me to think about this kind of stuff that would help me feel as others seem to here so I can respond to them in a geninely positive way? To feel encouraging. To feel appreciation. Rather than what I typically feel which is a kind of disgust that someone is promoting their no-low effort digital scribbles? Note I don't generally mention my disgust. I either give a white-lie (that's great!, like, +1, heart) or say nothing. I'd prefer some kind change of heart on my part, some POV or philosophical position that helps me genuinely appreciate those creations. </p>

"Neighbours yelled at my wife for ""telling their kids off""","<p>In what has become an extension to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/16716/neighbor-unhappy-with-the-fact-i-asked-his-kids-to-return-our-toys"">Neighbor unhappy with the fact I asked his kids to return our toys</a></p>

<p>My wife has just called me in tears because two of my neighbours felt it appropriate to yell at her because we ('you and your husband') 'tell their kids off'. </p>

<p>Now, if we were in fact telling them off for a range of things unrelated to us I would understand at least the displeasure, if not the uncivil nature of its communication. However these are the incidents they are referring to:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/16716/neighbor-unhappy-with-the-fact-i-asked-his-kids-to-return-our-toys"">Neighbor unhappy with the fact I asked his kids to return our toys</a></li>
<li>Child kicked ball into my kids head, apologised and we said ""it's ok, just keep an eye out next time""</li>
<li>Asking them not to let themselves into our porch / cupboard / garden</li>
</ul>

<p>And this specific case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Child pointed a Nerf gun at our 2yr old daughters face (after shooting someone else who wasn't playing) and my Wife said ""shes not playing, its not nice to shoot people who aren't playing"", at which point they shot my wife in the face instead and my wife went to the parents and told them what had happened.</li>
</ul>

<p>My wife was then treated to 2 grown females shouting at her saying ""Don't tell our kids off, if you have a problem with our kids, come to us"", which I'm pretty sure is largely what we have done. Now one of those neighbours is the first neighbours friend, but up until this point, we thought had no problem, and ironically tells the other neighbours kids off all the time.</p>

<p>Honestly at this point I feel the only recourse is to move but I feel thoroughly disheartened to be effectively bullied out of my home. My wife doesn't want me to speak to them in case it escalates further, but I don't feel I can simply leave things be. Surely not addressing it is worse? </p>

<p>What actions would people recommend for disputes with neighbours like this? It has an element of walking on eggshells, as I don't want it to turn into ""you should parent like this"". Like this questions:</p>

<p><a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/7185/how-can-we-ask-neighbours-to-be-more-quiet-without-escalating?rq=1"">How can we ask neighbours to be more quiet without escalating?</a></p>

<p>Ultimately I want to address the tension between us in the most sensible way that wont lead to violence (I will probably repeat the tactic from the previous answer linked to). But I also would like to get a feel of options beyond that, I'm thinking some of the options in <a href=""https://rentberry.com/blog/bad-neighbors"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> are possible, but I'm not sure where to start....</p>

<p>This is not in and of itself a health and safety question, though there is the issue of meat spoons used in vegetarian dishes.  Rather it is a matter of courtesy as not everyone likes their flavours mixed, or their food handled by others.  </p>

"How to gently tell someone that you just want to be friends?","<p>Already many months ago, ""Bob"" joined my circle of friends. He has a plethora of good character traits and it is really great to hang out with him. In addition, he is a bit shy and also introverted.</p>

<p>Through the last several weeks, I got the strong impression, that Bob has a crush on me. This was also independently verified by other friends (without me asking them about it). So it is a pretty safe bet. He didn't make a move yet, but it already got me wondering what to say to him.</p>

<p>Now, I really like Bob as a friend, but just as a friend. I don't want a romantic relationship with him.</p>

<p>So my question is the following: <strong>If he opens up to me, how do I reject his advance in the most gentle and least hurting way?</strong></p>

<p>My goals are</p>

<ul>
<li>to make clear, that we will just be friends, so that he can look for another girlfriend.</li>
<li>make clear, that I really want us to stay friends. That's not just a set phrase to put an end to an awkward situation.</li>
</ul>

<p>So unlike previous questions like <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1183/how-to-nicely-tell-someone-i-am-not-interested-in-a-second-date"">here</a> and <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/130/how-to-nicely-reject-someone-who-is-hitting-on-you-in-the-united-states"">here</a>, I'm not talking about a(n) (almost) stranger. I hope that we can stay friends and he won't feel like he lost face (that he made a fool out of himself), or feeling too  uncomfortable around me. </p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions, what to say (or what not)? E. g. from what you said yourself or maybe would have wanted to hear in a similar situation (so both sides of the coin)?</p>

<p>Additional information, that may be helpful:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm currently not in a relationship, and neither is Bob.</li>
<li>No additional complicating issues like differing cultural/religious background or the like.</li>
<li>I don't fear a violent reaction or the like. This is of no concern to me.</li>

"Should one apologize if they misunderstood/misinterpreted something in a fast paced discussion?","<h3>Example situation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Peter: I believe step 1 can be easily replaced by more efficient algorithm</p>
  
  <p>John: I'm afraid the interface does not suit our needs (doesn't have anything to do with step 1, completely disregards it)</p>
  
  <p>Peter: I specifically mentioned the step 1, which seems unrelated to the implementation.</p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>What should John say now, Given that John is in a bad shape, e.g. lack of sleep, tiredness? </p>

<h3>My approach</h3>

<p>I would say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>John: I apologize for missing the context, I'm not in a good shape these days.</p>

<p>Is this a good idea? When I have done this, people have said that they didn't find it offending at all, though my guess is that it is mutual politeness. Would situation change if it would be verbal communication instead of texting?</p>

<p>John and Peter are in work relationships, or possibly they are two SE network users (excluding overcrowded sites like SO). As a result, each side has no idea what country the other is from.</p>

<p>Of course, the best way would be to go to sleep, but I spend most of my time on SE, as I find it more entertaining and fun than anything else. I gain invaluable skills too.</p>

"How to insist (and convince) on a course of action when you are not in a position of power","<p>I help a young teenage boy learn English at a non-profit organization where I am a volunteer. The boy is considered at-risk youth as he's the child of immigrant parents and of low socioeconomic status. </p>

<p>English is the third language he is learning and French is also mandatory in his school (public school). </p>

<p>I noticed from the beginning that the kid has some learning difficulties and though I am not in a position to diagnose the kid, he does show symptoms of dyslexia. However, I have some training in special education and I suggested that he should get evaluated for specific learning disabilities. 
He's a smart kid but is really struggling with spelling and he has problems remembering things (e.g he still can't remember the word ""well"" in the answer ""I'm well, thank you"", when asked ""How are you?"". </p>

<p>Every time I report to my supervisor, I make sure to tell her my observations and after repeating myself a few times the supervisor reluctantly reassured me that she would inform the boy's mother. </p>

<p>On the most recent lesson, I spoke with one of the psychologists - my supervisor had already left - and told her the exact same things, that the boy would greatly benefit from being evaluated if it means getting the help he needs in school. </p>

<p>The psychologist's response was more or less that these problems tend to get overdiagnosed and that she is worried that the boy would be stigmatized for no reason. He already has low self-esteem and so on.</p>

<p>I disagree with the delay in informing the mother and I would like to politely insist they recommended her son got evaluated by a professional to at least exclude a learning disability (even if not severe). </p>

<h3>How can I convince them that they need to act sooner rather than later and talk to his mother about it?</h3>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I was at a meeting yesterday. I spoke openly about the boy's learning difficulties since we all had to discuss our students' progress. 
My main points were that a) he'll be more stigmatized for not being on the same level as the other kids rather than for having dyslexia and b) that exactly because he's bilingual and English is his third language, he needs to be evaluated for possible dyslexia. 
The psychologist's response was that it's best to avoid labels (""he is dyslexic"") and that we (looking at me, though) should be careful about this concern becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
I decided to just do what I can on my part (by studying and finding resources for teachers) to help him and be as effective as I can but convincing the psychologist and my supervisor is probably pointless.
I could insist to an annoying degree but it seems that the more I insist the more stubborn they become about it. </p>

"How to ask my housemate to take better care of his pets?","<p>We have three kittens (around 16 weeks old) and a bearded dragon in our household. The kittens are well fed and looked after because I look after all three of them. <em>I have no qualms with that at all</em>. They're little dudes.</p>

<p>The problem lies with the fact I have no clue how to look after a bearded dragon nor' do I have experience doing so. So I tend not to get involved too often.</p>

<p>I see regularly that the water is dirty or that there aren't many locusts in the tank (at this moment, there is only one). The housemate in question (I shall call him Bob for simplicity) only seems to get the water changed either when I remind him that the water is running low (maybe twice a week or when his dad visits maybe once a month). He also said he'd get locusts for the tank last week because I was asking questions about the bearded dragon purposely to hopefully trigger it, such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, how often to bearded dragons eat? are they like snakes where they don't have to eat too often? </p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'll have to pick some up tomorrow</p>

<p>but tomorrow was six days ago. I'm worried because I'll be leaving this house soon to move to a new city and taking two of the kittens with me (which I own). Which means there will be one kitten and the bearded dragon left here (which he and his girlfriend Alice own). I couldn't live with myself if I left them without saying anything. Bob has an easy ride because he knows I'll feed them on schedule every day, I just don't want the other kitten to lose that routine or either of them to suffer when I go. I can also imagine because Bob used to live with his parents, they more than likely helped out with it too, this will be (from my own assumption) the first time he's looking after pets on his own. </p>

<p>What can I say or do to remind him to ensure that he keeps a sharp eye on his pets? </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Additional information</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>We also live with his girlfriend Alice, who'll be staying here and she loves the kittens to bits but is scared of the bearded dragon (so she's in the same boat as me in regards to having no clue what it needs)</li>
<li>I have no qualms being direct and upfront with him as I'll be leaving, but I don't want to burn any bridges with either of them, as I would like to check up on the kitten every now and then (I've grown to love him).  </li>
<li>I would like to enforce that he doesn't mistreat the animals at all, he's great with the kittens and the bearded dragon, they are very much in a loving home. He's just a bit lazy when it comes to his responsibilities and needs a push in the right direction sometimes. </li>
<li>Bob had already owned the bearded dragon when he moved in and then we
got the three kittens together (two mine and one his and his girlfriends)</li>

"Best way to tell a new friend I'd like to date her","<p>Last summer I met this girl at a festival. I had this almost instant feeling she's perfect girlfriend material. Turns out though that just a few days earlier she'd fallen for another guy at the festival and they ended up going on a trip afterwards. We did however continue chatting and bonding during the rest of the festival,  talking about personal things such as relationships and feelings.
Afterwards we stayed in touch from time to time checking in on each other. Her relationship with the guy from the festival lasted a few months. When I found out that they'd broken up I didn't see it as an opening for me, instead I felt sad that it hadn't last since I genuinely care for her .</p>

<p>Fast forward to Christmas and she let's me know she'll be close to my town around New years in case I want to meet up. We end up having a really good day together and it would definitely have been a perfect date if it was one. Anyhow, seeing her again only solidified my feelings towards dating her.</p>

<p>I have absolutely no reason to believe that she feels the same way. She's incredibly lovely, both when texting and in person but that's just who she is. Which also is the number one reason I'd like to date her.</p>

<p>I've already decided I need to find out if she's interested and as comments pointed out this is best done face to face.  My question is, what is the best way to ask her, ie what phrasing would I use in person?

<li><p>We live in different towns and won't be seeing each other in person anytime soon. Although she suggested on more than one occasion for me to come visit and go to an underground club.

"As an American abroad, how do I know when cheek-kissing is an appropriate way to say goodbye?","<p><strong>The generic question</strong></p>

<p>Traveling abroad as an American, especially in Europe, how can I know when I'm expected to cheek-kiss someone as a parting gesture?  Is the rule different for men and women?  How do these customs relate to hugging or shaking hands?</p>

<p><strong>My question in context</strong></p>

<p>I'm from the United States, where (at least in my sub-culture) cheek-kissing is generally not performed between anyone who isn't either family-related or romantically involved.</p>

<p>For the sake of this answer, I would appreciate any perspective, not just Canadian, although that is the perspective through which this particular interaction took place.</p>

<p>I was on a trip through Europe with a friend and met three French Canadians from Montreal.  When we first met, I believe all greetings were limited to shaking hands.  </p>

<p>I am a male American, my traveling companion was a platonic female friend, and the Canadian friends we met were two men and one woman.  Their native language was French and their English was fluent but with clear French accents (I'm not sure if this is important or not, I just want to establish the level to which I believe they are versed in French culture).</p>

<p>The five of us spent several days getting meals together and going out for fun until we parted ways.</p>

<p>Upon saying goodbye, I hugged the two men (where I come from, this is common among males you have become close with, and I don't believe there was any discomfort among them), and was approaching the woman for a hug as well but was caught off guard when she performed cheek-kissing.  I adjusted my demeanor in time to reciprocate, but I was left wondering how I should have anticipated that moment and behaved appropriately.</p>

<p>Wikipedia writes this about cheek-kissing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cheek kissing</strong> is a ritual or social kissing gesture to indicate friendship, family relationship, perform a greeting, to confer congratulations, to comfort someone, to show respect, or to indicate sexual or romantic interest.</p>
  
  <p>Cheek kissing is very common in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and Latin America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What social strategies can I use to know when this is expected so that I can avoid coming off awkwardly while traveling? It seems like the social gesture is confined to ""friends"" based on the description from Wikipedia, and we had only known the group for several days, but I still consider them ""friends,"" however I was unsure if that was the level of friendship that warrants cheek-kissing, or if it is usually performed among close, long-term friends. <strong>Or</strong> is it expected even among acquaintances?</p>

"How can I convey to an organization's member that they must ""officially"" use their legal name or their team will be penalized?","<p>Someone submitted something to me with their full name as William ""James"" Smith.  It is required to use their legal name.  I continued to use the name ""William"" on other documentation but William asked me if I could use James instead since everyone calls him James and he uses James for everything apart from legal documents like birth certificate, etc.  For my purposes I am required to use their legal name.  I told him this and he would not accept that, saying how he uses James everywhere.  Perhaps seeing that I wasn't going to accept James, he said that it was a privacy issue and he did not want other people to know his real name.</p>

<p>I have no issue calling this person ""James"" (and yes these are all made up names) and in fact had been calling him ""James"" all day.  This is for a sports organization.  While it is not a government agency or anything, there is a national governing body that has official policies such as this. </p>

<p>The name in the system shows up on rosters, score sheets, rankings, etc. and this is where the person's name would be visible to others.  We turn in the score sheets after each game to the national headquarters and if the name differs from what's in the system, the team is penalized.  </p>

<p>Sure it's a sport, sure it's an extracurricular hobby, sure it's for fun but this is actually a small business for me and I have to adhere to the national policies.  Additionally, I'd think it wouldn't look good to make exceptions for some people and not for others.</p>

<p>I've since talked to the national headquarters and they reminded me that the policy is to use the legal name.  They made a small compromise, putting his name in the system as ""William James"" and informed me that if we turn in score sheets that say James Smith, the team would not be penalized. (<strong>EDIT</strong> Forgot to mention that the rosters and rankings will now show ""William James Smith"", but the score sheets we submit may say just James Smith, i.e. the William part will still be visible to others in some aspects)</p>

<p>I did not know how to react because I certainly want to respect people's privacies especially if there is truly an issue.</p>

<p>However, I felt that using the privacy issue was a lie to try to persuade me to get what he wanted.  For example, his email address contains ""William"" in it and he has 2 Facebook profiles: one as James Jordan and another as William Smith.  It's not difficult to find the William Smith profile.</p>

<p>How do you react so as to not look like you disrespect people's privacy issues but you think that the privacy issue does not actually apply to the situation?</p>

<p><strong>Follow-up Question</strong>: Was it even appropriate to ask the national headquarters?  I already knew the policy and was fairly certain they would not make an exception.  Does asking headquarters and furthermore letting James know that I tried asking headquarters only encourage them to come up with farfetched/implausible excuses because now I look gullible?</p>

"How to approach the owner's handicapped son about him distracting our work?","<p>For the last two weeks, our owner's son has been coming to our office daily to ""work"". However, he can't work. There's no work that can be assigned to him, and he is constantly distracting us by demanding more work (which he actually can't do).</p>

<p>He is 23. He is handicapped. He uses a wheelchair and can move the upper part of his body, although not too precise. Not to belittle him, but in my opinion, he lacks general knowledge and I believe he has a form of autism (I don't know what), indicated by how he lacks consideration in interacting with people. He has never worked before.</p>

<p>He invited himself to work in our office because of Alice, my female coworker.</p>

<p>Although the situation sometimes a bit awkward because of his inconsiderate comments (not only to Alice), he is generally a nice person. However, he is distracting us by asking for work. For now, we have asked him to compile a report from invoices, which he has done <em>very slowly</em>. The report has already been done by Alice, and the task is given to him merely to satisfy his demand.</p>

<p>We have two problems if we give him (a part of) our work:</p>

<ol>
<li>He cannot be held responsible if he makes mistakes.</li>
<li>He will slow us down, and we are already understaffed (so we can't spare a person to coach him).</li>
</ol>

<p>The owner already knows of this, but I don't think they have realized the impact on us. I'm looking for a way to get through this without asking his parents (the owner), mainly because:</p>

<ol>
<li>The son is actually a nice person.</li>
<li>He does not have a lot of friends. He is usually holed up in his house.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My goal:</strong> To stop, or minimize the distraction, while maintaining our friendship with him.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to approach him. We've tried ""You're distracting our work"", ""You better stay at cafe"" (we are a cafe) in a joking manner, but it does not work.</p>

<p><strong>I'm not sure what to do.</strong> Should I approach him? Or should I approach his parents?</p>

<p>*Update:** Examples on how his disability disrupt our work.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He works slowly. He picked up bills stacked on his table in 5 seconds, stared on it for 20 seconds, stared on the keyboard to find the keys needed to input the data, then proceed to input the data. This consumes at least 2 minutes to complete one data entry.</p></li>
<li><p>He occasionally drops bills, papers, or phone. We then need to pick them up for him. If we delay helping him because we're busy, I guess he will start to rant to himself that we should help him first so he can work.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that I'm not against him working with us, but for now we simply cannot find any ""real"" work for him. We'd prefer someone <em>else</em> assign him some tasks suitable for him.</p>

"How to ask a friend to stop joking about a nonexistent relationship between other friend and me?","<p>My initial situation is kinda similar to the one described <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2632/how-to-gently-tell-someone-that-you-just-want-to-be-friends"">here</a>, but includes a troublesome third person.</p>

<p>I brought an acquaintance ""Bob"", who's also a good friend of my BFF, into my group of friends, with whom I share a hobby. Everybody including me befriended him really quick as he's a very nice person.</p>

<p>Anyways, a couple of months ago ""John"", started making jokes about how we would suit each other perfectly as a couple, that Bob might have a crush on me and sometimes he would even get really crude and pretend we already have a secret relationship going on including bed room speculations, which led to a lot of fun for everybody except me (usually Bob is not even present, if he is, he's just remaining silent). 
On multiple occasions I've made very clear that there's nothing going on, that I like being single (I really am). At one point I even asked, why he (and apparently others, who sometimes join the jokes) think anything could be going on between Bob an me. The answer was just ""because you two are single"", followed by childish laughter. I also tried joking and redirecting the topic to something else, or how I'd rather get together with John instead (he has a girlfriend of almost 10 years though, who I know very well). He liked the back joking, but quickly got back to ""Bob + me"". At least, when I don't answer at all, he stops after one or two extra remarks, which is what I've been doing recently.</p>

<p>Normally, I would just continue to ignore the jokes, since Bob has made no hints that he likes me more than the other girls or would be interested in something serious. I actually think he knows pretty well, that I'm not interested in him. The thing is, the occasional jokes have been going on almost a year by now with slightly higher frequency, and it's getting really annoying. At some point even my BFF (who initially introduced Bob to me, but is not in the group) asked me, if I could maybe imagine dating Bob. Apparently he is looking for a girlfriend. Another girl (who I suspect likes Bob) also asked me, if I'm interested in him because she thinks ""we would suit each other so well"". With the girls it was quick and easy to clarify my non-interest, they haven't asking anything else since then. Only John is still continuing.</p>

<p>All the jokes and hints are slowly making me paranoid, because I start looking for subtle hints (I think Bob is not the type to ask directly), I get more concious of how I talk to him (so I don't accidentally send mixed signals or something) etc. It's making me distance myself from Bob for no apparent reason (none he's at fault for at least) and I feel bad about that, since I consider him my friend, too.</p>

<p>So, my question is: How do I tell John to stop with the jokes, while maintaining my friendship to him and Bob? I also don't want to start some drama within the group, cause overall I like hanging out with them. Or should I just continue to ignore everything because ""guys are just guys""? (If it's of any relevance the group consists of mainly 30-something men.)</p>

<p>Up till now I have been avoiding to say ""There will never be something going on because I'm not attracted to Bob"" since it's like I'm rejecting him without him even asking. There has to be a better way?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I didn't expect things to get this big in such a short time, I even felt a little silly at the beginning. But I thank you guys a million for understanding and giving me some insights as to possible reasons why ""John"" is behaving like this and furthermore for many possible solutions on how to deal with this. I would mark multiple answers as a solution if I could.</p>

<p>I've decided to directly confront him in private next time, to tell him the jokes are not funny and that I want him to stop and then see where this will go as suggested first by @Chris Sunami. 
""John"" is actually not that bad of a person as he might look here right now. So I hope he'll understand and stop. Usually we get along really fine, except when he starts aforementioned jokes. If he doesn't, I probably will just ignore him and not meet with the group for awhile (or meet with the other when John's not coming along).</p>

<p>And yes, even though most people in the group are 30-something, they're rather childish. I didn't expect that thing would continue for so long. I wouldn't have minded one or two comments.
Also, I want to stress that this is a private social group (not work) and most of the time I consider them to be my friends (yes, even ""John""...). The group is also not rude in general, most of them don't say anything when this happens (can't tell if they are entertained or just don't want to be involved). The worse situation was when three of them ""were having fun"" (I just left on that day).</p>

<p>About his crude remarks, explicit sexual remarks have been - thankfully - rare so far, even if in two cases they definitely crossed lines. I thought it's a common thing among guys when there's a high number of them, which is why I didn't do/say much at the beginning. When there's more girls than guys, we never ""joke"" like that (even if it's all girls). (I actually get less harrassed than other guys, but more than other girls - which doesn't make it much better, but well...)</p>

"Dealing with small crimes as a volunteer","<p>Every now and then I volunteer for an association, organizing big role play events in my country (by big I mean several days with between several hundred people, so nothing at the national scale, but big enough nonetheless).</p>

<p>There I act as one of many game masters, creating the game to entertain people,... but I'm also meant to make people apply the rules whenever I can, be sure there are no cheaters etc...</p>

<p>The association has a responsibility towards the players somehow, and even though as a volunteer I risk nothing (legally speaking) if rules are not respected, it's part of our duty to make sure everyone is safe, and to some extent that the law is applied. I'm not there to play the police, yet I can't let people commit small (or not-so-small) crimes without doing anything, because the association might suffer from it. </p>

<p>This year, I eavesdropped a little while waiting for someone, and heard people talking about what they were smoking. They were absolutely not trying to hide they were having fun with good old cannabis, and to the smell of it, indeed it was drugs they were smoking.</p>

<p>Here lies my problem. Smoking this is forbidden in my country. If many people are doing it, it will be very bad press for the event. Moreover, I'm talking about an event with childrens of all ages, pregnant women sometimes etc... thus people who must not be impacted by passive smoking from this drug.</p>

<p>So, I think I should step in and stop these people from taking drugs, right? But here comes the tricky part. It is a well known fact in my country that a large majority, especially for people of my age, is in favor of the decriminalization of cannabis. So, should I step in and stop this, I can be a hundred percent sure a lot of people will see it very negatively.</p>

<p>I was told in such case I could ask people to stop smoking, and in case of repeated offence, to seize their ""cigarette"", or even exclude them from the area of play (which is a private property rented by the association). </p>

<p>My problem is: I have a duty to perform, yet I'm absolutely not a member of law enforcement, thus the only authority I got comes from the respect players have for their game master. Nothing more. </p>

<p><strong>How can I approach these people to stop smoking drugs in the event area without causing a drama?</strong></p>

"Using my own training plan without upsetting stubborn trainer","<p>I've been working out at the local gym where I live for about half a year now. Since my town (if one can even call it that) is pretty small, the gym is too. There aren't a lot of people and therefore not a lot of machines/weights, but that's no problem, I never had to wait for anything. But since the gym is relatively small, aside from the owner there are no other trainers.</p>

<p>For the last 6 months I used the training plan the owner provided me (which was free). But after a lot of research myself, including books, websites and forums, I think the plan is highly unbalanced. I came up with a better, more balanced and less intense plan (since I'm only working out for half a year) and tried to talk to him about the topic. He immediately rejected my statement of his plan being unbalanced, and told me I should follow his plan. I'll see I'll make gains, he said. Sure, I might make some gains, but for what cost?</p>

<p>I don't want to just follow my own plan behind his back, because that might upset him. Because of his age he's pretty old fashioned, he also seems relatively stubborn.

"How do I help someone that has really low self esteem and gets crippled by failure?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a close friend with many great qualities. She has low self esteem probably because she was always expected to be the best (during school mainly) so even if she performs really well, she considers it to be average. She needs constant positive reinforcement and is very sensitive to criticism.</p>

<p>I think this is what results in her not being able to deal with failure. Even if it's only a board game, after losing she completely falls apart and starts saying stuff like ""there's no point of my existence"", ""I'm worthless"" and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>I'm the closest person to her and she really looks up to me. Still whenever I compliment her, or recognize her achievements, it doesn't feel like I'm actually helping her. It feels like I'm making her depend on positive reinforcement even more. When she hits a low point after a failure, I have no way to get her out of that state, other than distracting her with something else. She doesn't listen to reason or anything, she just gets into this loop of ""I'm worthless"".</p>

<p>There was a point when she decided to get help but then she changed her mind about it and I don't really want to push her.</p>

"Ex-girlfriend is obsessing about me, how to stop the madness?","<p>Long post ahead, I will try to tell the story from my point of view, mainly because I'm not really sure about what's going on in the head of the other person.</p>

<p>A few years ago I used to date this girl, let's call her Mary. After 1 year she decided that I was not really her type and we both moved on without keeping in touch. Nothing weird up to this moment.</p>

<p>Several year passed and around 1 year ago I found this girl at my company, Mary was offered an internship position. We were working in different buildings, in different teams and different projects so there was basically no professional contact between us. She told me that her life at the company up to that point had been miserable, mostly because she felt unwelcome by her coworkers and technically overwhelmed. </p>

<p>Just out of kindness I tried to help Mary learning some technical concepts and tried to keep her company during lunch so we naturally got a bit closer again. At this point I think it's important to say that I had (and still have) a girlfriend, and I let Mary know immediately. </p>

<p>I'm not really sure if Mary got interested in me during those days or if she was just looking for new friends but she frequently tried to meet me outside of my office hours. For instance a few times I told her I had a plan to go running after work and she self-invited herself to come with me. After the training she tried to plan more activities together (dinner, meeting with other friends, going to a club) but I always declined, making clear that I was not interested and especially that I didn't want to go out without my girlfriend.</p>

<p>When her internship ended, Mary moved to a different city. At that point she started to text me daily about how she was unhappy there, how hard it was to make now friends and how much she missed our city. I was not really interested in hearing her complaints or be friends with her but I felt bad for her and tried to be friendly and let her vent.</p>

<p>A few week passed and I had to go to a professional one-day event in a town quite close to the city where she had moved and unfortunately I told her about it. She self-invited herself again and spent all the time there with me. I was even a bit annoyed by her behavior at this point.</p>

<p>When going back to my home city in the night Mary started texting me about how wonderful had been spending the day together and how in her opinion we would make a great couple. At this point I answered very explicitly that I didn't feel in the same way and that I was in love with my girlfriend. She got extremely angry, telling me that I deceived her into thinking I was interested in her. </p>

<p>At this point we arrive to the current situation. Mary texts me 2/3 times a week telling me that she loves me and wants to be with me. I tell her that I'm not interested. She gets angry and invents a new hypothesis to explain why I behaved like that (deceiving her and all). At the moment her best hypothesis are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tried to take revenge on her because she left me years ago</li>
<li>I tried to make her suffer just because I am a sadist</li>
<li>I tried to turn her into my lover</li>
<li>I tried to keep her as a ""spare tire"" in case I break up with my girlfriend</li>
<li>I am in love with her but I'm just a coward and don't want to leave my girlfriend</li>
<li>I am in love with her but I can't understand it because I'm stupid</li>
<li>I am just plain stupid and I don't understand that my behavior is a an obvious give away that I'm interested and now I have to give her a chance</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course there are many many more. If I give her an explanation of why her hypothesis are not true she seems to understand and accept the explanation just to repeat the same pattern and accusations a few days later.</p>

<p>Of course this kind of behavior gets old very quickly so I got more and more exasperated at the point of telling her that I don't want to hear her anymore and that I want her to stop texting me. One day she felt so angry that she insulted me and deleted my number.</p>

<p>The following day I was away from my office and my coworkers told me that somebody was insistently calling my number. I immediately messaged her asking if it was her and she confirmed that she was trying to reach me (or someone who knows me) to get my number back. Now I made very clear to her that I don't want her to call me back at my workplace or to text me anymore on my personal phone but she still reaches out to me twice a week to say how sorry she is and that she just wants to be friends and there may be a great future together. If I try to make her understand that her behavior is completely unacceptable her answer is that ""a girl in love has a right for happiness"" or something along these lines.</p>

<p>I also tried not answering her messages any more but in that case what she does is calling me non-stop, sometimes even for hours.</p>

<p>The situation is become exhausting. </p>

<p>What I want now is to be left alone by this person. I don't want to get the police/law involved both because she has not be <em>so</em> aggressive and also because I don't want to risk ruining her life just because maybe it's a difficult moment for her. At the same time I'm not really sure about what else I can do now. </p>

<p>How do I get her to stop this madness and leave me alone? Best case scenario I would like to make her ""calm down"", because I don't want to hear her screaming at me if I were to meet her in the street or somewhere else, is there something I can say or do to achieve this result?</p>

I know it's much better to talk to people face-to-face, but more often than not, the opportunity to meet simply doesn't come up. In fact, I typically don't see my parents' friends' children more than once a year and have not met any old co-workers (except by chance) after leaving my previous jobs.

"Co-tenants set up an inflatable pool outside my window. It's now breeding bugs. What can I do?","<p>A few weeks ago, I moved into a single-person house across from a larger four-person house on the same property. We are all college students in a college town, in the US. If it matters, I'm two grades above them. We share a backyard. </p>

<p>About a week in, they decided to set up one of those cheap $50 inflatable pools in the backyard, fairly close to one of my windows. (There'd be no other place to put it.) At the time, I'd mentioned that standing water isn't healthy to keep around for an extended period of time, especially untreated and unmaintained. They said they'd take care of it. </p>

<p>It's been five weeks, and that has not happened. I've likely been negligent in not following up with them about it sooner, but that's in the past. I'd normally leave it be, and I wanted to, but it's turning into a breeding pool for mosquitoes and other bugs. I've talked with them about it, asking whether they're still planning on maintaining it, commenting that it's starting to breed bugs - but I've gotten only lukewarm responses. </p>

<p>The landlord does not know about this pool. I was nudged into one of those ""forgiveness over permission"" implicit social contracts with the other tenants, and the landlord was never informed. Though, it should be noted that the pool blipped on the landlord's radar via an abnormally high water bill for the month. It's not a small pool. While I do pay my share of this bill, I was willing to do it in order to avoid setting a bad social precedent early on. It's $10-15, and I'm willing to pay $10 to maintain amicable relations. (The landlord contacted us all, asking what was up with the water bill, but it's so far that email has been met with radio silence.)</p>

<p>But this does also mean that deflating the pool and inflating it only when it's going to be used is non-viable. It's about $55-70 net worth of water to properly set up, and we live in a drought region.</p>

<p>I'd like to stay on good terms with the residents. They are nice people, and I do have to live on shared property for the next year. But it's, well... a problem that's only going to get worse. On top of that, I am actually good friends with the <em>landlord,</em> and I'm not sure how my choice to not inform them will be received, and reflect on <em>me</em>. I would like to stay on good terms with them as well, both as a tenant for recommendation reasons, and a friend, because I just flat like them. </p>

<p><strong>The reason I'm asking here is because I consider this a social problem rather than a legal one.</strong> There is both a contractual mechanism in place and a city code violation process that I <em>could</em> engage, but involving the law over a backyard pool is just about the coldest, silliest thing I could do, and I'd really rather not. I'd rather slather peanut butter on myself, put on a jester hat and zoot suit, and shout bug-themed obscenities through their open windows while jumping up and down in the pool than do this. (To clarify: this is not a normal activity for me.)</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, I've already tried the ""gentle nudge/reminder"" approach. I'm not sure what's appropriate from this point forward. </p>

<p>I'm looking both short term and long term here: what do I do right now, and what can I do later on if that doesn't work, or if the group is unresponsive? At what point is it socially reasonable for me to have done my due diligence, and escalate the issue?</p>

"How to tell if you're being too clingy or inviting yourself unnecessarily?","<p>I find that there are some situations where I am not sure whether the other person enjoys my presence enough to warrant further interaction. For example, if you meet someone during a talk at the end of a conference, talk with them for 5-10 minutes, and then get up to leave, do you wait for them and walk out with them or would they wonder why you want to walk out with them if you just met? Or if some people you met at the conference walk in line behind you while at the airport, is it acceptable to join in on their conversation? Or if some people that you just met are talking about going out with some people that they know a bit better and you're standing there awkwardly, is it acceptable to ask if you can tag along?</p>

<p>I fear that in these situations, if I do act, then they may think something along the lines of ""I barely know this guy, why is he (any of the above or similar actions)?"" Most people will say yes to be nice the first couple times, but I don't want to be with/inconvenience them if they'll be thinking the above text.</p>

"How to avoid being seen as a cash cow by my family?","<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I'm German, in my mid-20s and currently living together with my girlfriend without kids. I earn a fairly good salary for my age compared to other family members and was always a saver (cheap car, no expensive vacations, ...) to fulfil my <strong>ultimate</strong> life goal of buying a house (real estate) for myself. Recently I also inherited some money which I of course also want to spend on my house.</p>

<p>Sadly, some of my (close) family members (like my sister/her husband and partly my mother) can't handle their own money/income that well (at least this is my impression, of course, this view is biased). They spend money on stuff that I never would spend so much money on (e.g. leisure time, amusement parks, vacation together with their kids). It is also not that they are poor. They have a very good double income.</p>

<p>Regularly they ask me for a loan to pay their stuff <em>because they can't</em>. The amount of money they owe me is getting higher and higher. Of course, I want to help my family in critical life situations, but not to let them live their dream life while I lose money to invest into my future house. If I try to say no, they come up with sentences like:</p>

<ul>
<li>We <em>need</em> that new car because we both have jobs (one of the parents could easily travel by bike)</li>
<li>Get old enough to have kids, then you will understand</li>
<li>You don't even need your own money</li>
<li>We need a cleaning lady because I can't handle it alone</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, I'm giving them the loan because I don't want to be seen as a complete mug.</p>

<p>In some bigger cases, I have a valid, written contract. For smaller amounts, I usually said to them to add this to the final volume of the money lent. They started paying back but stopped quietly (!) doing so for some months until I asked them to start paying again (and they did). I could have cancelled the contract (because there's a clause for this case), but eventually I didn't. </p>

<p>They have interest rates, far lower than from a bank and also including an agreement for regular payments, which they have not fulfilled all the time. Because they didn't, the interest rate being so low caused the whole loan to be a negative game for me because of inflation. I am in no way wealthy, I just have above-average savings and earnings which I currently don't spend to save on my life goal.</p>

<p>Finally, this pattern of behavior has set a bad example for my nephew: he is now asking me for a loan. His own mother can't lend him any money because the next vacation is already booked.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How to avoid being seen as a cash cow in my family without being seen as a grasping and unhelpful person? My goal is to not give them any more money in the future.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>A thing I always ask myself is whether the problem I have is really on my own side and it should be okay for family members to ask for money even for non-critical stuff.</em></p>

<p><strong>Responses to comments</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you get anything written down? Or does the exact amount and even the fact that they did loan any money at all come down to your and their memory (or conscience)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some bigger cases I have a valid, written contract. For smaller amounts I ususally said to them to add this to the final volume of the lent money.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are they actually paying back any of the ""loans""? How much total money do they owe you? €5k 10k 20k?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no. They started paying back but stopped quietly doing so for some months until I asked them to start paying again (and they did). I could have cancelled the contract (because there's a clause for this case), but eventually I didn't. The total money lent is more than 10k.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are those loans with agreed interest and regular payments, or just ""pay me back when you can""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have interest rates, far lower than on a bank and also regular payments, which they did not fullfil all the time. Because they didn't, the interest rate so low caused the whole loan to be a negative game for me because of inflation.</p>

"How to tell people I'm not their tech support?","<p>I have a rather common problem for people in my field of study (computer science). The problem is this: People, especially relatives, ask you stuff about their computer-related problems, for example: ""What kind of anti-virus program should I install?"" or the much more frequently asked ""Can you cleanup my PC?"" one. I really dislike such questions, because they have nothing to do with what I study or what I will do for a living in my career later on. Also, it sucks that some family members or even my landlord assume I can help them just because I study computer science.</p>

<p>It feels like others are totally ignorant and just assume you are a genius and know everything about anything related to something about ""computers"", regardless of what it is. This gets especially interesting if you get questions about rather exotic programs that you have never even seen yourself beforehand.</p>

<p>The fact that I get such questions bothers me a lot, as it is assumed that I can help to fix their problems, regardless of what I have or want to do. Also, I feel isolated as a ""geeky"" person, a weirdo, by asking me such things without talking to me about anything else. It feels like what I do is a minor thing.</p>

<p>So: How can I fix this? My targets are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tell those people, who expect me to help them with their totally random problems, that I'm not their personal technical support for their printer or whatever</li>
<li>Do 1) without hurting their feelings a lot, I'd rather tell them that I'm just not competent enough to fix their problems, however, this is not an option due to my field of study. (Note: I already tried this and it was ignored, because ""I know that, because I study computer science"")</li>

"How can a poor and socially handicapped person socialize with wealthy people?","<p>The question I want to ask is this:</p>

<p>Can you please provide effective ways or best practices on how an individual from one socio-economic background can train himself/herself <strong>as quickly as possible</strong> to socialize with people of another socio-economic background, especially when the life style and interests between these two populations vary drastically.  A plan/strategy that requires approximately 8 hours/week of training/implementation effort and can start providing results after 6-12 month (or sooner) would be amazing!</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I had a great and bad night tonight.  The great thing was that I found the social challenge I was looking for.  The bad thing was realizing how underdeveloped I am and the daunting road I must endure to complete this challenge.</p>

<p>I am 37 years old, and tonight was the first night I was invited to a dinner gathering that consisted of many financially established families.  Of the adults that attended, the population can be segmented into the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% physicians and surgeons, many of whom also own a technology company, and own several patents</li>
<li>10% very successful people in engineering, finance, real estate, law etc...</li>
<li>50% spouse, relatives or parents of the segments above</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the individuals I paid attention to or even tried to converse with, the popular topics of discussion were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Medicine + Surgery - MDs talk passionately about their practice and experience at a very deep level; domain expertise is required for this discussion</p></li>
<li><p>Automotive - they were very informed on all aspects of automotive, from explaining the engineering principles behind different engines, to government policies on electric and gasoline vehicles, to speculating Elon Musk's motivation and strategy to open source patents on electric vehicle design etc...</p></li>
<li><p>Politics - very indepth debates on domestic and international politics. They seem very well versed on the specific responsibilities of numerous government positions in American and Canadian political system, and used this knowledge to ideate solutions to address current political dilemma</p></li>
<li><p>Legal and intellectual property - many academic or corporate institution would like to claim that any innovation that a faculty or employee develops during their employment is a property of the employer.  People attending the party shared their stories on how to circumvent these issues and retain ownership of what they believe they developed independently</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could not intelligently engage in these conversations.  I felt any questions I asked were too novice and only disrupted the discussion these people were enjoying.  (Picture the scene when Tony Soprano, a mob boss, was invited to his neighbours barbeque and he amiably and naively asked a fund manager, ""any changes in the stock market lately?"", To which the fund manager replied,""....umm.... There are always changes..."" The fund manger awkwardly returned to his financial colleagues to discuss intricate details of a particular stock at a level that lay people wouldn't understand) .</p>

<p>My hypothesis as to why I am socially handicapped is because I grew up in a financially distressed family for 30 years.   My parents were immigrants to Canada many years ago, they never completed elementary education, and my dad was more or less a refugee. For much of my brother's life and my life, our priority was to help our family ""stay afloat"".  For example, as teenagers getting our first paid jobs, all our pay checks went to our parents.   I was finally able to pay off all my parents debt 2-3 years ago.  And I am about to pay off the remaining mortgage for their house by this summer.  I have been self employed as a software developer for the past ten years.  I realized that for me , working as a software developer was more financially sustainable for my family than developing an interest in politics, economics, stocks, automotive, etc...</p>

<p>But now that I will soon be debt free, I need a plan that will cultivate me as quickly as possible to be able to socialize with wealthy people. I feel it is imperative that I befriend wealthy people because I need to leverage their knowledge and influence to help other people.  </p>

<p>But studying any one of medicine, automotive, politics, law, finance, etc... To the level of detail and appreciation that they have will take many many years based on where I am today.  Can any one share a plan on how I might realistically achieve my goal in as short a time as possible?</p>

<p>I will consider stopping my software development practice completely if it impedes my progress to socialize with influential people.</p>

<p>To this date, the only subject matters I am well versed in are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>software development - but the people I know in this area are often the grunt of the litter in the work force, or they will direct me to the population segments mentioned above</p></li>
<li><p>boxing (combat sport) - these people are from the same upbringing as me and are often at risk youth, or people with limited resources trying to help at risk youth, I don't see an opportunity here</p></li>

<li>""Did you use this pan last?"", no, ""I had a hard time cleaning it after the last person used it"". </li>
<li>""Were you up last night?"", yes woke up and got a glass of water, ""I heard you banging around, you must have a sleep disorder"". </li>

"How to talk to people at a singles mixer when you are an introvert?","<p>I am going to a singles mixer in a few days. I'm an introvert and find it hard to make small talk with people I don't know. How do I make the most of a singles mixer (that is, meet people and have meaningful conversations)?</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I find it difficult to talk to people I don't know - I'm not nervous about speaking to them, but I don't really know what to say, so I just don't do it.</li>
<li>I don't know how to extend conversations. So if someone asks 'how was your day?', I might say 'it was good,' and leave it at that, which ends the conversation unless the other person prods for more. I don't give more detail on my own because I'm not sure the other person really cares.</li>
<li>It's easier for me to talk to a single lone individual. It would be near-impossible for me to inject myself into a group of strangers.</li>
<li>I cannot speak naturally with strangers (unlike with family and friends) and would need to think through what I was planning to say before saying it. Mostly because I don't know them and I don't know how they will respond.</li>
<li>I will not know anyone at the event.</li>
<li>I am going with a few friends-of-a-friend of the same gender who I will meet for the first time on the same day as the mixer. I don't think they'll know anyone there.</li>

"How to deal with someone who always feels treated disrespectfully?","<p>I already asked this question before, and it was deleted for being off-topic (also because I did not check back for too long, and thus was unable to adjust my post according to the comments / the commenters did not see my changes.) </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The question:</strong> (hopefully not off-topic now - many thanks to the people who commented the other post)</p>

<p><em>How to better react to my brother when he overreacts to small things, seeing them as intolerable 'disrespectfulness', or when he expects special rights? What reaction could cause him to re-think his reaction / his state of being-hurt?</em></p>

<p>(If that's not possible, it would be nice to at least be able to lead a normal, non-argument conversation with him, without having to make too many concessions. It could also help to understand why my brother is reacting this way.)</p>

<p><strong>Additional information:</strong> We're a family of four, in a 'western' country. I am 25, my brother is 22. He lives with our parents again and is currently not doing anything, I am visiting our parents place every other week or so. </p>

<p><strong>Typical problem situations:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>He expects to have 'time alone' in the kitchen. He does not want to cook food while people are around; he will state this to the people in question ('around' here is in rooms adjacent to the kitchen; one of them has to be passed to get to the kitchen.) [He has some money to buy food (not enough for eating out every meal), he even could cook in another kitchen in another flat if he asked]. </li>
<li>When my father told me about something he's done (most recent, the bottle smashing, see below), that's ""talking behind his back"", and hurtful to him - when asked why exactly this is hurtful, he did not give a reason but replied ""don't you see what sick person this [our dad] is"" (that's a frequent statement of his)

<ul>
<li>I would understand it, if my dad had done more than just stating a fact, and if I had not directly told/confronted my brother about this; but to me this does not seem like 'talking behind someones back'. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>Insults: 
Here are two religious examples - my brother became a Muslim a couple of years ago - but there are other examples as well. E.g, criticism of all sort is seen as insult.  

<ul>
<li>He is against letting the dog be inside during the night (religious reasons); when my dad did some research on the view of dogs in islam, and talked to my brother about what he'd found, this was an insult to my brother (maybe doubting his knowledge was the insult). </li>
<li>On another occasion, my dad read a book very sceptical about the islamic faith, and claimed that the prophet might not even have existed. This was an insult to my brother (and not, for example, a 'different opinion').</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>More extreme situation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Smashing a bottle in my mothers room and leaving it for her to clean, after walking in on her being in the bathtub - he faults her for forgetting to lock.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I, and my parents, have tried:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>When we were on better terms, I tried to talk to him about instances where he felt treated unfairly by others, and tried to offer different points of view, or just a more moderate reaction. (People didn't always treat him right, but there are more useful reactions than just feeling offended.) He listened, and in generally did not seem to take it badly, but it also did not change anything. Of course, my knowledge of these cases was usually limited, and therefore he might just have been thinking 'she doesn't understand the situation anyway'.</li>
<li>Telling him he was overreacting considerably -- since then we're on bad terms.</li>
<li>Reacting pissed (no effect so far)</li>
<li>Telling him it is quite hurtful to be told he cannot stand me being physically present  -- his reply was that 'You would not even know what it means to be hurt, otherwise you would not behave the way you do'.  (To a further question, he replied that yes, it's indeed us that have hurt him so badly.)</li>
<li>We have tried factual arguments and logical arguments. There were very long discussions, sometimes ending angrily, sometimes not, but I don't remember ever having reached consensus.</li>
<li>By now, my father just ignores him or shoots back sharply (without arguments).</li>
<li>My mother is generally very friendly and careful towards him, often stating (to him) that she wants that he feels at home and has everything he needs. She is generally ignoring any attacks from him. -- In some sort he is reacting positively to this; for example, these days he from time to time he says (to her) she's not the problem. However, it does not seem to change his behaviour in general. And he will still dig up her 'mistakes' another time. (A few months ago, he used to say similar things to me, like 'you're not the one, it's our mum and dad'.)</li>
<li>My mother has suggested to him to go see a psychologist. He does not want to because he does not think his behaviour should be changed in any way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe this is exaggerated, but it feels like having lost a family member. Any help would really be appreciated.</p>

"Being told to get into a relationship despite state of mental health, how to ask why?","<p>In spite of my current mental health, friends, family, and health care professionals* often tell me to consider getting into a relationship without telling me <em>why</em> I should get into one.</p>

<p>As a rhetorical question: would getting into a relationship not make things worse for me and/ or negatively impact a potential partner? I cannot say that I want to get into a relationship due to extremely negative biases against it but said peers usually dismiss my fears and make me feel worse about myself for being ""childish"".</p>

<p>To expand upon the negativities I feel, I have not been in a relationship before because of secondhand experiences close friends and family have had with his/ her partner(s). Such experiences include (but not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>Parental divorce due to adultery (ParentA &amp; ParentB).</li>
<li>Second parental divorce due to step-parent's physical and mental abuse of ParentA; physical abuse against step-parent's own children; tax evasion; child support evasion; etc. (ex-step-parent has since been dealt with legally).</li>
<li>ParentA being in relationships after that ended due to partners being emotionally distant from ParentA due to unmet expectations.</li>
<li>Sibling being in a relationship that ended due to cheating.</li>
<li>Sibling being in a relationship that ended due to emotional abuse/ obsession of partner.</li>
<li>ParentB emotionally abusing me unconsciously for 10 years due to divorce 2 decades prior. I have since moved out of ParentB's house on my own.</li>
<li>ParentB raising sibling and I to be subservient to a partner in a relationship. Physical appearance was policed to meet stereotyped standards of how a female should look and how she should act.</li>
<li>Friend currently at risk for physical abuse by spouse who is experiencing mental health issues.</li>
<li>Several peers split/ divorce being left alone with child(ren).</li>
<li>Several peers dealing with aftermath of sexual abuse.</li>
<li>Unrelated: I do experience symptoms of misophonia to both sounds and visual triggers so being close to people in general is unpleasant. However, I am taking small steps to reduce my reactions to those triggers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do acknowledge that not every relationship will end so poorly and my own experiences can be drastically different (and even positive) but because a majority of my peers have been or are currently in bad relationships that put his/ her physical and mental well-being at risk, I keep fearing that I will be in the exact same situation. Until I can resolve my mental health issues, I do not want to be in a relationship.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How can I ask my peers why they keep pushing me like this without being seen as naive or pitiful while still being able to get an appropriate response explaining why they keep insisting about this (barring the whole, ""I want grandkids"" thing)?</p>

<hr>

<h1>Notes and clarifications:</h1>

<ul>
<li>As asked in the comments, counselors have brought up relationships after asking about my sexual orientation. To my best understanding, he/ she asked to ascertain whether I am in denial and/ or repressing preferences or desires. I am, to my best knowledge, hetero/ asexual. </li>

<li>Kosher food: we will get rid of the obviously non-kosher food (such as pork) but we can easily miss the more obscure ones (obscure as not universally known outside of the Jewish communities)</li>
<li>Shabbat: switching on lights for instance is a problem - we are likely going to forget to switch them on or off. There are probably other ""practical life oriented"" things as this one we are not aware of.</li>
<li>Shabbat again: is it OK to watch the ceremony (I am curious how it is in real life)?</li>

<li>Absolutely radiates negativity  </li>
<li>Consistently in a bad mood (I'd say like 80% of the time)  </li>
<li>Sarcastic, condescending  </li>
<li>Micromanaging silly, trivial things (my biggest pet peeve)   </li>
<li>Asks sarcastic rhetorical questions when he feels you screwed up (which is always because...)  </li>
<li>Impossible to please  </li>
<li>Nothing is ever his fault. Case-in-point: he borked a server migration by missing the DB part (only moved the frontend stuff, like web UI) and blamed <em>vendor</em> documentation!  </li>
<li>VERY poor communicator: hard to reach, gives vague instructions, not enough info. Constantly on DND in IM/chat.  </li>
<li>Widely disliked in the company  </li>
</ul>

<p>I am sending him daily emails now about what I'm doing, trying to gain his trust. I've read in multiple places that <em>over-communicating</em> things (everything?) is helpful with a micromanager boss. I can only do so much though since he is such an incredibly poor communicator. God help me, I am trying to find solutions and ""build a bridge"" with this man but after a whole year at this job, I'm almost not sure it's humanly possible.  </p>

<p>Of course my story here is one-sided, so take that into consideration I suppose, but I will say one of our absolute best technicians (I work in IT Ops) quit a few months ago. He and I were fairly close and he confided in me before he left that the only reason he was quitting was because of our boss. Also, we frequently commiserated about the IT director (our boss) before that. Lastly, I know said ex-coworker was extremely critical of our boss in his exit interview, but it doesn't seem to have done much good, if any.  </p>

<p>All that said: <strong>I do not want to quit, so please don't suggest it!</strong> My questions are:    </p>

<ol>
<li>Is there anything that can be done to fix this? I know there's no definite answer here, but in general. How does this typically go?  </li>
<li>If there is hope, what can I do to fix the situation? Other than over-communicating things, which I am already trying to do. </li>
<li>Perhaps I can use some kind of metrics to <em>prove</em> I am doing a good job? We use tons of software for tracking things.   </li>
<li>What are my options as far as filing a formal complain or requesting a different boss? What if I got another job offer and demanded a different boss or that I quit? This is a small-medium sized business so I'm not optimistic on that front, but it easily could come to that.     </li>
</ol>

"How can I support my aunt when she is being ""yelled"" at by a stranger?","<p>The other day, I was in some kind of park where children had tools and material to build huts. Since they weren't a lot of material, when a hut was finished it was then dismantled and the material was then used to make another hut.</p>

<p>My little cousins (my aunt grandchildren) started to build a big hut while my aunt and I were watching them. I was at one ""corner"" of the hut while my aunt was at another one, so we weren't really near each other (but not that far away either).</p>

<p>At some point, another child came in and started taking material from ""our"" hut (probably thinking that it was an abandoned hut). So, my aunt quickly told him in a ""warning"" voice ""Oy, Oy!"" to get his attention and then in a more neutral but still ""schooling"" voice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This hut is being built, maybe you could take material from another one?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub>I'm really not sure about what her exact words were, I just recall the global intent. Plus, all this was in French so the translation might be poor.</sub></p>

<p>The mother of the child was near and had heard the exchange. I believe she misunderstood the ""warning"" voice and took it for aggression. In any case, she became aggressive herself and started to angrily tell my aunt that this was no way to talk to a child, and that being aggressive toward a child was really unacceptable (and so on and so on).</p>

<p>My aunt tried to explain herself at first (in a neutral but a bit apologetic voice); but then dropped it and just let the other woman talk until she was finally over.</p>

<p>Since I was near, I heard the entire exchange. I wanted to support my aunt but didn't want to escalate the situation either, so I stayed back and just watched things from afar.</p>

<p>When the exchange was finally over, I didn't know what to do. My aunt seemed not to realize I had heard all of the exchange, and I didn't know how to comfort/support her (she seemed a little shaken by the exchange but not too much).</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>In this situation, how could I have been supportive of my aunt (during or after the exchange) without taking the risk of aggravating the situation when the exchange was still going on? And, if I do not intervene during the exchange, how can I still be supportive while justifying that I <strong>chose</strong> to not do anything? </p>

"Arguing science with a passionate non-scientist?","<p>As a physician for more than three decades and a Molecular Biologist before that, I know a lot of science and medicine (I also keep up with the literature.) </p>

<p>I find that people hold on tightly to their beliefs about health matters, and many don't know how to search or evaluate the literature to inform their beliefs. I don't mind this; I don't know anything about an enormous number of things, but I like to learn. An extreme example of this is anti-vaxxers, but there are much 'softer' positions that are equally incorrect.</p>

<p>When people find out socially that I'm a doctor, they want to discuss Big Pharma, conspiracy theories (e.g. doctors know the cure for cancer but are withholding it to make money), want to know if I'm a ""Lyme-literate"" doctor (Southcentral PA is a Lyme hotspot, so it's a very real concern here), or want to discuss a particular disease and what causes it. I don't take offense at these approaches, because I hope to help people understand, and sometimes I actually succeed.</p>

<p>But sometimes they go nowhere, or worse. For example, if I cite a study on dogs, they'll reply, ""But dogs aren't people!"" without knowing that dogs are an incredibly good model for human disease.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was speaking with a breeder about a disease my dog has. She doesn't trust vets (they're in it for the money) and said it wasn't possible that my dog had (x), that I shouldn't have (a radiological study to determine the extent of x), that I should just change the dog's diet. When I said I've treated the same disease in people and this test is necessary, she shouted, ""BUT DOGS AREN'T PEOPLE!!!""</p>

<p>I told her that she was right, that dogs aren't people, but they are an incredibly important model for human disease, and that many breakthroughs in medicine were thanks to the study of the same disease occurring in dogs.</p>

<p>She then snorted that doctors are in it for the money.</p>

<p>I like being social, I like discussions, and sometimes the discussions are fruitful and satisfying. Sometimes they're only frustrating. I don't like being rude, so I engage in these discussions not knowing which direction they'll take.</p>

<p>I have never said, ""I don't discuss medicine off-duty"". Or ""I don't discuss science."" I would feel I was being rude and antisocial. If I just change the topic, it's clear I simply disagree. </p>

<p>How can I break this cycle?</p>

<p>Edited to add (in response to comments): I <em>rarely</em> tell people I'm just meeting that I'm a doctor. If I'm asked directly, I'll answer honestly. I love science and will bring it up (did you hear about [amazing breakthrough of the year]?) but I will not bring up medicine unless it's with friends who know I'm a doctor and it's something funny. I address people at their level; you can't communicate effectively with a patient (or anyone else) without taking note of their own level of comprehension and using it yourself. (It's not an ""I'm smarter than you"" thing. I <em>may</em> be smarter about some things, but I guarantee I'm downright stupid when it comes to technology and a bazillion other things.) My work has been <em>caring for people</em>, and I care deeply about people who put their health in my hands. Can't say that extends to everyone I meet, though. I write much more formally than I speak. Finally, the dog conversation happens a lot because I used to be a breeder (Border Collies, the best dogs in the world!) and I know a lot of dog people.</p>

<p>[Btw, I love dogs and don't like the thought of experiments on dogs or any other animal. I'm a ""flexitarian"", which means I rarely eat meat. That's because I love animals, not because I think meat is unhealthy. But scientists work on dogs despite my feelings.]</p>

"How to invite my band-members/coworkers to give me feedback on my performance?","<p>I recently joined a music band that's composed of four colleagues with who I don't work (different projects &amp; teams), but I know them well since we have lunch and banter next to the watercooler together. However, the four of them <strong>do work together</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm the singer, I'm new to this role (I normally play the guitar and it's the first time I'm in a band). My coworkers have a pretty good level at playing their respective instruments. </p>

<p><strong>Sometimes I make mistakes while singing</strong>. For instance, I'd fail to reach a high note, or start a bit too late. I know I perform way better after we already rehearsed a couple of songs, as my voice is warmed up and I'm calmed down. But some days I perform worse than the previous week. Normal stuff, heh? </p>

<p>The thing is, I'm extremely self-critical and sometimes I'd be scared about completely sucking at what I'm doing whereas it's just me freaking out. This band thing is very new to me, so I'd like to have some feedback to know how I can improve. But in the band, the only times when people point out what went wrong, <strong>it's only regarding their own practice</strong>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man, I screwed everything up...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if I say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Laughing] That was very high-pitched. That didn't sound well, or was it okay?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will <em>literally</em> say nothing. They'd look at me while saying, and then we'd move on to something else.</p>

<p>I don't know why we don't talk about each other's performance, both on the bright and less bright sides. Maybe they don't want to judge the others, in which case I'm totally fine with us not giving feedback to the others. But if it's because they don't dare to critique my performance, I'd like them to let me know, so that I can improve.</p>

<p><strong>How can I invite my coworkers to give me feedback regarding my singing?</strong></p>

<p>PS: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I tried asking for direct feedback. ""What did you think of that performance, was it okay for you? I feel some parts weren't that great"". The thing is, even direct questions don't trigger feedback. </p></li>
<li><p>It's not only about my own performance. As a guitarist, I sometimes feel <strong>I could give some advice to my coworkers on playing the guitar</strong>, but I refrain myself because I'm scared they'd think I'm criticizing them.</p></li>

"How do I phrase an introduction on a dating website?","<p>I'm attempting to meet somebody on a few dating websites. The sites that I'm using all rely on internal messaging systems and user-created profiles to stimulate conversation, so the only thing I know about other people is their pre-written descriptions. Favorite books, movies, basic physical attributes, and freeformed About Me sections. As a man seeking a woman, statistically I'm the one that has to make the first move and introduce myself.</p>

<p>Problem is, I have no idea what a good introduction is. I've tried some variants of ""Oh, cool, you're a fan of X? So am I! What's your favorite episode of X?"" with common hobbies and I've asked for details on hobbies or jobs, but so far these messages have been opened but have not received replies. According to all of the internal algorithms I'm contacting people that should be good matches, so I don't think it's a lack of commonality. I'm coming to the conclusion that I'm just bad at striking up a conversation.</p>

"How to tell when a girl friend is not a girlfriend?","<p>As a non-native English user, I sometimes have difficulty determining when someone mention ""girl friend"" really means girlfriend in a romantic relationship. <strong>Related post in ELU</strong> <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/102865/does-girlfriend-or-boyfriend-always-indicate-partnership"">Does “girlfriend” or “boyfriend” always indicate partnership?</a></p>

"Informing friend their girlfriend might be pregnant","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I have a friend I'll call Hamlet that I've known for quite awhile through school. He also has a girlfriend I'll call Ophelia that he's been dating for over 3 years.</p>

<p>I've known Ophelia for as long as they've been dating and don't like her at all. I think she's very immature, insecure, and self-centered.</p>

<p>There's also a group of acquaintances I associate with regularly that are friends with Ophelia. I consider them decent and trust their judgement and observations for the most part.</p>

<h3>Situation</h3>

<p>Earlier this week I heard from those acquaintances that Ophelia had apparently ceased the use of contraceptives. They said it's ""an effort to become pregnant so that Hamlet would be 'forced' to continue being together with her."" Further, they said she has taken a test and <em>is</em> pregnant.</p>

<p>Now, this is a pretty huge claim, and one that I don't take lightly. But why lie about this? This seems like something Ophelia would do. I'm still cautious that it could be a ruse, <em>although this is unlikely</em>. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I'd like to tell my friend Hamlet about the rumors I've encountered and the strong possibility that Ophelia may very well have done something malicious. I feel I owe it to him so he's not potentially surprised later or unknowing of Ophelia's prior spite. I think these claims are very likely to be true, so it's not like I'm just dropping a stray rumor.</p>

<p>I feel that Hamlet might be upset once he discovers everyone but him knew about the situation. I think it’s important I tell him now, so he has time to prepare for this and not have a sudden future surprise and take it out on the people who knew beforehand.</p>

<p>It’s not just simply telling him a rumor is going around, but that I personally believe it has validity.</p>

<p>With this in mind, <strong>how can I gently tell Hamlet that Ophelia likely 'let' herself get pregnant whilst conveying that I'm on his side and also didn’t have bad intentions?</strong></p>

"How to insist roommate provides me with proof of utilities bill?","<p>I live in a shared house with several other people. One of them (call him Bob) signed the master lease with the owner and his name is on all the utilities. I pay Bob rent and my utilities. I have a written agreement with Bob that says 1) the cost of utilities is evenly divided by the number of people living in the house 2) I can see the utility bill. </p>

<p>In the past I asked Bob to see the utility bill but he never got around to showing it to me. I'm not going to pay anything until I see it. There are several complicating factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>against my wishes an extra person has been living here for a few months, and I think it's fair they pay their portion of utilities.</li>
<li>it was never made clear to me what the period/term of the individual utilities is and I would like to know this for record keeping/budgeting purposes</li>
<li>Another roommate called Dylan has the responsibility of ""finances"". Everyone in the house has an instant messaging group we use to communicate, and it was actually Dylan (not Bob the lease holder) who posted the amount needing to be paid, though we would still be paying it to Bob. I feel like Dylan is a busy body and Bob uses him as his muscle man. </li>
<li>We've had conflicts in the past but now everyone is on good terms and seems happy. When I've made requests like this before they retort ""It's a problem if you don't trust someone living here"".</li>

"How to tell beginner pickleball player they shouldn't play?","<p>Often a lower level <a href=""https://www.usapa.org/what-is-pickleball/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pickleball</a> player will come to a day set aside for advanced players. (Pickleball has 4 people on a court &amp;usually played at community centers.) It seems if I am nice to them and play a game with them, they do not get the hint that they should not be there.  What seems to happen most is that everyone allows them and yet are annoyed with the play or get passive aggressive and start forming groups that exclude the lower level person and then certain players (newer people like me) are left playing with them. It is a winning situation for the lower level player and a losing situation for the advanced players who do not get the exercise they want or the skill competition that they like.  </p>

<p>No one in charge of setting up who is advanced-People just assume/guess. There is pressure from other players to play with everyone, yet they all avoid games with certain people. I get stuck playing with the lower level people, even though I beat the advanced players when I play in games with them. The lower level player really ruins the game for other 3 players on the court. How can this be handled properly &amp; politely?</p>

<p><strong>How can you tell someone that they are not good enough to play or that they should not come that day?</strong> I am not a mean person, but I feel that trying to be nice is victimizing me to play with people I do not enjoy playing with and who I do not want to play with.

"How to tell a stranger that the way I wish to educate my child is none of his/her business?","<p>Consider the following scenario: I'm taking my kid (5 years old) to a coffeeshop and we do some 'math problems'. By math problems I mean that I explain him about the numbers, addition, counting and so forth. When I ask him to draw a number sometimes he doesn't do it properly so I tell him: <strong>""no, that's not good, let's try again"".</strong> I don't like to reward/credit him if it's not ok but I also understand that he's 5 years old. I may also tell him not to lose focus and to try to complete the task. The way I choose to handle the 'lesson' is short, concise and fun (take my word here). To be clear, none of those lessons ever ends with tears and I fully understand that a child has a threshold (and I know how to spot it).</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>From time to time, there would be someone who will voice their opinion on my method. Example: ""you should not say this or that but rather this and that."" Or, ""you should try this method it really works best for other kids."" Sometimes they would even go an extra mile and leave me a note! </p>

<p>Usually, I tend to say <strong>""thank you for this pointer""</strong> and end the conversation promptly but the truth is that I find it insulting. Consider what would happen if I would interrupt an argument between 2 lovers and say something like: <strong>excuse me for interrupting but Sir, respectfully, you should apologize and buy her flowers</strong>. How would they react? would that be ok? of course not!</p>

<p><strong>What am I asking?</strong></p>

<p>What approach would one take to handle such situations? The way I choose to educate my child is my decision only and not a stranger's concern. I wish to focus on my child and not the audience but I also wish to draw a firm line when someone takes the initiative to confront me on a private issue and make suggestions what I should/shouldn't do. </p>

"How can I help someone realize that they should respect the staff's privacy?","<p>Quick background on the situation. My wife and I bought a vacation house with a friendly couple (we have known each other since the age of 3 - we're practically brothers) that we visit every so often. The house has a live-in caretaker (a 60+ year old woman) that takes care of the house and prepares it for when we visit.</p>

<p>During our last visit, a couple of weeks ago, I discovered that my friend's wife has zero respect for the caretaker's privacy, entering her room without the caretaker's consent.</p>

<p>She does that to get to the east part of the garden quicker since the caretaker's balcony door is right at the edge of the garden, so passing through that room saves her 10 seconds of walking. Another instance was when she retrieved a book from the caretaker's room. This house has a rather large library and the caretaker often borrows books to read at night or on her free time. My friend's wife decided she needed that book and couldn't be bothered to ask her permission to take it.</p>

<p>The caretaker told my wife about it yesterday over the phone and I was a bit dumbfounded at how inconsiderate a person can be. I consider that room as a separate unit that belongs to the caretaker. You wouldn't walk into another person's house to retrieve a book they have borrowed now, would you?</p>

<p>I am thinking of approaching my friend's wife directly but it's going to be a delicate matter. </p>

<p><strong>How can I help her realize that she should respect the caretaker's privacy?</strong></p>

<p>I realize that this is probably only a small part of deeper character flaws and changing her view on the subject might be a colossal task, but I would like to give it a shot as a friend. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I can just ask her to never enter the room again without consent but I am afraid she might push her husband to get the rid of the caretaker. I'd rather avoid that outcome since the caretaker has been working for my family for 20+ or years.</p>

"Telling parents that it's okay if their child doesn't kiss me","<p>I have cousins who both have children. Whenever we see each other, my cousins always told their children to ""go kiss Ælis"" but the children are sometimes reluctant to kiss me (which I can understand). Nonetheless, the parents push the kids to kiss me which they ultimately end up doing. (For the parent it's important that the children kiss me because it's a sign of politeness.)</p>

<p>However, I'm uncomfortable with the fact that the children are force to kiss me when they clearly don't want to. So, sometimes, if I know the parents aren't watching, I just wave at the children and be done with it (so, no kissing).</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>If the parents are still watching how can I tell them that it's okay if the child doesn't kiss me? And how can I do that in a way that they won't see me as an obstacle to their child education? And so that they won't insist further, making the situation even more uncomfortable? </p>

<p>Saying to the parents:</p>

  <p>It's okay, Abby/Andrew doesn't need to kiss me.</p>

<p>How do I communicate with someone who addresses me in a more meaningful way than I'm comfortable with?

"How do I politely explain to my neighbour that I don't feel comfortable being alone with her in her house while my kids play?","<p>We recently moved into a new neighborhood, as did our neighbor, Jane. I have two young girls (4 and 5), and Jane has a boy and girl (7 I think?). My kids love to play with them, and her kids seem to enjoy it just as much (they knock on our door asking if our girls can come out to play and whatnot).</p>

<p>The issue is that Jane is a single mother, and my wife occasionally works on weekends; Jane sometimes will ask (or my girls will ask and Jane will be accommodating) if the kids can go into her house and play in the toy room together. I don't know her well enough to leave my kids alone in her house for an extended time, and I don't want to accompany them and put myself in a situation with no accountability. </p>

<p>This is uncomfortable for me. I've discussed it with my wife; she's just as uncomfortable with it as I am. I try not to be careless, and being in the home of a single-mother alone while my wife isn't around is basically red flags all around (not that I've noticed any sort of motives from Jane, just that I don't want to put myself in that situation). There's no cultural reason for this; it's a boundary I have for myself. I feel fine socializing with other women, it's socializing in private that I'm not fine with. </p>

<p>My question is how can I politely explain to Jane <em>why</em> I don't think it's a good idea for my girls to play in her house when my wife isn't home to accompany them? I don't want to sound accusatory, but at the same time, I want to make it clear that when my wife isn't home, hanging out in her house isn't an option.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with so far is redirecting the invitation --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jane's Son: <em>Can the girls come inside to play in the toy room?</em></p>
  
  <p>Me (so Jane hears): <em>Not right now, but maybe when their mommy gets
  home they can.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jane: <em>Is it ok if the girls come in and play?</em></p>
  
  <p>Me: <em>Maybe later, once their mom is home</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>My hope is that this will make it clear that I don't feel comfortable being in another woman's house without my wife home. This is both out of respect for my wife, as well as not wanting to be in a compromising situation even once.</strong></p>

<p>A couple of things that aren't an option:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Letting my kids play in her house while I wait outside (doing yard work or something). While this is ok for a short time, it ends up requiring me to walk into Jane's house to extract my kids or they'd never leave.</p></li>
<li><p>Staying in the toy room with them while they're playing. This defeats the point of me not wanting to be in Jane's house alone.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This wouldn't be a big deal if we didn't get along or I noticed anything off, but she's nice and our kids get along great. While I want to be clear, I don't want to be offensive by sounding accusatory.</p>

<p>This seems good to me as it is very opened ended. 100k not enough to live of forever, but still more than what you normally spend even when buying something big. So the person has to think about it. It can help you learn something interesting about the person (e.g., 'I would start a goat cheese farm') And can lead on to further engaging question/discussions.</p>

"How to initiate discussions with partner involving previous infidelity?","<p>There a couple things my partner and I are working on in our relationship.  Perhaps the most challenging is that there was a cheating incident a little over year ago on their end.  We didn't talk for nearly 8 months after it happened, but for the past 4-5 months have been working on rebuilding our trust and proactively communicating about the issues that had pushed us apart prior to the incident itself.</p>

<p>What I've found is that even though 9/10 days I believe in my partner, our relationship, and the improvements we have made, I still wind up having moments of anxiety about this prior incident that I'd like to be able to discuss with them.</p>

<p>For example, I may be stuck on a thought like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Have we made enough improvement in our communicative efforts that we could effectively prevent the circumstances that led us to that point the first time?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and would like to talk to them about it, if I can.  I've found that I get nearly instant relief from the anxiety accompanying those thoughts when I am reassured that that incident was a mistake, regrettable experience, or simply that it won't happen again.</p>

<p>The problem is that I've been struggling with figuring out how to start these conversations since the topic rarely ever occurs naturally in our day-to-day lives.

"How can I lay out my reasons to my girlfriend for why we shouldn't get married?","<p>My girlfriend isn't a citizen of the US and I am. We've also have only been dating for 4 months.</p>

<p>So when we first started dating she said that if I wasn't ready for commitment in the range of 1-3 years, then we should reconsider continuing our relationship. She laid out her reasons, with the main one being she needs a green card, but also most of her friends/family are married already. We're in our late 20s and in her culture women are typically married before that age. My own thinking was that 1 year seemed too soon, but 2-3 is reasonable if we're happy in our relationship. I told her that I can't predict the future, but if we're happy then I don't see why we couldn't get married.</p>

<p>After 3 months together (1 month ago) she pressured me to move in together. It came down to an ultimatum of we live together or we break up. I really liked her (loved?) so I caved. In my mind the worst that would happen was we break up and she moves back out.</p>

<p>So recently, she's been hearing about all types of family issues back home and she brought up marriage to me. She knows I think it's WAY too soon so she began begging me to marry her. From what she said, she wants to become a citizen and be a pathway for other relatives to come to the US. Her begging went as far as offering to pay me. Each month, I donate $100 to a foreign charity that I strongly believe in. She brought that up and said that ""why can't I help her if I'm willing to help those people?"" We argued a lot, but are now in equilibrium again. She told me that by helping her I'm helping her entire family and the younger generation. </p>

<p>As strange as it sounds, I do believe she cares about me, but I also think she needs to think of her family. Everything she says tears at my soul and makes me feel horrible. I want to help, but I know deep down that this isn't what I should do.</p>

<p>I want to lay out reasons why this is a bad idea. Here is what I want to say:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Both of us could get in severe trouble. Even if we ""love"" each other, the US is going to be extremely suspicious of a marriage after only knowing each other for less than a year.</p></li>
<li><p>I'll be required to support her for at least 10 years. Even if she doesn't sue me for support, the government could if she ever goes on unemployment.</p></li>
<li><p>I could lose half of everything in a divorce, even with a prenup because I've heard a lot of times those aren't enforceable.</p></li>
<li><p>A wedding, ring, etc are all expensive. She already mentioned we don't need this, but it's going to look even more suspicious if we don't have any of it.</p></li>
<li><p>We just don't know each other well enough. So while I believe I love her, any marriage at this point is fraud even if no money is involved.</p></li>
<li><p>My friends are going to think I'm ""crazy"" and probably assume there are other motives (which there are of course). They already thought I was crazy to move in together so soon.</p></li>
<li><p>I have other issues that I also need to worry about, such as my dad's failing health.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>How can I lay out my reasons to her without reading them off like cold facts?</p>

"How To Respond to Rude Cashier?","<p>Once in a while I get coffee from a nearby shop. Lot of times, the ladies at the counter are rude; especially to me, because I look like a soft target. Really, I am not confrontational unless I am at the end of my rope (on a side note, my co-workers were surprised when I was assertive and nearly aggressive with our local tax department a year back, but anyway)</p>

<p>What happened was: I was slowly putting change in my purse, and I even said ""pardon me"" to the lady behind me in the line. Because I was taking too long, the cashier said impatiently, ""Ma'am, please move aside"", while she was taking the food from the lady behind me (to ring her up). When I returned the receipt, the lady rudely said, ""the garbage is right there"". Usually, most cashiers would take the receipt for me.</p>

<p>Because I tend to be on slow side (especially if I'm tensed about sometime), people see me as soft target. But on the flip side, sometimes people are nice and patient (mostly males who are interested in friendship or something else, but that is another thread).</p>

<p>Kind of reminds me of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyG2jtA_rd8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this scene</a> from English-Vinglish (with late Bollywood actress Sri Devi).</p>

<p>If I have said ""<em>Have a blessed day</em>, would this have humbled her, perhaps offering me an apology? Please note, I also wish to be in and out, but I don't like rudeness!!!</p>

<p><strong>How to respond to this cashier being assertive, but without being rude?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm second generation of Indian, and this happens in the USA, if that is relevant </li>
<li>In this particular shop, cashier is required to print receipt. Lot of time, people will return receipt, so this is common. Next to cashier is a bunch of receipts stacked up from customers who don't need receipt.</li>

"How should I talk to my neighbors about using leaf blowers?","<p>I live in an area with huge oak trees, so leaf blowers are a real labor saving device when used in the fall (i.e. leaf raking season). I don't have any issues when the blowers are used to move leaves from the yard into the street during the fall. Unfortunately, several of my neighbors use leaf blowers <em>year around</em>. </p>

<p>The use of blowers in the hot and dry summer is a real annoyance, because of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Air Quality.</strong> Using blowers in the dry summer significantly decreases air quality to the point that it is more comfortable to stay indoors with closed windows. </li>
<li><strong>Noise.</strong> I like to eat on the deck, and this is not possible with the noise level of my neighbors blowers. Newer blowers models tend to be much quieter whereas my neighbors' are pretty loud.</li>
<li><strong>It's more work for me.</strong> I don't have a blower, so I use a rake, broom, and dustpan to collect the loose yard debris and litter. Every time one of my neighbors uses a blower, I need to sweep my path again because they have blown derbies on it. In the end it'd be easier for me to simply sweep my neighbors' path to avoid their debris to end up on my yard.</li>
</ul>

<p>My first attempt to address this issue was super awkward, but effective. One of my neighbors would consistently (6 days a week) use a blower for 15 to 20 minutes around dinner time. One day when she was using the blower, I grabbed a rake and broom from my garage. With the yard tools in hand, I approached her and said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, I notice that you have been using your blower a lot, and it is quite loud. Have you considered using some other types of tools to pick up the mess?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She was surprised that I could even hear her blower (even though she was wearing industrial hearing protection). I didn't expect the conversation to get that awkward, so I said, ""Just letting you know, thanks"", and then walked away. That was the last time I heard her using the blower, but the interaction was too awkward to attempt again with another neighbor. What did I do wrong in this interaction?</p>

<p>Our annual block party is coming up next month, and I think this might be a good time to address the use of blowers. Should I try to address this issue at the block party? How should I approach this issue?</p>

<p>It would be really convenient if everyone coordinated and used the blowers at the same time. I would very much prefer to hear 6 leaf blowers in unison for 20 minutes, than one leaf blower at a time for 2 hours. In the past my neighborhood has cooperated to thwart thieves and get rid of rats, is cooperation a possibility when it comes to the use of blowers?</p>
"
"How to tell my friend's mom to stop bothering me about not going to church?","<p>As of recent, I have become less and less involved and active in my religious community; especially my church. There's many reasons for it, but the main ones are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Negative stigma given when doing something the church disapproves.</li>
<li>Less of a presence of younger individuals.</li>
<li>My own philosophical conclusions that differ (often greatly).</li>
</ol>

<p>I still maintain a few of the friendships with those still in this community; I haven't blocked them out from my life or anything.</p>

<p>This often gives me problems though. These members I attempt to maintain friendships with like to attempt to bring me back when I don't want to. I haven't flat out told them the conclusions I've formed, because I know it's going to cause them to argue and maybe even be ashamed of me. I don't want to start an argument and have to defend my own beliefs when I know nobody's opinion is going to change.</p>

<p>One particular situation that's been continuing for too long is my friend's mom nagging me to go to church. She'll say things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yea, speaking of church Anilla, you should come this week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So why weren't you at church last week Anilla?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand the probable reasoning for this; she worries about me and wants me to stay in the community and grow to be a good person. The way she goes about it though is far too aggressive for me though and I really don't like mustering an excuse each time. </p>

"How can I reintroduce myself in an email to someone I met a year ago without risking offending them?","<p>About a year ago, I did an informational interview with a friend of a friend.  We connected on LinkedIn shortly after, and I did a basic follow-up ""thanks for meeting with me"" email, but we haven't had any contact since then. </p>

"Resolve conflicts with my roommates now that my parents expect my cat, which occasionally poops outside its litter box, to stay with me permanently","<p>I've had my cat for the past 13 years and it is very important to me. The cat used to live at my parents place, as did I; I moved out two years ago.</p>

<p>Recently, my parents took a 4-month vacation and I took the cat to my apartment (pets are allowed, as per my lease). My roommates (who share the apartment with me) tolerate it well enough, but it is slightly irritating to them as the cat sometimes poops outside the litter box (I take care of it) or meows early in the morning. It's not critical, but annoying to them nonetheless.</p>

<p>As I was expecting it to be temporary, my roommates accepted the situation without much issues, but they would still like the cat gone. The problem is that, now that my parents are back, I found out that they expected this to be a permanent situation, not a temporary one.</p>

<p>I'm therefore stuck between a rock and a hard place as my roommates would like the cat gone and my parents don't seem to want it back. Euthanizing the cat is <strong>NOT</strong> an option and I do not want to give it away (where I would not be able to see it). I will have the option to move only in july next year, which I feel is probably too far to drag the issue. My girlfriend can not host it as she has a cat of her own.</p>

<p>How can I solve this issue in a way that leaves everyone satisfied? I don't feel it's appropriate to impose on my roommates or my parents, but perhaps there is a way to resolve the situation I haven't considered? The cat is extremely important and I am willing to make sacrifices.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE: I ended up asking my parents again and explaining the situation. They decided to take the cat back at least until July in exchange for me taking it back when they travel. My roommates agreed to this so everything is solved!
Thanks to everyone who posted an answer!</em></p>

"How to deal with someone who seemingly only asks you loaded/leading questions in casual situations?","<p>The subject says it all: There is no one specific incident I can summarize, but in general I have had encounters with people who endlessly ask loaded/leading questions and statements that are simply uncomfortable to respond to. These are in casual, non-work/non-professional situations in which nothing is really at stake. Questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>“Who wouldn’t like that?”</li>
<li>“Who could say no?”</li>
<li>“I never met someone who didn’t like that.”</li>
<li>“Why would anyone do that?”</li>
<li>“Why would anyone say that?”</li>
<li>“Here! Have some! I know you will like it!”</li>
</ul>

<p>And such. These are non-sales/non-pitch situations in which there are no high stakes: I’m not buying or selling something so these kinds of questions/statements are even more frustrating and baffling.</p>

<p>At least in a sales/pitch situation one can be more assertive and even act in an alienating way since in most sales/pitch situations there is no deep relationship at stake. In casual social situations when stuff like this happens I find it to be more uncomfortable because this type of interaction seems even more unnecessary.</p>

<p>Is there a simple thing that can be said or done in response to an interaction like this that can move the conversation past this question/statement without too much friction?</p>
"
"Dealing with a friend trying to get me a girlfriend","<p>TL;DR: Bruce is pushing for me to enter a relationship with Mary, and I like Mary, but don't want any relationship right now, and I want him to back off.</p>

<p><strong>The People</strong></p>

<p>Me: I am not interested in a relationship currently, for reasons not pertaining to the question, not in a relationship</p>

<p>Bruce: An excellent long-term friend, very relationship oriented, in a relationship with Alice</p>

<p>Alice: A good friend, in a relationship with Bruce, excellent friends with Mary</p>

<p>Mary: A good friend, very alike me, excellent friends with Alice and Bruce, not in a relationship</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>Recently, Bruce and I were sitting together, having a conversation about everyday affairs, when he mentioned that he and Alice had been talking and had agreed on something. This wasn't special - they are in a relationship - but he went on to say that they had agreed that Mary and I were perfect for each other, and that we should begin dating.</p>

<p>This is strange, as it had never come up before, and Bruce knows I'm not looking for a relationship. He outlined his reasoning, which mostly consisted of the fact Mary and I are similar, and waited for my reaction. </p>

<p>I calmly explained that I was not currently looking for a relationship, but he did not want to accept this. He is the type of person who believes that being in a relationship is always beneficial. He really believes Mary and I would be perfect for each other, and he left saying ""this isn't over."" </p>

<p>This isn't the first time things that ""aren't over"" are very over. But he came back to me day after day, refusing to let it drop. I would be reading a book, and he made a comment that Mary would love it. He asked me how I was doing in school (he knows full well I'm at the top of my class), and when I mention how well I'm doing, he responds 'oh that's great, did you know Mary is at the top of her class?' </p>

<p>Other friends make fun of me for not wanting a relationship, and interpreting every time I talk to a woman as flirting just to give me a hard time. This doesn't bother me, as they drop it - it was only an excuse to tease me about a facet of my life that is radically different from theirs.</p>

<p>But Bruce insisting I would be a good match for Mary is unsettling, as he doesn't understand when to stop. He also recently asked me multiple questions on how I would react if Mary attempted to 'ask me out'. </p>

<p>I don't run into Mary every day, so I'm afraid he will attempt to 'set us up' without my knowledge. He is in constant contact with her and Alice, but I am in limited contact. </p>

<p>I will be at the same event as Mary in a couple of weeks, so I suspect Alice is pushing Mary just as hard to get Mary to ask me to enter a relationship and might have met with more success than Bruce. </p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>How do I get Bruce to stop pushing me to enter a relationship with Mary, while not destroying my friendship with Bruce? </p>

<p>Note: I'm not worried about my friendship with Mary, unless Mary does something rash, which would be addressed in a different question.</p>

"What is the etiquette for responding to ""Don't worry about it"" with something you are sorry about","<p>I was meant to buy travel tickets for somebody, but they all got sold out before I could. There were reasons for them not being able to buy the tickets themselves.</p>

<p>Not being able to travel on those specific dates is a bit of an inconvenience to them, so I apologised. I said: ""<em>I'm sorry I couldn't book the tickets for your family. I know [person1] was really looking forward to meeting [person2]. Tell them I'm sorry too.</em>""</p>

<p>They said, ""<em>Don't worry about it</em>"". I was ready to let it go too, because I actually did try my best, so I don't really blame myself for it.</p>

<p>But what do I say to that? I didn't want to just say ""<em>Ok</em>"", I felt like it'd make the apology sound insincere. I went with ""<em>Thank you</em>"". But in retrospect, it feels a little out-of-place.</p>

"When someone states a view I don't agree with, and asks for confirmation, how to avoid giving it without triggering a debate?","<p>There are many people who, after stating their political, religious or ideological view, or an opinion in a debated or controversial topic, explicitly ask for confirmation.</p>

<p>For example, <em>""Am I right?""</em>, <em>""Isn't it so?""</em> </p>

<p>Assuming it's not done in bad faith to provoke a debate, but it just occurs naturally to them, as they expect agreement or sympathy from those around them, how can I avoid expressing agreement, in case I don't intend to trigger a debate in the topic at the moment?</p>

<p>Staying in complete silence is not always an option, especially if the number of participants is very low, or the question is addressed directly at me.</p>

<p>The tactic I usually use is to silently mumble something like <em>""well, that is one way to look at it""</em>. Usually it works, sometimes it doesn't.</p>

"My girlfriend wants me to parent her?","<p>Apologies for a strongly truncated backstory, but stackexchange wouldn't let me post it, claiming it was spam.</p>

<p>I'm 24, my girlfriend's 25. She's my first girlfriend, she's had boyfriends before me. We've been together for 3 years.</p>

<p>Overall, it seemed like a good, healthy relationship thus far. We rarely had fights, lots of small problems we could clear by talking things out. However, one reoccurring subject seems to never be solved: She wants me to spend more time with her. That looks like a reasonable request to me, because I work a lot to get my degree in a scientific field. (She doesn't have regular work.) My issue is that for some reason, she never can tell me  when she's unhappy with how much time we spend together; this problem always leads to explosions and drama and crying and all that. This happened 3-4 times so far. 
Every time, I explained that I sometimes just don't notice that she's not happy with how things are going. She always seemed happy, or can tell me what's making her unhappy, apart from this bloody issue. I explained that I need her to tell me when she's not satisfied, and that I need to count on her to do that. I can't read minds. But it didn't seem to bear any fruit.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, we got into a big fight. In short, she got in a fight with my brother, where he clearly messed up, but later on sincerely apologised. We were not in our home town, but a place where it's nice to spend your holidays. I had two weeks of school there, those two and others were there to relax.</p>

<p>The next day, she left back home. She texted me when she was sitting on the bus already, and I got lucky that I went on a small field trip with the school that I was close to the train station so that I could meet her before she left. She did however promise to come back the following week with her sister without me asking, a promise she wouldn't keep, and later told me she never intended to keep.</p>

<p>For two days, she didn't contact me. I believed that she wanted some distance, so I waited for two days before texting her. As usual when drama is unfolding in our relationship, she didn't want to talk or text about it, but only in person. She wanted me to ""think of her for a change and try to understand her"". However, she wouldn't tell me anything. I didn't know for sure what was going on with her. She made a few comments  (if you really need to know what, I'll provide it) that led me to believe that she wanted to break up with me. My brother and a more experienced friend confirmed my conclusion.</p>

<p>A week later I returned home, missing the last couple of days of school, to talk things out with her. It was a nasty talk at first, where she accused me of some horrible things that were demonstrably wrong. In essence, she accused me of doing nothing for our relationship, while she's being the one doing everything and carrying this relationship. And some other things I'll omit for now. She told me that she'd expected me to protect her, and felt unprotected.  She also admitted that my reaction on that day destroyed her image of me being a white knight on a noble steed. She couldn't explain to me, at all, why she wouldn't want to give me any hint on what's going on inside her, all the while demanding that I understood her and empathise with her. I even offered to give her a call, and just let her talk and say whatever she wants to say, while I said nothing and just listened. She couldn't tell me why she wouldn't take me up on that offer; ""Others talked me into it"" is all she could tell me.</p>

<p>Following the advice of a female friend of mine, I suggested that my girlfriend and I get some distance and cool off. We agreed to meet this Friday, which will be a week after out last talk.</p>

<p>A lot of things she said and did hurt me deeply, and I feel that it created a distance between us. 
On top of that, I don't think that she has any intentions to reconcile things with my brother. I'm aware they won't be best buddies, but I want them to at least be able to be in the same room at the same time.
Also her parents, as she tells it, quite dislike me now. She lives with them, and I'm not comfortable visiting or  spending a night in a house where I'm not welcome.
Furthermore, apparently she had some image of me in her head, which now is no more, so I can't help but wonder whether she was in a relationship with me or that image of hers.</p>

<p>But most troublesome of all to me is that it seems to me like my biggest mistake was treating her like an adult, mature woman. I can't trust her to express her discomfort with our relationship, it looks like I'll have to dig to get her to tell me some things. I don't understand this, because for some things she seemingly has no trouble at all expressing her unease with. I also ask her almost daily how she is, and how things are going for her. And we went over this subject multiple times.
And when the fight broke out, apparently she expected me to not get emotional to her making me choose between her and my brother, as I see it to treat her like a child who still doesn't know how to deal with emotions.</p>

<p>Here is what I'd like advice on:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>is it usual/common in a relationship to have to go out of my way to find out whether my girlfriend is unhappy with something in our relationship?</strong> Am I setting unrealistically high standards by not wanting to have to do that?</p></li>
<li><p>I prefer an analytical and logical approach to problem solving, and can't deal with what seems like a purely emotional reaction that she exhibits in such cases. I don't know what's going on, what happened nor what to do. <strong>Is there a chance in the future that she'd be able to meet me halfway across and at least give me hints of what is going on inside her in such cases?</strong> </p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, assuming we agree to try and fix this mess we're in. <strong>How would I/we go on about mending our relationship?</strong> I know that for me, this relationship can't continue in this manner. But I have no idea where or how to start mending. There is a lot of hurt and pain present on both sides, I'll have to somehow also mend relations with her parents, and she with my brother (at least to some degree). The main point remains that I need to trust her to talk to me when something's wrong, but I'm not even sure I currently trust her words at all.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>I've been asked to limit my post to one question, so here's me trying:</p>

<p>As far as I can see, the main issue is that in this situation, both she and I were communicating in ways the counterpart didn't understand. 
<strong>Is there a way that this might improve in the future? Will I have to constantly explicitly ask her about her feelings towards our relationship for as long as it holds?</strong></p>

"Is there a Russian etiquette on declining offers of food when visiting someone?","<p>I'm 15 years old, living in Israel. Occasionally, I visit senior citizens on their birthdays - bringing balloons and stuff, with a few other people.</p>

<p>These people who we visit are usually older Russians (there are a lot of Russian immigrants here), who are not very often so religious.</p>

<p>I, personally, am American, so there are three cultures at play here - Russian, American, and Israeli.</p>

<p>When I go into these people's apartments, very often they will offer me food, either packaged or something they've made. If it's packed I will usually have no problem eating it, but if it's something homemade I can't usually take it because I don't know if it's kosher. And if I ask if it's kosher, there are different standards, but I <em>really</em> don't want to offend these people by giving the impression that it's not kosher ""enough"" for me, since these people are usually not observant (keeping the rules of the religion strictly).</p>

"How to stop my ex wife from pressuring relationship between our son and my new partner","<p>About five years ago my wife Laura and I got divorced - we kept it quite civil and even now our relationship is quite friendly. We also have a son, Steve, currently 10 years old that spends 3 days a week with me.</p>

<p>My ex quite quickly remarried a guy who always wanted kids, so both my son and him quite quickly bonded. Recently my relationship with my partner Anna started to look more serious and we've decided to move together. The problem is that my partner never wanted kids (although she professionally works with them), mainly on the account of her having mild <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OCD</a>, that makes her feel very uncomfortably in untidy places (and usually kids ARE messy, my son is not an exception). Still, Anna quite likes my son, although she treats him more like a friend or one of the kids she works with rather than a stepson. But hey, this situation is quite new and stressful to both of them, so I'm just hoping that this will evolve slowly.</p>

<p>Anyway, my ex decided that all five of us should be a ""one happy family"" - she keeps inviting us to ""go camping together"" (something she never asked me alone), keeps asking Anna ""could she spend extra time on her own with Steve"", or even forces my boy to keep asking my partner for such ""private quality time"" via Facebook messenger (I know Steve well enough to say that he would never say something like ""<code>Can I spend some extra time just with you on Friday when dad is at work?</code>"").</p>

<p>I've told Laura that my partner is not looking forward to be a stepmom and personally I never expect her to be - I just hope that Anna and Steve will have a good relationship based on respect, whatever else would come I'd welcome as a bonus, but my ex keeps insisting, saying that ""If Anna wants to be with you, she must act as a stepmother"".</p>

"How to make getting to know someone less artificial?","<p>(Or, am I over thinking everything)</p>

<p>There is a girl (Jen) that I've been acquaintances with for about 3-4 years. I recently asked her if she would be okay with me getting to know her better.

But after that, I just can't wrap my head around how I can make the random date ideas (that the internet seems to think are good) more natural. They make sense if there is a mutual interest, <strong>people are happy to do anything with the person they like</strong>, but without that interest ""Hey, wanna go.... <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-kinds-of-dates-do-you-wish-your-guy-would-take-you-on"" rel=""noreferrer"">people watching/to a cooking class/do some other random activity that is completely out of left field</a> with me?"" seems like a very good way to bore Jen. </p>

<p>I figure that until Jen has an active interest in me (refer to bolded statement), the interactions should at least be non-awkward and be interesting enough to let her have an enjoyable time. So my question is, how can I make these intentional one-on-ones seems more natural? </p>

"How to handle when someone uninvited inserts themself into a conversation and takes over?","<p>My partner and I were in a very casual restaurant (self seating, buffet style) with another couple who we were still getting to know. As we were about to eat, a good friend of the couple (but unknown to us) came over, and without excusing himself for interrupting or even so much as a glance in our direction, proceeded to discuss a matter in a very loud and animated manner with our new friends. Then, after about 12 -15 minutes, the person departed, again without a glance or word to us.</p>

<p>I was flabbergasted. It felt awkward to eat in silence (or even at all, since the other couple were not eating), and it would have been nice had the couple interrupted their conversation to introduce us, or excused themselves for ""a moment"" to discuss a matter totally foreign to us, but that didn't happen.</p>

<p>I would have considered introducing myself to the newcomer if there had been a break in the conversation, but there wasn't.</p>

<p>Other than that, what I was feeling (and still feel) was ""How incredibly rude that guy is!""</p>

<p>My question: Is there any courteous way to interrupt the ""intruder"" and prevent being treated as if we did not exist? What is the best way to handle such an event?</p>

<p>I'm not looking for how to handle our new friends so much as the intruder.</p>

"How to talk to family member about their spending?","<p>My grandparents have a caravan at the Baltic see where they basically spend all summer. This, in my view, is good for them. They get to be in nature, which should be good for their health, and they seem to have a more active social life there than at home, which is also good imho. Of course renting the space costs money, and quite a bit at that, but as far as I can tell its totally worth it for them.</p>

<p>In addition, my grandma likes to buy stuff on teleshopping channels - stuff like lotions, jewellery, clothing and candles. And while I don't particularly want to get involved in their choices - its their money - I feel this isn't adding nearly as much value to their lifes.</p>

<p>You can probably see where this is going. Every year, the choice to continue caravanning is in jeopardy because ""it's too expensive"", while the shopping goes on basically without interruption. When trying to talk to her about it, you'll hear things like ""it's just a couple of Euros"", apparently not realizing that this adds up if you order every other week. Also, my grandma gets quite defensive and feels being harassed when people disagree with her.</p>

<p>How can I make this a more productive conversation? I don't want to tell her what to do, I just want her to be more deliberate in her spending, and try to convey my sense of how much value both choices add to their lifes. How can I talk to her about it without seeming to intrude into her choices or questioning her judgements? (Of course, to some extend, that is what I'm doing, but with the best intentions.)</p>

"How can I keep a conversation on topic with a person who rambles?","<p>I am seeking suggestions for how to keep a conversation on topic with a 50 year old family member who says whatever comes into his head, often changing the conversation in a confusing way.</p>

<p>I've tried addressing the issue directly but he gets offended.
Here is an example to illustrate the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>Today he asked me to help him navigate using Google Maps but I couldn't even type in the address as he wouldn't stop talking and asking me random questions. This happened right after he told me to put my cellphone away as it's rude to be on it when you are with other people. </li>

Perhaps some day I will re-attempt to reconnect the pathing, but for now, the quality of life with it is a lot better and I'm content with leaving it the way it is.</p>

<p>I've had serious relationships in the past, and it was never a big issue. It does cause some inconvenience when intimate, mostly that I have to be careful with it, but nothing too serious. </p>

<p>Recently I started a new relationship, which appeared to be going really well, we went out twice but have been in contact every day for about 2 weeks. Yesterday we had scheduled a date which's purpose was clear that we'd get intimate. Before we met I chose to go for a walk and tell her about my condition. At first, she didn't quite understand what it meant but I explained until she did. We then went back to my place, had dinner and after moving to the bedroom I showed her what it looked like from the outside (the bandage). </p>

<p>We watched some tv and fooled around a bit, after which she left, at leaving she told me she can't stop thinking about it. Specifically about how it's something that I can't control (that it's actively working all the time). 
This was last night and I haven't spoken to her since (usually we would text during the day). </p>

<p>I've decided I would just give her time to think about it and process, I imagine she'll figure out that it's not that big of a deal and still choose to go ahead and attempt a relationship (this is the first and only un-matchability so far). 
But I'm still not sure how I feel about the fact that she's bothered by it.</p>

<p>Any tips on how to proceed? How to decide for me, if her being bothered by this shows a negative side of her character?</p>

<p>Also - none of you proposed anything regarding my current plan of action of not doing anything. What do you think? Reach out? Continue waiting?</p>

"How can I ask this girl out when she's giving me mixed signals (and other various obstacles)?","<p>I'm going to try to make this short, but there's quite a bit of stuff to explain.</p>

<p><strong>Background information:</strong></p>

<p>Me: Male, 17, Junior</p>

<p>Her: Female, 17 (assumed), Junior</p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>

<p>So, this girl moved from a nearby state to the city where I live in before the school year began, and when school seated, her assigned seating in physics for the semester was at my table group. I got a crush on her and asked her to homecoming (this is back in October), but she said she was going to be gone the day (visiting her old state) but she said it was sweet of me to ask. We had a conversation afterward about where she was from and the new place where we both reside, and that gave me some hope.  However, she wasn't gone on the day of homecoming so I have my doubts (there's a chance she left after the school day ended).  For about a week she basically went out of her way to avoid me, but it got back to normal after. </p>

<p>Then, in November, we were assigned the same group for a month long project and conversations were friendly from there. We eventually exchanged numbers in a group chat for the project (there was one other person in the group) and we ended up talking outside of the chat (but mostly about physics), and the conversations were very friendly. In the second semester, her seat changed so we aren't in the same groups anymore, but we text every once in a while to discuss physics homework and she is very friendly now with her texts and she says hi when we walk by each other in the hallway.  </p>

<p>What I want to do is ask her out, but I feel like I'm dangerously close to the friendzone. I could probably just start a conversation with her during lunch, but it would be kind of annoying to her because I'm just interrupting her studying out of the blue with nothing to talk about. The final option I think I have is this: In my class, if you miss a lab, you have to stay after school with another student who already did the lab and do it then. I'm thinking I could just do that, but there's a chance we don't do the lab together. </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> She kind-of rejected me and we're on good terms at the moment, but there are complications for me asking her out. </p>

<p><strong>Question(s)/Where I Want To Be:</strong></p>

<p>How can I ask her out? Do I ease it into a conversation?</p>

<hr>

<p>How I want the situation to be at the end: She knows I like her and I have either gone out with her or she has said no.</p>

<p>My expectation: We go out, but she wants to be friends (idk, this is just what happens most often with my friends and their relationships)</p>

<p>EDIT:  The way that I approached her was by walking up to her after class in the  hallways and just straight-up asking her.  I'm asking how I can change this approach to be more successful and if I did it wrong.</p>

<p>UPDATE: She missed a lab and I helped her make it up after school and that went well, where do I go from here?</p>

"Refusing free goods as a blind person","<p>As a severely visually impaired person, I use a white cane in the public and unfamiliar shops for identification purposes and as a mobility aid. I regularly encounter sellers at bakeries or fast food restaurants who would like to give me my entire, usually smaller purchase, for free. I always refuse the offer because I am able to pay, but I feel like I'm making them very insecure and scared about our conversation. A typical of these conversations is like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: Good day, is it my turn to order?<br> <strong>Seller</strong>: Yes, it is!<br>
  <em>I tell them what I want</em><br> <strong>Seller</strong>: Alright! Have a nice day!<br>
  <em>Seller hands me a bag with the items</em><br> <strong>Me</strong>: How much is it?<br> <strong>Seller</strong>: Oh, it's on us!<br> <strong>Me</strong>: Are you sure?<br> <strong>Seller</strong>:
  Absolutely!<br> <strong>Me</strong>: Why? I'd like to pay!<br>
  <em>Awkward situation and silence</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they really refuse my payment after this, I look out for a donation box (kinda like a tip jar, but the content goes to a local charity) and put some money in there.</p>

<p>A friend of mine has suggested to actively remind the sellers of the situation of many homeless people, who often won't even consider approaching a shop like theirs, and that they should rather make a donation to their local food bank or the people who really need it. He also suggested that I say ""I'm able to pay despite my visual impairment, others aren't."" to them as well. However, I think that sounds kind of arrogant and pitiful at the same time.</p>

<p>So, what should I do or say to these sellers to prevent the conversation from becoming awkward in the first place? I feel really uncomfortable taking goods for free, but sometimes I have no other option.</p>

"How can I decline to help my teacher with their personal IT problem?","<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Certain details have been changed for privacy's sake.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am the go-to person for tech help for my friends (and enemies), family, and <strong>teachers</strong>.  I have helped everyone I know with tech since 3rd grade (I am currently in high school).</p>

<p>During school when a video wouldn't play, the projector wasn't calibrated, things wouldn't print, etc., I would help and fix these issues. Teachers thanked me and were appreciative that I was able to fix their <strong>school-related</strong> issues within 5-10min without having to go through the IT staff.</p>

<p>However, there was an art teacher at the school (I say ""was"" because she resigned, much later after this incident). She was rightfully known for <strong>ALWAYS</strong> being on her phone. It became so bad that a petition was signed by multiple parents addressed to the board to get rid of her (although nothing came of it). As an outspoken, very opinionated, person I frequently made jokes to friends and made it clear that I was totally against her and her use of her phone. I even said things to her face (which looking back may have not been the most appropriate).</p>

<p>Towards the beginning of an art class, she put a lesson on the projector and started to explain what we were going to do that day.  Her phone pinged and she picked it up and started to look through it. The lesson came to halt, and since we were used to this we started talking and the room got loud. A few minutes later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Teacher: ""[Insert My Name Here] come here."" </p>
  
  <p><em>Everyone went silent</em></p>
  
  <p><em>I walk over to her desk, wondering what did I do?</em></p>
  
  <p>Teacher: ""I'm getting a message on my phone that my iCloud is out of space. What should I do?""</p>
  
  <p><em>I'm thinking it's probably photos of art or something for the class</em></p>
  
  <p>Me: ""If you don't want to buy more space on iCloud, you can transfer the
  photos to the computer and delete them from your phone""</p>
  
  <p>Teacher: ""Here's my Mac. Can you do it for me?""</p>
  
  <p>Me: ""Should we transfer it to the school computer for the lesson?""</p>
  
  <p>Teacher: ""What? No. These are my vacation photos.""</p>
  
  <p><em>Everyone laughed, except me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't want to help her with a personal matter and encourage this behavior, but I also didn't want to get in trouble and sent to the principal for refusing, who based on my experiences with him, would probably not care that it was an inappropriate request.</p>

<p>So, I ended up helping her transfer everything. This took the entire rest of the period, while everyone else got to sit back and enjoy the off period.</p>

<p>This sucked for multiple reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I had to help a teacher I didn't like</p></li>
<li><p>I was encouraging her irresponsible behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Didn't help socially among other kids</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone else got a period to talk, socialize, or do work from other classes and I didn't</p></li>
<li><p>It was completely inappropriate for a teacher to ask this.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2><strong>My goal for future reference:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>I want a way to politely tell her that (in a way that I would <em>not</em> get into trouble):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It is inappropriate to ask for help with personal matters.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I don't feel comfortable helping her with non-school related technology questions.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>She's the type of teacher that is liable to respond like ""No? Excuse me?! Go to the principal immediately"". </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Going to an administrator is not really an option as it was a right then and there thing and she probably would not have let me leave.</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't really want to give the impression that I am unable to help or don't know how for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's hard to say I don't know when I am helping 5 other teachers with other tech problems</li>
<li>It's one of my few socially driving forces. I really don't want to lose what social interactions I gain (with other kids) by them losing their confidence in my abilities.</li>

<p>However, my last contact with her was over 5 years ago. I had either deleted her number or just lost it when I changed my phone handset. I also did not recognize her voice, so blurted out that response.</p>

"How to determine which gesture of appreciation will be the most effective?","<p>Recently, I decided to learn more about <a href=""https://oureverydaylife.com/love-languages-5533438.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Love languages</a>. </p>

<p>According to this website, here is a list of the various way people can show appreciation for someone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Physical touch</li>
<li>Gift giving</li>
<li>Words of affirmation</li>
<li>Act of service</li>
<li>Quality time</li>
</ul>

<p>I then asked myself what ""love language"" the people in my family talk. For some of them it was quite easy to figure out but for others (like my big sister), I'm still struggling.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How can I determine what love language someone speaks? </p>

<p>My aim here is to be able to offer more ""valuable"" gifts to my loved ones which means I would (ideally) like to know what ""love gesture"" they will care the most about. However, knowing that ""they don't really care about love gesture X but they care about Y"" would still be valuable information. </p>

<p>Also, I'm more interested in solutions that don't involve ""directly asking"" but rely more on observation. An ideal solution would be for me to just ""go through my memories"" and find the answer I'm looking for.</p>

<h1>What I have thought about doing (and why it won't work)</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Just ask them ""what is your love language."" But since (as far as I know) my family doesn't even know what a ""love language"" is, they won't be able to answer this question.</p></li>
<li><p>I also thought about asking them with concrete examples like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would you rather I give you this fluffy unicorn or spend time with you in this aqua-park?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the risk here is that the ""fluffy unicorn"" was a terrible idea to begin with and just changing the examples would draw completely different answers and conclusions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also (as you may have noticed) none of these solutions rely on observations.</p>

<h1>More about my big sister</h1>

<p>(please note that if you have a solution that would work for every person, that would be highly appreciated)</p>

<p>My mother always complained that I ""never do anything with [her]"" so it was easy to figure that she values quality time a lot. My little sister is a big hugger so, I figure she might be on the ""Physical touch"" side. </p>

<p>However, my big sister tends to keep her emotions and feelings inside her which makes it harder for me to determine her ""love language"".</p>

<h1>Notes and clarifications</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>I don't really have a time frame here (even if having the response <strong>now</strong> would be much appreciated). And if the answer involves seeing the person face to face, it would still be a valid answer. </p></li>
<li><p>My family probably won't agree to take a quiz about love languages (even if some of them might accept, a lot of them won't). They won't care enough, think it's silly/stupid/not science and not worth there time. Also, some of them don't really speak English and I can't find a quiz in French.</p></li>

And I have 0 connection to anyone, family or otherwise(meaning, I can go years/forever with no contact and be totally ""happy""), so being alone actually ""feels good"". I have always hated talking to other people or ""hanging out"" with them, because quite frankly it's boring, and I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing. </p>

It's like my brain goes blank-so I just repeat an answer from what I've said in past situations matching the current question. </p>

"How to decline eating food at a restaurant?","<p>I'm often invited to restaurants before or after certain meetings with groups of people I know, including friends. However, I don't like to eat ""outside food"" and never go to restaurants or get take out in my daily life.  I'm a really cynical person and I don't trust that restaurant food is of good intent. I want to be able to see every step of the process that the food went through before eating it such as how well it was washed, where was it grown, did the processor wash their hands before, is it fresh? I'm not a fan of business tricks such as skipping steps that can't be observed by the customer (such as not washing fruits because nobody can tell) Because I'm not able to keep track of these things at restaurants I prefer not to eat at them. These are my own personal reasons and I know they are not universally agreed upon by everyone else. I do not want to share them as I don't want a debate about why my reasons are not right; I know some of them are extreme, but I still prefer for it to be the way it is.</p>

<p>Usually I still go to the restaurant though with them but don't order anything except maybe a drink just to have ""ordered"" something (which I won't drink). (Note: We go to low quality/inexpensive (or overpriced low quality) places to eat)</p>

<p>Sometimes this becomes awkward as the people I am with start asking me questions about why I don't eat. They try to help me by suggesting that we can go to a different restaurant or recommending things from the menu. Still, it won't make a difference as I won't eat it either way. </p>

<p>I feel like this becomes really awkward and sometimes offensive towards the other person(s) when they see I decline to eat or order any food. It also draws lots of unwanted attention to me. Since I'm not able to communicate exactly why I don't eat anything there I feel degraded not being able to deal with the situation and end up ruining it for everyone. </p>

<p>I don't know how to communicate to them that I'm sitting there at the restaurant to talk or spend time with them and NOT for the food as I am not a fan of restaurants or trying different foods in general. </p>

"How can I help someone become more assertive?","<p>My fiancee is what I would call ""too nice"". She's always trying to please everyone, which often leads to her taking a ""grin and bear it"" attitude when others expect too much of her. It doesn't matter whether she's interacting with her roommates, her co-workers, her family, or even complete strangers. What invariably happens is that they do something she doesn't like, and she just lets them.</p>

<p>One big one that she complains to me a lot about is her roommates not doing their fair share of cleaning. Recently, their apartment has gotten roaches. She's told them repeatedly about the roaches and reminded them about keeping things clean, but they still leave the apartment a mess and don't often clean. Last week when she mentioned that she had seen more roaches, one of her roommates told her that she should clean more. She was very upset by this because she does most of the cleaning, even when the mess isn't hers.</p>

<h3>What I've tried</h3>

<p>I've tried two different things, neither of which has worked. First, I tried telling her explicitly that she needs to be more assertive if she wants her situation to change. I tried telling her this about one of the issues she has at work, and she responded that she can't be assertive because she will get fired.</p>

<p>The second thing that I tried was offering assertive solutions. I usually suggest them in the form of a question along the lines of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you tried saying/doing X?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She usually hasn't tried and then offers an excuse for why my solutions won't work. Her excuses are usually about how doing whatever action I've told her to take will make the other person mad at her, and that she's trying to avoid that.</p>

<p>I can tell that always catering to others is taking a toll on her. I think that being assertive will help with that, but she seems to always fear that being assertive will result in retaliation. I think that if she actually tries, then the fear will go away.</p>

<p><strong>How can I help her learn to be more assertive?</strong></p>

"How to reduce the risk of people interpret me implying things, when I never intended to?","<p>I have Asperger's Syndrome.  I'm an aspie.  I am naturally inclined to say things literally and take things literally, but I have learned most <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotypical"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neurotypicals</a> communicate differently, and as a minority, it's up to me to adapt where I can, so I do my best to learn typical non-literal implications.  That goes both ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I say something, and people believe I implied something else.  This may lead to conflict.  I may get annoyed at the other because I perceive they aren't listening properly.  They might get annoyed at me because they perceive I'm being dishonest.  Perhaps it's even related to this elusive term passive-aggressive that I've never quite understood.  A classic if somewhat constructed example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Them</strong>: You said you like X<br>
  <strong>Me</strong>: I did not say I like X<br>
  <strong>Them</strong>: Oh, so you don't like X?<br>
  <strong>Me</strong>: No, I did not say I don't like X. Actually, I like X.<br>
  <strong>Them</strong> (annoyed): But you just said you didn't say that!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this example is somewhat artificial, there are many examples in the daily world where poor communication may cause conflict.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Another example, from the real world:</p>

<p>Ten years ago, a young woman I knew from university asked if she could sit on my bike rack, and I answered she was too heavy, as my bike rack doesn't like more than 30 kg or so.  </p>

<p>I don't remember if I said the part about the maximum weight for my bike rack, but as an engineer, she should understand.  I'm bad at reading non-verbal communication and I was unable to understand her response, I may have said something wrong.  </p>

<p>I am aware that there is a cultural attitude against telling women they are too heavy, but rationally there should be no insult in telling an adult woman her mass appears to be more than 30 kg and that the bike won't like it, in particular, if she is an engineer.  It's true.  And it was only a 500-meter walk anyway.</p>

<p>If I kept a diary I could probably list dozens, if not hundreds, of examples.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I may be able to think of ways I could have formulated it differently, but I'm not sure if <em>My bike won't like that</em> would have had a very different effect. </p>

"How to talk to someone about work after their significant other passed away","<p>I recently moved into a shared home where my landlord is one of the roommates. Shortly after her husband passed away. Understandably she’s been upset and stressed. Also I was told it was the husband who generally took care of things around the house, like repairs. She had been staying with family for a bit but now is back. During her time away her son dropped by and told me to contact him if there are any issues. I told him the Wi-Fi hasn’t been working properly (I tried fixing it myself and called the ISP but they don’t speak to someone not on the account). The son replied his mom is under too much stress right now to deal with it, which I get.</p>

<p>My question is how long should I wait, or how can I tell if she’s ready to be informed of some of my concerns regarding the rental? I have a lot of trouble knowing when and how to “cut someone slack”. For example the past two days there have been renovations/cleaning/redecorating which I hadn’t been informed of and I couldn’t use several parts of the house and even in my room it was very noisy. I would like to have the conversation with the landlord that I expect advance notice when things like this are happening but not sure if now is the right time given her husband's passing (I actually mentioned I didn’t know this was happening and they said “it wasn’t supposed to happen today”). Also, it’s insignificant as I never watch it but during the renovations the TV has been removed and it’s technically in my lease. I don’t want to nitpick, especially given the circumstances, but things like this make me concerned they aren’t taking the rental agreement seriously. </p>

<p>Another factor making things difficult is the landlord is almost always surrounded by guests/friends/family when she is at home. I don’t really think it’s appropriate discussing these things in front of them and when I tried in the past they butted in and interrupted. Would it be impersonal to just start using email even though I literally live with the landlord? </p>

"Dealing with freedom problems with SO","<p>I am a male 28yo, my SO is a girl 25yo. We've been together two years and a half.</p>

<p>We've each compenetrated the other's lives, we think similar about a lot of things and in some other things we have different postures wich makes our conversations pretty stimulating. We've also did a lot of things together through all this years that are totally remarkable and special for both of us. More than we did with previous couples, making this relationship pretty rewarding.</p>

<p>Last weekend suddenly she wanted to give ourselves a time, to see if she can deal with being alone. The reason was that she has this thought about travelling to Germany and spend a year living alone, or doing a EVS (European Volunteering Service), not for the sake of volunteering but to be alone in another country, I think it this way because she doesn't do any volunteering here to help poors or animal rights associations or even some volunteering in events teaching kids.</p>

<p>My point of view is that if she want to go live abroad we as a couple can manage to do it, she is going star a PhD program this september, and we don't have to be in the country. But she doesn't care, her point is that she want to be alone abroad.</p>

<p>I think it's kind of unfair because if you are with somebody you want to be with that person, even though you need your loneliness moments, which I need too. So this means that we can move abroad an she will have freedom to meet people and to do what she wants, and share that experience like every couple living together. However I love her, and I don't want her to be forced to abandon her dreams for me. So I told her her do what he wanted with our relationship.</p>

<p>Two hours after we both went home and me saying that she has to do what she feels she has to do, regarding leaving me or stay appart a time until she decides to leaving me, aka ""giving us a time"". After that decission, she called me and said she wanted to be with me and see me at that moment, that she loves me. We met, everything went great. We met two more days and it went ok but something was blocking her, therefore blocking us. So I asked her ""you love me?"" She answered ""Yes"", ""Do you want to be with me?"" she answered ""Yes"", ""Are you allright with your decission?"" then she answered ""Ummmm.... well yes"". This doubt is what is making me afraid.</p>

<p>I feel like she really loves me and thinks only great things about this relationship, but right now she is with me trying to reevaluate the relationship, maybe searching for things that can justify breaking up, while, conciously or not, taking decissions that she knows won't allow us to have much time to see us. It's just speculation, as it can be that she only feels bad for all of this and is still stressed about the situation, or worse, that she doesn't want to lose the money we spend on buying a trip to Sicily for this september. Where she confessed she wanted to give me a proposal ring, wich curiously was what I wanted to do too, I've already preordered it.</p>

<p><strong>So my question is</strong>. What is the best course of action, to communicate her that she has to fully commit to my decission, whatever decission it is, but without stressing her out or forcing to decide out of pressure.</p>

<p>What I thought was not going out together this week and saying clearly that if she is going to go out with me and will be constantly reevaluating the relationship searching for a reason to break, I preffer to wait until she is totally decided. Doing this will probably stress her a lot more, and can be a reason to break since I can seem a bit unreasonable, and also we won't be doing anything about the trip probably losing all that money. The other thing is to keep meeting with her and being good and happy, the same guy as if nothing had happened. This brings me some issues, because in my last relationship my ex broke with me, then we continued being together and I chose this option, being the good boy as if nothing happened, and then she broke up with me just before going on a Erasmus. So this will mentally be hard for me, but maybe it's the best option.</p>

<p>Things to take into account:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We both like to travel, we even opened a travel blog.</p></li>
<li><p>Right now officially she decided to be with me, just after two hours of saying me that she wanted a break.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>-The reasons that lead me to think about her reevaluating the relationship are a few comments that came out of nowhere in conversation. Like ""You are really beautiful"", ""You are very good to me"", ""You always take me to gorgeours places"".</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since we met we traveled (counting only 3 or more days stays) to two cities in the region, to one city in another region, to a camping in some coastal area, to London, and Milano. This year we wanted to go Sicily as I said before and maybe Scotland or Belgium.</p></li>
<li><p>She also traveled alone or with other people, to Liverpool where two sisters of her live, to South Spain since she did there a Masters degree (we are from the north of Spain, and Germany that was a present of her sisters for Christmas.</p></li>
<li><p>I work full time with lunch break, wich means working from 8:30 to 18:30, which means that most of the year except summer we mostly hang out together in weekends. Due to responsibilities it's hard to meet in the week regularly.</p></li>
<li><p>Since this year she works when they call her in a farm where schools organize excursions to learn about farm work. In may and june she works most of times five days a week 8 hours per day, plus 2 hours of commuting. Most of the year maybe it's one or two days of work by month in average, not pretty well paid, but she goes, because that way she is occupied and can earn some money for the weekends.</p></li>
<li><p>We were planning to go together abroad on a work grant next year.</p></li>
<li><p>She doesn't want to go living UK to search some better job and be near her sisters, because her mother will be alone in her house, and also has some debts to pay and a restaurant that isn't going too well.</p></li>
<li><p>She admitted that she loves me. That she thinks I'm beautiful and all of that. I believe her, since she repeated and showed affection in concordance. Even now she says that she loves me and that I'm the best person in her life. That she feels bad for putting me in this situation. Also recognized that she has too much pride against me for being a man and that he isn't too constant with what she starts.</p></li>

"How to cold call/post a long lost relative?","<p>My mother lost touch with her cousins many years ago and I would have been about 5 years old the last time I seen them. I am 30 now. </p>

<p>I am doing family research and trying to build the family tree. My mother is quite a bit younger than her cousins so she doesn't remember much.</p>

<p>I found a few of them on Facebook but the others don't use Facebook. Some are not really interested much in my research and are not providing much info about my great-grandparents but they might not remember either. It's a long shot but I'd like to ask them about the family history.</p>

<p>I looked up their name in the phone book and I think I may have found them but I have no way of verifying the info from the phone book because some of the cousins are estranged from each other due to family issues.</p>

<p>I want to write a letter to the address in the phone book (essentially cold-calling/mailing) and see if it's my relative. I don't want to reveal too much in case it is not my mother's cousin after all. </p>

<p>Some of them would be 60+ so I'm not sure if they use email or not.
Here's what I've thought of, but I'm not sure if this is a good way to do it, or if  I should explain more.</p>

"How to address awful smells from the flat above","<p>Apologies for the large amount of run-up; the context feels very relevant:</p>

<hr>

<p>My wife and I live in a 1930s block of flats in London. We are on the ground floor, of a staircase of 8 flats, so we're at least slightly familiar with <em>(almost)</em> everyone in the block.
We own our flat, but I believe several of the flats are owned (effectively) by the council and are rented out as council flats. This block and the others on the rest of the estate around us are run by ""BarnetHomes"" on behalf of the council.</p>

<p>In the flat directly above ours, lives a lady whom we have never seen (in the 2 years we've lived there). We suspect that she is physically and/or mentally disabled, for a handful of reasons (some of which relate to other parts of question, hence listing them here):</p>

<ul>
<li>Never having seen her leave the flat.</li>
<li>She's never answered her door when we've knocked (3-4 random times over the 2 years)</li>
<li>She has a friend (""Ray"") who visits her very regularly (I probably <em>notice</em> him come past 4+ times a week so it seems likely that he's visiting 5-6 times a week) and appears to bring her groceries with him each time.</li>
<li>She has some sort of small yappie dog, which never leaves the flat either (we can hear his skittering on the floor above and barking, but never see it taken outside)</li>
<li>In a previous (non-confrontational) conversation with Ray in which I was asking to come into the flat above, he responded with ""Oh no, you can't do that; she doesn't like to have other people come into the flat"".</li>
<li>Comments from other flat-owners on the staircase that <em>they</em> think she's disabled in some way.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of the above are conclusive, and some aspects are VERY circumstancial, but that's the context I'm working in.</p>

<hr>

<p>As mentioned above, she has a small dog, and about a month ago, our fuse cupboard (basically a 50 cm deep closet) started to smell incredibly strongly of wet dog. It varies from day to day but at a minimum it's always strong enough that you can smell it if you sniff at the closed cupboard door, and at worst it's frequently strong enough that it actively bothers me 3-4 metres away from the (closed) cupboard.</p>

<p>The flats in the block are all laid out identically, so the main power lines running up to the flat above, with <em>their</em> fuse boxes, all lined up in a vertical column. We believe that there is an air channel running between her fuse cupboard and ours, and that the smell is coming down from her flat.
We've previously had an issue with a leak from 3 flats above coming down through all of the fuse cabinets down the stair <em>(yeah, I know ... leaks in the space running the electrics. Fun Times.)</em></p>

<hr>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I saw Ray passing and mentioned this smell and asked if I could come up to take a look to try to confirm the issue and see what options we (he and I) might have to resolve it.</p>

<p>As noted he refused the concept of me coming to take a look. He also refuted that there were any smells in her flat and said that maybe it was coming from the hall (it wasn't). I invited him to come in and smell the fuse cupboard to see if he had any advice. He came in and said he couldn't smell anything in the fuse cupboard. I think I <strong>believe</strong> that he couldn't smell anything, but he was wrong - it smelt bad.</p>

<p>Over Christmas I had asked 3 different people at different times to take a look in the fuse cupboard and give me their thoughts (with no other prompt). All 3 asked whether I was talking about the smell, so it's definitely not just me.</p>

<p>It's probably worth noting at this point that Ray appears to have terrible health. He's severely obese, has several missing teeth and awful looking gums and needs to rest for a bit before walking up the stairs whilst carrying his friend's groceries. I don't know whether he couldn't detect the smell because he'd just come down from the flat and had aclimated to the smell, or whether his health has simply damaged his sense of smell entirely.</p>

<p>Last week, out of curiosity I walked upstairs and quietly sniffed at the key hole of the flat above.
It stank of the same wet dog smell. I would expect to be unwilling to spend more than a few minutes inside the flat, based on the smell.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>What do I do now?</strong></p>

<p>If they were any of the other neighbours, with whom I have more normal interactions, I would just go and talk to them and explain that it really is a problem, try to sort it out by discussing.</p>

<p>But I don't really know how to approach it in these particular circumstances.</p>

<p>I don't want to just leave it, because it's pretty unpleasant, and also because I would expect it to cause issues when we want to sell in another {however many years}.</p>

<p>Escalating up to BarnetHomes (whom are our Freeholders/management company and we assume are <em>her</em> Landlord/Freeholder too) seems like an unwise Nuclear option. But equally it seems like if we wait 9 months and then tell them that there has been a problem for ages, then I would expect them to say ""why didn't you tell us previously?""</p>

<p><strong>What is a sensible set of next steps to try to resolve this?</strong></p>

"How to react when your flirt gives the same respond like you did","<p>To establish the background of the story, let me explain who is the flirt and what is the relationship between each other in my case.</p>

<p>I'm a 23 years old male and my flirt is also 23 years old but a female. Me and she are both open-minded about anything and we are funny. We always make jokes about sex, but we never done that. </p>

<p>So, we went the same highschool but had never talked back then. But last summer, I texted her somehow and we started chatting. After a while, we decided to meet. The meeting was pretty good actually since we are both selective when it comes to communication. After two or three meetings, we stopped talking because I'm a person who waits the initiation from opposite party. It seems like she is too...</p>

<p>Now the question part:
Today we have started chatting again but the interesting part is we were being childish and funny again. But at the end the conversation went like this(I don't know any way to improve visual on this conversation if any, sorry):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She: I thought you were irritated because of me and because of this I also got irritated by you :D<br>
  Me: Wow, actually I didn't even think anything like that, why didn't you share that with me at least?<br>
  She: Do we need to tell this to other party in these kind of conversations, lol.<br>
  Me: Okey. (Me being on standby mode, waiting her to share her actual    feelings, didn't work as you can see)<br>
  She: Okey...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What should I say in such situation to make her open her feelings? I know she is into me but I don't know the key or whatsoever. Conversations like this have occured to me way too much and I felt like I need to ask you about this.</p>

"How do I deal with this kid who is really creeping me out in class?","<p>For reference, I am a 17 y/o male in my Junior year of HS.  </p>

<p>So there's a kid in my class, not sure the age but I know he's a Junior (looks like a Freshman though), let's call him Andrew.  Andrew usually never talks, and tends to listen in on others conversations, then laugh while looking in their direction.</p>

<p>In this class, my teacher recently set up table groups where we can choose who to sit with, so I chose a table in the back with a good friend of mine (we were the only two at the table).  Recently, my friend has been sick so I've been alone at this table for about two classes, and just on Monday, Andrew decided to sit at my table and I'm not sure why, because there were plenty of other seats for him to sit at. I figured there wasn't anything wrong with him sitting there, but he's been creeping me the hell out for the last two classes.  </p>

<p>He just sits there on his chromebook the whole class and randomly bursts out laughing hysterically while staring at me, and sometimes I just look out of the corner of my eye and, again, he's staring at me.  Even worse, sometimes he is doing what appears to be the ""Heil Hitler"" salute while staring at me and smiling.  </p>

<p>The worst of it, however, is this: on Monday, I brought a protein shake to school that is actually quite disgusting, and most people wouldn't drink it (I do because I need extra energy throughout the day).  When I was drinking it on Monday, Andrew just kind of looked at me, and appeared to type something on his Chromebook.  Fast-forward to today, and he's doing the exact same things as Monday, but this time he brings THE EXACT SAME DRINK to school that I drank on Monday, and drinks the whole thing at once while staring at me.  </p>

<p>I don't know what to do, because I don't want to move seats and it's rude to ask someone else to move.  Do I tell the teacher?  The school?  I'm worried that it's going to get worse.  What should I do?</p>

<p>UPDATE:  We just got new seats in class and I sit next to him...</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: It turns out he was pretty normal as of a few years ago and was involved in an accident.  </p>

"How do I make it known to a group of friends that I need a little more patience to communicate with?","<p>I am the kind of person that is quiet until I feel welcomed in a group of people, and even then, I still am relatively quiet until spoken to.</p>

<p>Important information to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am deaf with cochlear implants. The cochlear implants are hidden beneath my long hair. I understand a person if the room is relatively quiet, the person speaks clearly, and if I understand the topic well enough to make guesses towards what the other person might say next.</li>
<li>Background noise, like other members of the group chatting, exacerbate the difficulty of understanding one person.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am thinking of a situation where more than three people are present, all are hearing, and all do not know sign language enough to be able to communicate with me directly using sign language.</p>

<p>Note: </p>

<p><em>When you say that you need time until you feel welcome, how long does that usually take?</em></p>

<p>For me personally, it does not take long. Feeling comfortable in a group can take one to three group meetings, and might even take only one, if the group is especially compatible.

It is a long process with a lot of unknowns -- and a lot of tricky personal stuff we have to go through and deal with. Understandably, a lot of people we know are excited for us to eventually be together, but many people don't really realize the hardship and also the complexity of what we are doing.</p>

<p>I tend to get a lot of questions along the lines of ""when will you be able to be together?"" and to be honest I have no idea!

"How to restore harmony between my family and my wife or is it necessary?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I married my wife 2 years ago after we dated for about a year. There has been ongoing conflicts between my wife and my family, which I will elaborate below. My wife is Korean, I am Taiwanese. We both live overseas. My mum lives in Taiwan.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>During the time of these conflicts below, I had a visa passport issue so I wasn't able to travel overseas to visit my mother-in-law nor go back to my home country.</p></li>
<li><p>I am now visiting my Korean mother-in-law in 2 days. My mum was originally going too with flight booked but she got pissed off about an Uber incident (explained below) so she cancelled her flight because she doesn't want to recognise my marriage.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conflicts</h2>

<p><strong>Meeting between mums</strong></p>

<p>My mum wanted to visit my wife's mum (her father has passed away) right after we got married. However, her mum originally disapproved our marriage so it wasn't a good time to visit. </p>

<p>After a few months, her mum began to recognise our marriage. My mum, again, wanted to visit her. Her mum's response was that she's very busy with work during summer and it's best to visit during winter since she has no work during that time. </p>

<p>Winter in Korea is very cold, so my mum much prefers to visit in summer even just for 30 minutes. At that time, my wife told me she doesn't want to push her mum too much for the meeting as she's already stressed about work. On my mum's end, she doesn't understand why her mum can't even spare 30 minutes to meet the parent of her son-in-law. My mum felt very offended at that time. I tried to express to my wife that this doesn't really make sense but she was very upset at that time I kept pushing for the meeting. My mum even grew suspicious about why her mum didn't want to meet immediately.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I didn't think it was necessary to push for the meeting, however I also felt weird why a 30 minutes meeting would be difficult.</p>

<p>However, the way I handled this back then was that I tried to make both parties happy (which I know now is wrong). I tried to find explanations for my mum why her mum felt it difficult, and at the same time tried to talk my wife into the 30 minutes meeting. But it didn't work out. I think they both didn't understand each other as a result and the meeting didn't happen.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Learn Chinese conflicts</strong></p>

<p>Ever since I got married, my mum has been pushing me to teach my wife Chinese so she can speak to her. I have told her many times that I will teach her at my own pace, considering she also needs to focus on English as my wife and I live in a English-speaking country. However, my mum would try to call us through chatting app every now and then and request to speak to her. If my wife didn't show much improvement in speaking Chinese, my mum would complain she is not learning much.</p>

<p>My wife actually is interested in Chinese but felt it was too pressure from my mum.</p>

<p>I, again, tried to please both parties. I tried to convince my wife to just 'pretend' you learn few new words each time you talk to her. At the same, try to tell my mum maybe not pressure too much.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I totally think my mum should just back off.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Chatting app conflict</strong></p>

<p>In the second year, my wife started sending some photos of us to my mum and my mum would send some text back for me to translate. I thought it was a good way for them to connect since they have difficulties talking with each other. However, my mum accidentally sent some photos of my ex with my sister traveling in Japan together (my ex and my sister remained friends). </p>

<p>My wife was very upset about the photos and replied to her 'Thanks for the photo but please do not send Ray's ex-girlfriend's photo as I don't feel very good' and deleted the chatting app. My wife also started a huge arguments with me as the first time I said was she probably sent those by accident (maybe she felt I was siding with my mum).</p>

<p>I personally think deleting the chatting app was her way to stand up for herself cause back then I often didn't seem to have my own opinions and I was easily influenced by what my mum said about my marriage. However, the way she handled it was very extreme.</p>

<p>My mum was very unhappy that my wife deleted the chatting app for those photos because she said she didn't send those intentionally. She just wanted to show traveling photos of my sister and she didn't pay attentions to who else were in those photos.</p>

<p>They seemingly apologised to each other last time my mum visited. My mum told her she sent those by accident and if that had offended her she is sorry, my wife told her she was too sensitive and she is sorry too. However, my mum was still upset about it and brought it up many times after that (because she thinks my wife did not apologise first).</p>

<p>In my opinion, I think my wife overreacted but I somehow could understand why she handled it that way to protect herself as often I don't always protect her first between my family and her.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Sister's Uber conflict</strong></p>

<p>Last time we moved, my sister was moving in with us temporarily (she was staying for 2 weeks). Because her furniture didn't fit in her room, she had to put her furniture into a storage bit far from where we were moving to. The weather was pretty bad that day, raining heavily and quite windy. After my sister has put her stuff into storage, she called me up to ask me if I could pick up her as the trains weren't operating and she didn't really want to take the bus.</p>

<p>At that time, I would've gone to pick her up but my wife told me we still had a lot to unpack and she wanted to finish unpacking over the weekend as I will be very busy doing overtime the next week (there was a huge project due at my work at that time) and she wouldn't know how to unpack my clothes.</p>

<p>So I caved in and told my sister to take an Uber. She was not happy of course and questioned me if this is my wife's opinion. I stupidly told her yes. My mum was incredibly upset after hearing the story from my sister and blamed my wife for giving me 'bad' influences. I felt really guilty at that time and apologised to my family.</p>

<p>In my opinion, thinking back, I would pick up sister up because I was happy to and find alternative solution for the unpacking.</p>

<h2>Psychologist and books</h2>

<p>As you can see, I was often torn between my family and my wife. I was really depressed and didn't know what to do. I started finding helps from books and psychologists. I read a little of <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0762415339"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'No more Mr. Nice Guy'</a> and <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0553381407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'Toxic Parents'</a> and <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0553447718"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work'</a>.</p>

<p>My current conclusion after seeing <em>psychologists</em> and reading <em>books</em>: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I was too influenced by what my mum or my wife thinks in conflicts like those. I should focus on how I actually feel and express my opinion even that leads to arguments with wife or disappointments of mum.</p></li>
<li><p>I focus too much on making others happy. I should ask myself if I am happy. Follow what makes myself feel fulfilled and happy.</p></li>
<li><p>I was too afraid of arguments, divorce, guilt and disappointments from other people. I was always afraid to express my true feeling because I would be afraid to argue, afraid my marriage would break, afraid of the guilt I would feel to stand up to my mum, afraid of the disappointments my mum would have if I set boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p>I was too afraid to set boundaries.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Current</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I am not talking to my mum too much and I've told her I am already an adult and wished to handle my marriage on my own. (Before, she would call me often to push for a divorce). She is still upset over what happened before and has told me she won't recognise my wife as her daugher-in-law until she dies because my wife 'bullied' my sister for telling her to take Uber. </p>

<p>But I am not too afraid of the guilt messages she sends me these days such as 'I cried all night', 'I am so disappointed in you', 'you disappointed me like your father' (my parents divorced), 'I can't believe you married with someone as terrible as that'. I just choose how I react to these comments.</p>

<p>I still sent her flowers and card on her birthday. She is still my mum and I appreciated what she has done for me, but I felt she was getting way too involved with my marriage.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been a lot more expressive about what I think is right or wrong with wife and she has been adapting quite well somehow. She would say sorry to me and often we work out a mutual agreement. I feel a lot better because I was no longer afraid and I think expressing would help my wife respect me more.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>My question is.. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is it actually necessary to help them, some days, see eye to eye? How I feel about it is: If I keep doing what I am doing, my mum will respect my marriage and my wife more and gradually she will accept my marriage and my wife. Also, my wife will respect, accept my family more and feel more protected (since I am now expressing how I feel more, not afraid to stand up to my mum).</p>

<p>The psychologist said maybe at some point I need to have a conversation about this damaged relationship with my family and my wife, but the timing is very important.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is important to restore this damaged relationship, am I now doing the right thing? How would I go about it?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>UPDATES(6/02/2018):</h2>

<p>I went to South Korea to meet my wife-side's in-laws and they were really welcoming and lovely. During the trip, I finished reading <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0060507853"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Toxic In-Laws: Loving Strategies for Protecting Your Marriage</a> by Susan Forward. </p>

<p>The book has helped me tremendously to see that my mother has been making countless unreasonable requests, overstepping boundaries and attempting to control decisions in my marriage... such as protesting about where our baby should be born ( she even made remarks such as ""I won't allow my grandkid to be born in Korea, that's not right""), belittling my wife when she quitted her job to focus on studying English for few months (she made contemptuous comments about how the money come from my earning anyway when we gave her some money as birthday gift, which was not true because we already saved it together before she quitted), and disparaging my wife's personality as a cruel, disrespectful person whenever she talked about how she got married with me at the beginning without her family's permission. </p>

<p>Sadly I have allowed her to do so in the past, but no more. I also admit that the cause and continuities of their attitude toward my marriage is also my responsibilities. I did not communicate and express myself clearly where I stand in the whole mess.</p>

<p>Now I can clearly see why my wife has pushed back the way she did because I have been too meek to protect our marriage fortress. I was too afraid to upset my family and putting my family's priority above priorities for my marriage or for my wife's.</p>

<p>Now I am aware that we have rights to protect our own mental health, to express our own beliefs, feelings, opinions, convictions, values, and traditions. To state what we stand for and state what we are willing and unwilling to do.</p>

<p>Allowing yourself to be treated badly is much too high a price to pay to keep people from getting upset with you.</p>

<p>I highly recommend anyone who has in-laws problems in your marriage to read this book by Susan Forward. It has helped me immensely.</p>

"How to talk about my comfortable lifestyle without sounding like I'm bragging?","<p>Most of my friends have gone down the marriage with 2.4 kids route. Great for them but it does eat most of their time/money.</p>

<p>Not having done that, I can afford a decent house, to have a couple of holidays each year, and to spend money on luxuries.</p>

<p>Sometimes when they ask what I have been up to, I feel genuinely awkward.  I know they would do the same in my situation, so what is the problem? Believe me, I am not the bragging type.</p>

<p><strong>How can I tell them these details without sounding like I'm bragging?</strong></p>

<p>This question has got nothing to do with putting a monetary value on having children.  I am NOT saying that not having kids is better than having kids.  If I did then I wouldn't be asking this question.</p>

"What are sensible dating precautions to avoid accusations of sexual harassment?","<p>Recently, a woman accused a celebrity of sexually assaulting her. Her account has been widely criticised as not describing sexual harassment, but simply describing a bad date.</p>

<p><a href=""https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/opinion/aziz-ansari-babe-sexual-harassment.html?referer=https://www.google.co.uk/"" rel=""noreferrer"">One of the articles commentating on her account</a> links to a <a href=""https://yougov.co.uk/news/2017/11/01/sexual-harassment-how-genders-and-generations-see-/"" rel=""noreferrer"">YouGov poll asking what actions constitute sexual harassment</a>.</p>

<p>The key statistics that worry me are that 34% of women consider a comment on their looks to be always or usually sexual harassment, and that 5% consider consider a man asking them out for a drink to be sexual harassment.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that these were standard flirting techniques, and that asking someone out for a drink was a common date suggestion.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/1/16/16894722/aziz-ansari-grace-babe-me-too"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vox says</a>, “Perhaps what is especially threatening about Grace’s story is that it involves a situation in which many men can imagine themselves.”</p>

"How to tell my wife about a (possibly romantic) relationship with another woman?","<p>I am happily married male, mid-thirties, Central Europe, two nice kids. With my wife, we have a great relationship and no big issues, just the normal ones (if she only didn't burn the meal that often :) ).</p>

<p>Couple of years ago, we moved to her birth town, which led to me losing literally all of my close friends (we make visits on a yearly basis, but the closeness of our friendships dissipated). The acquired loneliness troubled me quite a lot and it was basically my only big problem at that time. As an introvert, I don't need many friends, but I need at least a few really good ones.</p>

<p>The situation changed half a year ago when I stumbled over a woman who turned out to be very ""compatible"" with me. She is also married and has kids, so it all looked utterly innocent at the beginning. My wife likes her and I like her husband and we even meet together and all works well. My wife knows we are very close friends.</p>

<p>The problem is, that while she bravely fills my social needs, we are also getting closer and closer together. When she was desperate, it was me rather than her husband who helped her out of it (her husband is not into these things much) and same situation happened the other way: she helped me tremendously while my wife didn't really care or have time at the moment. We can talk about many things which our partners dislike discussing. We have a lot in common. These facts made us really very close friends and at some point I realized I fell in love with her. It looks like she might love me too.</p>

<p>What's clear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Neither me, nor her want to change anything. We know we want to keep things and families as they are.</li>
<li>We are completely positive that there will never be anything physical between us (we both have quite traumatic experiences of being cheated on).</li>
<li>We both see our relationship as something very special and helpful and if possible, we'd like to maintain it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My question is: What's the best way to discuss this relationship with my wife without ruining what we have?</strong></p>

<p>My goal in this conversation is to get her opinion on that. Something like ""stop it now, or I am leaving"" or ""I am fine with her as long as..."" or ""it's ok, I actually also have a similar friend"".</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In some comments and answers there is this ""How can you know there will never be anything physical between you two?"" topic. I just know, that's not an issue. That was actually my mantra last couple of months: ""It kinda feels like more than just a friendship, is it still OK? Well, we'll never touch each other, so it must be OK."" But then thanks to placing my question here I realized, that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_affair"" rel=""noreferrer"">emotional affair</a> is exactly what I am going through. And they state that it can be as harmful to the marriage as the physical affair, which destroyed my ""no touching, no problem"" theory.</p>
"
"How to reply to ""Drive/Travel Safe""?","<p>Oftentimes when leaving work, or the last time I see someone before I go on a trip, someone will say ""drive safe!"" or something similar.  On one hand, this feels more or less like well-wishing to me (e.g. ""I hope you have a safe drive."") so my instinct is to respond with ""Thanks!"".  However, grammatically, it feels more like a request or command (e.g. ""When you drive, please do so safely."").  If I interpret it that way I'm more inclined to say something like ""Will do!"".</p>

<p>I've replied both ways in both situations and sometimes feel like my response wasn't what the person was expecting.  But since it's often said at the end of the conversation there isn't much of a chance to address it without probably being even more awkward.  I'm probably just reading to much into subtleties, but some people have said it pretty seriously (particularly people roughly my parents age) which may be a part of why I'm over-thinking it.</p>

<p>So, which of these responses feels more natural? Is it possible some people (e.g. parents) mean it as a request to be responsible, while others mean it more as a pleasantry?</p>

"How do you communicate efficiently with someone who is stuttering?","<p>I recently got a project at work where I need to regularly talk to a person who is suffering from very bad <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttering"" rel=""noreferrer"">stuttering</a>. He is very competent and professional at his job, but talking with him is a bit tedious, because he frequently has issues forming a complete sentence. </p>

<p>What are the general do's and dont's when talking to someone who is stuttering? For example, when he has trouble completing a sentence but I think I know what he wants to say, how should I act? Should I wait patiently? Should I complete the sentence for him? Should I interrupt him with my reply? What is the general etiquette for dealing with this very common condition?</p>

<p>My goal is to communicate efficiently with him but without hurting his feelings. But I also don't have a close relation to him, so I think it would be impolite to directly address his condition and ask for his preferences.</p>

"Friend is having a hard time, but resists emotional support","<p>My friend has been experiencing some health issues lately which might be quite serious. However, he doesn't want me to inquire, tells me to forget about it, and my best guess is he doesn't want pity for his situation. At the same time, he sounds so stressed that I find it hard to do nothing. Part of me wants to respect his wishes because he is an adult who is not required to share everything with me, and maybe talking about this will increase his stress. The other part feels that maybe leaving him alone right now is being irresponsible.</p>

<p>We are good friends, who both recently moved, so he lives in a different city to me. We usually communicate via messaging. The move was recent so I at least have not had time to build up a good support network in my new environment.</p>

<p>I have some options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Give him space, let him know he can reach out to me whenever he is ready</li>
<li>Force contact (if so, how?)

<ul>
<li>Talk to him about other things (via messaging? ask to Skype?)</li>
<li>Talk to him about what is happening with him</li>
<li>Visit him</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>(I left the options up there as some answers already refer to them, but am no longer asking for which option to take)</p>

<p>My goal is to keep our relationship going, so that he has someone to talk to should he want to. But how can I communicate that I both respect him and do not pity him, and that I care deeply about his wellbeing? I want to acknowledge the situation, rather than pretend nothing happened and just send trifling messages.</p>

"How to ask if people are gambling for ""real money"" with leaving possibility not to join?","<p>I don't normally gamble. On the rare occasion, if asked by a group of friends, I may consider it if it's not for much money. (for example it's possible everyone is given chips for free and return them at the end so no real money is involved). How do I ask how much money, if any, people are planning on involving? In theory games like poker could be done free or for hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p>Here is the backstory. I live in a large shared house with a lot of international people. We have trouble communicating as English is the only common language but many don't feel comfortable speaking it. (Also there are some culture differences, like I noticed someone was resting his feet on the table which is different than I'm used to).</p>

<p>Someone in the house suggested we get together to do something fun to get to know each other. I think this is a great idea. Someone else suggested poker. I'm not really comfortable gambling in the first place, let alone with roommates who don't normally speak the same language.</p>

<p>I would like to avoid the awkward situation where it looks like I'm trying to avoid them as people would probably know I'm home but not joining. How can this be done? On the other hand, if no money is involved, I may as well join. </p>

"In non-violent communication, what to do when ""I feel..."" statements fail?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication"" rel=""noreferrer"">Non-Violent Communication</a> seems to be a common piece of advice when it comes to conflict resolution. So far as I understand, NVC promotes the use of ""I-statements"": saying things like,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I feel X when you Y</p>
</blockquote>

<p>rather than,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You made me X!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds great in theory: you only talk about things you can know for sure - how you feel - and the other person can't argue because they're <em>your</em> feelings.</p>

<p><strong>What if that doesn't work?</strong></p>

<p>I mean situations like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the other person ""sees through"" the I-statement and interprets it as the second anyways</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: I felt scared to tell you [serious, personal thing]<br>
  B: You think I'm a judgmental person?!</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>the other person says you shouldn't feel that way</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: I feel uncomfortable being around my ex<br>
  B: That's ridiculous, you're dating someone else so you shouldn't care</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>the other person dismisses your feelings</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A: I felt really hurt when you did that<br>
  B: Why should everyone cater to your feelings?</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>(Examples are paraphrased from actual conversations where we were attempting to reach an understanding or resolve a conflict - for instance, the second conversation occurred when I tried to decline an invitation to a party. They are meant to illustrate situations where I was attempting to follow principles of NVC, but the other person responded with invalidation or hostility, rather than empathy and collaboration, which is what I was hoping for.)</p>

<p>Written out, it seems easy to rebut the statements logically, but keep in mind these are conversations about topics with strong emotions involved. Seeing as though humans are not logical machines, it makes sense that not everyone will respond as you hope to ""I feel"" statements. I know simply phrasing things a certain way is not a magic bullet, but as I am trying to improve my conflict resolution skills it's helpful to have rules to keep myself in line. My hope is that by forcing myself to stick to these guidelines, I will eventually internalize the philosophy.</p>

<p>So, I would like to know how non-violent communication can be used to defuse such responses. Most posts I see simply advise on the initial phrasing but don't discuss following up to a negative response.</p>

<p><strong>What is the next step in this communication strategy when ""I feel"" statements fail, if any?</strong></p>

<p>(Please note, I am interested in the ""theory"" of non-violent communication more than solutions to these particular examples, although I can add more context if necessary.)</p>

"How to tactfully ask if someone is from the same ethno-religious group as I am?","<p>I am an ethnic and religious member of a certain ethno-religious group. (You can probably guess which one, but I thought the question might be broad enough to apply to other ethnic/religious groups too). It's also not just specific to either religion or ethnicity - since someone I might ask could be a member of just one part, both, or neither.</p>

<p>There are not very many other members of this group where I live, and I'm often happy to meet others so we can talk about relevant stuff that most of my other friends don't really 'get'.</p>

<p>As a student I would often just ask someone, if I had an inkling based on their name or something they'd said, ""Are you []ish?"". Of the maybe ten times I asked this, the answer was always 'no', and it became a bit awkward and I would blurt out ""Oh sorry, I am, I just ask everyone that"" (partly so they wouldn't think I was asking for anti-[]ic reasons). </p>

<p>I've recently started working at a medium-sized company, and I've just realised there's a guy here with a quintessentially []-ish name. I'd love to find out if he's a part of the group, for work and other purposes (e.g. asking how HR/our bosses responded if he asked for time off on religious holidays, potentially going to services together, seeing if he can link me up with some other local []s, exchange holiday greetings, potentially chat in a relevant language, etc).</p>

"How do I tell my roommate that I feel treated unfairly by their SO?","<p>I have a roommate I allowed to sublet with me. I have allowed their SO to move in with them. Currently I'm not receiving rent from the roommate, and that's an entirely different problem of my own creation, because I had them leave their previous job for an opportunity we ended up getting left hanging on. But I felt the lack of rent paying was important to bring up to explain the circumstances here. </p>

<p>I have been covering the rent, and I told them to not stress out over it. I did not tell them it was okay to not pay rent, but rather to not stress if they were short. We have been waiting on roommate to get work from the person we invested in. SO has gotten 3 jobs and quit every one of them in less than a week during this time. They never tell me when they quit a job, only when SO gets a new one. </p>

<p>SO gets envious of my employees, because I pay other people to do work that SO feels capable of doing, but never actually does. I've given SO chances to work for me in the past to earn cash, and jobs have been unfinished. This has lead to tension in the household, where I never see roommate unless its with his SO. I feel taken advantage of by the SO, and not the roommate. </p>

<p>How do I talk to the roommate about this? I have anxiety when I think about handling the situation. I'm unhappy that SO has left multiple jobs without making enough money to pay me back. SO has told me in the past when I asked for some rent money, that I told them not to worry about it. This is where I feel SO is being manipulative. </p>

<p>SO has admitted to me in the past that they will cause a scene to get what they want in situations. I feel that they are doing this to me. My anxiety is causing me to not know how to handle this discussion. </p>

<p>I have only about a month or two more of this before I have to ask you guys about kicking them out while retaining friendship. But for now, how do I discuss this problem with roommate without SO freaking out? When I have tried to handle things in the past, it has resulted in SO throwing a tantrum and not acting like an adult. This triggers my anxiety. </p>

<li>I have two tenants, we shall call them ""roommate"" and ""SO""</li>
<li>Roommate is unemployed due to a fault of both of ours, so I am covering rent until the job opportunity we pursued together pulls through for them</li>
<li>Roommate is kind and respective, and I allowed their SO to move in</li>
<li>SO started off respectful, but is now rude, demanding, and makes me uncomfortable in my own home</li>
<li>SO is also unemployed, and when I gave SO opportunities to work for me in the past, SO never completed their work </li>
<li>I would like to approach roommate and find a way to settle the issue (be it by reinstating rent, asking SO to move out, having SO fix their attitude issues, or another resolution) before I damage our friendship beyond repair</li>

"How do I approach telling someone that they are not invited to an event that I am having?","<p>I'm part of a tabletop RPG (roleplaying game) group, and I also happen to be the host, the organizer and the game master (read: the one who runs the game) of our weekly games.</p>

<p>I got asked to help organizing some RPG event for a local comics and games fair, and one of the ideas was to bring my local RPG group to the event, running one of my games there so that people can take a look.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of my players is so used to utter profanities¹ and to label every enemy female character ""the bi#@£"" or ""the wh&amp;$%"" that I can't trust him to behave.</p>

<p>I have already contacted the other players in a separate chat, explaining them that I still didn't ask the guy because if nobody could come I didn't want to tell anything to the guy. Let's suppose they can.</p>

<p><strong>What's the best strategy to politely tell him that it's best if he skips the game, without him holding a grudge?</strong></p>

<p>It is possible that he might not be able to be there because he's busy. Is it more effective to inquire if he's busy first?</p>

<p>Is it more effective if I tell him in private, or together with the official announce to the rest of the group?</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Someone in real life suggested me to let him partecipate, with the caveat that he must stop playing and go home if he misbehaves. I think I might do this, even if it means a chance of moving the resulting drama to the event. Still, I'd like to know what's the better approach before this point.</p>

<hr>

<p>1- The Italian language has this special kind of blasphemous profanity that is way harsher (and therefore stigmatised) than your usual profanities.<br>
The local culture is weirdly OK with such blasphemies being used in informal contexts, expecially by people with a low upbringing: cursing this way is considered liberating by many, many old people utter a profanity at the end of every subclause just because, youngsters do it to feel like rebellious grown-ups, raging people shout 'em at the top of their lungs to appear more intimidating, and even milder people sometimes use blasphemy to express sudden pain or high levels of frustration, as an expletive.<br>
Weird, I know, but I wanted to state very clearly that this guy is not some sort of madman because he curses.<br>
His problem is that he is so engrossed in this culture that he has problems behaving normally.<br>
He's not alone in the area, but of course this doesn't excuse him from behaving at formal events.</p>

<li>""Why do you need to delay the visit?"" - after I make my request</li>
<li>""The tidyness of the property is unimportant, we are looking for damage""</li>
<li>""What have you got to hide?""</li>
</ol>

<p>I would most likely become flustered and stutter when encountering the above whilst on the phone, having a script, or answers to these, prepared would help me.</p>

<p><strong>Result</strong>
I managed to contact them via email and said the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spoke to REDACTED this morning in regards to postponing the property visit on the 14th until the week after (20th – 24th). She advised I contact you via email to discuss this.</p>
  
  <p>I am requesting this because I am often away from REDACTED for extended periods and rarely have time to tidy. I would like the opportunity to prepare the apartment for your viewing.</p>

<p>It worked I successfully rescheduled.</p>

"How to answer a technical question without sounding patronizing","<p><strong>Context :</strong></p>

<p>My girlfriend (let's call her V) and I, are programmers, and sometimes we ask each other questions when we believe the other may have an answer.</p>

<p>A few times, she’s told me that I sounded patronizing in my answer (which might be the case, but I don't see how or why).</p>

<p>We usually never put punctuations at the end of our sentence, and when we do, it is usually a sign that an argument will start.</p>

<p>The exchange usually happens like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>V: How do you do A by B?<br>
  Me: I don't know, I don't have the ecosystem on my computer to test it, but I believe the answer is C, let me check</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Delay of 5 minutes or so.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Ok the answer does seem to be C, according to this reference, this should work<br>
  V: How? Can you write it?<br>
  Me: (code solving A by B with C)<br>
  V: Ok thanks.<br>
  Me: Sorry for the delay, I was making sure I had the reference for it<br>
  V: Then you are very smart.<br>
  Me: Why are you upset?<br>
  V: Because you said like every dumb person would google that</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[argument continues]</em></p>

<p>I believe something in the way I express myself in that particular interaction was definitely wrong, when I was saying that I was looking for reference.</p>

<p>However this is the way I usually interact with colleagues for technical questions and when I answer on Stack Overflow I make sure I have the right reference to back my answer.</p>

<p>I know we are talking about interactions with my girlfriend, but on technical issues I was assuming we were interacting like we would in a work fashion. Maybe this is my mistake.</p>

<p>So, my question: <strong>how can I answer such a question without sounding like a patronizing guy, that has all the information?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p><em>Thank you very much for your inputs, there are a lot of good recommendations in the answers to the question. There was a clear difference between the tone of my exchange with her here and our general interactions (but no part lacking in this dialogue).</em></p>

<p><em>Today we exchanged again about some programming topic and I used a tone we have more in our usual interactions and offered one solution that she looked up by herself and she found another solution.
The general gist was to give what I honestly think is the answer and trust her research, helping further if needed.</em></p>

"How (not?) to talk with moms","<p>One type of folks I am really, really annoyed with are the mothers talking about their first kids in their first years after birth.  They virtually cannot talk about <strong><em>anything</em></strong> except their children.  </p>

<p>After having observed this dreadful pattern for many unrelated moms for several years, I am wondering whether it is possible for them to speak normally and not about when their child learned to recognize the family members, to say the first word, to go to the john itself, or to start playing with the other kids. Such crazy talks of these moms are as automatic as machine guns; the moms are unstoppable and uninterruptible, physically unable to finish under half an hour. (My cousine is a prime example: she talks and I silently listen.) If you gather several moms in one room, you are guaranteed to keep them busy for the whole day unless they, well, need to take care of their kids. </p>

<p>In other words, is it possible to get anything unrelated to their child from them upon asking a simple ""Hey Nancy! How are you doing?"" or is it better not to ask them anything at all?</p>

<p><strong>My interpersonal goal is to improve my communication skills in this matter by getting out of a conversation I dislike or changing the topic quickly.</strong></p>

"How to improve a relationship with my mother?","<p>My mother often yells: “I’m a horrible mother. After everything I’ve done for you this is what I get. I don’t know why I am being punished. I should’ve enjoyed my activities instead of taking you to different classes, just like other mums did. Now their kids are better, happier and smarter.”</p>

<p>She’s upset almost everyday about very small things. If I leave hair on the comb and not clean it - it will get her very upset. My opinions are not the same as her and it upsets her greatly. I make many mistakes, but I wish she realized that I really try hard. When she’s doing something I try asking her if she needs some help but she’ll usually say she has so much work she doesn’t know where to start.</p>

<p>I’m a 21 year old student. I’m self financing and studying in a different country for 3 years already. I love my family so much and I’ve decided to spend the whole summer with them, but almost every week there will be a big fight that leaves me crying. I don’t know how to handle this. Maybe I’m not showing enough of love? I really, really love her.</p>

<p>I told her once how we never have any other conversations, other than her parenting me. She said it’s pointless when she sees I don’t know how to take care of myself.</p>

<p>Can someone please help me? Whatever it is that I do, she will get upset and I am out of ideas. I am thinking of leaving, not because of all of the yelling per se, but rather because I am writing my bachelor thesis and on top of that I have other activities I need to work on, all of this stressing me out and leaving me with little time to work on.</p>

<p>All of this is very painful for me and perhaps my character flaws are the reason for this, so feel free to ask any questions you might think help answer this, I will provide additional information.</p>

<p>All advice on how to fix a relationship with my mother is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

"How to deal with illogical girlfriend?","<p>This is a serious problem. I don't know how to fix it honestly, but in a relationship of almost 2 years it is quite infuriating.</p>

<p>Usually during time spent with my girlfriend, she is a very logical person, when it comes to things that we agree on, but that is only on the basis that she knows <strong><em>we agree on them</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The problem is that whenever she states something that I don't agree with or does something that I don't agree with, I cannot discuss what is wrong with said premise or wrongdoing without being told I am 'attacking her', or that I am 'starting an argument'. Think of basically someone who says something wrong you hang around with, but have to step on eggshells whenever you think something opposite.</p>

<p>For example, we were watching an analysis on a speech by Donald Trump, and she was pointing out errors in his presentation: black and white fallacies, loaded questions, slippery slope arguments, appeal to emotion etc.<br> Shortly after we get into a conversation about something, and she states that mixed Asians on average are becoming super tall, probably an average of 6ft. (She is Viet/White 5'10 and had a tall father, so she has a bias.)</p>

<p>I reply</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wow really? I know a lot of mixed Asians but they were pretty short.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She then replies by using a No True Scottsman, and basically says 'They must not have really been mixed. I would know; I'm Asian'. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well they probably had tall parents. On average Asians are not that tall, and the world average isn't even 6ft idk babe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from there she basically says her anecdote is more reliable and says 'case closed, no arguing about it' and gives me an attitude. This continues through basically anything that has views contrary to hers.</p>

<p>The worse part is if I try to talk to her about it, or talk to her about something she's done wrong that she wouldn't want me to do. I will get hit with emotional appeals, and it's like she throws any type of logic or reasoning out the window whenever it suits not taking accountability for something. <strong>To her, either you are always wrong, or there is always a middle ground that you must abide by.</strong></p>

<p>How do you guys suppose I fix this? Or talk about this is another way? I'm honestly at a loss right now, and this is really destroying the relationship.</p>

"How to establish boundaries in a friendship when the friend does not understand, while preserving mutual friend group","<p><strong>Background:</strong> I am a guy who has traveled quite a bit across the U.S. and made a lot of friends due to an organization that I am a part of (not work related). Last year I went to visit some of these friends in another state and they brought along a few people I had not met yet, and we got to know each other over the course of a weekend. We exchanged contact info and parted ways. </p>

<p>One of the people that I had met needed some help with navigating a few things in our organization that she was learning how to do, and I had previous experience doing them so I offered to help. We began to communicate frequently and I gave her the advice she needed. She is an interesting person and we chatted about a lot of other things via texting/email as well. <strong>Note:</strong> <em>We do not see each other regularly due to the distance that is separating us</em></p>

<p>Pretty quickly though, she started to message me a ton and some of the conversations got way too personal for my liking. I asked her to back off, but she would only leave it for a week or two before trying to get too personal again. She also started to tell me a lot of very personal things about her life that I was not interested to learn because we were just casual friends.</p>

<p>Recently I felt very bombarded with how much communication that we were having because it was pretty much nonstop and she wanted me to provide her a lot of emotional support, other advice, and for me to tell her all about my life and past etc... I felt smothered and bombarded and also I just wanted to be casual friends. I had learned from some others that she has some issues with respecting people's personal boundaries, and I had begun to feel that in my own life when she started asking me very personal questions (past relationships, my battle with depression, about when I would next start a relationship, and questioning a lot of my personal choices).</p>

<p>I wanted to create some distance in the friendship so I started to drop hints that progressively became more and more blunt but she still didn't get it. Unfortunately, they didn't translate very well to her, and she continued to bombard me further. Eventually I just straight up told her to please stop bombarding me with messages etc... Even after telling her that, she continues to message me, and is quite upset with me.</p>

<p>Naturally she is very upset by this and doesn't understand why I am telling her to back off. Originally I tried to ask her nicely, but she just didn't get what I was telling her so I had to be pretty harsh.</p>

<p>She also recently told a close friend of mine (a girl) who I was considering asking out on a date (she liked me and I liked her etc...) that she could never date somebody like me blah blah blah. Basically it ruined that friendship beyond repair, and I do not want it to happen again with my other friends. I have since ceased communication with her and no longer respond to any of her messages.</p>

<p>We have a large mutual friend pool due to both being in this organization, and I am concerned that this may happen again. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> My biggest concern through this is that I will lose the mutual friends that we share, since she is close to them and spends a lot of time with them and I rarely see them. I am very close to these mutual friends and have known many of them for 10+ years. I do not want to lose those friends because of this situation, but I feel like it could be a big possibility. </p>

<p><strong>How can I preserve those friendships while still ending this one? Is there a way to avoid the collateral that is inevitable in the near future?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Also, how can I explain this situation to these friends without it sounding like I am bashing this girl?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I also just thought of this as well, since I likely will have to interact with her in the future due to our organization, <strong>What is the most professional way to interact in the future?</strong> (This may be a topic for another post)</p>

<p>I said I wasn't interested,  but he wouldn't take ""no"" for an answer, though I told him no at least ten times. He also asked me for my phone number. Not wanting to give him a fake one I said ""not interested,  thanks"" another time and escaped to the swimming pool. The guy followed me there.</p>

"Get to meet someone from the internet without being pushy about it?","<p>So I met this girl on Jodel (sort of like social media, but it's anonymous and you only can connect with people in your area) a few weeks ago and we have been chatting nonstop since then on Kik (messaging app, also anonymous, only usernames no real names). I'm male.</p>

<p>We really have so much in common, she shares my humor, etc. I really feel a connection there. We met under circumstances I'd describe as ""getting to know new people in this area"", but after a while the conversations got really flirty and I had to lie if I said there wouldn't be any romantic interest involved. I guess weither there could be more or we just stay really good friends depends on if we feel attracted to each other when we meet or something.</p>

<p>It's not the first time I met people on Jodel, and to this day I can still count some of them as really close friends. Since I share such common interests with this girl I wanted to exchange phone numbers and/or meet up in person. </p>

<p>She declined both, which made me really confused at first. She then explained that she has met someone from Jodel before and it was a really creepy guy. Given that, I can understand why she does not want to meet up quite yet, however I'd like to bring the topic of meeting up or exchanging phone numbers in the future again in order to get to know her better and make a stronger connection. With this Kik messanger, I always feel like there is a high chance of people just ghosting each other after a while.</p>

<p>Also I'm sure she's not acting or catfishing me. We ""talked"" via voice messages and exchanged some pictures. Sure, it's no guarantee that she actually is interested in me too or if it just concludes in a friendship. But atleast she's real and shares a lot of interests and opinions.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How can I bring this up in the future</strong> (not right know again, because I already asked her a few days ago, maybe in 2-3 weeks or so, I don't know) <strong>without it being to pushy?</strong> I'd really enjoy getting to know her better and in person. However I don't want to be seen as one more of those creepy dudes she already is scared of. Maybe I could explain to her my reasoning behind asking again?</p>

"How to tell a friend that his indifference is hurting my feelings?","<p>I'm not a native speaker so I apologize in advance for my bad English. I know the question may seem opinion based but I'm not asking for advice of what to do to fix my relationship, I'm just asking how can I phrase my concerns correctly to avoid being seen as ""pointing a finger"" at my friend.</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>There's a boy (let's call him Bill), whom I've been friend with for several years (5 at least), we've always been interested in each other but nothing serious has ever happened between us, because we are in relationships with different persons.</p>

<p>Bill is the closest thing I've ever had to a best friend, we can talk about anything and we've achieved a level of confidence that I never thought I was capable of feeling with another human being.</p>

<p>The problem lies in the fact that Bill's feelings for me have grown stronger with time, and I think we're both guilty because we're used to jokingly flirt with each other or pretend we're a couple when we hangout with other friends. He used to send me messages late at night confessing his feelings and telling me that our situation made him super sad on a daily basis, about 3 - 5 times a week I would receive messages like this.</p>

<p><strong>The Trigger</strong> (It all started getting weird afterwards)</p>

<p>Three days ago, our friend group had a reunion and we ended in Bill's house (Bill, another friend - Sam - and me), we were having a great time until Sam got out of the room we were hanging out in. He was absent for about 15 minutes, in this time we started throwing some pillows at each other and joking, everything was fine until a sad expression started showing up on his face, long story short he ended up crying on my shoulder, again confessing his feelings, I just reassured him that I only see him as a friend and reminded him that he is in a relationship with a girl who loves him and blablabla. </p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>We usually talk everyday via voice chat on a server, two days ago he entered the server and seemed okay but a little serious, he then started making passive aggressive comments about me, I'm a very emotional person so I felt really bad and started crying, he didn't seem to notice this, so he kept going on with the bad comments, I couldn't handle it so I left the server.</p>

<p>Sam talked to Bill about what happened and Bill ended up sending a message saying he was sorry and that he wasn't mad at me or anything. Bill is a really unstable person (emotionally) so I just assumed he had had a bad day, but he apologized so I thought everything was fine.</p>

<p>But yesterday he completely ignored me while on a voice chat with other friends and hasn't talked to me since the incident (we used to talk for hours everyday).</p>

<p>It really bothers me because I really appreciate our friendship and it would be horrible if it ends up destroyed by a dumb argument.</p>

<p>I've tried contacting him via text messages but he doesn't even open the messages. I'm really sensitive about my friends so his indifference is really REALLY hurting me. And what hurts me the most is that I've always been open with him and told him several times that if our friendship was bothering him because of the underlying feelings he has for me I could give him space, or stop talking to him for a while until he gets over me. And he has always refused to stop talking.</p>

<p><strong>The question</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How can I properly phrase a short message to let him know that the<br>
situation is affecting me?</li>
<li>Or, how could I address the issue via a voice call, avoiding ""pointing a 
finger"" at him for his behaviour?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My goal</strong></p>

<p>My main goal is to avoid ruining the relationship, and clarify the situation to find a solution.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>We're both 20 years old. 
Friends for more than 5 years.
It's the FIRST time we have a problem (we get along pretty well).
I've asked friends in common but it seems like he hasn't talked about this to them.</p>

"How to deal with my boyfriend’s mother without affecting my relationship with him?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I have been dating my boyfriend for 5 years now and even if everything is perfect with him and I couldn’t be happier, <strong>it is not the same with his family and especially with his mother,</strong> who does things that are unacceptable to me. </p>

<p>I will enumerate some of the things she does to me, so you can get an idea of what she is like. Please keep in mind that it's just to give you context, <strong>I am not asking for help</strong> on how to deal with every of these situations: </p>

<ul>
<li>She usually calls my boyfriend <strong>to tell him how badly his brother behaves</strong>, e.g. ""Your brother did <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>"".</li>
<li>She plays the role of the victim, e.g if you don’t answer her because you're busy or whatever, she’d say <strong>you don’t care about her</strong> or that <strong>you don’t love her enough</strong>.</li>
<li><p><strong>She spends all day screaming</strong> for things like </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am so alone!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one cares about me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and similar. This makes me think she lacks attention.</p></li>
<li><p>If my boyfriend prefers to spend the weekend with me rather than going home, she tells him that she's his mother and that <strong>he seems to love me more</strong>.</p></li>
<li>When my boyfriend comes to visit me, <strong>she calls him every day</strong>. I could understand that she worries about him, but I think it's a bit too much, for my parents wouldn't be that overprotective towards me.</li>
<li>My boyfriend has a dog that scares me sometimes. Last summer, it started barking at me when I entered the house. Whereas my BF's dad suggested to put it in the kitchen until I got relaxed, <strong>his mother wouldn't let that happen and let the dog continue barking at me</strong> without even holding it, so I just ran and locked myself away until I wasn't scared anymore. I feel like she could have respected my fear and hold him while smelling me.</li>
<li>She got angry because the 21st of December I hadn't wished her a Happy Christmas -I was planning to do so on Christmas' Day. Due to her anger, I did it that same day (21st) but via a text message and not a call, she got angry too. Please note in my country (which is also theirs), it’s ok to do these things by sending a WhatsApp. </li>
<li><p>My boyfriend's elder brother usually plays bad taste “jokes”. For example, he would drink my milkshake -the one I prepared for myself- and after telling him it was mine and that he had already drank his he would say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who bought the ingredients? My family, so I can drink it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was not true because I did buy them, but what really annoyed me was nor their mother nor my BF didn't say a word and indeed <strong>his mother always laughs at his jokes while it's obvious that those are not funny to me.</strong>  </p></li>
<li><p>While I was living far away from my boyfriend’s town (+600km), his mother invited me for his birthday and when I asked the day she said “today” <strong>when she perfectly knew I would not be able to come on time</strong> due to the distance.</p></li>
<li><p>While watching a TV show <strong>she would come and start talking to us</strong> without caring we were watching something even if we had headphones so we wouldn't hear her screaming. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>She checked my underwear</strong> just to find out if I was using thongs and after she realized I didn't she said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She is not a <em>dirty</em> girl</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>These are only a few of the things she's done to me over the past years. Unfortunately, it has reached a point where I have even thought of breaking up with my boyfriend, for his mother and elder brother do those things to me.</p>

<h2>What I've tried so far</h2>

<p>I have talked with my boyfriend about these issues many times. He sometimes recognizes that <strong>what his mother is doing to me is not okay</strong> (especially when I get mad/sad), but he'd soon forget about it and tell me that I'm exaggerating everything, <strong>making me feel like he doesn't support me.</strong> </p>

<p>My relationship with his mother right now is nearly nonexistent (it has been almost 2 years since the last time I've seen her); we just talk on WhatsApp on particular dates (e.g. Christmas and birthdays). The problem is that my boyfriend insists that I come to visit his family, even knowing I am not comfortable with the situation. It's been a while since these things have begun bothering me, but I have now decided to give his mother and elder brother a new chance, as I know my boyfriend suffers a lot from the situation. </p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Until now, I have never spoken of this problem with either of them, but since my boyfriend has never supported me in front of his family (he told me he asked them to stop, but they didn't), <strong>I now want to let them know that what they're doing to me is not okay.</strong></p>

<p>Where I need help is in how to deal with the mother in case she shows some of the behaviors I have already mentioned above and make her stop them, as my boyfriend has already tried with no visible result.  Also, I would like to get a way to make my boyfriend realize that the way his mother is treating me hurts me. I am plenty aware that is his mother and he love her, I don’t have any trouble with that, I also love mine, but I would like him to understand that if things don’t change I am not obliged to bear with his mother as I am in a relationship with him, not with his family. Because sometimes he also makes his mother play the role of victim saying it's me the one who is never going to visit them or because when I do I have a <em>bad</em> face.</p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<p>@Fr1Krazy: His brother -and only brother- is 30 years old.</p>

<p>@Mindwin: We're both Spanish.</p>

<p>@Graham: We're 24 years old.</p>

<p>@Pharap: His father is at home too, he's ok. He just doesn't take a part in, he doesn't defend me but he doesn't support his wife (my BF's mother) neither.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How do I deal with his mother if she starts playing the victim role with me again, or if she doesn't treat me with the minimum of respect everyone deserves?</p>

<p>Or, in other words: </p>

<p>How can I make my boyfriend's mother stop making me uncomfortable without damaging my relationship?</p>

"How can I ask (or determine) if someone on the phone is human without offending them?","<p>I recently saw a doctor about a minor medical problem. This is the first time I saw this doctor . After the appointment I asked my doctor a follow-up question via my insurance company's website. I got a call back from the doctor but during the entire call I was distracted because all of the doctor's remarks sounded so dull and artificial. Also, he didn't seem to remember anything about me and just kept telling me to make a follow-up appointment with my doctor. I thought to myself that I might have been talking to an AI. That didn't seem too far-fetched to me with the recent advances in AI and doctors' busy schedules. During the entire call I was trying to determine if he was real and almost blurted out ""are you a real person??"". </p>

<p>In hindsight, I think I was talking to a real person and he just has to deal with so many patients that he starts to talk like that. But I have started getting automated telemarketing calls that try to trick me into thinking a real person is talking to me. </p>

"So, my boss is teaching a class ""about transgenders""","<p>So, my boss is teaching a class ""about transgenders""...</p>

<p>My boss mentioned at a staff meeting today that she would be teaching a class ""about transgenders"" at an upcoming industry conference. To be clear, it wasn't like a passing statement between two people that I overheard. It was a part of her statement to the entire staff about the upcoming conference that she would be attending.</p>

<p>The word ""transgenders"" struck me as a little tone deaf, almost as if she said that she would be teaching a class ""about blacks""</p>

<p>I know she means well, but I strongly suspect that she's out of her element.</p>

<p>I guess I'm wondering if I should offer to help. I'm by no means an expert, I'm not trans myself, but it seems like I may have some personal experience that she could benefit from. I identify as <em>queer</em>, I've dated trans people, and I try to be active in the movement for equality. This doesn't mean I know everything there is to know, but I know what I've experienced and heard from my friends and partners.</p>

<p>At least I feel that I should ask her if she knows any trans people personally that she could run her teaching materials by, before she presents them to a room full of people... Many minority groups are pushing for a sort of ""nothing about us without us"" stance and I think that could apply here.</p>

<p>Am I overreacting?</p>

<p>Should I offer to help?</p>

<p>To clarify...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've worked with my boss for a little over 6 years.</p></li>
<li><p>We don't really spend time together outside of working hours, but I did attend one of these industry conferences with her a few years ago. </p></li>
<li><p>We've had a pretty good working relationship for as long as I've known her, she tends to listen to and respect my point of view on most things that I've had to approach her about.</p></li>
<li><p>To the best of my knowledge the class will be a sort of sensitivity training, helping people in our industry work with and serve trans people. </p></li>
<li><p>The only real reason that I suspect that she's out of her element is the use of the word ""transgenders""</p></li>
<li><p>I have no reason to believe that she is ""virtue signaling"" she doesn't tend to be outspoken about politics, race, gender, sexuality, or other such issues. </p>

<ul>
<li>(Though personally I find the implication that the only reason someone would speak to these issues is to serve their own ego a little offensive and I think it demonstrates a worldview that is generally wrong. If this is your opinion you're welcome to it, but I'm not interested in answers that focus on this misguided assumption.)</li>

"How do I help my girlfriend get out of this dangerous situation with her parents?","<p>Hello Interpersonal Stack Exchange,</p>

<p>About two weeks ago I posted the question <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/17222/how-do-i-help-my-girlfriend-defend-herself-against-manipulative-parents"">""How do I help my girlfriend defend herself against manipulative parents?""</a>. I recommend reading that one first as it contains some preliminary info that ties into this post.</p>

<p>I believe that it's necessary to start a new question because I did leave out some info on my first post and the situation has also gotten <strong><em>much worse</em></strong>.</p>

<p>PS: I know it's quite the lengthy post but all the information is necessary and I've tried my best to shorten it down as much as possible.</p>

<p>PPS: It could be said that maybe the internet isn't the best place to look for help in a situation like this, but just know I'm trying other sources of help as well and my hope with this post is for it to spread so we can get as much help as possible.</p>

<h1>Background - Pt. 2 [Trigger Warning]</h1>

<p>In my first post there were a few things that I failed to mention that I am mentioning now since they are of more relevance in this question.</p>

<p>The first being <strong>a history of sexual abuse</strong>.</p>

<p>In her lifetime there has been multiple occurrences of sexual abuse/molestation ranging from when she was six to just recently. <br/><br/></p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>There are two main occasions I want to talk about here:</h3>
  
  <p><strong>First Occasion</strong></p>
  
  <p>She was six or seven at a friends house and there was a period of time where her friend was using the bathroom and the dad tried to rape her. What makes this case difficult is that the man that did this was a well known judge in her home country.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Second Occasion</strong></p>
  
  <p>A boy in her school has been trying (sometimes successful) to molest her during a class that they shared.  That went on for the last school year and I hope it won't happen again (I don't think they share classes anymore).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br/>The second being <strong>a history of self-harm</strong>.</p>

<p>I believe this started mostly because of the sexual abuse history and how it affected her but I also believe it's also partly due to the derogatory remarks and additional emotional abuse she receives from her parents.<br/><br/></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>In the past she has caused harmed herself by <em>burning or cutting herself</em> but no longer does these things.<br/></li>
  <li>The last time she cut herself was on her thighs around 3 months ago. It was another time where her parents were giving her a really hard time. She showed me and we did a lot of talking went on about why she does it and how she can stop and I still try to help her with it.<br/></li>
  <li>When her parents found out about it their reaction was not helpful. Her mom told her she was crazy and asked her if she was planning on cutting her siblings too.  Her dad got extremely upset and asked her if she was also doing drugs while proceeding to seize all of her makeup and rummage through her personal belongings on a mad witch hunt for drugs.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h1><br/><strong>Some Context</strong></h1>

<p>Around the second month we were dating, I got into vaping for various stupid reasons. I used to bring it sometimes when I would come over and would use it when we would walk around the lake near her house.
<br/><br/></p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>There are a couple points I want to bring up about this:</h3>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>I was into vaping for about three weeks before I decided that I hated it more than I liked it and eventually planned to sell the vape pen.</p></li>
  <li><p>I used nicotine free e-liquid.</p></li>
  <li><p>She had tried a puff once and didn't like it at all.</p></li>
  <li><p>I accidentally left it at her house the last time I used it. She found it, told me, and was going to give it back to me the next weekend when I came over. However we kept forgetting and one week I just told her to get rid of it, but she apparently didn't since she felt bad and knew I was going to sell it. We forgot about it up until this point (it was hidden in one of her bags).</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h1><br/>The Problem(s)</h1>

<p>So today the plan was for me to come over and hang out with her for a few hours since it's the last day of her summer. Unfortunately, her mom somehow found the vape pen we had forgotten about so long ago and freaked out while proceeding to tell her father and uncle. This situation is <strong><em>very bad</em></strong>, especially with the drug talk from earlier.</p>

<p>So basically, we ended up not hanging out and she has been asking me for help and updating me up until now.
<br/><br/></p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Let me tell you how they've retaliated...</h3>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>They've emptied her bank account and <em>transferred all funds to her mother</em> (as far as I know all future direct deposits will also be taken from her not long after they drop).</p></li>
  <li><p>They will take all of her personal belongings at the end of tonight and I am not sure when or if she'll get them back. (She might get her phone back)</p></li>
  <li><p>Her dad told her–today–she had three strikes but that she's already used two of them.  This and apparently the first is from when she cut her leg (his reasoning behind this strike is he thinks she was just wanting attention, which is a pretty f'ed up mindset if you ask me).  If she strikes out again, apparently they will then move somewhere else (in or out of country). Honestly her parents hate it here and will look for any excuse to move out of the country.</p></li>
  <li><p>They told her that no matter what she will have to attend college in her home country. She doesn't want this. She has signed up for multiple scholarship programs and wants to attend college and start her life here.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><br/>Best case scenario, her family is staying in the country for two more years. She has told me she doesn't want to leave with them and has told me she would like to move in with me when her family leaves.  She'll be 19 at the time so there shouldn't really be any issues with that.</p>

<h1>My Question</h1>

<p>How do we properly inform her parents that she 1) will not be leaving with them, 2) will not be attending college in her home country, and 3) will be moving in with me when they leave?*</p>

<p>*I have a bad feeling things will not go well when this subject is brought up and am wondering if legal help will be needed since, although she will be 18+, I have a feeling that they will still try to assert their dominance over her.</p>

<h1>Additional Notes</h1>

<p>Let me also clarify that her parents know about both instances of sexual abuse and have done almost nothing about them.</p>

<p>I've tried following community guidelines to my best ability, but I'm sure I could have messed up somewhere.  Feel free to let me know and I'd be happy to fix!</p>

"How to ask a neighbor if I can replace our shared fence?","<p>I recently moved into an older home with fences between my home and my neighbor's home. Based the way the fences are constructed, I believe that they are owned by the neighbors and not myself. One of the fences is in <em>bad</em> shape - it is rotted and ready to fall down in a year or two, and the part of the fence facing the street and not my house has completely fallen over and is resting on the neighbor's lawn.</p>

<p>I would like to get this fence replaced. However, I am not sure how to approach the neighbor because I have never communicated with this neighbor before and I am not generally comfortable with cold introductions. Further, based on the state of the fence and yard in general the neighbor either does not care much about the outside of their house or does not have much money to spend on upkeep (but I do not actually know either of these to be fact).</p>

<p>Since I have no prior contact with the neighbor and am unsure about their commitment to a good fence or financial ability to contribute to its upkeep, I am not sure how to go about asking about getting it replaced. My proposed options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>(Introduce myself) ""It looks like our shared fence is going to fall over in a year or so. Would you be interested in splitting the costs of replacing the fence?""</li>
<li>(Introduce myself) ""It looks like our shared fence is going to fall over in a year or so. Would it be OK if I have it replaced?"" (I would be comfortable covering the costs of replacing the entire fence myself.)</li>
</ul>

<p>My concern with the first approach is that I am essentially putting the neighbor on the spot asking for money, and possibly making them feel bad if they do not want to replace the fence. My concern with the second approach is that it may come across as acting superior if I suggest to pay for the fence myself. Which way is most likely to result in a) not offending the neighbor and b) a new fence?</p>

"How can I ask a stranger who I'd be living with if he believes in weird things?","<p>I'm a master student (20+) that for the last 6 months has been renting a room in an older woman's (50+) house, that is we're living in the same house (just two of us). Unfortunately, I didn't have a possibility to check the house and room myself before I moved in (I only saw the pictures she made) so our only way of communication was email. She seemed a nice woman with a colourful personality (she's a yoga teacher) but as the time has progressed it turned out that she's a person that I don't quite get along with. As it turned out she believes:</p>

<ul>
<li>everything is a floating energy (we can walk through the walls)</li>
<li>we're neither born nor die, we're floating energy (reincarnation?)</li>
<li>the weather and terrorist attacks are controlled by masons (Illuminati)</li>
</ul>

<p>and a lot of other weird things, moreover she's super anxious. She's been divorced for a long time and living alone since then, and I have an irresistible feeling that she feels alone (although she has a son in my age). Whenever there is a possibility she starts to talk a lot, even when I'm not in the mood. During some conversations, she was unintentionally (at least I hope so) trying to talk me into believing the same things as she does. It was absurd as I'm not only an agnostic that doesn't believe in anything but science but also a physics bachelor so in effect, I started to spend as much time as possible at the university and friends' flats and basically avoid her. I'm a calm, industrious person that usually spend most of the time alone. </p>

<p>Right now my agreement is reaching its end and I'm looking for a new flat. Among the offers, there is one that is affordable (woman again) but its description bugs me a little bit:</p>

<ul>
<li>she's 30+, willing to share her house with someone who likes to spend time together a little bit</li>
<li>it seems that she's a children therapist working with animals</li>
<li>she mentions that there's a yoga room in her house (whenever I see or read yoga I cringe)</li>
</ul>

<p>The housing market is really tight so I can't be picky that much. Again, I can't check the room myself (only email) but now I have friends whom I can ask to do it for me. Assuming that she will respond to my message, how could I gently ask her if she believes the same things as my current house owner and if yes, inform her that I don't believe those things and I'm not willing to talk/listen about it at all?</p>

"How can I politely ask my date to not use her phone unnecessarily during dinner, without ruining the night out?","<p>When I am on a dinner date with a girl (generally in her early twenties), how can I politely tell her that I am annoyed and feel disrespected when she unnecessarily uses her phone to send text messages to her friends?  These are generally early dates - often first dates though some are second, third, or fourth. None of these girls are in exclusive relationships with me. So, we are not super close.</p>

<p>(My focus is on frequent, <em>unnecessary</em> texting.  I have been on dates with girls who have had to respond to work-related matters on emails with their phones, and this doesn't bother me at all.)</p>

<p>When this happens, I just sit there quietly and wonder to myself, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... wow ... is she that bored on this date?<br>
  ... that's kind of rude ... does she do this on her other dates, too?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I put in considerable effort to plan these dates: I look for restaurants and study their menus, I make reservations, I go to the gym all week before the date, I get a decent haircut, and I try to dress nicely.  </p>

<p>I have always paid for dates and never asked a girl to split the bill with me, even if they had spent much of the date texting other people.</p>

<p>(Money is not the issue; I pick up the tab as one way to demonstrate that I try and be a good date.)</p>

<p>Most recently, I was on a date with someone, and it happened yet again:  </p>

<p>This girl not only texted frequently but also spotted someone in the restaurant who was supposedly ""famous on YouTube"" -- and so she spent part of our date trying to snap a photo of him with her phone, and also tried to get his attention, to say hello.  I feel I have no self-respect and am letting someone waste my time.</p>

<p>Instead of sitting there quietly and feeling insulted, I want to know how I can ask my date to not use her phone unnecessarily, without ruining any good vibes we have during the date.  This seems like a pretty tough thing to do, because I've never actually tried being assertive in these situations, and I'm afraid I'll just act out badly and say something like: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know what, put your [expletive] phone away, or else I'm leaving!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though, I think that doing this would of course ruin any chances of us going out again.</p>

"How should I handle disagreeing with my sisters cash cow milking?","<p>Inspired by this question: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2699/how-to-avoid-being-seen-as-a-cash-cow-by-my-family"">How to avoid being seen as a cash cow by my family?</a>, I wanted to ask how my own situation should be handled.</p>

<p>We are not rich, but also not poor. My sister has two little children, has less money, but still is no way poor. My grandma has only one son, my father, of whom we are the only children, and a lot of savings. She has a really great heart and always gives a little bit money when we're visiting, but she wants to keep her savings, because shes extremely afraid of getting incapable to live on her own. By german law, maids etc.get paid by her savings - and when used up it gets paid by her child, my father. This is extremely expensive. She wants to avoid that at all costs, therefore looking carefully for her money.  </p>

<p>I really respect my grandma for this way of thinking. And I think I'm still getting enough of that pie she has saved by all those little givings.</p>

<p>But not so my sister. Whenever we have some family party she starts to complain about financial problems, which, imo, she does not have. Always somethings going wrong for her, it seems. One time it's a broken car, next time the laundry machine, next time whatever. Oh and because of this and that we really can't go to that holiday the children were so happy of.</p>

<p>She never complains like this, when my grandma's not near. She tells about all those broken things, yes, but never ever mentions she's in financial problems because of it. She, too, spends lot of imo senseless things, like tattoos, ever new fishes for the pond (which will die soon enough) or fitness studio, which my grandma would never spend her savings for. But still, when she hears about the children being not able to go to that holiday they were so happy of, she gives her money. It's not that it's riches she's getting. 200 € here, 300 € there. Plus the regular givings for each visit.</p>

<p>Normally I would tell my grandma not to be stupid. But my grandma has always been fair for the two of us. That means, no matter what, I'm getting the exact same amount of money, though I never asked for it. So I take profit of maybe 2000-3000 € per year just for being my sister's sister. Only the money for a new car I don't get - she wants to give it to me as soon as I buy a new one, too. I don't know how much money this will be, as my sister broke so many cars by buying always old, but rather expensive cars and all those gifts to her have summed up. My grandma even urges me to finally buy a new car so she can give me that sum, too. I will certainly not do that, as long as my current car is still able to crawl.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we visit my grandma, my husband jokes before arriving, now we'll see how bad the financial situation of your sister currently is - just on the amount of money we will get.</p>

<p>I feel pretty bad taking all that money I think I have no right on. So how would you proceed? Should I talk to them? Would you react in ""public"" on such a family happening or rather look for some privacy to talk? Should I tell my sister to stop? What would you tell her? Would you tell my grandma?</p>

<p>Edit:
As proposed in the comments, I edited my question. You are right, I should not ask for opinions - people will either way tell me.</p>

<p>And another edit to clarify the role of my father in this little game of my sister's... I know my grandma and my father really well. They would never start to talk about such things to me. But as far as I can interpret their silent communications when my sister starts complaining, is that my father thinks the same way I do and already told her. The way she looks at my father in such situations is like ""but how should I tell her?"". This is only interpretation, but what I know for sure is that sometimes my father jumps in, preventing my grandma from paying by paying himself. Same point in fairness - he's a second cash cow I'm milking unintentionally.</p>

<p>And no, grandma is definitely not dement. I really know her well. For an old woman of 78 she could not be any fitter.</p>

<p>By the way, also my grandpa is still living. In such situations he simply closes his eyes pretending to sleep - seemingly avoiding any discussions with my grandma.</p>

<p>So, in short, everyone is looking away, pretending not to notice to avoid any discussions.</p>

"How do I get my mother to use the bathroom?","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>My living situation is as follows: I live in a two-story house with my mother and no one else. Our Bedrooms are upstairs, together with a small bathroom without a toilet. The toilet is downstairs. We live in the middle class of a first world country. I'm a 16-year-old girl.</p>

<p>My mom has to use the bathroom almost every night, but she is, in her own words ""too lazy to go downstairs"". So she goes to the upstairs bathroom, empties the bowl with our showering supplies and reliefs herself in it. When I get up in the morning to take a shower she is still sleeping and the entire place will smell of the bowl. It is a four square meter bathroom so the bowl is always forced up into my personal space.</p>

<p>She sometimes forgets to remove it, so when I come home from school and go to the bathroom to eg. wash my hands, the bowl will stand there in all of its at this point 12-hour old glory. When she cleans it, she just empties the bowl, rinses some water through it and puts our showering supplies back in.</p>

<p>I told her (not very compassionately) that I find it disgusting and unhygienic and that we need to find another way to solve this. She said that, as mentioned, she's too lazy to go downstairs and I shouldn't be such a squeamish baby and just bring it down and pour it away myself.</p>

<p>Eventually, she bought a bowl with a lid, but guess what - She says she's too lazy to put the lid on cause she just wants to go to bed again after she relieved herself.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>How can I get her to use the bathroom? Or how do I not have to share a bathroom with a bowl of loo? This probably includes the consecutive question ""How do I convince a person to do something if they deem everything inconvenient and inconvenience as enough reason to not change? eg. I can't convince her to use the bathtub and rinse it away cause it's not so convenient.</p>

"How do I decline conversation in my native language?","<p>I often meet people who do not natively speak my language (German) but are learning it and would love to practice it by speaking German to me.</p>

<p><strong>General Situation</strong></p>

<p>The problem is that I talk in a slight dialect (Norddeutsch), speak very fast and often kind of unclear. Even other Germans occasionally have a hard time understanding me. I usually say just that - ""I'm sorry, but [insert what I just said]"". They usually suggest to try it anyways, I agree and as soon as I realize they don't understand my normal German, I switch to a forcibly slow, clear and accent free speech - often still with no success. </p>

<p>This is incredibly excruciating for me, not at least because I'm insecure about the whole not being understood thing in general. (Especially my dad treats it very rudely, I might tell him and his girlfriend a story and when I'm finished he'd just look at <em>her</em> and ask ""Didya get any of that?"" which makes me very self-conscious about this, but that's a whole different story.)</p>

<p>When I then again suggest conversing in English, the other person usually responds with ""Oh no, it's fine, I can do it!"" and I'm just thinking ""Yeah but <em>I</em> can't"".</p>

<p><strong>Cases</strong></p>

<p>In one extreme case, I had an online friend who was learning German and he got so angry with me always giving up speaking my native language that it contributed to the end of the friendship. Apparently, even if I say that the problem is on my side and my insecurities it's still taken in offence.</p>

<p>The other times I have these situations with people, besides online, would be while doing sports. I do Parkour, where often international people come to check it out - they might be refugees that are just learning German or transfer students from literally anywhere. Besides conversation content, it usually goes as described above.</p>

<p>How do I politely tell someone that I do not want to practice my native language with them?</p>

"How can I make my girlfriend not to get fixated on false facts and listen for reasons?","<p>My girlfriend has a tendency of getting fixated on things she thinks true, when she won't listen to any reasoning and starts arguing with me. We are in our late twenties and we have been together for 8 months. She is a foreign student in my Central European country, we both work as interns. Neither mine nor her first language is English, but it's the only common language we share. I'd say our language skills are nothing near excellent, but better than average in our countries, e.g. we rarely have to pause in live speech to find the appropriate expression.</p>

<p>We planned going on a short holiday. A few days after reserving a room online I found out we have to pay for the accomodation in Euro, instead of *local currency*. As she has a Euro bank account, I asked her if we could pay from that. I never indicated I want her to pay for our stay without compensating her in *local currency* or by paying for dinner, etc. We always share payments, except for transportation. I never asked her to pay for the fuel when I drive her somewhere. However I'm fine with that, since my pay is better than hers. The recent online conversation leading to the conflict went as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Hey babe, I guess we have to pay for our room in Euro. Can we use your account for that?</p>
  
  <p>Her: I wanna use that money when I travel around Europe with my family. Can't we pay in *local currency*? Let me check this out.</p>
  
  <p>Me: I don't know, I'll have to ask them.</p>
  
  <p>Her: Why did you choose such a place to stay? Cancel it!</p>
  
  <p>Me: I did choose it because this was the only one which was rated like above 6/10 and still not a hotel room for 500 Euro/night in *local currency*.<sup>1</sup></p>
  
  <p>Her: What? It's so expensive! I could buy many things for that! Just forget about it, and cancel the reservation.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Please stop saying this, our room costs 60 Euro/night.</p>
  
  <p>Her: I can't pay 500 Euro for one night. I won't go there, it's so expensive. Cancel it.</p>
  
  <p>Me: What are you talking about?</p>
  
  <p>Her: Do you wanna piss me off? What if they charge me more?<sup>2</sup></p>
  
  <p>Me: Why would they do that? Read again, it costs 60 Euros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note #1: Her sudden turn to accusing me in her second answer isn't exaggeration, it literally happened like this.</p>

<p>Note #2: The exact wording of the conversation couldn't be understood as ""our room costs 500 Euros"" at all, reading it back, it's still clear I was referring to other possible choices. I repeated the fact multiple times (even when she was attacking me), after the quoted part from our chat.</p>

<hr>

<p>It went on for a while, she gave me more and more aggressive responses. I asked her if she drank something, since she has a history with alcohol, and this made her go wild. She deliberately misinterpreted my choice of words ""free room"" as if I meant <em>free of charge</em>, not <em>vacant</em> or <em>available</em>. She insulted me for being stupid, crazy, said I just wanted to argue with her, told me I constantly accuse her of doing something wrong.<sup>3</sup> I asked her to read back, and copied print screens of our conversation but she refused to read them, or listen to the fact, that our room wouldn't cost 500 Euro/night.</p>

<p>My question is <strong>how can I de-escalate the situation if it happens again?</strong> This seems to happen quite often. Telling her the facts doesn't seem to impact her perception of the situation, like it's already fixed forever in her mind. Asking her if she is drunk is obviously not a way to do that, but I did that after some arguing, after I became angry too. Thought about simply not responding to her for an hour or so, but I just can't let it go when someone doesn't understand my explanation or disregards my reasoning.</p>

<p>IIRC this thing happened like 4 times in our relationship. Considering myself quite rational it affects me badly. After the initial refusal, I admit if I made a mistake and apologize. She has a different personality, she'd rather try to explain and defend her position, but then laugh at herself realizing her argument is incredible, this happened multiple times. I wouldn't mind her not saying, only realizing she was wrong, as long as she doesn't cling to false statements so strong. We have been together for 8 months. I don't feel this thing happens like each day, but every 2 months seems a bit too often.</p>

<p>Typically after such fights we don't speak for some short time, it seems like time solves the problems... I usually try to talk about the fight, but occasionally she shuts it down with a ""you just look for arguments"" sentence. Sometimes she knows she was wrong, sometimes she doesn't. If she doesn't, she can't take any criticism at all. Other than this thing I like her and our relationship.</p>

<p>I don't remember having any conflict right before this argument.</p>

"How do I make people stop seeing me as a child?","<p>English is not my mother tongue so please be indulgent.</p>

<p>In my family, we are pretty close to each other. I mean, when I say ""family"", it includes aunts, uncles and cousins. With my big sister, we grew up with my cousins and one of our aunts. They were all born in the mid and late 1980s. And here I come, born in 1993.</p>

<p>As I am the youngest and the shiest, I was quite often left aside and couldn't build any relationship with them. Plus, I had and still have a rather difficult relationship with my sister.</p>

<p>When I was 20, the situation didn't change. They never shared anything with me. They never asked me to go out with them. It's not like they are much older than me. Even when they are talking, when I'm here, no one talks to me. I know I should try to fit in, but whenever I try to give my opinion, it's like I shouldn't, because ""I don't know what I'm talking about."" They don't even listen to what I have to say. </p>

<p>Even now, no one thinks I can think for myself and make my own decisions because everyone sees me as a child who is influenced by everything and everyone. </p>

<p>I have lived by myself and had a job for about two years. And most of them don't. I am not saying that having or not having a job justifies whether you are mature or not. I am just saying that even if I proved that I'm responsible, they do not see me as an adult.</p>

<p>My relationship with my mother is pretty much the same. She still sees me as her little baby and tries to make me do whatever she wants me to do. </p>

<p>She has a lot of personal problems. And whenever I try to help her, she doesn't consider my advice. But if her friend tells her the exact same thing I did, she thinks about it and says she’s right. It is rather frustrating.</p>

<p>I shouldn't care about what they think of me, but I have a pretty low self-esteem, and their rejection doesn't help. In family gatherings, I am always put aside. It has become distressing for me to see them.</p>

<p><strong>How can I make them stop seeing me as a child?</strong></p>

<p>Should I just ignore the situation, since I cannot make them change their behavior?</p>

<p>Edit 1 : I forgot to mention that we are a Turkish family who lives in France. My mother came here when she was 4.</p>

<p>Edit 2 : I don't know how to say this without sounding rude and arrogant but almost everyone in my family is narrow-minded and never question themselves. For instance, I have been a vegetarian for about two years and they still insult me, saying it's useless and that I am just following a trend. They don't listen to the reasons why I am a vegetarian and discredit me everytime we eat. I am not forcing them to do anything, or annoying them about it. But they keep coming at me. I know it's not the subject, but it was just an example of how intolerant they are. </p>

<p>Edit 3 : This topic is not just about my family members seeing me as a child. It is also about them rejecting me for not thinking like them and imposing their way of life on me.</p>

"Asking someone to use their native language without being rude","<p>Sometimes, I find myself in a conversation with people who can't speak English (or some other language) with standard pronunciation. Of course, not everyone has good speaking skills to begin with, and I believe it's more of an issue with my hearing than everything else. Moreover, I don't want to discourage anyone from learning a new language by making remarks about their skills. </p>

<p>However, when I have a decent understanding of the interlocutor's native language, I feel like the conversation evolves more naturally if they use it.</p>

<p>For instance, I've just helped a French tourist get around my hometown. While I couldn't understand her strongly accented English, the conversation went smoothly as soon as she started speaking French to me. I can't speak French, so I just answered her questions in English, making it a bilingual conversation. Due to the circumstances - we were at the subway, plus she's a stranger I'm unlikely to ever see again -, I was able to say ""I'm sorry, but I cannot understand your English, can we try French, please?"", but this sounds like a rude way to start talking to people I must see on a daily basis. </p>

<p>In another example, one of my best friends' wife is Peruvian and I struggle to have a talk with her in any language other than Spanish. Having been living here for several years, she has a decent vocabulary and most people get along with her just fine (in fact, she's lovely). Yet, whenever we're talking using the local language, I seem to miss about 20% of what she's saying and I don't have the courage to tell her.</p>

<p><strong>How can I politely get someone to talk to me in an understandable manner, without making them feel like it's their fault somehow?</strong></p>

<p>I'm ok with little white lies, as long as it doesn't discourage them from keeping on trying. I do feel like this is more of an issue with me than the other person, but saying this out loud sounds like I'm just trying to call them out politely.</p>

"How can I get through to my close-minded elderly relatives?","<p>My InLaws are very predisposed towards dismissing new ideas, I find it very difficult to discuss new ideas or suggestions with them.</p>

<p>A suggestion is usually met with stubbornness, refusal, sometimes outright hostility &amp; scorn, without the idea being properly considered. The subject becomes more and more controversial &amp; hostile until we drop it. </p>

<p>The refusal is also usually backed up by spurious justifications made up on the spot, which are then stuck to rigidly the longer the conversation goes on for (they are often ridiculous and patently untrue).</p>

<p>An example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: I was thinking that it might be simpler for you to order groceries
  online rather than trekking into town this week, considering [recent
  injury]. Or we could do the run for you, what do you think?</p>
  
  <p><strong>InLaws</strong>: Absolutely not, nope, no thanks, it's fine, we'll do it, we'll manage,
  you don't know what to get, you have to get in before 11AM to get the good veg because otherwise they throw them out [not true]</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: I understand we don't normally do it but I'm sure I could write a list
  of what you need to get and I'll be happy to be there before 11AM if that's important</p>
  
  <p><strong>InLaws</strong>: Nope, <strong>no</strong> <strong>thank</strong> <strong>you</strong>, we'll manage, it needs done properly, you won't get there in time with the traffic, your car won't do it ,
   no [again, not true, also silly]</p>
  
  <p>(this time both of them joining in for the ""no"" parts)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This pattern is used every time an idea that comes from the outside is considered, and it isn't limited to accepting help. How could I introduce a new idea to people who are pre-disposed towards dismissing it, in a way that gets them to properly consider what I've said? </p>

"How to tell whether someone would like to have my painting, without imposing a gift on them?","<p>I paint as a hobby. Made few hi-bye friends at office because of this. I would be happy to give my painting to someone who truly appreciates it from the bottom of their heart.</p>

<p>Usually when a painting is done, it stays in a box in a closet at home. It is 14 by 11 inches in a paper frame (called matting) of 20 by 16 inches.</p>

<p>If it's relevant, the people who express most appreciation are from India and have been in USA for 10 to 15 years (they are usually shy and indirect, especially older generation), hence I added the India tag.</p>

<h2>1st scenario</h2>

<p>I finished painting with religious overtones and emailed to a group of people at work. One lady (roughly in 50s) asked me if the painting is here in the office. Does this necessarily mean she would love to keep the painting? I would be happy to give it to her. On the other hand, I don't want to unnecessarily burden someone with an extra possession if they really don't want it.</p>

<h2>2nd scenario</h2>

<p>Another lady (roughly 30s) asked what do I do with painting after I have finished them. Another time, this same lady showed me an old religious photo. I may consider painting this in future. Would it be a good idea to give it to her?</p>

<p>In other words, <strong>how do I tell whether someone would like to have my finished painting, without imposing a gift on them?</strong> I wish I could use painting as a way of making friends.</p>

She is the cleverest student in our school, and I'm not so clever as her, but usually get high marks, so both are well known. Both have many same interests, especially maths, and when we train for maths contest, we study together. This is a very close friendship, calling almost every time, being close to each other, and many other things. </p>

<p>This upset her, and her eyes became teary. The reason she did what she did was because she was choosing a clean one for me. I didn't know this, and couldn't say sorry after.</p>

"When is it appropriate and when is it inappropriate for a neurotypical (NT) to refer to a person with Asperger's as an Aspie?","<p>People with Asperger's on this site refer to themselves as Aspies.  Is this a term that should be used only by people with Asperger's? Or can neurotypicals (NTs, a term I learned only a few days ago) use it too, and if so, are there conditions under which it is OK and other conditions under which it is not OK?</p>

<p>I'm not in any way implying that there is something wrong with Asperger's or with the term Aspie.  But because of the <strong>ie</strong> ending, it seems overly familiar unless one knows the person fairly well.  For example, if I knew someone named <em>Katherine</em>, I would not call her <em>Katie</em> unless/until she told me to. </p>

"How to deal politely with people asking about your job but unable to understand it?","<p>I work as a researcher in a very abstract field of Mathematics (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.2178/jsl/1208359058"" rel=""noreferrer"">this kind of thing</a>) It is very pure Mathematics, without any concrete applications. When I meet somebody for the first time, they often ask me about my job and they want to know the details: What are you working right now? OK, you just wrote a paper, but about what? What theorem did you prove?</p>

<p>Since the abstractness of my field, and since those people usually have at most a vague memory of High School math, the only sincere answer would be: I cannot explain it to you because you would have to know a bunch of stuff you do not know, and I cannot teach you those stuff either, because it would takes years.</p>

"How to quickly greet and identify visitors at work?","<p>I work in a smaller startup (about 30 people). We rent an office space in an affluent neighborhood. The office has a very small (3ft x 3ft) ""atrium"" between the outer door and our office door. We do not share the atrium with anyone else; it is exclusively used to enter our office. </p>

<p>The outer door is not locked, the inner one is. A key pass is required to enter, or there's a buzzer set up for guests to request access. </p>

<p>I am a junior member of the company and have taken it upon myself to answer the door (my coworkers/bosses are quite happy with this arrangement as it means they do not need to be disturbed). I get the mail, accept deliveries, and unfortunately also have to navigate what visitors to let in and which to turn away.</p>

<p><strong>The TL;DR of my question is:</strong> What can I <strong>politely</strong> say to people who show up at the door to get them to promptly state their purpose so that I can tell whether to greet them warmly and invite them in (for potential sponsors, friends of employees, interviewees, etc), or refuse entry (cold callers / door-to-door salesmen, etc)?</p>

<h3>More Details:</h3>

<p>I must open the door to be able to talk to visitors. The office door is alarmed and can only be held open for up to 90 seconds before the alarm is triggered. This cuts my time to screen visitors down into a very tight window. </p>

<p>Due to the open concept nature of our office letting them in the door gives them easy access to all of the office (there is a very wide, very open ""hallway"" into the main room, with lots of glass-fronted conference rooms and offices lining it. Aka zero privacy). I don't feel comfortable letting people in prior to establishing motive because if they're a salesman it makes it a lot harder to get rid of them.</p>

<p>We're on a commercial road and our name implies that we're somewhat medically inclined. Because of these factors, we get a LOT of people coming by trying to sell us products or services. It falls on me, to quickly explain that we're not interested and politely turn them away. </p>

<p>We also get a lot of foot traffic from potential sponsors, interviewees, friends of employees and other people it is in my best interests to be unfailingly polite and welcoming to. However, I am often not aware they are dropping by and can't verify their legitimacy until they name-drop someone in the company that they're here to visit. </p>

<p>I often end up with a dialog like the below;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Hello! (polite smile)</p>
  
  <p>Them: Good afternoon, how are you today? </p>
  
  <p>Me: Fine thanks, and you?</p>
  
  <p>Them: Great, thank you. (If I'm lucky they might also add ""My name is Bob Smith"" like that should mean something)</p>
  
  <p>(sometimes salesmen will quickly launch into a speech here but more often than not the visitor will attempt to step forward into the doorframe, expecting me to let them in. I stand my ground and it's off-putting for both parties)</p>
  
  <p>Me: ... What can I do for you?</p>
  
  <p>Them: I'm here to meet with X. (or) I'm with Y company selling Z.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I can let them in / turn them away. etc. </p>

<p>I was always taught not to give my name out because it encourages solicitors, but I also find that a lot of the interviewees try to be chummy and ask for names so I can't use that as a barometer, and then my first interaction with a potential new employee is me giving out my name so reluctantly it's like I'm giving away my firstborn.</p>

<p>I basically have a 90-second window to a) exchange polite greetings and b) figure out why they're there, all while being polite-but-firm to potential solicitors without coming across as rude to guests.</p>

<p>I'm not a professional assistant and I have zero experience as a greeter. I imagine there's a simpler/more effective way to run this dialog which is why I'm reaching out here.</p>

"Need help in understanding girlfriend's angry behaviour ​","<p>I have been with my girlfriend for 7 weeks now. We are both 31. During that time she has gotten really angry with me 4-5 times over things that I said. When she gets angry she says that our relationship can't work out because our natures are incompatible. Everytime I feel that what I had said wasn't so offensive that she should break up with me. But she gets sad and stressed out for about a day each time. I really don't like to see her sad.</p>

<p>The last time she got angry over these things.</p>

<ol>
<li>She is not working and doesn't have any money. I have lent her about 1.5 times my monthly salary so that she could repay her debts. And I got her a bunch of other crap. So one day she has remarked a few times that she has spent a lot of my money. I can't hide that I wanna say something but I am not saying it. She prods. I said, ""You are like other expensive girlfriends, just that my expenses are no fun"". She says, ""Why not fun?"". I said, ""It's not like I'm spending on things like trips, etc. I am paying for your day to day needs."". She later told me she was offended by this because I was ""making her feel obligated or indebted"" (there's a phrase for that in our native language) to me.</li>
<li>I was saying how unlucky I have been in life and sharing an anecdote. She said, ""Maybe you met a girl like me because you are unlucky."" I did not comment.
She told me later that she was offended by that. I didn't ask why.</li>
<li>She was humming something. I said, ""Why are you weeping?"". I was just teasing her. But she got offended and eventually brought up points 1 &amp; 2 as well. She said I was mean and not compassionate.</li>
</ol>

<p>I didn't say any of these things in an angry or mocking tone.
I take lending money casually and I have helped my friends in their time of need several times. I don't keep asking her to pay me back or expect any favours in return. I do not really take the luck thing seriously. It's just something I find interesting to talk about. When I sing crap songs (with wrong and made up lyrics) she says she doesn't like it but I don't get offended by that and keep singing my song.</p>

<p>I can't imagine how people can get offended by these things. I would be fine if she had said the same things to me.
I hate to hurt her feelings like this because I love her and I think she loves me too. (I guess that's why she keeps making up.)</p>

<p>But I don't know how to deal with her constant threats of breaking up.</p>

<p>Is there something really wrong with my behavior? Or are we really not meant for each other?

<p>I'm a single 20-something man living in a major city who is actively dating.  I met a woman about 5-6 months ago on a dating website, let's call her Alice.  Alice and I hit things off well based on our mutual interest in early modern music and modern Japanese authors.  We went on two dates to shows and had a great time each evening. However, soon we mutually decided we didn't want to pursue a relationship, but wanted to still be friends and continue to go to music shows and talks about books together. So we did; maybe seeing each other about once a month, and texting a handful of times a week to work to pick out shows, work out logistics, and occasionally share work/life updates in a way that's typical of friends.</p>

<p><strong><em>Problem:</em></strong></p>

<p>Just recently Alice got a boyfriend, call him John. Last time I saw her,  she expressed concern to me that she might no longer be able to be my friend because of the circumstances in which we met and what that would cause John to think. Nevertheless, she was willing to keep contact as a friend for now. Normally when I'm in this situation I'll try to arrange a double date or something similar so I can meet John and demonstrate I'm not a threat to him, and just generally bring things into the open.  However Alice seemed less than thrilled at that idea. This made me a little uncomfortable that our friendship might be somehow secret, and poking at this further she explained it's just embarrassing to tell people, not exclusively, but especially her boyfriend, how we met despite the fact that we are just friends now.</p>

<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong></p>

Tom and my son both enjoy playing card and board games and sometimes get together at our local library to play.</p>

<p>Tom has come over to our house a few times and each time he smells worse than the time before.  6 months ago he smelled mildly unpleasant and I just assumed he needed a shower.  Yesterday he came over and he smelled VERY strongly of old cat urine.  The weather was nice so we opened all the windows and managed.</p>

<p>My wife and I stopped by Tom's house about 5 months ago.  We saw a few cats and the house smelled somewhat of cat urine.  I guess that the house must be getting progressively worse over time.</p>

"A group of friends did something wrong, how to tell them without exaggerating, but still defending my position?","<p>Context:</p>

<p>A group of friends did something to me that was, to say the least, inconsiderate: We had an appointment in a certain place,  let's call it A. </p>

<p>I live in another city (this is a rather new situation, been here for one month and a half), so I told them I was going to get there at a certain hour. They were going to meet earlier. Then,  when they were together, they decided to go to another place,  let's call it B. They told me this through text message even when I had told them I was not going to be reading them because I would be driving (in fact I was driving to A). They were also aware that I was not reading it because the app allows you to see it. </p>

<p>Not only that, but place B was much closer to the original city I was at, so I passed by oblivious to the fact they were there,  went almost to A, and then saw the message. I refused to go back to B and went home, showing one of them,  at least, discomfort. </p>

<p>Now this friend, which is also the one who had organised the original plan with me, sent me two messages in a humorous tone trying to downplay it. Then asked me whether I was ""angry"". I then answered ""I am not angry"",  trying to imply I was rather disappointed instead of angry, but then he interpreted it as if my anger had then disappeared after two days and everything was okay again. </p>

<p>Now I can understand what happened could have happened to anyone, they were simply inconsiderate to my situation. But this pissed me off. </p>

<p>What is the best way to deal with this situation? Expressing them what I felt, also considering the fact that I had declined another plan to go with them, and the fact that I am passing through a hard personal moment. </p>

<p>Also please do note that what, in fact, makes me angry, is my friend asking me repeteadly ""Are you angry?"", ""Are you still angry?"" as if this was my own problem I he had nothing to do with it. Even if this is my best friend from the six, I would like to tell all of them that they are,  at least, responsible for not warning me, as they had all read my message. One of them even told me on the phone, Why don't you read the messages? </p>

<hr>

<p>Since I cannot post comments, I answer here:</p>

<p>Have any of them apologised for the incident? Was the decision to move to Location B on a whim, or was there something more urgent that kept them from going to A</p>

<p><em>A couple of behaviors in question for illustration purposes:</em>   </p>

<p>When we are in public places together, Bob likes to comment on people he finds ""ugly"" or ""weird"". At other times, he takes pictures of strangers dressed ""like shit"" and share them on our messaging group to make fun of them. Most of his targets look like they either have mental issues or don't have enough money for ""good"" clothes.<br>
I usually react mildly, saying basic stuff like ""Not cool"" or changing the conversation.</p>

<p>Once he described a news story he read online about a ""gauchiasse"" (a wordplay on ""left"", as in political left, and ""diarrhea"") woman who was raped by undocumented immigrants, he seemed to find the whole thing hilarious.<br>
I awkwardly scolded him on the spot, but we haven't had any serious conversation about it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other small examples that can be summarized to: Bob has always been snarky, but over the years his behaviour has become more and more petty and mean, and he became very focused on material things and appearances.    </p>

<p>I travel on the bus <em>a lot</em>. Twice a day, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year (minus a few weeks holidays) and I <strong>love</strong> it. It's a great time to unwind, to people watch, to lose yourself in thought for half an hour during that beautiful trip through the limbo of home life and work life where you can do simply nothing but wait to arrive at your destination.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting parts I've found (<sub>yes, I find mundane stuff like social etiquette on buses interesting</sub>) is dealing with busy buses, or more precisely the people on busy buses. Not crowded to the point people are standing or struggling to find space, but busy enough that there are no ideal* seats available.</p>

<p>Sometimes they don't even have to be <em>that</em> busy; if everyone on the bus is sitting in an ideal seat and has a bag with them this problem can present itself when the bus isn't even half full (or half empty, I'm not sure what the optimistic outlook on bus capacity is).</p>

<p>*An ideal seat is one that has the window available and doesn't require you to climb over someone to get to it.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>Regardless of capacity, but assuming there are no other ideal seats available, but there are plenty of seats that are not occupied by patrons but are instead occupied by their bags, what is the optimal way of ensuring they move their bag so that you can sit down and relax for the duration of the journey, preferably without any awkward 'he made me move my bag / I had to make them move their bag' tension between you?</p>

<hr>

<h1>Attempts So Far</h1>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, I have in fact made several attempts to ensure other passengers' belongs will not impede my derrière's voyage to its temporary resting place, with mixed results. When I say mixed results, every single time they have been successful in getting the item of dispute out of my bottom's path, but it is the resultant fellow passenger's reactions that have been mixed. Here they are listed in what I have felt has been the most positive reaction to the most negative (judged by the resultant body language, verbal response and eye contact for the remainder of the trip):</p>

<ol>
<li>Asking the person 'Can you move your bag please?'</li>
<li>Asking the person 'Do you mind if <strong>I</strong> move your bag?'</li>
<li>Telling the person 'Move your bag.'</li>
<li>Sitting down on the remaining seat that is left where the person's bag is.</li>
<li>Moving the person's bag without any other interaction with the person. (As in picking it up and placing it on their feet, I've only done this once, I don't recommend it.)</li>
</ol>

<p>So as you can tell, I'm a bit of a connoisseur in bag moving, enjoying variety and keeping it fresh, but I'm still really interested to know what IPS's thoughts on the matter are.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Clarifying Points</h1>

<ul>
<li>I think bag size matters here, if someone is lugging a huge suitcase around with them on the bus which, for any reason (even because they simply don't want to) isn't in the baggage area, then I'd rather stand than have them move it. They've got enough to deal with, I'll take the hit on this one. So let's assume a bag around small rucksack size unless you want to explicitly address different bag sizes in your answer.</li>
<li><strong>My ticket does not entitle me to a seat.</strong> An important point on this one. As a living, breathing human being I feel I am more entitled to a seat than your nan's groceries but this doesn't mean that I am. </li>
<li>People on the bus can be any age, any gender, any race, any shape, any size, anything, the only thing they share in common is a habit of placing their bag in between my butt and its planned safe harbour. Feel free to break it down in your answer though if you feel it is relevant.</li>
<li>It hasn't arisen before, but if someone refused to move their bag on the first attempt, I would make a single follow up attempt to reason with them and then I would drop it and figure out alternative arrangements for where to store my buttocks (likely another seat). I point this out just to clarify that the above list is not a progression through refusals, I'll quite happily accept that someone really wants to keep their bag on the chair.</li>
<li>Location: UK.</li>
<li>Bus layout / seating arrangements are single seats arranged in pairs along each side of the bus with an aisle up the middle, thus:</li>
</ul>

"How to get more co-operation from a teacher who discourages a student from asking questions to clear his confusion?","<ol>
<li>Kindly excuse the long question because you need a lot of background details in order to provide good answers here. I did add the India tag but feel that this is not necessarily a culture-specific problem in these modern times.</li>
<li>My 18 year old cousin who is in high school is expected to devote most of his time to studies in this 'crucial year before college', and his parents strictly regulate online time to 'avoid distraction', which is why he is not active on Stack Exchange and cannot ask this question himself here.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>I had only a very limited and passing experience of this problem when I was in high school myself, many years ago now, but my young cousin age 18 is currently facing this challenging situation which is rather common in India and maybe in other countries worldwide:</p>

<p><strong>How to get more co-operation from this Physics teacher who discourages students from asking questions to clear their conceptual confusion?</strong></p>

<p>Facts of the case:</p>

<ol>
<li>My cousin is 18 years old and studying in Class XII (highest level before graduating from high school in India) in a reputed school here in South India.</li>
<li>He took 'Science without Biology' group (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Computer Science, English) which is an advanced course preparing students for future studies in Engineering and computers. </li>
<li>He is studious and sincere but only an average student in his class and has found the textbooks to be of a difficultly high standard. He just barely passed the 'previous year' in the same group (called Class XI which is the first of 2 years with this course combination). However the teachers who taught him that year were supportive and allowed him to ask many questions in the class itself, as is typically allowed in India so he could clear his confusion and managed to pass the first year.</li>
<li>This year he is being taught by all the same teachers <strong>except Physics</strong> because the earlier teacher left and was replaced by a newly transferred-in teacher with good qualifications and 8 years experience teaching Physics at this level.</li>
<li>Problem: this Physics teacher does not appreciate students asking questions to clear their confusion (usage note on Indian English: such questions are called <strong>doubts</strong> here.) </li>
<li>Whether in class or in the Physics lab between classes, my cousin says that the teacher is not lazy or hostile -- he gives thorough lessons and notes, but simply does not answer the questions posed by students. As in, his answer is likely to be very short and irrelevant, and the teacher quickly passes to the next point. If a student persists with the 'doubt' the teacher will tell him to ask later but is not available later to be asked again. This attitude is probably not specific to my cousin's doubts alone, but not many other students tend to ask their doubts anyway. In one notable instance, the teacher said to my cousin:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why you are asking so many doubts? See these others are not asking like that. You really don't understand these topics? Please study your notes I am giving to you.  (this syntax is common in Indian English.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The teacher is also very reserved and not at all a good communicator inside or outside the class, though obviously competent in his subject.</p>

<ol start=""7"">
<li>This is a big problem for my cousin because Physics is very much a concept-oriented subject and he got used to asking the earlier teacher his doubts to get conceptual clarification. Indeed he has been good at asking such doubts on behalf of the group, and used to get good response from all teachers.</li>
<li>My cousin depends on the teaching he gets from school because it is a reputed school and neither he nor his father believe in after-hours private coaching from third-party teachers. Nor can he get into such a tuition centre now because the school year started in July and students will not be taken after August 1st.</li>
<li>Being very frank with the teacher and asking for a proper treatment of his doubts is not easy in the power-equation that exists in Indian schools because teachers are much more powerful than students and tend to see it as a criticism of their abilities.</li>
<li>For the same reason my cousin does not want to expand the problem by bringing in other students/ parents/ other teachers/ the school principal: since much critical teaching and learning must be completed amicably by February 2018, antagonizing the teacher would be disastrous.</li>
</ol>

<p>[Why can't I give him good suggestions myself, based on my own experience with teachers in the same subjects in Indian schools?</p>

<p>This is because I used to be a leading student in my class and had relatively few conceptual doubts, which however were well clarified kindly by most teachers. I also had the most wonderful Physics-master in a private coaching center, and scored stratospherically in Physics as a result, though I lost touch with the subject long back.]</p>

<p>In short I have had no personal experience of my cousin's specific problem and not much insight at all into the special diplomacy needed to deal with a teacher who discourages questions. <strong>That is why I need help from the very clever, sympathetic and eminently sensible people at Interpersonal.SE!</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Post script</strong>: I had a kind and brilliant but very abstracted mathematics teacher myself in class XI -- this was 22 years ago; that teacher was always 'in his own world' and could not even 'hear' your doubt, let alone answer it. Our mathematics class went rapidly downhill as a result and my private coaching class was also (for me) a disaster. I don't remember how I reached class XII. </p>

"How do I follow up with new acquaintances to develop a friendship?","<p>I think this Sarah Scribbles' strip illustrated the question in a nutshell:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zIWud.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zIWud.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Sometimes when at meetups, or at miscellaneous networking events I would meet people I could click with and become friends - common topics, shared interests, what not. After that event though, I worried about how to catch up with them. How do I ask? Is saying ""Hey do you want to hang out and have coffee together and talk about stuff"" sounds strange to me, and is only something that I will ask of a friend whom I know very well.</p>

<p>What are some possible ""excuses""?</p>
"
"Breaking up well","<p>Long story short, my ex and I split on pretty poor terms a couple months ago. They cheated again, I moved out, and now they're moving in with the person they cheated with...</p>

<p>I'm trying to ""break up well"", trying not to hold grudges, or foment animosity. I'm not looking to be friends with them, but I'm also not looking to be enemies. Basically I'd like a clean break. They go their way, and I go mine. </p>

<p>Here complications arise. Despite the context of the breakup, and being told that I'd rather not hear from them, they still want to be friends, and still want me to help them when they run into problems. To further complicate things, we're still legally married, so I kinda need to keep things as civil as possible till the paperwork has been shuffled.</p>

<p>My goal is to be civil, but to put a stop to these requests for help, sympathy, and friendship. Basically I'd just rather not have contact till we're signing papers. </p>

<p><strong>How do I go about telling them that these messages need to stop without escalating the situation? Or perhaps the more nuanced question... How do I explain to an ex that breaking up, in this context, means that it's kinda inappropriate to continue leaning on me for support?</strong></p>

<p>My first thought was ""Your problems are no longer my problems."" But... This sounds a bit blunt and cold, and I suspect that it may cause things to escalate.</p>

"How to refuse someone asking for additional help ""while you're at it""?","<p>A while ago, I was visiting an acquaintance to help her with something. After I finished fixing the problem, she asked me to do another thing ""while you're at it"". Let's say I'm done sweeping the house, and she asked me to mop the floor. The task was related, and it would take approximately half an hour.</p>

<p>This was not something I've agreed to do before, and certainly I was not planning for it. The complexity and needed time of the issue were not an issue (although it was not a small task), I didn't have anything else planned, but I felt like I was put on the spot if I refuse.</p>

<p>Additionally, from the past interaction with this person, I had a suspicion that she was planning to ask for this when she asked for my help. Note that I'm also worried that her request become slippery slope.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After this, can you do X? (After I've done X) Can you do Y? It will only take 5 minutes, I promise!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How can I refuse her request politely?</strong> My goal is to refuse the task and maintain the relationship, especially allowing me to leave (preferably not immediately, see below) with smiles on both of our faces :)</p>

<p>I was visiting her to improve relationship. That's why I agreed to help her in the first place. Refusing seems to nullify what the improvement I was originally aimed for. Preferably, I was hoping to stay a while for a chat (casual, but I have certain goal in mind), but if it's too awkward to stay after refusing her request, I'm fine to leave. (for example: I need to go)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Initially I was asked to help her install a software. It took an hour to get the software ready for her to use. After that, she asked me to install the companion app on her phone. I could see that I have to check whether the app and the software in PC can communicate with each other properly.</p>

<p>I doubt there's a ""professional"" that I can direct her to, because the task seemed very simple to be handled by a technician. She lived alone, so she had rather limited connection to someone who can do this. I can understand that.</p>

"I have been asked to keep a secret about a surprise that I believe will end poorly","<p>My parents have been divorced for roughly 40 years.  The separation was unpleasant, as divorces frequently are, but so were the following decades.  </p>

<p>They have not spoken to each other outside of a handful of words during my wedding.</p>

<p>There were courtroom fights, in-person fights, and everything in between.</p>

<p>My father has announced (not asked) that he will be driving halfway across the country to visit with me and my family (by which I mean my wife and son).</p>

<h2>The plot twist:</h2>

<p>He will be traveling with an old friend of my mother's.  He has stated that the two of them would like to have dinner with my family, my mother, and my mother's husband.  <strong>He has asked me not to tell my mother</strong>, as the mutual friend (someone that my mother has not seen in more than 40 years) wants to surprise her.</p>

<p>I have no reason to believe my mother would not be interested in seeing this friend.</p>

<p>I have <strong>every</strong> reason to believe that she would want to avoid having to see my father.</p>

<p>It is probably worth noting that my father has no empathy (and yes, this means he almost certainly has a personality disorder).  I mean that in the most literal sense: he seems fundamentally incapable of seeing anything from someone else's perspective.  As such, he cannot imagine that anyone that he is interested in spending time with would not be equally interested in spending time with him.  Despite the decades of bitter fighting between him and my mother, it hasn't occurred to him in the slightest that she would be anything other than thrilled to see him.</p>

<p>If I tell her, and she says ""no"" (which seems almost guaranteed), my father will blame me (for telling her, and possibly for sabotaging what he imagines will be a pleasant and social reunion).  If I don't tell her, I run the risk of her blaming me for being part of this (and possibly wind up sitting through an incredibly awkward dinner).</p>

<p>What do I say to my mother?  What do I say to my father?</p>

I say this, because considering he has never shown anything even close to a romantic interest and I know almost nothing about his personal life. It's very unusual for me.</p>

<p>I'm not even bored, since I'm studying, working and practising sports. So I'm really confused as to how to get him out of my head.</p>

"How do I get a second opinion without offending my longtime dentist?","<p>I have been going to my dentist for the past 18 years. It's a family practice: the dentist, his wife (hygienist), his sister-in-law (appointments and billing), and some additional staff I've never dealt with (I think an associate dentist and a hygienist.) I enjoy my visits very much, just really lovely people, every six months it's nice.</p>

<p>However, I've been developing a problem that I don't think they're taking seriously enough. I don't want to insist, it'd seem like I was telling him how to do his job. They're so nice, I feel like a jerk. So, I've been thinking about going to a different dentist to get a second opinion.</p>

<p>How do I do that without offending my dentist? Surely dentists share records and also my insurance would rat me out for cheating?</p>

<p><b>Edit:</b> I'm not scheduled to see him again for a few months, so if I go with the ""tell him"" option do I need to call him first or just make an appointment with someone else myself, and what do I say once I go back next time?</p>

"How to support a coworker with her insecurity, while not going against my own opinions?","<p>I have a new-ish co-worker. Before I landed in this team we already had some contact, we enjoyed having lunches together and often chatted over a cup of coffee. We seem to be developing a friendship, where we talk about and plan things outside of work as well: things like going shopping or going out for a drink. All in all, she's a great person, but she has one habit that I don't know how to deal with. </p>

<p>She tends to ask me things like 'Us females are doing a great job, aren't we?' or 'Isn't it great to have another female developer to explain stuff to you?'. I've never seen her ask the males on the team for this kind of support/validation, but the guys do compliment either of us on doing our job well if we deserve it.</p>

<p><em>I first dealt with this as if she were just joking around,</em> but I later found out she's serious when she makes remarks like this. She said she felt I didn't take her seriously. At that point, we had a frank conversation in which I explained to her that to me, the fact that we're female doesn't set us apart from the team and that we shouldn't act as such. There wasn't much reaction to that from her side, besides that she acknowledged being insecure. </p>

<p>She didn't stop making the remarks though, so <em>after that, I switched to remarks that let her know she did well, but there's more than us two females in the team,</em> like 'Yeah, the entire team did a good job this sprint' or 'Yes, you explained this very well, just like our most senior dev would'. This doesn't really help though, she just pushes for the female angle even further with replies like 'Yeah, but what do you think of our contribution/way we handled this?'. I usually shrug those off as 'we all did our share', 'you did a good job doing X' or 'not any different from how the guys did their work', but that doesn't seem to satisfy her or boost her confidence.</p>

<p>Basically, she's really insecure about her femininity and her work, but no amount of support that I gave her so far, that didn't directly acknowledge her being female, helped. <em>I want to support her, for her to gather some self-confidence.</em> But any compliment I give seems to be wasted upon her, if it doesn't acknowledge her being female.</p>

<p>At the same time, <em>I don't want to go against my personal views that being female does not set us apart from the rest of the team in any positive or negative way,</em> and so I am really not willing to give her the 'yeah, you're female and a developer and thus you're great' kind of support. </p>

<p><em>I also don't want to lose a potential friend</em> and otherwise great person over this, if at all possible. </p>

<p><strong>How can I be supportive when she asks for validation, without going against my own views?</strong></p>

"How to help my friend who is a functioning alcoholic?","<p>I have a friend who is a functioning alcoholic. He's in his early thirties, lives with his parents in a small apartment and has a degree in electrical engineering (never practiced it).</p>

<p>At first, I didn't think his behavior was problematic. He is originally from Albania, where men tend to drink more, and make their own wines and other alcoholic drinks, so when he would pull a 500ml plastic water bottle full of wine out of his backpack and offer us some, I thought nothing of it. My boyfriend doesn't drink and I rarely drink but I would sometimes have a drink with him.</p>

<p>More recently, however, I started realizing that every time he would visit us, he would bring a backpack with him, in which he would store at least two or three of these bottles. I also started noticing that he would sometimes take his backpack in the bathroom which made me suspect he might be secretly sipping on some wine or other drink. Even though he knows my partner and I don't really drink, he keeps asking if we want some.</p>

<p>Coming from a Health related background, I am almost certain he's depressed and I feel it's my responsibility to help (I can think of a few reasons why he's depressed. If you think mentioning them might help please let me know). He's had to sleep over at our place a few times, because he was clearly unable to walk home or it got too late for him to use public transport.</p>

<p>He is a really nice guy and I care about him but I hate to see him suffer like that (whether he realizes it or not). I've talked to my partner about it but he doesn't want to get involved.</p>

<p>Ironically, our friend has mentioned that his father had to pay a huge fine for getting a DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) and he did sound concerned about his father's behavior.</p>

<p>Long story short, it's depressing seeing him like that and I feel that by not saying anything, I am enabling his behavior which makes me feel like a hypocrite. This has started to affect me more than I thought it would. </p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>How can I tell my friend that he's a functioning alcoholic? Can I even bring alcoholism up? Should I offer my help and how?</p></li>
<li><p>And if I shouldn't say anything, how can I detach myself from the situation without acting cold towards him?</p>

<p>(I can't withdraw to another room without raising suspicion especially since he is used to me hanging out with my boyfriend and him. I can probably do it once or twice but no more.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the reasons I suspect he might be drinking about, past and present:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He was bullied as an overweight child of immigrant parents. He is skinny and tall now. </p></li>
<li><p>Ex-girlfriend hurt him but still sees her as a friend, when he's clearly hurt. I know he's hurt because he was really distressed when talking about her. </p></li>
<li>Perhaps lacks direction. Even though he has a good degree he just won't do anything with it. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>On a recent visit, and after all of us having some wine, my friend confessed to me that he should really cut down on the drinking. This was the first time he actually said something like that without anyone initiating a conversation about it. I immediately praised him for that and gave him a pat in the back and took advantage of the opportunity to tell him that if he ever needs my help or would like to talk about this, I'll be there for him. I feel more confident now to give him that letter. </p>

<p>Today is my birthday, and I received several packages from Amazon from my father.</p>

<p>I am a single, young professional with sufficient disposable income to purchase what I need and want for myself, without needing to wait for my birthday or Christmas, as I did when I was a child.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the desire for some items while talking on the phone with my father, and then subsequently bought them. Over the past few days, these items have shown up on my doorstep.</p>

<p>When I told my father that I already bought everything he sent, he texted my back with ""sigh... we were so hopeful!"" It makes me feel bad that he's disappointed. I could not tell him, but then I'd feel bad that he's wasting money on things I don't need. Additionally, he would like to know/see how I'm enjoying them, so the lies could easily get out of hand. I'd much prefer to be honest.</p>

<p>I responded that, in the future, I wouldn't be offended if he didn't send gifts, but rather just sent a card or something small from my hometown. He responded that he thought I didn't like cards. He is correct, I have no personal interest in cards, but I wanted to offer him something that he could get me to fulfill his desire to not get me nothing. Time will tell if this was effective.</p>

"How to argue with father who denies everything and makes illogical arguments?","<p>Not sure how to approach this question so please bear with me.</p>

<p>Every member of my family, including me, has a problem with my father's behaviour. I am trying to find a way to solve it.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Simply put, my father comes home after work and immediately reaches for the beer. He drinks 5-6 cans a night. He gets drunk, not a massive amount, but enough that his behaviour changes. In fact, I think he enters this behavioural mode automatically before he even starts drinking.</p>

<p>What is this behaviour? Well, he interrupts and critises people on <em>everthing</em> they say or do. I mean <em>everything.</em> He mostly does it to my mother - he undermines everything she says and it is affect me since I can't even have a conversation with her without him saying something about every single thing she has to say. It gets to the point where my blood boils but no matter how much I or my mother tell him to stop being irritating he doesn't seem to acknowledge it. I can't stress enough how demoralising it is to have someone put down everything you say constantly.</p>

<p>When we confront him about it, which is usually when he is in this state (i.e.: after he's had a few beers) he becomes <strong>very</strong> defensive. He turns every genuine argument we have into a joke, behaves like a child and eventually gets angry and starts spouting some incomprehensible or illogical sentences in an attempt to change the topic. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> Dad, your behaviour is annoying. We've told you numerous times to
  stop yet you continue. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Dad:</strong> Oh it's just a joke, what's life without jokes. <em>(immediately
  deflects)</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> I am being serious here, you do this all the time, it is
  irritating, offensive and you cannot treat me or mother like this. We
  can't say a single world without your needless comments interrupting
  us.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Dad:</strong> Oh so I'm not allowed to have an opinion? I am not allowed to say anything? <em>(tries to imply he is a victim)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how it starts... He fails to acknowledge what he does to us. He starts acting very childish, almost as if he's giddy. Anything we say, no matter how logical and earnest, he dismisses with a deflection or some twisted logic.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>It's easy to see it's near impossible arguing with him or trying to change his view <em>while he is in this state.</em> I have spoken with him about his drinking problem but he fails to see it as a problem. For him it's just a way to unwind after work and he fails to notice his change in behaviour. He refuses to even contemplate the idea that these beers might be getting him drunk.</p>

<p>The worst part is that this behaviour mode, as I said earlier, has been happening for so long now that he often enters it when he knows it is time to relax (i.e.: no alcohol involved to begin with). This includes going out on weekends, making public events with him unbearable.</p>

"How to convey (non-awkwardly) that its my birthday?","<p>First off, I know that <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1163/its-my-birthday-how-do-i-tell-people-who-dont-know-who-might-want-to-know-w"">this question</a> is very close to mine, but has no answer that would match my needs.</p>

<hr>

<p>Secondly, I find it shocking how many people answer for a workplace situation. This question is about generic place and a generic way that can be taken.</p>

<hr>

<p>Yesterday a colleague of mine had birthday and I didn't know about it until later that day where the coworker brought in some food and sent an email to everyone. I felt pretty embarrassed, as I already met him at that morning but had no clue. This is the reason for following question.</p>

<p>Please assume following situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>I am the person having birthday</li>
<li>We meet each other for a short period of time (lets say around 5-10 minutes)</li>
<li>It is a 1-on-1 conversation</li>
<li>This can happen in any place with any person I know (talked to that person a few times but only small talk)</li>
<li>This person has absolutely no clue that it's my birthday (doesn't ask ""what's up?"" or similar to which I could respond properly)</li>
<li>I am not giving off any hints by my looks or my behavior which could cause a question.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can I tell someone who has no clue (and therefore doesn't ask about it), that it is my birthday without it being somewhat awkward?</strong></p>

<p>I am not looking for answers like the ones in the linked question, as they are mostly suggest to bring food or do some activity. I am looking for answers which are purely conversation based (A short conversation, only small talk, no questions about what up etc.).</p>

<p>Please note that answers such as <code>Hey, it's my birthday!</code> would not be a good fit in my opinion, as I feel that it would be pretty awkward if you walk up to someone and the first thing you say is ""It's my birthday!"" (also I feel its kinda rude).</p>

"How to stop buying presents?","<p>How do you stop buying presents for someone (and their child) you don't know very well, when you have to see them and are giving other people presents at the same time, without appearing rude?</p>

<p>The background is, that I can only see my friends &amp; their families once a month for a big get together, so I've always brought their birthday presents along. A new person who I don't have any friendship with was introduced, and it felt rude so I started bringing birthday presents for them too. Then they started bringing their kid and that seemed rude since I do it for my friends children and I started doing that.</p>

<p>Now they are bringing their SO, and another new person has been introduced.</p>

<p>Its costing me more than I can afford, but to give 'smaller' gifts, when the giving is necessarily visible to everyone or no gifts seems terrible.  I don't wish to give my friends less to be able to afford gifts for acquaintances.</p>

<p>How can I manage this situation better?</p>

"How to respond to people who don't believe where you're from?","<p>I've observed situations like this occurring to a friend of mine (let's call him X):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stranger: Where are you from?<br>
  X: [insert southeast asian country here]<br>
  Stranger: Are you sure?<br>
  ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On very rare occasions, people are more direct/rude, and they'll ask this instead: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stranger: Are you sure? Aren't you from China/Japan/Korea?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most comical situation I've witnessed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stranger: Where are you from?<br>
  X: [insert southeast asian country here]<br>
  ...<br>
  Stranger: [insert question about China/Japan/Korea]<br>
  X: I don't know. I'm from [insert southeast asian country here].<br>
  ...<br>
  Stranger: [insert question about China/Japan/Korea]<br>
  X:  I'm not from China/Japan/Korea.<br>
  Stranger: Oh. Then where are you from?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>X is ethnically Chinese. His family left China sometime in the 1700s-1800s, and they settled in different parts of Southeast Asia, and later, in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there are appropriate responses to such situations. How can one deal with people who do not believe where one claims to be from? Do you repeat yourself? Do you repeat yourself more than twice? Do you give a better/longer default answer when others ask where you're from?</p>

<p>(Note: To X, there is no problem. He seems to think that these situations are normal, but I'm asking out of curiosity because ""home"" is central to the identities of most people, and it must be rather confusing when others don't believe that your home is where you claim it is).</p>

<p>EDIT: X is really from Southeast Asia. He lived in the region for most of his life, and so did his parents, grandparents, great grandparents, great great grandparents, etc. He now lives in Canada on a long-term, but temporary basis (i.e. he has definite plans to leave). The situations shown above come from conversations in Canada, and in conversations in the U.S. when we were traveling together. </p>

"How should I tell someone about a potential medical issue?","<p>I have a long history of skin issues, including several different types of cancers. As a result, I see a dermatologist very frequently to have potential areas removed. Because of this, I have become very proficient at tracking certain moles to know when they become a concern, as well as visually determining when a biopsy will most likely be necessary.</p>

<p>This leads me to my problem that has been dwelling on me.</p>

<p>Lately, at the gym, I have become casual friends with another member who will talk to me on occasion. Definitely not good friends, but just casual. Over the last few months, I have notice a very dark mole above his eyebrow that has become larger in a short period of time. Based on my experience, this raises a lot of red flags and even though I am not a doctor, I am fairly confident that this is something that needs to be checked out by a professional. It has the looks of something bad. To make matters worse, it is apparent that he uses tanning beds, which is an obvious increase in melanoma risks.</p>

<p>I really want to tell him to get it checked, but I feel like I am severely overstepping my bounds since I am not a doctor. Of course, I have to assume that even when doctors are out in the public, they cannot point these things out due to legal reasons.</p>

<p>How in the world do I tell a near stranger about a concern like this?? Obviously I will feel awful if I don't say anything and it turns out to be something bad.</p>

"how do I tell my friend how I feel in person without feeling embarrassed about it?","<h2>Context</h2>

<p>So I've been talking to this guy for nearly two years now and we both know we really like each other. When we first started talking, he told me that he liked me but I wasn't able to commit to a relationship at the time since I was studying - I told him I will be able to start a relationship until I finished school (which was in a year from that time). Usually guys my age (late teens) would just up and leave but this guy was different. He was understanding and stuck by me. </p>

<p>We've both had our up's and downs in the past two or so years. My trust issues got in the way of our relationship/friendship at some points - I've only really started trusting him at the beginning of this year. I just find it very difficult to trust someone with my life due to past experiences. He's the first guy I've ever REALLY liked in years, and he would be my first boyfriend - so I wanted everything to be perfect. </p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>We're not together, but we're not ""just friends"" either - it's really complicated. We do things that a couple would do (i.e kiss, dates, sex) but we're not official either.  I'm not much of a talker, I'd rather sit back and listen to people since I learn better about them that way. We are quite the opposite, with him being more expressive with his feelings than me. So, I've never really openly told him how I felt in person. I've been waiting for him to ask to be official since I graduated high school last year but he hasn't asked yet. I'm also the type of person who takes the words ""I love you"" very seriously so I haven't told him that I do love him - even though he's told me he loves me. I did say it one time through text but that was because I didn't have the courage to say it to him face to face as I'm very shy in comparison to him. </p>

<h2>Plan</h2>

<p>Every time we get time to hang out, I think about asking him but I always back out and forget it completely - then hours later I regret not asking. I'd rather ask him in person than through the phone but I back out thinking he might not want to make things official. I'm just scared of being rejected - what if he doesn't want to take things to the next level? I want to tell him how I truely feel about him in person without being embarrassed and asking him about ""what's next"" for us. I feel like it's more personal if you tell someone how you feel face-to-face. </p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>how do I tell him how I feel in person without feeling embarrassed about it?</strong> Expressing how I feel is rare to both of us but I want to make this work - no matter what. So if it requires me to step out of my comfort zone, I will. I think that once I openly tell him my feelings, I will be confident enough to ask him if we should move the relationship to the next level.</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>I hope to express how I feel about him and our relationship when we see each other next. Building confidence to ask him to move things to the next level is also another goal of mine.</p>

"how does one jump-start a social life in the face of abusers who are making it impossible to socialize within your tightest circle?","<p>I, single woman, 34 years, in Mauritius, have been the victim of domestic violence and the authorities caused my dad and brother to stop their behavior. Deep down themselves, they have not changed but they know they will face consequences, so they are acting differently.</p>

<p>My problem is social life. Events like wedding, birthday, funeral, dinner at relatives, I used to avoid all the going out with dad and/or brother. First what it used to be was that talks about domestic violence was taboo. When with people, I have to be presented according to them, keep smiling and showing as if I am very beloved. As such, I stopped going out with them. Then, there was a period when seeing authorities, court, doctors and recuperating myself, I was never at any wedding, birthday, funeral, dinner at relatives. </p>

<p>Now, there are times I feel very lonely. Most of my friends are married and they have their life. So, no human interaction. Last time went to a birthday celebration for a cousin who returned from abroad after five years. In the presence of my dad and brother, I just fringe or crisp. I don't know how to describe that feeling when in front of my abusers. I just cannot enjoy. I feel disgusted when seeing them. At the party, there were people not recognizing me. Others were so happy meeting me, as if I have returned from abroad for some years. </p>

<p>I really need some social skills advice, how I can make friends and grow relationships or enjoy myself when my dad and/or brother are also at the event? Also, I don't want talks that I share, to fall in their ears. See, my cousin is his cousin. My uncle is his uncle. My aunt is his aunt. And will this ever change throughout my lifetime? They will always share the same network of people. When a relative invites a family, they also invite the whole family. </p>

<p>Please advise. </p>

"Planned to move into shared house but not allowed when someone alleged I made them uncomfortable (adults)","<p><em>All names and numbers have been changed to preserve privacy</em></p>

<h3>Backgound:</h3>

<p>I am looking for a place to live. The end of the month is close. I viewed a room in a shared house, and after thinking about it, decided it was good. I emailed the landlord and asked if I could have it. He replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to the house. You can send the deposit and rent to
  example@email.com.</p>
  
  <p>The deposit is $400 and monthly rent is $800.</p>
  
  <p>I'll try and finish moving my things upstairs by tomorrow before my
  flight. You should be able to start moving in this Friday if you want,
  at no extra charge.</p>
  
  <p>Sincerely, Eric</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then realized that I did not 1) have Eric's phone number or 2) know his last name. I did not feel safe giving him over $1000 without knowing this information so I sent him another email asking. Eric did not reply, and knowing he was going to be away the next day, I thought I would go over to the house (the landlord lives in the same unit).</p>

<p>I knocked on the door about 7pm. Someone I hadn't met answered the door (call him Liam), and said Eric wasn't home. I introduced myself as the new roommate and asked if he had Eric's phone number. He said he didn't have Eric's but told me his last name and to look him on Facebook. I left, and shortly after got an email from Eric saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know what you did but you made my current roommate and his
  girlfriend super uncomfortable. I'm at work right now and received
  messages in no uncertain terms that he does not want you to move in. I
  have to cancel our agreement. I will not be cashing your deposit and
  rent. Good luck on finding a place to live. Eric</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm very upset. I don't know what happened. <em>I'd like to emphasize the point that when Liam answered the door, we were all about business and had no conversation about personality or opinions.</em> Moving is a lot of effort and I thought this was a done deal.  I sent Eric another email asking for an explanation and he replied</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never said I was going to be home so I don't know why you showed up.
  I'll get the full story when I get home. Regardless I cannot have you
  move in. I would have my roommate move out immediately. Good luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Question:</h3>

<p>What could I have possibly done for things to end up like this? What could I have done better? These people are in there 30s and seemed mature. If I really did do something offensive, I would like to know so I can stop it.</p>

<p>I am planning on sending  Eric a message. Does the following look good? </p>

  <p>Could you do me a favor and let me know how I rubbed Liam the wrong
  way? I got no sense anything was wrong and would like to know for the

<p>The only I have understood was a relatively large number of English words they used in their conversation. Is it a common practice to communicate this way?

"How can I better improve peoples views of me?","<p>I frequent a chatroom with a small community. Many types of discussions occur that I don't usually join in on. It's partially because I often don't feel like contributing because what I have to say might have been already said. </p>

<p>But on occasion, I do have something extremely important to add. However, because I usually don't contribute/I frequently fool around in the chatroom people seem to have gotten an impression from me that I don't know/haven't experienced many things and I'm not credible. </p>

<p>However, That is incorrect. I can tell just by the conversations they have that I know a significant amount more (or can reason better depending on the circumstance, like this one below) I'm not trying to ""toot my own horn"" but I do very much feel like I am more knowledgeable in general than most of the chatroom. An example of a conversation that was had recently is summarized below.</p>

  <p><strong>Person B</strong>: Instead of hitting him first you should wait for him to hit you then you should hit him.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Person C</strong>: Yes. That's the only option available when it comes to these kinds of people.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: Actually that's one of many and is probably not the best option seeing as how both person A and the kid from school will get in trouble. It would be much better if...</p>

  <p><strong>Person A</strong>: No, I bet you haven't even gotten into a  fight before. You don't understand the situation and you need to stop talking.</p>

<p>(I do understand the situation and I have been in a similar one but because I haven't spoken up and people do not accept my views I can't help.)</p>

<p><strong>Several hours later...</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Person D</strong>: What's this about hitting someone?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Person A</strong>: Yes there's a kid at school who deserves it (describes person and situation/plan for getting revenge.)</p>
  
  <p><strong>Person D</strong>: It would be much better to record this person and sending it to a figure of authority. That way you can get your cake and eat it too. Socking them is going to hurt your experience as well as theirs.</p>

"Appropriate ways to dismiss street vendors?","<p>In the Netherlands, it seems to be quite common lately to hire some students, put them on a busy main street or outside a supermarket, and have them target every passerby by asking 'Can I ask you something?'. </p>

<p>These people are always selling stuff I am not interested in (newspaper subscriptions, services that deliver food to your house every week) or they are trying you to sign up to become a permanent donor for a charity (in which I am also not interested). </p>

<ul>
<li>Do not make eye contact</li>
<li>Continue walking without changing pace/trajectory (unless one jumps in front of me, then I swerve)</li>
<li>Reply 'You just did' (gentle, joking tone of voice, smile on my face) if they ask me 'Can I ask you something'</li>

"How to deal with disruptive people in the cinema","<p>In my last two cinema trips I have had disruptive people in the cinema. </p>

<p>One was a group of 4-5 early 20s men, one of whom in particular was talking very loudly. I stared at him until he looked back at me, and I did the international sign for ""what the hell are you doing?"" (holding your hands up in a sort of shrug with a scowl on my face) and he did it back to me sarcastically, and continued talking. This angered me, and I said loudly ""If you want to have a conversation, *&amp;!# off somewhere else and do it"" which was met with threats of physical violence... but he did then shut up for the rest of the film. </p>

<p>Most recently this weekend there were people sat next to me and my wife who were on their phones a lot, not talking but mainly texting. The light from the phones was very distracting. About 10 minutes from the end of the film one got their phone out and wasn't even doing anything, he was just scrolling through pages of apps looking for something to do. This annoyed me and I said ""Can you put your phone away please? The movie isn't finished yet"" and all I got back from him was ""Just watch the movie yeah? Don't worry about me on my phone"". I replied ""I'm trying to watch the movie but the light from your phone is very distracting"", which was met with ""just watch the movie"". I protested some more and was met with deflection ""you're raising your voice now just watch the movie yeah?"". Ultimately I left it but it ruined the moviegoing experience for me.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that there don't seem to be ushers in the theatre in UK cinemas anymore - at least there haven't been in the cinemas I've been in for the last 10 years or more.</p>

<p>My options seem to be either to leave the theatre, find an usher and report the behaviour, or to attempt to deal with it myself. I'm not keen on leaving the cinema to find an usher because a) That involves me missing part of the movie and b)The usher may not even do anything - even if they come into the theatre the person might not be on their phone anymore. This leaves me to try and deal with it myself.</p>

<p>Frankly the whole thing makes me not want to go to the cinema anymore. I feel like there's an increase in entitled behaviour which I've also encountered at music gigs. There seems to be an ""I've paid for my ticket so I can do whatever I want"" mentality and I suppose in a broader sense this is part of what I'd like to try and combat.</p>

<p>I'm aware that my previous approaches may not have been the best - how can I do better to quash this disruptive and annoying behaviour? My goal is to make people realise they're being disruptive to others and change their behaviour.</p>

She and her girlfriend seem to sleep in the room directly below mine and I can often hear them talking, laughing, and walking around late into the night, even until 1am sometimes.</p>

<p>It's not like they are <em>very</em> loud; just loud enough that I've been having trouble sleeping or going to sleep. I don't believe they think they are being loud enough to bother me.</p>

<p>She has a young adopted daughter that has had a couple sleepovers with a friend in the past, and they were much louder at that time (and stayed up even later). Both times this happened I politely confronted her about it and asked if she could be quieter. She seemed unwilling to compromise at those times and the kids were still loud after I talked to her. (This has not happened recently.)</p>

<p>Because of her uncooperative nature the last time I brought up a much <em>worse</em> noise issue, I doubt whether she would help me out this time. It's probably worth mentioning that we have been looking for another place to live even before she bought the place, and we hope to move soon.</p>

"How can I help my partner handle pressure?","<h3>Situation</h3>

<p>My boyfriend and I are in the situation that we are actually starting to live our future. We have been together for 5 years now and have gone through much together. I'm in my mid-twenties and he is 5 years older than me. </p>

<p>When we started dating I was studying and he was working in a job where he was unhappy, stressed and didn't make a lot of money. I knew that he liked what I'm doing as a profession now, so I convinced him to start studying too so that he would actually like what he is doing to earn money and that we would have a brighter future together.</p>

<p>He will now start writing his bachelor thesis soon and finally, it looks like we are ready to move in together. The apartment situation here is very rough and also expensive here if you want to live in a central location. But we found a really nice apartment (which is like my dream apartment) and we also convinced the landlord that we will manage to pay the bills and stuff. I have saved a lot of money because I've now been working for 4 years and making much and don't spend a lot.</p>

<p>So currently there is a lot of pressure on my boyfriend. He needs to start writing his bachelor thesis soon, he needs to write an essay about his phase of practical involvement, he wants to find a new job because his current job will end in October and he has some financial issues which he is already tackling. </p>

<p>I showed him in all the time we are together that he can rely on me and I will help him when he is in a critical situation as well as financially. We agreed that when we move in together I will pay the larger amount of the rent and I'm totally okay with that.</p>

<p>For me, it's like the turning point of our way together and to finally succeed and establish something together but it all really depends on how he manages to finish his studies and get a job. As we are in the same profession I try to help him with study documents, how to tackle a certain task, what is left to do and stuff. I also help him with his résumé and cover letter for the job search.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>What can I do or say to make him feel less stressed and help him in this situation? What can I do to make him feel less under pressure? </p>

"How to attract someone who doesn't love you anymore?","<p>Everything was going wonders, we were together for 3 years and one day she was acting strange, she was not sending me cute and kinky texts anymore and she removed all my pictures from her instagram, then she called me to tell me that she needs a ''pause''. </p>

<p>This was so sudden and unexpected, it completely destroyed me and I broke in tears while talking at the phone, It was the first time my best friend, my childhood friend saw me cry. </p>

<p>By investigating further without telling her, I realize that the day before acting strange, one of my friends confessed to her. What a coincidence, the only problem is I did not know who confessed to her...</p>

<p>3 days after she left me, I knew they were going to the beach with a group of friends, Later I arrived too and found Michele my ''training bro'' we used to workout together all the time and he was hugging and kissing her, and all my other friends acting like nothing happened, like I didn't ever exist. </p>

<p>They didn't notice that I saw them kissing so when I came they acted like nothing, I sat silently in front of her and she didn't say anything, I watched Michele in the eyes and he looked down. I wanted to fist his face into a bloody mess, but then everyone would have looked at me like a monster. It was obvious that no one cared about me, I had to avoid making the situation worse. </p>

<p>Then I talked to her, and she told a lot of lies, How do I know she was lying? Because nothing she said matched with what her friends told me in different occasions or what her parents told me. Now she doesn't want to talk with me or have any contact with me for at least 1 month. </p>

<p>How do I attract her, so she leaves that other guy to get back to me? </p>

<p>My parents, and some of my friends always used to tell me ''Never give a girl too much love, she will feel too empowered and by consequence she will look at you like a weak guy and leave you for someone that appears stronger'' 
That was my exact same mistake, I loved her too much, I dedicated too much of my soul to please her. </p>

"What are the effects of using a verbal tic in informal speech?","<p>I've been watching the Japanese version of Naruto a lot, recently, and the word ""dattebayo"" really stuck with me...
Not necessarily a good thing, but I'm doing it pretty much unconsciously now.</p>

<p>I've been told to ""grow up"" by my friends, and I'm quite sure that pretty much all people except Naruto aficionados are going to think that I'm an unstable guy that's not yet mature (btw I'm 17)...</p>

<p>Previously, I had a tic of repeating every word I said in my mouth after saying it aloud, as if to check if it's correctly been spoken or not...</p>

<p>My question here is that does a verbal tic affect the listener's understanding in any way, and does it have any impact on their perception of whether one is saying the right thing or joking about? Does it make them feel disrespected? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I only find myself using these verbal tics when I'm talking to friends, it automatically stops when I'm talking to parents, teachers, older people etc.</p></li>

"Anxious during conference calls","<p>I am a middle-aged software engineer at a largish law firm. As a part of my job and at least on a weekly basis I participate in conference calls featuring three or more people made up of co-workers and often times vendors too.</p>

<p>I previously worked 18 years at a different and much smaller law firm where I was only very infrequently involved in such calls. As it's turned out, such calls make me rather anxious, usually when multiple people start talking at the same time and stepping on each other's words. </p>

<p>This makes me highly anxious and my supervisor makes a point of pinging me on it, as my voice raises and changes in tone, reflecting my anxiety. He interprets this as me being impatient, angry and rude. This behavior has also been reflected in my performance reviews. I've since explained as much to him about the anxiety, in hopes he'll understand better. </p>

<p>Additionally, I am hard of hearing (I use an assisted hearing device), and I am sure this contributes to my anxiety. My hearing-loss is bi-lateral, so while I usually hear <em>something</em> it comes out garbled. Add to that multiple voices stepping on one another and it is a recipe for anxiety. Even for a programmer I am not especially introverted and do well enough in small groups and in person.</p>

"How can I help a close friend get over me?","<p>I have this friend, I could easily call her my best friend. We see each other at least twice a week usually, have travelled together etc. About 6 months ago she confessed that she has feelings for me, but I don't feel the same way.</p>

<p>I don't have any issues with the fact that she feels that way, and I'm still very keen on continuing our friendship, however it seems to be having an impact on us. I'm in a committed relationship (I'm female and bi), and whenever I mention anything involving my partner to her, she gets upset. She doesn't yell or cry or anything, but becomes very distant. I can tell that I've upset her and that in turn makes me feel awful, and every time it happens we have a 'talk' about it. It normally starts like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Oh yeah, so last night we went to that restaurant near my place.</p>
  
  <p>Her: Oh.. that's nice...</p>
  
  <p>Me: The food was pretty good, so maybe you and I should go sometime.</p>
  
  <p>Her: Mmm...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After which she'll continue to be distant, and then for the next half hour I'm trying to remedy the situation, apologizing and telling her it's ok, that she's still important to me. She also gets upset whenever we don't see each other for more than a few days, and when we see each other again we inevitably end up having another one of these talks. We get along really well otherwise though, and we've both agreed that abandoning the friendship is not an option.</p>

<p>I've seen the question <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/12628/reject-a-close-friend-interested-in-dating-me"">Reject a close friend interested in dating me?</a> but I feel that this is different, as I've made it very clear to her that I'm not interested in a romantic relationship, and I don't feel like she's pressuring me into one. We are very close friends, and I want to stay that way, but I do feel like it's straining our friendship. </p>

<p>Up until now I've gotten by by just not mentioning my partner at all, but this is getting increasingly difficult as they become a bigger part of my life and I'm unable to talk to my friend about important things happening. I would like to be able to have a normal friendship where I'm not inadvertently upsetting her all the time, but I need to be able to talk about my life too.</p>

<p>In addition, she's not out. This is new for her and she has mentioned it's the first time she has felt this way about anyone. </p>

<p>What can I do to help her feel better about the whole thing? Is this something that just needs time? Am I just being selfish here?</p>

"How to help my friend accept criticism?","<p>tl;dr Bruce believes that the world is, at its core, a very nice, nonjudgmental place where people get along and don't criticize, and when this belief is contradicted he either refuses the evidence or withdraws into himself. I'm worried for his future at music school.</p>

<p>I have a friend. Let's call him Bruce. We are both college age (19-21). I have known him for years, and he is one of my best friends. He and I get along very well in almost every way, and we each have a great trust in each other. There is just one issue that crops up occasionally: he believes that any treatment that goes against how he believes he should be treated is unfair to him. This would not be a problem if he did not have naïve expectations for how he believes everyone should treat each other. I don't mean 'talk it out' expectations, I mean 'why would anyone ever say an insulting word to another?' expectations. </p>

<p>These expectations are not always a problem. His girlfriend is very similar to him, and, while it does produce a pseudo echo chamber effect, it also makes them both incredibly happy, and it has improved both of their dispositions, in the short and long run.</p>

<p>Whenever anyone doesn't conform to his expectations, he immediately assumes the form of someone that has been mistreated. He sulks, he whines, and he loses all his personality for a few hours. He believes that everyone is putting on an act when they don't like someone else, and that if everyone was just honest with each other, then all these problems would go away. </p>

<p>I know for a fact that he feels this way: his two shoulders to cry on are his girlfriend when he can, and, when she's away, me. She lives an hour's drive away, so a lot of the time I am more convenient. </p>

<p>An example that encapsulates this attitude is an interaction we had in a class.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*Me standing up debating with the class on how safe our area is compared to others</p>
  
  <p>*I sit down</p>
  
  <p>*Bruce, who stayed out of the debate, leans over</p>
  
  <p>Br: This school's not that safe, you know</p>
  
  <p>Me: What are you talking about? *provides statistics</p>
  
  <p>Br: Everyone here is really judgmental, though.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Aren't you going into music? They're even more judgmental there: it's all about how you play.</p>
  
  <p>Br: No, it's different there!</p>
  
  <p>Me: You've talked to people that went there. Do you really believe <em>insert local harsh music teacher here</em> was an outlier?</p>
  
  <p>Br: Yeah, I've met some of the professors!</p>
  
  <p>Me: On a recruiting trip?</p>
  
  <p>Br: Yeah, so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>He was often shielded from criticism in his household, as his mother was focused on him growing up happy and enjoying his youth, at the expense of things like constructive criticism.</p>

<p>This makes me very worried for his future. He is going into music, and while he certainly has the skills to be successful, he intends to go to a very prestigious music school, and it is likely (if his audition is on or above his average) he will get in. There, it is likely he will meet the real world, including instructors that take a very hard line stance, and a tough love approach. I want to somehow introduce him to even a small sampling of what he will receive, or convince him that everyone there isn't nice and get along, as he believes that this <em>incredibly competitive</em> music school is all sunshine and rainbows.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>how do I convince him that some people just don't get along, and that he will receive criticism he will just have to take?</strong> I've tried many things, including engaging him on the subject while he's sullen (he refuses to believe me), while he's happy (he brushes it off), by injecting a small amount of criticism into our conversations (he looks at me expectantly until I praise him, and when I don't, he is thrown off balance), and trying to talk to his girlfriend about it (she thinks he will be able to handle it and refuses to talk to him about it).</p>

"How do I politely say no to a stranger asking to use my phone to make a personal call?","<p>TL;DR</p>

<p>A stranger approached me and asked me if they could use my phone. I didn't want to be rude and say no bluntly, so I wavered, and felt uncomfortable. How do I say no to strangers asking for use of my phone? </p>

<hr>

<p>This is for future reference, this happened a few days ago and I would like to know what I (and others) can do in the future.</p>

<hr>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>I was waiting for a bus at a bus stop, using my phone. A person approached me and asked me if they could use my phone to make a phone call. I wasn't sure what to do so I asked ""to who?"" and they answered ""my brother"" and I said ""... to pick you up?"" at this point I wasn't really sure of whether they were telling the truth or not. I finally ended by semi-confidentially saying that my bus was arriving soon, and I couldn't do that. After repeating a few times, they walked off. </p>

<p>In this situation, I couldn't just leave the location, and I was uncomfortable around a stranger I didn't know. </p>

<p>Question:</p>

<p><strong>How do I tell a stranger no when they ask to use my phone for a personal phone call?</strong> </p>

<p>Reason I am asking on here is that I didn't feel confident when I said ""no"" that time, so I would like to have knowledge about what I can say and what is considered okay to say in this setting. </p>

<hr>

<p>Notes: </p>

<p>I will not put down the appearance of this stranger, because I do not want any bias. </p>

<p>This was outside at a bus stop, near government buildings, downtown, in a relatively small city (population ~98,100).</p>

<p>This question is different from <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/5314/how-do-i-best-handle-offering-my-phone-upon-request-without-becoming-a-phone-boo"">this one</a> in that this is a setting where I did not indulge the stranger at all and did not want to lend the phone to the stranger at all. Additionally, I am in a more public place (on the street), not an enclosed place where social rules apply (the library). </p>

"Avoiding conflict when showing my family my new name","<p>I don't like my name, I never had. Recently, I found myself a new name that I really love and I have started using it online.</p>

<p>Now, the thing is that I just received a (nice) mug with my ""new name"" on it and I would really like to show it to my family (via a group conversation that we have). </p>

<p>However, they will probably ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did you put this name on the mug and not yours?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I would like to be able to answer truthfully (""I like this one better"") while minimizing the risk of me hurting their feelings (after all, my mum chose my birth name because she liked it).</p>

<p>So, <strong>how can I show off the mug with my new name without causing a conflict?</strong></p>

<h1>Main goal</h1>

<p>My main goals are:</p>

<p>1) Show the mug.</p>

<p>2) Not having to lie.</p>

<p>3) Avoid a crisis.</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>Please note that I consider myself agender (my family doesn't know that) and that this might play a part in why I don't like my birth name. However, I'm not ready yet to inform my family that I consider myself agender. </sub></p>

<hr>

<h2>Notes and clarifications</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I would be fine with just telling them ""I prefer this new name"" and not ""I disliked the old one"".</p></li>
<li><p>I do not expect my family to change how they are calling me (plus, they use nicknames for me most of the time and not my real birth name and I like those nicknames).</p></li>
<li><p>I will specify it's a personalized mug when posting the picture.</p></li>
<li><p>My family isn't familiar with my new name.</p></li>

"How do I deal with a partner who is more emotional than me?","<p>I have a partner who is struck by life problems emotionally much more deeper than me. Whenever a setback or tragedy occurs, my partner cries about it and is sad for a long time. Although I have empathy for him and I express it, I cannot make <em>myself</em> terribly sad about it and wallow in self-pity. I accept the cards I have been dealt in life and try to move on.</p>

<p>Because of my mentality, even if I express my sympathy, it is often not enough. My partner often complains: ""I wish you also were sad, that would make me feel better. Why aren't you as upset/sad/angry about this as I am?""</p>

<p>Maybe my partner needs me also to be sad to normalize his own sadness. I don't know. I am not sure what to do, because I follow a Stoic philosophy (which also means I do not show extreme jubilation when something good happens, which my partner also finds strange -- but in this case doesn't complain).</p>

"How to set up interactions with someone you are interested in after long time without contact?","<p>I am a 20 y/o guy and I would like to spend time with a particularly nice girl who I only saw occasionally and it has been 6 months since the last time.</p>

<h2>Past interactions</h2>

<p>These have always been because of a mutual group of friends. My friends are friends with hers and so occasionally if there is a group cinema outing, party and once there was a picnic to watch a band play at the park, it is mostly just at these times that I see her. Now to be clear we have never been particularly close, I would estimate there were only 8 or so days spent together and they were spread out over a a year, ending 6 months ago. However in the latter half particularly, I would find myself spending the entire day chatting with her happily. </p>

<h2>Current standing</h2>

<p>Due to a combination of our friend groups shifting, and myself going from somewhat unsocial to non-existant after suddenly spending 50h weeks at a new programming job as opposed to the 5h I used to, we have not had any interaction at all in 6ish months. I have intended to contact her before this point via facebook, pushing friends to help or even ""subtly :D"" dropping into her work but the prospect made me quite anxious as I didn't know what to say and then next minute it's been 6 months.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>Enlisting help from a mutual friend in order to invite us both to a group event will no longer work as there was an awkward falling between the main two who connected our friend groups (not related to me, the girl or this question). </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It does not have anything to do with me but I feel that in her friends' eyes I could be related to the situation, even if its only by association with the friend with whom they had the falling out with. This makes reconnecting with her friends in this group a whole separate question that I am not as worried about since we were on good terms, but I do think it should be done only <em>after</em> first reconnecting with the one who I am by far, the closest to. 
<strong>end edit.</strong> </p>

<p>Now, my current goal is to merely meet up and have a chance to reconnect/spend time but I think it has probably gone too long that to try and ask for something casual will be weird enough anyway so I might as well be more direct than in usual cases. I was thinking of using facebook to send a message along these lines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, I received two free tickets to this cool new movie. Is there any chance you would be interested in coming? I was thinking we could go grab some food from this place beforehand or something?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Either that or give up to the off chance we meet again. Does anyone have some answer for how to tactfully approach this situation to result in a good chance in spending time together?/Finding out if she even wants to spend time since there is a significant possibility I misread her signals and she has no interest in meeting me.</p>

<p>For reference, she is 20 and my ultimate goal is a long term relationship. But lets just start with meeting up for now.</p>

"How does one respond to statements like ""It's all yours""?","<p>There's a coffee-dispensing machine (similar in concept to a Keurig) in my apartment lobby for use by the tenants. As coffee is a popular morning beverage, occasionally I have to wait behind one or two people. The past couple days, I have had to briefly wait to use it (very minimally, less than a minute), and the person in front of me has turned around when finished and said something like ""It's all yours"" or ""I'm done.""</p>

<p>Of course, these statements could be unnecessary; they can just grab their beverage and walk away. After all, you don't yell ""I'm done"" to the car waiting behind you at the gas pump when you finish filling your tank! But I am not sure how to respond to this. I've been just muttering a ""Thank you,"" but that is also unnecessary (thanks for what? Being done? Or ""allowing"" me to use the machine?) and I'm afraid that can come across as sarcastic. </p>

The church is very loud. They are over a mile from our house and we can clearly hear every word they say into their loud-speakers. They have consistently had a service every Friday since the church opened, going from 10 AM to 7 PM at night. My father has had enough of it. My family and I were discussing methods of dealing with these loud pentecostals without being persecutive or disruptive. We are bible-believing Christians and do not agree with their religion. They are being incredibly rude and disruptive.</p>

<p>The culture here is a very tolerant culture. They tolerate almost everything instead of fixing or getting rid of the problem. The police are very corrupt and kind of racist, they wouldn't be able to do anything about it without requiring a bribe or some other method of persuasion. Even if the police made them be quieter they would just do it again just as loud or louder next week. </p>

<p>We have contemplated going to the municipal council but I don't think they would be able to do anything about it. We once complained about rock concerts that would go on until 3 AM in the morning and they enacted a curfew, but the problem is, this is a religious group and the people are very tolerant of religion.</p>

<p>My mother however, is somewhat of a weird case. Generally speaking, she tends to be quite open minded. However, in situations of distress, its like a switch flips on in her head that puts her in religious overdrive. That means she all of a sudden believes in everything her religion tells her to, prays thrice a day, follows every small superstition in the books. That's fine with me too, she's allowed to believe in whatever she wants to. The problem is that she starts enforcing her beliefs onto me. Did I mention I'm supposed to be a Hindu? That means she thinks the direction my head is facing when I sleep has an adverse affect on my long term health and other, quite frankly, absurd beliefs.</p>

<p>On numerous occasions, I have tried to tell her that I do not believe in this stuff, but somehow she always ends up guilt tripping me into doing it.

We stayed friends and, though I now live in a different country, we still keep in touch, albeit casually and not often. In real life we see each other perhaps once a year (since we share friends) and once or twice a year we chat over messages (like for birthdays). She works in a popular public place so I can always reach her in person if I wanted to and was in the country.</p>

He still refuses to admit that he copied it.</p>

<p>I changed the subject and we haven't talked about it since, but it's still in the back of my mind. Could he have done it by mistake? Maybe had the app description open while he was writing ours and been very tired? </p>

<p>How do I deal with him now? This might have been a one-off thing but nevertheless if it was plagiarism and he wasn't expecting to get caught then what happens if I catch him again? We're just starting out on a business venture together so this is kinda important I think! </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"Gentle way of asking for feedback after the first casual date?","<p>I've met someone online, and after a few very pleasant exchanges we decided to go on a casual date, which I also quite enjoyed. Ever since that moment, our online exchanges started dying down.</p>

<p>As of now I'm uncertain whether that other person did not enjoy our time together as much as I did and wants to severe ties, or we both did enjoy it, but are afraid the other party didn't like it.</p>

<p>I'm very bad at reading social cues, so if there was some nonverbal communication, I've completely missed it.</p>

<p>I've been thinking of just asking something along the lines of ""Hey I liked that time we spend together, wanna hang out some more?"", but I'm afraid that would be putting too much pressure on the other person in case they don't want to do that.</p>

<p>Is there a gentler/better way to ask for feedback than with this straightforward question?</p>

<p>P.S. Ideally, though perhaps unrealistically, I'd like to pitch the question in a way that would allow me to ask for details if the answer is ""no"". ""You've been texting someone all the time"", ""You've been interrupting me while picking your nose"" or ""I don't trust people who eat potato chips with chopsticks"" would be some invaluable feedback upon which I could improve in the future.</p>

"How to effectively dismiss persistent sellers in situations where you can't or don't want to walk away","<p><strong>The Situation</strong></p>

<p>Twice this week I have been bothered by persistent individuals looking to sell or market something, but in neither occasions has it been possible to simply walk off. </p>

<p>The first took place at my house where a person attempting to sell a product knocked on the door. I politely informed them that I am not interested in their product, they acknowledged my statement but continued to ask questions, to which I had to interrupt and say ""I said that I'm not interested"" before closing the door.</p>

<p>The second occurred at a coffee shop where I was having a conversation with another person when someone interrupted and began saying ""I'm not trying to sell you anything, but..."". Given the material they were holding, they were clearly trying to market a graduate recruitment service so I said ""Sorry; we're not interested"". Again, they ignored my intent and replied ""Not interested in having a job?"". They would not accept the fact that we are in fact employed and do not wish to be interrupted, and would not leave us alone until I had to resort again to ""I told you we are not interested. Please go away."", at which point they acted as if I had been extremely rude to them (of course, telling someone to go away is rude, but I felt out of options) before attempting to insult me (""I'm glad that I'm not your employer"") and finally walking away.</p>

<p>In both of these situations, I wished to stop the person from selling or advertising something that I have no interest in, and both individuals had interrupted something else I was doing. However, it was not possible or desirable for myself to walk away as with the answers in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/3223/appropriate-ways-to-dismiss-street-vendors"">this topic</a>, instead, it required the other person to acknowledge my disinterest and remove themselves, however, both were reluctant to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Is there an efficient way of dismissing such people without them attempting to continue marketing their service, and without appearing as rude to other individuals nearby?</p>

<p>For context, these occurred in the United Kingdom, although I expect answers would be similar for other countries.</p>

"How to deflect awkward questions when shopping for women's clothing as a man?","<p>This is going to be a bit of weird question, but I don't know how to deal with this anymore.</p>

<p>I'm an Indian guy who's recently immigrated to Britain for college. I'm also very, how to put this, interested in cross-dressing. In India, this wasn't possible for me since I lived with my parents, but a few months ago I decided to take the plunge and buy some Western woman's clothes. These clothes are not for wearing in public. That time and every time since then, no matter what store I go to, I've been asked (by the cashier or clerk most times, or sometimes by other shoppers) some variation of ""Who are you buying this for?"". Usually, I just pretend to have not heard the question and continue what I was doing, but I'm always extremely visibly embarrassed after such incidents, and in one case, the man who had asked the question kept pressing the issue. Additionally, I often want to try out items in the dressing room (I do try to do this as discreetly as possible), which makes ignoring such questions more embarrassing.</p>

<p>How do I deflect such questions politely and without public embarrassment?   I find it distasteful to lie even in these instances, but if it's the only possible thing to do given my circumstances, I would just to avoid the situation.</p>

"How can I ask my wife to share more of our responsibilities?","<p>I feel like too much of the responsibilities of being an adult fall on my shoulders, and that my wife does a lot more taking than giving in that regard. I would like our relationship to be more of an equal partnership where I feel that I benefit from it too. Don't get me wrong, I love her dearly, and the romantic side of our relationship is pretty good, but there's also a practical side of two adults living together and that's where I feel like I get a raw deal.</p>

<p>We had a big fight this morning over the silliest thing, because she was upset at me for not refilling the coffee maker after using it (which is not a thing in our house, I usually have to refill it in the morning before I use it myself.) But it really struck a raw nerve for me, and opened up an argument about how I want her to do more around the house.</p>

<p>I'm ten years into my career, and I've been quite successful at it. She's just starting out. I work 60+ hours a week, she works about 35. The difference in income is more than 10x. She keeps her money that she earns to herself and uses it for personal things, and I pay for all of our expenses, rent, food, vacations, eating out, etc., plus I give her a monthly stipend that she can spend how she likes. Given the difference in our income, I don't mind that so much - I feel she could contribute in other ways.</p>

<p>I handle the garbage, the supermarket, and the finances, bills, and taxes. I manage to get 1-3 hours each evening before bed, plus half a day off each weekend to spend with her. In order to work as much as I do and still do all of that, I have no life or friends outside of work and marriage. It's hardly balanced, but I'm happy enough like that because I know I'm working towards an early retirement and secure future for my wife and I and our future kids.</p>

<p>I think if she could just keep our tiny 500 sqft apartment clean, and have supper in the fridge for ~5 days a week (which should mean cooking 2-3 times a week.) that would be the minimum contribution. I don't think that's too much to ask.</p>

<p>In reality she gets home from work tired, spends some time unwinding with her smartphone, and then spend 1-3 hours with me watching netflix or other activities. Then she'll often stay up late on her phone again, and I go to bed early because I get up at 4:30 and start work. She gets up late, gets ready and goes straight to work.</p>

<p>The dishes pile up, the kitchen, floors, and surfaces get dirty and accumulate junk. It gets worse all week until near the end of the weekend when she finally makes an effort to do something about it. It's a good week when the apartment is relatively clean by the time the next week begins, but that's rare. She cooks about as often as I do, which is maybe once every two weeks. I got fed up last weekend and spent a couple hours vacuuming and packing things away, but I really don't have time for that.</p>

<p>If she can't pull her weight now, how would things be when we have children together? When we have a larger place and all the demanding needs of children? The thought terrifies me because I can't take any additional responsibility, and I'm scared I'll end up having to carry most of that alone too. There's no take-backs on the decision to have children.</p>

<p>I need things to change soon and gain some level of confidence that I won't be alone in this before it comes time to start a family. I don't know how to approach it. We argue over this a couple times a year but nothing ever really changes. There are some short term changes, and then that terrible smartphone comes out again and things start to degenerate until we're back to where we were.</p>

<p>I know it's hard to paint an accurate picture of a marriage in just a few words, and harder still given you only are getting my side of things. But I'm really at the end of my rope here and I don't know what else to do.</p>

"Relationship with a stalker: I want to get over it. How can I stop her if she stalk me again and how not to fall to her trap again?","<p>Summary of my problem:</p>

<p>I've been in a difficult relationship the last few years. 
Let's call her Helen.</p>

<p>We dated for a while, but after some time she left again.</p>

<p>This went on several times: she breaks up with me, came back after some time, I forgive her, repeat. After some time she started to stalk me, wait me at my frondoor, etc.</p>

<p>I was constantly afraid to meet her somewhere. I was scared to go home, knowing her inclinations, I would not be surprised to learn that she is waiting for me inside, creeping under any excuses.</p>

<p>I was used by her as much as possible because of my inability to refuse.</p>

<p><strong>I want to get over it. How can I stop her if she stalk me again and how not to fall to her trap again?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Details:</p>

<p>Helen was a rather strange girl.</p>

<p>In further communication, I learned more and more details about her character and history, and her strangeness became more understandable for me. Helen was a very self-contained girl. She always reacted sharply to the touch of other people. If someone tried to pat her on the shoulder or take her hand in a friendly way at the club, she always dared to scare away or even fight back. I've never seen such a reaction before. Yes, there are people who do not like physical contact, but even in the worst case they just rudely say to not be touched, but to fight so desperately ... This behavior was like the behavior of a puppy who was obused all his short life, and now he fears people and every touch.</p>

<p>Helen did not have any friends. I mean literally, not even one. Yes, I'm also an introvert, I'm not very good with people, and I do not have friends either, but at least there are people with whom I constantly communicate, I go out and spend time with them. Helen had only books and tea. And now me.</p>

<p>But, dammit, I loved her. And I wanted to help her overcome her problems and normally join the society. </p>

<p>When she was a child, her parents used to quarrel a lot. And divorced. She stayed with an abusive mother. She screamed at her. She insulted her with strong expressions. She beat her. She called her muddle and useless, even though her grades were always impeccable. She bought a dog, although she knew full well that her daughter was panicly afraid of dogs. They lived together and Helen had no one to turn to for help. She did not want to go home anymore.</p>

<p>And then, like a bolt from the blue, she proposed to break up. Without explanation. I did not yield to persuasion. We stopped talking. </p>

<p>A few months later she came to the club. Imposed a conversation and offered to resume the relationship. I could not refuse, because I wanted it.<br>
We dated for a while, but after some time she left again.</p>

<p>This went on several times: she breaks up with me, came back after some time, I forgive her, repeat. After some time she started to stalk me, wait me at my frondoor, etc.</p>

<p>Then it all turned into paranoia. I was constantly afraid to meet her somewhere. I was scared to go home, knowing her inclinations, I would not be surprised to learn that she is waiting for me inside, creeping under any exuses. This brought me trouble, so I went to extreme measures. I talked to her. I put the conditions that this time is the last. If she do it again, I will not forgive her anymore. At that moment, I just wanted to get rid of her, because I was 100% sure that it would not last long. Again.</p>

<p>And it happened. She left, less than three months.</p>

<p>I was used by her as much as possible because of my inability to refuse.</p>

<p>I tried to distract myself. I started going to the gym. I tried to get other relationships. But no matter how much I try, I can not feel the mental closeness with other girls. </p>

<p>I want to get over it. How can I stop her if she stalk me again and how not to fall to her trap again?</p>

"As a pedestrian, how to get someone to stop following you in a car?","<p>Sorry, I just never had these situations occur until I moved into a neighborhood.</p>

<p>Usually, we (well, my dogs) get most of our exercise in a large, unused field near my house. The people on our way and around the field know me, so it's rarely an issue. But it's wet and rainy today, so I was taking the dogs for a long walk. They were on short leashes, in broad rainy-daylight.</p>

<p>When I walk the dogs, I allow them to be dogs. They are allowed to stop and sniff and ""read"" the neighborhood dog-gossip. So our walks take quite a long time.</p>

<p>As I was walking, a car driven by a stranger (male) slowed down to my creeping pace and stayed there. At first, I just ignored him, but after a few minutes, I just looked straight at him. He didn't roll the window down, so I didn't try to talk. He just stared back. So we continued in this fashion, me letting my dogs walk at their pace, him creeping along just a bit behind me.  </p>

<p>Finally, I gave in, walked to the driver's side and asked him to roll down his window.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Why are you following me?<br>
  Him: I want to make sure you don't let your dogs take a dump on someone's lawn.<br>
  Me: They did already; it's in this bag (I hold up the smelly evidence.)<br>
  Him: You wouldn't be the first person to let their dog take a dump on someone's lawn.<br>
  Me: Well, it won't happen today, not with my dogs anyway.<br>
  Him: And I'm going to make sure it doesn't. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I walk away and he continues to follow me. There was no response to my looks or my request to please stop following me.</p>

<p>I didn't have my cell phone with me, so I can't call the police, or take a picture of his car's plate. I was kind of afraid to walk to my house; I didn't want this creepy guy to know where I lived (my dogs aren't vicious.) Finally, I just stopped walking and waited him out. He left.</p>

<p>Clearly, the exchange wasn't a friendly one. (I'm beginning to wonder about this neighborhood. Life on the farm was a bowl of cherries, neighbor-wise.)</p>

<p>Is there a way this exchange could have been handled better on my part? (Please keep in mind I'm reluctant to introduce myself to someone silently following me in their car.) </p>

"How to best approach sibling about showering & brush teeth at an earlier time, or elsewhere in Jack & Jill setting as to not wake me up?","<p><strong>I'm not sure if this would better belong in parenting stack</strong> I am happy to provide more information to try and help solve this. Culture context: Chinese Canadian.</p>

<p><strong>Problem summary</strong>: My sibling (mid 20s) takes a shower and brushes teeth late at night (after midnight around 1 to 1:30 AM) which wakes me up as I try to sleep because we now live in a Jack and Jill setting(bathroom between 2 rooms). I would like to think the best way to approach this would be to simply explain my problem of sleep being interrupted and offer solutions, but it's ignored.</p>

<p>I suppose they believe I shouldn't need so much sleep (I find I need 8-10 hours), and I should live like them sleeping late.</p>

<p><strong>Related-ish Details:</strong> </p>

<p>They are plenty of ""issues"" with my sibling. Enough text that it could belong in another post in parenting or interpersonal stack exchange. In summary (with regards to Steven Covey's 7 Habits of Effective People) they live a very ""pleasure centered"" life. Otherwise they ""hate waking up"" which may be part of why they sleep late not wanting to go to sleep and deal with another day. They tend to wake up around past noon 2-3 PM.</p>

<p>I haven't dealt with their ""issues"" really as I'm not the parent. I have some resentment for the sibling due to the dislike of me and refusal to share in childhood, and I've been very busy with my own share of work (school and work terms). I don't find I have as much time or interest to drown in video games and shows to have easy common interests to speak of.</p>

<p>Sibling doesn't seem to care about anything besides enjoying their debaucherous lifestyle of doing whatever they want whenever they want. They have a part time job (I don't get an impression they don't care or seem to be trying very hard to get full time somewhere), play a lot of video games, watch movies/TV and browse the net in their room on their desktop or phone when out of room. They don't really contribute any housework either, and they don't really care about anything our parents try to get them to do or ask. My parents seem more and more resigned as time passes.</p>

<p>I've previously tried getting them to go to the gym with me, but they don't accept the invitation, despite they fact I believe they've had a gym membership for a very long time.</p>

<p>I haven't been living in this house for very long as I've been very busy doing school and work terms elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Possible solutions/approaches and my thoughts of how they may fail. I thought it would be best to propose a few solutions to my sibling rather than nag them about the problem.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Ask sibling to shower and brush teeth in grandparent's downstairs bathroom where it won't wake me up? </p>

<p>Caveats: They probably don't even want to the walk down there despite the short distance, see/hear/smell grandparent, plus it smells like old person. They'll also probably ask why can't I sleep in grandparents room instead if I suggest this. Also maybe this isn't really fair to grandparent to possibly be woken up? However grandparent is quite old (high 90s in age, dementia, etc) and hard of hearing though, they spend plenty of time sleeping. Nowadays since grandparent can't do stairs sibling can conveniently spend most of their time upstairs and never have to deal with them.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Ask sibling to shower and brush teeth earlier, even going as far as to ask them to do it everyday ~10PM, again.</p>

<p>Caveats: Done this before they don't really care, and even when I nag them to do it earlier they necessarily won't. Plus they might be ""too busy"" in the middle of a online game they can't pause, or want to finish an entire movie or TV episode. Like many humans they don't like being told what to do, or asked to do something.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Months ago I said something the lines of ""hey can you shower earlier so it happens before I try to sleep?""</strong></p>

<p><strong>The reactions I get is annoyance and disbelief, and essentially lip service to that it'll be done which it doesn't.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Get parents to ask sibling to shower and brush teeth earlier.</p>

<p>Caveats: They'll just ignore it as usual, or pay lip service temporarily. My interpretation is their habit and endless debauchery is more important than my sleep. How to make this a habit to stick and make sibling want to do this is what this solution lacks.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> I go sleep in the basement where I'll be stuck dealing with the noise of the water tank and heater instead.</p>

<p>This could attempt to avoid the problem but it doesn't really solve the problem of a lack of respect, and I don't like the idea of letting sibling just walk over everyone else in the house and setting another precedent of they can do whatever they want and everyone else has to work around them. Also problem doesn't necessarily get solved as now I have the water tank and heater instead.</p>

<p>I suppose I can try them all. I have previously slept with ear plugs however I don't enjoy it and don't want to be wasting money on ear plugs for every single night. Ultimately I feel rather pessimistic as I don't understand how you can really negotiate with a party that doesn't really care or consider your needs reasonable.</p>

<p>Later I hope to move out once I get full time work elsewhere, but that'll be in the future. I would appreciate any advice I can get, perhaps I am approaching the problem wrong and I must solve other related problems.</p>

<p>I previously read Crucial Conversations a long time ago but still feel like I'm at a loss of how to approach this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Upon proposing solution 1 and 2 to my sibling I was brushed off with as many ""yep"" and ""yeahs"" quickly to get rid of my, as I was interrupting them in a turn based card game, which doesn't demand immediate undying attention in my opinion.</strong></p>

"How to acquire information from a confrontational stranger","<p>I recently encountered a situation where I felt it was important to ask a stranger what they were doing/if everything was alright or prompt them to explain themselves, however, after they acted confrontationally I lost my nerve and did not say anything. I have often thought back and wondered what would have been the best way to avoid conflict/defuse any escalating situations if I <strong>did</strong> attempt to acquire that information.</p>

<h2>The Scenario</h2>

<p>I was on the bus home, 3 girls and 2 boys aged 15-17 guided a young girl aged 6-8 on (whom I had noticed 30 min earlier shopping with her parents and made some idle elevator chatter to the father when he dropped some coins). </p>

<p>There are another 6 or so people scattered around the bus. The group sit near me, and are quite loud so I overhear parts of their conversations. Attempting to be as objective as possible, this is what I could gather. They talked about seeing the girl and her parents at the shops, they said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know why I got so mad?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and explained it was because of how the parents were treating their daughter badly by rudely refusing some request. There were a few other mentions of some conflict at the shops. They said that their next stop were some clubs and they were going to get very drunk. Next they addressed the girl in a way that seemed to me as though they did not really know her or what to do with her. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ooh yeah, we should probably feed the girl, lets stop by a food shop,
  I'm not buying. (then addressing the girl) Little girl, are you
  hungry?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note: my question is <strong>NOT</strong> about about anything other than Interpersonal Skills for avoiding conflict.</em></p>

<p>Ignoring any subconscious bias I may have and although the young girl did not look distressed at all and other than being obnoxious/swearing the group had done nothing wrong, I had heard enough that I felt it was important to somehow check if everything was alright. While mulling over how to ask what was going on in a way that avoids conflict the group noticed me and said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop talking, people can hear us... This weirdo (gesture at me) is staring at us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I was staring, and obviously that wasn't the best method but I will explain it away as subconscious since I was about/attempting to engage in a conversation with them. This confrontation threw me off, I awkwardly looked away and put in headphones until eventually they left. And when I got off I promptly phoned the non-urgent police line with a description and plenty of emphasis on the fact that there was a distinct possibility that there was nothing wrong after all (there was still a good chance they were just transporting her to another relative or something).</p>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>My condition is to acquiring (or attempting to acquire) enough information so my worries for the girls safety can be put to rest. Obviously guaranteed conflict aversion won't be possible but I would like to know how to do this before they noticed me, after they noticed me and in the case where our interaction escalates, using IPS in a way that minimises the conflict.</p>

"Handling questions about new tattoo from friends and coworkers","<p>I recently got a tattoo of a semicolon on my wrist. If you haven't heard of semicolon tattoos <a href=""https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-a-semicolon-tattoo-is-the-most-beautiful-tattoo/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here is a link to a website</a> that explains it better than I could. The TL;DR is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A semicolon is used when an author could’ve chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to. The author is you, and the sentence is your life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically it is a reminder to not commit suicide.</p>

<p>So, it's a bit of a personal meaning, which I am fine discussing, but it's also a little intense to spring on someone from an innocent question about my tattoo. </p>

<p>What is the best way to handle questions from friends and coworkers? The conversations usually start something like </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Them:</strong> Is that a tattoo? What is it of?<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> A semicolon.<br>
  <strong>Them:</strong> What? Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My closest friends know about my struggle with depression, but many of my 
acquaintances don't, and none of my coworkers do. I work in a fairly professional setting as an Engineer.</p>

<p>It appears that I wasn't super clear as to how I ideally would want the discussion to go. @Taegost articulated my goals better than I could <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/6417/8441"">in this answer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It sounds to me like you want to be open about it, but to start off the conversation on a light note, trying to keep it from being awkward while still allowing the conversation to progress naturally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My goal here is to be open and talk about it/my story/mental health as a whole without sucking people into a pretty dark rabbit hole from an innocent question</p>

"How to tell a professor that I don't mind if he is busy?","<p>Sorry this got a little long...</p>

<p>I am self-studying a course. Two years ago I began to use some lectures by a professor from the United States (I'm from a different country). He is retired now. While watching his lectures, I began to have some questions about the topics. So I usually sent him an email which he usually replies to quickly. This has been going for a long time and I am extremely grateful that he almost always found time to answer my questions and even answer my follow up questions.</p>

<p>Last month, I sent him an email. He didn't respond. This is perfectly understandable because he might be very busy. The next day I sent him another email asking another question, and he responded to wait for a week before he can answer me because he has been very busy. I'm pretty ashamed at this point because I'm not sure if I am annoying him already.</p>

<p>Finally, yesterday I thought he is no longer busy, I sent him an email to ask another question. He responded something like this (not exact words):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry it looks like I am ignoring you. I have been very busy and
  answering your questions isn't a small amount of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then proceeds to answer my question and asked if I understood.</p>

<p>Now I began to panic because he felt that he is ignoring me. The thing is I don't feel ignored at all. I know he's busy. In fact when I first started sending emails my hope is he would reply just a few times. I never expected he would help me a lot by always replying to my emails.</p>

<p>So my question is: how can I tell this professor that I don't feel ignore by him because I know he can be very busy and just answer my questions if he has the time? And also, if it matters, how can I express that I am extremely grateful he even answers my questions at all? I am not even one of his students. I just know about him through his lecture videos.</p>

<p>I am not sure what to do because I don't know the culture of the United States and I might offend him somehow by replying rashly. This professor has been very kind to me, and I do not wish to do something that might offend him.</p>

"How to react when my girlfriend allows others to insult me to her?","<p>I've been dating my girlfriend for six months. She's a very nice person and always goes out of her way to make everyone feel happy and appreciated. She's kind no matter what others do/say to her.</p>

<p>She's a fairly sociable person and our relationship is well-known. People often feel the need to give her their opinion on me/us. She usually ignores them and responds passively. However, this has crossed the line a couple times, in which other men have insulted me to her (over text), such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know, I've never liked your boyfriend. You should break up with him.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>(response) Surprise... and I don't really know.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You're way too good for him, he's a gross P.O.S. You deserve better, especially with that body.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>(response) Yeah I know. And thanks.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When I asked her about previous similar messages/chats, she said she was just letting them think she agreed to avoid confrontation and keep a friend. But I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who thought that way about my SO. Furthermore, I have no way of knowing that she was really lying to them; her texts did seem authentic and the people were convinced that she didn't have real feelings for me.</p>

<p>Should I just accept that we're different and that she'll tell others whatever they want to hear, while in reality she is happy in our relationship? Or am I right in getting worried about her reactions to their comments? I don't like her letting others walk all over me (or compliment her about her physical appearance, which just doesn't feel right).</p>

<p>How should I react in this situation, with the intention of continuing this relationship, but not at the expense of my self-esteem or having the risk of being cheated on? I love her but I don't want to be in a toxic relationship in which she goes behind my back and tells lies. What do I do?</p>

"How to make friends in an online math community (AoPS)","<p>I am from a school in a city in Dallas, Texas and an math olympiad enthusiast, but unfortunately no friend of mine in my school/city is really interested in maths. And going to any math club is not feasible for me due to I having a weird timing slot.</p>

<p>So I did what most math olympiad enthusiasts do - join a site called <a href=""https://artofproblemsolving.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Art of Problem Solving</a>. People like me usually make friends and discuss about math with people who are also math olympiad enthusiasts from that site, but how to do that ?</p>

<p>I can't simply private message some user whom I don't know  and ask ""Hey do you want to be my friend so that we can work on some olympiad problems together online and discuss them"", because that may be simply count as stalking.</p>

<p>Also, some guys make friends on that site by discussing problems and sending each other problems to work on, but I don't think that may be a good idea, because if I send a person X a problem/discuss alternative ways of solving something with X regarding some of his solution on some problem, then if he finds it interesting, then OK. But if X doesn't finds it interesting but he finds it too rude to mention that ""I don't find the stuff you're talking to interesting"", then it can go in the opposite direction.</p>

"How should I text a guy I liked on LinkedIn?","<p>I have been co-workers with this guy for a little bit over a year but didn’t get to see him often except when we both showed up at company parties.</p>

<p>He seemed to be interested in me. First approached me to start a conversation at one party and then asked me out for a drink at the end of another company get-together. But somehow it felt a bit like a booty call, and I wasn’t in the right place to start anything, so I didn’t take him up on it that time. </p>

<p>After radio silence for almost half a year, he connected me on LinkedIn while I just started a process of leaving this company. He might’ve heard of something. But after we connected, he never texted or interacted with me in any ways. </p>

<p>It’s been another six months, and I’ve been busy with job searches and a lot of stuff in life. Now that things have settled a bit, I would like to at least have a coffee with him and see if there are still possibilities. I’m not sure whether he’s looking for the same thing, but at least I don’t want to have regrets for any longer. Things that recently happened in my life have changed my perspectives and I don’t want to wait for the perfect moment for things to happen any more. </p>

<p>The problem is I don’t really text guys first, ever. But outside of LinkedIn, we don’t really have any other means of contact. So it’s not possible to just “bump into” him. I’m thinking about text him like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey,  long time no see. Thanks for connecting with me. How are you?</p>

<p>And see how things go. </p>

<p>How can I get back in touch with a soon-to-be ex-colleague that I'm interested in when the only way I have of contacting him is via LinkedIn? I'd like to make him aware that this is not a casual thing but a friendly coffee to get to know each other.</p>

"How to find out how my father would like us to decide for him with regard to medical treatment?","<p>So, this weekend my mom and dad both signed some official paperwork, which my dad handed to me with a 'read it carefully please'. The paperwork gives me and my brothers the power to make decisions for our parents with regard to finances but also medical stuff when they can't make those decisions themselves and the other parent also can't make them. They're not in trouble yet, but they are both in their fifties and realize that this could save both their partner and us kids a whole lot of trouble if something actually happened. </p>

<p>Basically, they've ensured that doctors can disclose their medical information to us, so we can make decisions about their treatment for them. </p>

<p>Now, my dad <strong>never</strong> talks about things like whether he wants to be an organ donor (even mom doesn't know), let alone that I can get information from him on whether he wants e.g. treatments that only extend his life but will never cure him, or what he still considers 'quality of life'.</p>

<p>Basically, I now have a document giving me and my brothers the power to make decisions. But the document doesn't give any guidance on the medical part (there are some wishes in the financial part of the document). </p>

<p>My brothers and I tried to get a conversation about it going this weekend, but although my mom answered some of our questions about her wishes, our dad remained quiet (not even a 'don't know' or 'never thought about it'). </p>

<p>After a few minutes, he tried to shut down the conversation, without explanation. I gave it one last try, telling him something about my own viewpoints on unnecessary medical treatment (which are pretty extreme), and explaining that if I didn't know his point of view, I would go by my own compass and thus might make the wrong decision for him. He wasn't convinced and didn't show any reaction. There was nothing that encouraged us to believe he genuinely wants us to make the decisions for him without having his input, but also nothing that indicates that he needs time to think about it and will inform us when he has made up his mind.   </p>

<p>We later tried getting some answers from my mom, but basically </p>

<ul>
<li>We don't know why he doesn't want to talk about it, only that he seems to loathe the subject. </li>
<li>We all have no clue what his wishes are.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, one way or another, we have to get that conversation going. Because I don't like having this responsibility but not knowing what he wants us to decide, and neither do my mom and brothers. </p>

<p><strong>How do I make my dad realize that he has to think about this stuff and provide us with some guidelines? How do I get him to provide us with information on his last wishes?</strong></p>

<p>I've no interest in the skill myself, but I feel odd giving her a gift to do completely on her own.
Ideally I'd like to go with her, and sit at the side, so that afterwards we can still talk about it, etc. (I.e. it becomes at least a shared experience).</p>

<p>But since I'm not interested in actually doing the skill itself, I'd prefer not to pay for a second (moderately expensive) ticket.
Naturally, I wouldn't expect to be a part of the (practical) workshop in any sense.</p>

  Receptionist: Okay, it will be with Dr. xxxxxx. Can I ask what the reason for the appointment is?</p>

"How do you deal with colleagues and people around you constantly passing judgement on you for not knowing something?","<p>I'm unique in a lot of ways. I don't like sports, I'm not in touch with the current affairs, I don't have any opinion on most things and I don't know about most of the things that people talk about.</p>

<p>Despite me not offending anyone, people get offended by the fact that I don't know xyz. It could be anything of the topics that I mentioned in the first paragraph.

"How to handle people blocking your view and breaking the rules at the theater by not sitting in their assigned seats?","<p>A while ago, my parents/brothers and I went to visit a theatre performance (in The Netherlands, where we live). We booked really nice first class tickets with empty seats in front of us. We booked them very last-minute, hoping we would be lucky, and we were. A few of the seats in front of us were still empty during the performance. After the break, what looked like a mother and her daughter (in her early teens) entered the row in front of us, and stopped at the seats in front of me and my dad. </p>

<p>I clearly overheard their talk, and the girl was telling her mother that these were not their seats, that their seats were about 5 rows further back. Her mother tried to keep up the act that these were their seats though. In the end, she noticed they now had our attention, and asked us 'Are these seats taken?'. </p>

<p>Mom and dad were hesitating, so I just cut in: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No, these seats aren't taken. And no, they will not be taken either. We booked our seats this way, so maybe no one would be in front of us. I clearly overheard your daughter telling you that you booked seats about five rows further back, so please go to the seats assigned to you on your ticket, or I will go and fetch an attendant to remind you where they are. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Might be of interest that we booked 1st class tickets, and that about 2 rows further back, 2nd class started. So they were basically trying to get a free upgrade. <strong>Also note that taking seats that aren't assigned to you is breaking the theatre's house rules.</strong> </p>

<p>Despite my answer, the mother sat down, and pulled the girl into a chair as well, the girl already looked majorly uncomfortable and embarassed at this point. So, I got up, didn't engage the mother further, fetched the nearest attendant like I had promised, and they came with me to remove them to their own seats. </p>

<p>The girl's mother started insulting my mom, telling her she had done a poor job raising me, that the only thing she did right was feeding me (I am overweight, ouch). At this point, only the attendant's presence probably prevented this from escalating into a proper, physical fight. This ladies remarks managed to take away some of the good spirits we were in that evening, despite us all having had a really good time up to that moment, and us trying to dismiss/joke it off afterwards. We were all a bit less cheery for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>While the attendant escorted mom and her daughter to their proper seats, 
I started feeling bad for the girl, she was looking so embarrassed with the way her mom was behaving, we were feeling less cheery but she was close to tears. </p>

<p>I get the impression something in my response/actions triggered all of this, but I can't really put a finger on what it was. 
<strong>So, next time someone takes seating not assigned to them, how can I handle the situation in a way that won't make the other person feel a need to be nasty and ruin our cheerfulness, while at the same time prevent possible children of being embarassed by their parent's behavior?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>There have been a lot of comments saying it's not 'my job to enforce the rules' or that these people were perfectly entitled to take those seats, so to clarify a bit further to avoid this confusion:</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, it's perfectly acceptable (and even expected) to point out to people that they're breaking a rule and inconveniencing you, before getting any authorities involved. People talking in a silence carriage, people smoking outside of smoking areas, people taking seats that aren't theirs to take, neighbors causing stench by having 30 dogs: It's expected you point out that there's rule they're breaking, that they're inconveniencing you, and only after go fetch an authority. </p>

<p>So yeah, while it's technically not my job to 'enforce' the rules by physically moving these strangers to their proper seats, it's my 'job' (duty?) to tell them, <em>when seeing people trying to take seats that aren't theirs, and being asked whether these seats are free</em>, that these seats may be free but not theirs to take according to the rules of the theater, and to let them know breaking it will get them into trouble.</p>

<p>If they hadn't asked, and I had seen them commit the offense, I could've silently flagged an attendant or pointed out their mistake to them in a more gentle way, like 'Hey, we didn't see you here before the break, did you miss the beginning?'. But by asking whether the seats are free (which, as LordFarquaad pointed out in <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/17882/1599"">their answer</a> is equal to confessing you're trying to commit an offense), the burden was up to us to tell them that they were trying to break the rules being fully aware of them (which is slightly worse than unknowingly breaking a rule). </p>

<p>A lot of people might be thinking that I'm only taking offense to the seat being occupied, but the combination of them deliberately breaking the rules in combination with them not paying for the seats and limiting a view, all while engaging us in the process, is what makes it worthwhile enough to be assertive.</p>

"How should I deal with a close relative that ""uses"" my possessions?","<p>Anybody who has a sibling when growing up knows what it means to get his/her possessions taken without giving any permission, especially if they are the same sex and around the same age. This is somehow ""normal"" when very young.</p>

<p>The problem for me is that my brother is still acting in this way, even if we are both in our 30s.</p>

<p>We don't live together and we don't even meet very often, but for some reasons we still have a lot of possessions that are in ""shared"" spaces. For instance, we have a family vacation house in the mountains where we both occasionally go during the holidays. I used to keep there some clothes, some bikes and a lot of other stuff to make my holidays more pleasant.</p>

<p>What does my brother do then? I can give you a few examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Very often I find my clothes dirty or somehow ruined. For instance, once he used some of my ""vacation"" clothes to work in the garden and to paint and they were basically unusable after that. When confronted he shrugged it off as ""well they were old and at least now there are some working clothes around here"".</p></li>
<li><p>One year he sold some of our old bikes (which belonged to our grandfather) without even consulting me. When confronted he's comment was ""well they were not really yours, were they? At least I freed some space"".</p></li>
<li><p>One year he told me he was using my ""good"" bike to get around. When I went there after a few weeks he was not using it anymore. I tried to use it and discovered that was broken and needed some costly work of maintenance. I asked him about it and he said that when he used it last time it was COMPLETELY fine, perfect. Nobody else used it though.</p></li>
<li><p>More than once it happened that I left some tool in the apartment of my parents and found it broken after a few weeks. After a quick investigation, I discovered that he had used it multiple times.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This happens very frequently for a lot of stuff and when confronted he generally gets very aggressive, at the point of threatening physical violence if I insist on his responsibilities. He never offers to ""repay"" something he broke or to help in any way. He always answers that what he did was perfectly acceptable (even when mostly it isn't) or that he was not responsible (when clearly there is no other excuse).</p>

<p>My parents (that are still alive and in their 60s) are generally very passive about this. They somehow understand that he occasionally has this behavior but (and I agree with them here) don't want to intrude. Sometimes they offered to repay for his damages but I have always refused because I really don't think they are responsible in any way. The only reason I include them in this question is because they are the main reason I still interact with my brother and it may be relevant.</p>

<p>So well the question is, how should I deal with someone like him? At the moment my strategy is to just avoid him, and be more careful with my properties. I try not to leave my things around him and such, but, as you can guess, this causes my some inconveniences. Any other idea?</p>

"How to encourage people to not make/cancel travel plans based solely on my personal opinion?","<p>I live in a city in the UK that is hosting some competitive sporting events in coming months. From my time at university and beyond, I have made a number of friends and acquaintances across the globe, some of which are interested in the sports involved. They mainly come from North America and Asia. Many have been messaging me asking if it is worthwhile travelling to attend these events. Many of them - from the wording of their messages - assume that because I live in the city, that I automatically have an interest in the sports involved.</p>

<p>The problem is that I have no interest whatsoever in these events and thus have never tried to learn more about them. I would normally recommend a friend or acquaintance who also lives in the city that they could ask for pointers from, but nobody in my extended circle is interested either. To my knowledge, I have never lead anyone to assume that I do like these sports.</p>

<p>Personally, I find the events to be quite inconvenient due to road closures, effects on public transport etc., but I keep these opinions to myself as I don't want to discourage an avid fan from attending (and it's the price you pay for living in the city!). When someone asks for info or if I'm interested, I don't mention these inconveniences, nor say anything hurtful or extreme; just that it's not my cup of tea, but they ought to check out web sites or Facebook groups for people that might be. I'm always still happy to catch up with them in person if they come visit though, and the city has plenty to offer besides hosting these events. I'd hate to lie to them because I know virtually nothing about the sports, I really can't say if the long trips are worth it just for those.</p>

<p>On my opinion alone, some are feeling discouraged or are seriously considering cancelling their trip because it's not worth it if <em>I'm</em> not excited about it. For many I suspect I'm their only regular point of contact here. My questions are; How can I encourage them to <em>not</em> base their judgements purely on my own opinion (without ignoring them or lying)? Similarly, how can I suggest to them to do some digging into groups that would be interested without coming across as dismissive?</p>

"Politely declining a request to use my railway card to get a ticket when the person has to stand in the queue","<h1>Background:</h1>

<p>I'm from India. In our railways, we have multiple ways of booking tickets, one of them being the regular way (stand in the queue) and the other, a card which lets you get your ticket printed on a separate machine. You can recharge a fixed amount on the card as required.</p>

<h1>Situation:</h1>

<p>I use the said card and frequently get requests from people (strangers) to book their tickets (of course they'll pay me) so that they can avoid the usually long queue. I personally want to politely decline due to: </p>

<ol>
<li>This said card is very easy to get</li>
<li>I wouldn't ask someone myself if I were in their position. I would wait in the queue. </li>
<li>Due to this problem, there are even railway employees who sit at these machines, offering to print tickets. This is another alternative and while there's still a queue, they can go there.</li>
</ol>

<p>I do make exceptions: if the person looks like they're especially in a hurry/seem desperate/disabled/senior citizen whatever... I do book it.</p>

<p>So far, I've taken the easy way out by saying ""I'm in a hurry."", a white lie: which may be an etiquette issue? Besides that, have also felt I need to justify my, perhaps unexplained and possibly rude, refusal. </p>

<p>So I thought of something along the lines of explaining point 1. Adding how unfair it would be to the others standing in the line if I ""favoured"" this person by booking (Point 3). But I'm afraid that might lead to the person becoming more defensive. </p>

<h1>Question:</h1>

<p>Is it good etiquette to state my rationale while declining such requests? Either case, how to refuse in such scenarios in as polite a way as possible? </p>

<p><sub>I don't mind if someone ignores cultural context here since general etiquette will help all, including me. But please mention it if you do so!</sub></p>

<p>I am not afraid to be fired--my contract will end soon. Yet, I am too afraid to speak directly. Why? </p>

<ol>
<li>I will get a panic attack, my voice will change like I am crying.</li>
<li>Because by this I admit that I am weak and he is strong. He constantly in needs to show his supremacy.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Is my only goal to inform the boss about how I feel?</strong> </p>

<p>Probably, this is the only feasible thing. People do not change. I just want to work in a quiet atmosphere for a few remaining months. I want to finalize 3 papers for him. I already have invitations to work from two different countries and weighing my options. I am fully independent on him, nor do I need his recommendation in the future.</p>

<p><strong>However, do I want to tell him soon, or would doing so after your contract expires be enough?</strong></p>

<p>That is what I was thinking, I can write a letter to him, wrap it in a nice envelope and put it in his mail box. Good... I learn hiding and escaping. Nothing new for me and  nothing to show my children as an example. They know the situation and even offered me some help to talk with my boss.</p>

<p><strong>Do I want to offend him back?</strong></p>

<p>No, I want to act with dignity.</p>

"Explaining to a parent that they shouldn't yell ambiguous commands because you have misophonia?","<p>Suppose there is a bottle of dried basil and a bottle of curcuma on the shelf, and your mother tells you to pass her the basil but points at the curcuma. You would be puzzled at whether to interpret the auditory cue and pass the bottle of basil or interpret the visual cue and pass the bottle of curcuma. If you had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">misophonia</a> and your mother yelled this order at you, you might want her to stop shouting and respond -- asking her, ""What the hell do you want me to do?"" Your mother could respond with, ""Come on, beat it!""</p>

<p>The trigger misophonia sounds here are simply the mother using a coarse shouting voice to speak. The more this voice is used the more unbearable it becomes.</p>

<p>I have explained it to my mother on hundreds of occasions, but she either acted as though she was ignoring the problem or as though she didn't know what to do. It wouldn't be very constructive for me to say she bloody well knows what she's doing, maybe I shouldn't be angry about it, she's been nicer lately, but how do I make her understand that shouting commands at me is counter productive?</p>

"Someone else using my cooler without my permission","<p>This might be very intuitive for someone to suggest me to ask him to put it back. But please hold on. </p>

<p>I live in a hostel and changed room to the next room which had a cooler already (owned by my new roommate). I put mine outside in the corridor which is a common practice. The old cooler was bought by me last year and left in the corridor because of space crunch. The new person in my old room has started using it now without asking me.</p>

<p>Scene: he is my hostel mate but we never talked. He is not new here (he came to the college 2 years ago, in the same batch/hall as me).</p>

  <p>The person/ people living in (room) currently, uses/ use a cooler without the permission of the owner and most probably even without paying the additional cooler charges. </p>
  
  <p>Just because I or anyone else might make them put it back outside doesn’t make them less of a thief. It will be called a reclamation. </p>

  This mail doesn’t need to be shared with anyone else in the hall if it doesn’t concern them.

"How to reject a proposal from a close friend?","<p>I have been friends with a girl at work for more than a year. I have always seen her as a friend and I am pretty sure I never did anything to lead her on. I am going to switch jobs in a couple of months. I told her this a month ago. From that time she has been acting a little strange. She always comes by my desk during work hours, constantly texts and calls me. But I thought she was reacting because I was leaving from the workplace. </p>

<p>A week ago, her sister got married. I was at the wedding and it was amazing. Myself and a few friends at work had the best time! She was really happy. The next day she told me that she had feelings for me. She also revealed that she had a crush on me for more than seven months before we started speaking. She clearly says that she is in love with me and wants to spend the rest of her life with me.</p>

<p>She is a really sweet girl, but I never considered her more than a friend. I would like to tell her ""No"", without ruining our friendship. She really supports me and helps me in making decisions. Also, her sister has just moved out of the house so she seems a little sad. Yesterday, she brought up the topic again and asked me what my answer was. I wanted to tell her ""No"" but just don't want to hurt her feelings. </p>

<p>How do I explain this to her without her getting hurt/our friendship getting ruined? </p>

<p>EDIT:
She also expects a reason why I am rejecting her (if my answer is NO which it is)?!</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Everything went well. I moved to another country after a few months. I told her that she's a great person and I hope she understands that I have other things to do in life and I am not ready for a relationship. Also I told her that we're friends now and will always be. I told her that there is no guarantee that if we get into a relationship, that it will go on forever. But this will go on forever. Its best if things stay the way they are. I also said, I have a great deal of respect for her and she'll always be a special person in my life. She was kind and gracious enough to understand. It's been eight months and we're still great friends. Thanks for all the advice!</p>

"When is it good to argue with someone vs ignoring them?","<p>When should you express your disagreement versus ignoring the person?</p>

<p>I have a flat mate who is very bossy. He was telling me not to use the back door as it's only used for emergencies. He's not the landlord and he says these sorts of things often. I ignore him. I've tried talking with him before but it goes nowhere.</p>

<p>I was speaking with a friend who was complaining someone in a club he was part of was being bossy and telling people what to do. I told my friend just don't do what he's telling you to. My friend replied it would come off as passive aggressive and he cares about the club and respects the person even though he was being bossy. He rather argue with him.</p>

<p>So when is it a good idea to speak up and say you disagree with something as opposed to just ignoring it? (I ask this question assuming it's not work related and no money is involved)</p>

"How to clarify to a person that I don't want her to talk to me about a certain topic anymore?","<p>Every time my grandmother talks to me (everyday since I live in their house for almost a year now) she brings up a sensitive topic.
This situation has been going on for about 4 months now and I can’t stand it any longer and I know if I have to deal with this much more I will explode and I don’t want that to happen.</p>

<p><strong>Topic:</strong></p>

<p>The topic is about the fact that I will get money from an estate that is currently getting sold.
The reason this topic is sensitive to me is because I worked together with my stepmother to renovate the house and my grandmother hates her to death. She uses every chance to talk bad about her and in general spreads negativity whenever she can. E.g. ""Why do you even try, she won’t give you your money anyway"" or ""You still help her?  You are wasting your time!""</p>

<p><strong>My Actions:</strong></p>

<p>I tell her every time that it’s worth putting work into renovating an old house and I will get my money because my stepmother is not as evil as my grandmother thinks she is. Every time I try to tell her, she says I am such a naive fool.
Still, she won't stop. It's not like she has Alzheimer’s or anything similar, but it seems she just loves to bring it up all the time. It has come to a point where I simply don't talk to her anymore until she bursts into my apartment/my room and I have to.</p>

My parents found out when my mother looked through my call logs and saw I was texting and calling a number everyday, and she had previously met my girlfriend unofficially when she picked me up for school and had always been suspicious until she put two and two together </p>

<p>I have brought up what I believe but they just think I'm young and being stupid, and keep in mind me and this girl are only a few months apart in age. </p>

<p>My parents are incredibly overprotective and so when they found out they flipped because they say that I'm not ready for a relationship (keep in mind I'm in college) that this relationship will distract me 100% and I won't be anyone in life. My parents think that she's distracting me from school, but really it's just the end of the year and I'm getting lazy as anyone would. </p>

<p>The person who feels this the strongest is my mother, she's hell bent that I break up with my girlfriend, but the thing is, my girlfriend has given her absolutely no reason to do this. My mother says she's bossy and ugly, but she's none of these things. My parents are both Latin America and obviously grew up with different views on everything. </p>

<p>I can't leave the house because ultimately I'm still dependent on my parents and I exactly say any of this to them because they think she's a distraction to me.

"How do you ask friends not to be so hard on you?","<p>I was out with a group of friends listening to some music. A couple of them were grilling me and asking why I made decisions that I now regret. For example, I said I wish I had gone to a different school. They asked why I didn't transfer. I said my boss made us do something silly at work. They asked why I didn't convince my boss to do it a different way. When I'm telling these stories, I'm not trying to vent or be negative, I'm trying to share an interesting story or opinion. (as an aside, I know some people who only ever focus on the positive and I find this disingenuous).</p>

"How to start/keep conversations in professional conferences?","<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the USA, and almost every three/four months, I go to different conferences. I have found it really hard sometimes to start, and more importantly, to KEEP conversations with people, especially those that I know from before: because I know who they are and what they do and where they live and what is the focus of their research and so on!</p>

<p>Also, the people that I am talking about, they are in higher positions than me; like they are not students. I know how to start and keep conversations with students; e.g. how is your research going, when will you finish, what are you going to do after you finish, etc, but they are either professors or post-docs or run huge R&amp;D incorporations and so on. Also no need to mention that they are older than me! </p>

<p>I do not know if this is due to lack of confidence or the fact that English is not my first language, but whatever the reason is, it does not let me communicate with people efficiently and makes me nervous whenever I see those people and I am like what am I gonna do, what do I say, and that eventually results in awkward moments like long moments of silence or saying something completely nonsense! </p>

<p>So, what are your suggestions? What should I do? What are some good questions to ask that can lead to keep good conversations? Like with people that I know from before, all I can say is “hi, how are you, how is everything, when did you get here, how was your flight”. And that's it!!

"How to avoid sounding unfriendly when talking fast?","<p>As an Introvert, I am not very social in nature. However, on certain occasions, I have found myself to be forced to interact with people. I tend to always be thinking of something when someone is trying to talk to me.</p>

<p>The problem is that when they do try to talk to me, I respond in talking really fast, due to my nervousness and anxiety. </p>

<p>This has become a problem, as people seem to feel that I was signalling them to ""Shut up"", or just ""Don't talk to me"".</p>

<p>For example someone asked me :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi, is this seat taken?</p>

"In what direction should I explain a topic that requires in-depth knowledge to understand?","<p>This is most likely a general problem in interpersonal communication and teaching that I have come across frequently, but couldn't find a definitive solution for. </p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a PhD student in the field of graphene electronics. Family
  members, friends or my partner want to know what I am working on. This
  can be just because they are nice, or because they might have heard
  ""graphene"" mentioned in the news and want to know how I am related to
  this topic.</p>
  
  <p>Either way, I would of course like to explain what it is that I am
  trying to find out in my research. But in order to understand this,
  one needs a certain amount of underlying knowledge of the broader
  field at different levels: what atoms and electrons are, what graphene
  is, what electrical currents and transistors are, etc etc.</p>
  
  <p>Do I start by making sure they know the basics (first what are atoms,
  then how metals work, then how graphene is different, then how you can
  make electronic components out of them, and then what I am researching
  on them)? Or do I just say what I am working on and let them ask for
  further explanations (""And what is this ""graphene"" you mentioned?"")?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see two approaches that I could take:</p>

<ul>
<li>I could explain <strong>""from the ground up""</strong>, picking up where I think the person has still a good grasp of, and explaining more elaborate concepts until I arrive at what they actually asked</li>
<li>I first state what I am doing and <strong>let them ask for clarifications</strong> afterwards?</li>
</ul>

<p>My problem is that I don't know which is more effective. With the first method, I feel like it helps people properly understand the final part of the explanation. The disadvantage is that it takes longer, they might lose interest halfway through and/or might be offensive if I start explaining something they already know. I mostly tend to do this, and I'm not sure this is the best way.</p>

<p>The second direction runs the risk of first confusing or discouraging them, and of them losing the track of what the goal of the explanation is. On the other hand, it only explains as much as necessary (they will just not ask for clarification if it's clear already). Here it seems to me as if the original explanation is quite useless if you anyway need to explain the underlying main concepts later on. By that time you have then established all the required knowledge, but then anyway need to repeat yourself.</p>

<p>The same fundamental question also applies to when you would like to explain something to a child, or if you are telling a story that involves people the other person might (not) know.</p>

<p>I could either first make sure they know all the people that will be in the story (e.g. <em>""You remember Sarah, the housekeeper of aunt Margret? Well, in 1972 she ...""</em> or I could assume they know them and let them ask if they don't?</p>

<p>Does the order depend on the person that is asking? Or on how well I can judge what they know already? Is there a preferred direction that doesn't offend anyone and still answers the question in a proper manner?</p>

<p>To set the scene:</p>

<p>~10 years ago she was dating someone, first love etc. I think he moved away so it ended.</p>

<p>2 years ago they met up again, he was married so they became friends, but she has stated that is when she realised that she did really love him.</p>

<p>1.5 years ago his wife committed suicide.</p>

<p>1 year ago he then committed suicide as well.</p>

<p>6 months ago I met my current partner.</p>

<p>Due to work commitments we only see each other every other week.</p>

<p>The problem that I am trying to understand is that she keeps saying that she misses this person as her best friend, and it genuinely upsets her. Even when together she occasionally mentions being sad that he is gone, but when we are apart she gets really down, and I call her only to hear ""I miss him"".</p>

<p>If this was a simple case of missing an ex-boyfriend then I would say she hasn't moved on and probably have to end the relationship, but I don't know how to factor in the death and the fact that they were not together in the last year since they reconnected.</p>

<p>What I am looking for is advise on how to approach the subject with her?

For this I am not bothered about if my opinion is right or wrong, it is what it is so answer based on my opinion, not your own please.</p></li>

"Roommates complained to landlord before talking to me","<p>I moved homes a few months ago. I’m living with roommates: 1 couple and the landlady. I’m not sure if the landlady is currently living in the home as I haven’t seen her for several weeks.</p>

<p>This morning I received an upset email from the landlady about me cooking and making noise after midnight. Given my work schedule (and other factors) I am up latter than what’s considered normal. I thought I was being quiet and am sorry I have disturbed the other roommates and would like to solve the problem in an agreeable way.</p>

<p>There’s a few things I'm having trouble navigating</p>

<p>1)  I have trouble communicating with the other roommates. They are extremely non-direct and sometimes when I’m speaking to them they quickly say their sentence and walk away before I can reply. They also haven’t done things I’ve requested of them like dry their hands before touching a door knob so it’s not wet for the next person. </p>

<p>2)  It seems the landlord and the other roommates feel they can arbitrarily make rules for me. We had agreed to a signed lease which says I pay money to use this as my home and I really don’t appreciate extra rules being added on top. I would really appreciate if they phrase these things as requests or negotiations instead of orders. Another example includes the landlady was unplugging an appliance of mine because she doesn’t like it left plugged in (even when turned off). </p>

<p>The email stated ""your roommates have talked to you about cooking and making noise after midnight yet you continue to do that"". First off, they didn’t talk to me. Second, they don’t get to decide when I cook. I know midnight is late but they are up themselves cooking until midnight so part of the thing is I have to wait until they’re done.</p>

<p>How should I reply to this? My goal is to keep doing what I’m doing without having people try to impose additional rules and get mad at me when I’m not following them. Should I tell the landlady that the couple isn’t making an effort to communicate? Knowing what specifically is making noise would help because if it’s something like opening the fridge door then using a mini fridge might help.</p>

<p>Does one necessarily take priority: not talking to me vs I wouldn't have agreed to it even if he did? Or are these two separate issues that should be individually addressed? </p>

"Roommate's dogs won't stop barking","<p>I moved into a shared house where the landlord lives with us and is one of the roommates. She had some dogs that wouldn't stop barking. Generally speaking communication has not been good but for whatever reason the dogs were not in the home for about a month. Now they're back. The barking is so excessive I believe it may be illegal as it's a form of noise pollution and prevents people from quiet enjoyment. I just had a phone interview right when she brought them in the house and it really screwed me up.</p>

"How can I express disagreement to my boss without him feeling insulted every time I share my ideas?","<p>The company I recently joined is owned and being run by a single person: my boss. </p>

<p>He knew me from earlier in person a little, so he called me one day over the phone, to leave my previous employer and join his company. I met him in person, he told me all about his impressive plans on starting a new business branch which involved custom machine design (let's call it ""the prosperity machine""), and made an offer whith such a high salary that I did not even think about not joining. I have 5 years experience in custom machine design, my boss little. </p>

<p>In the beginning everything went fine. I started working directly with him and he mostly talked about his business plans and the prosperity in the future. He gave me little tasks which had nothing to do with my profession, but I thought that's ok, it's just the start. </p>

<p>As time passed by, I found out more and more red flags: high turnover rate among people directly working with him , some mention that he is bipolar, and he also started behaving unusually, telling me that I cost too much for the company and do nothing. 
 - So what would you like me to do then? - He tried giving me some daily little projects, fortunately a little bit more to do with my profession, but every project got stalled near the beginning as he did not agree with my design proposals. Sometimes he even sent me home because he had nothing to give to me for that day.</p>

<p>So one day I told him to start doing the project he hired me for, and design the ""prosperity machine"".</p>

<p>He finally agreed to this, and started the project by introducing his plans to me. He came to me every day with his new ideas that he was thinking about all night. Filled papers full of drawings, had a meeting with me every day. 
Whenever I tried to add my ideas or add something to his ideas he just would not listen. He appeared to be completely incompetent in machine design and had the worst and most impossible ideas I have ever heard. I tried to tell him how to do it but he got upset and angry calling me a rebel. He even told me not to think and leave it up to him to do as he says. So I agreed and he often gave me tasks on filling excel charts that add no value to the project, or his regular nonsense drawings. I am a little lost, working on something that makes no sense, leads to completely nowhere, wasting time, yet still receiving a high salary which is being produced by the other people in a different profession (which my boss tells me he hates) at this company.</p>

<p>As I work alone in my profession, I cannot talk to anyone about the project specifics, however if I mention the boss, most people share their bad experience with him, but don't really care as they have their own work to do.
There is a co-supervisor at the company who is helpful in every way, but cannot or does not want to help as he is legally just another employee who has been working with my boss for many years and says there is nothing to do.</p>

<p>The ""prosperity machine"" project itself is not bad at all, the basic concept is viable, so I consider designing and building it. It would greatly help if he would trust me at least little enough that he would let me work. </p>

"Do I need to tip in a restaurant that has both a waiter and a cashier?","<p>Restaurant setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Canada, meals under $10 a person.  Usually smallish Asian, Pizza or Fish and Chips type of restaurants.</li>
<li>Sit down, grab your own menu from the table.</li>
<li>Waiter shows up to take the order (sometimes the waiter is also the same person as the cook and the cashier, sometimes they are different people)</li>
<li>Waiter rarely shows up again - usually because the meals are over relatively quickly </li>
<li>Waiter brings food and drinks (sometimes water is self-serve from a big jug that you can grab or already at the table)</li>
<li>When done eating, leave dishes and walk to the cashier which is sometimes close to the exit and sometimes close to the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the bill for the group is be $36 to $39, I usually just let the cashier round it up to $40 (I pay cash).  Most of the time they seem thankful but I'm not good at reading facial expressions, so I'm not sure if they really are happy with the tip or not.   I seem to get a big range anywhere from very happy to very disappointed.  I tried to figure out if there is correlation between the look and the amount I leave and I can't see any clear relationship.  Strangely enough at one restaurant where I go frequently, once I got a happy look and the next time I got a disappointed look for what I figured was the same tip.   It's really confusing.</p>

<p>In regular restaurants things are easy I usually use credit card and punch in 15 to 20%.  In fast food restaurants where there is no waiter I don't tip at all (into the little jar).  The one I'm having trouble with is this hybrid style of restaurant.</p>

<p>Since it's kind of a mix between fast food and slow food.  I figure the tip should be the same way (somewhere between 0% and 15%).  Is it really like that?  Am I over-tipping or under-tipping?   Also when there are multiple people involved I feel very awkward giving a tip to the cashier and giving 0 to the waiter.  Will the waiter get their share?  How will the waiter know the tip came from me personally?   I thought of leaving the money on the table, but again I'm not sure who will get the tip.   On top of that the tables are not that well ""watched"" by the staff so the tip may lay there for 10 minutes and someone else can just grab it as they are passing by.</p>

<p>I feel like it shouldn't be that hard, am I missing some basic understanding of how all this works?  So far I've been going with ""that's tipping culture for you - just roll with it and when it doubt just tip extra"".   I'd like something clearer than that.  I hate undertip, and I really hate to overtip.  A formula would be great :-) </p>

"How can I handle a bisexual friend whom I think is attracted to me?","<p>As some background, I go to a co-ed boarding high school. I have a girlfriend back home and am straight. My wing in the dorms is filled with a large collection of my friends. We're close- we play basketball, guitar, tennis, and poker together whenever we have free time. </p>

<p>We're all straight except for one bisexual friend, whom I'll code name Bob. 
We completely accept and support his sexuality. Bob is quite emotional, and has talked individually to each of us about his social anxiety and coming out to a select group of people as bisexual. In his talk, he has mentioned to us (individually) that he's depressed because he has an intense crush on another male at our school, who he doesn't name (to me), has a girlfriend, is completely straight, and understands that there's no chance that he would ever be in a relationship with. </p>

<p>The rest of us friends have talked about it, in private, to confirm that I'm the only one that has heard the talk about the anonymous person he has a crush on three times. He's offered to tell another one of us who his crush is, yet this individual honestly declined the information (wisely, but it doesn't really help me). This leads me to think that he's specifically attracted to me. </p>

<p>As friends, we hate to see his obvious sorrow about this impossible relationship. However, in the case that this is possibly directed toward me (and I'm very sure this is the case), I feel like I have to do something for him to get over me as a crush, while still keeping him as a friend. </p>

<p><strong>What can I do to help Bob get over me as a crush while still keeping him as a friend?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> We're Americans east of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>I've looked at related questions (<a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/12628/reject-a-close-friend-interested-in-dating-me"">Reject a close friend interested in dating me?</a> and <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/17670/how-can-i-help-a-close-friend-get-over-me"">How can I help a close friend get over me?</a>), but the difference here is that I'm not 100% sure that his crush is directed toward me.</p>

"How to motivate my lazy partner towards self improvement?","<p>Background: I am 23, partner is 21. Been together for 4 years.</p>

<p>We just moved in together a month ago while I am working abroad for a few months, to have a ""trial"" period of whether we're good together. I have lived on my own for 4 years, he has never lived alone yet.</p>

<p>We are both used to spending all free time inside playing games, but with my experience of living alone I learned responsibility for myself and my health - meaning, even if I enjoy spending time on my PC I still eat healthy, keep my place clean, go for walks everyday, and constantly seek to live a better, happier life. I don't have much of a social life or hobbies yet, but I am constantly seeking ways not to waste myself on the PC.</p>

<p>He is different. He lived with his parents, so he is not used to living alone yet. He plays games, eats pizza and burgers (also has an eating disorder type of thing, where he in his childhood learned to be disgusted by basically anything that isn't white bread, cheese or meat) and just seems to have no care for where his life is going. He says he is insecure about his body and wants to lose weight, but he does nothing to change his diet or to exercise. He says he wants to save money, but keeps ordering takeout which is very expensive where we are living now.</p>

<p>He says he will start taking walks with me, but he's ""waiting for the motivation and energy"" to do it. As if it would magically come without doing anything?</p>

<p>Simply put, he is quite emotionally immature. Besides his life habits, he is not very emotional, and is not empathetic in the least. In difficult situations, he often makes himself the victim, and gets pissed off if I say things that make me unhappy or try to establish boundaries on what I will and won't do for him (because I don't want to encourage his lazy and childish habits, to become his parent). If I try to talk to him about how his actions are harming him, he gets clearly annoyed and I give up and let him do what he wants.</p>

<p>I love him very much despite everything, and as we are both so similar, I want to support him and help him be happy. I know I cannot live his life for him and I can't force him to change his life if he doesn't want to - I understand that very well.</p>

<p>How could I get him to understand that what he is doing is harmful and not a healthy way to live?</p>

"How to invite my colleagues to an at-home goodbye party when they usually organize them in a bar?","<p>I'll leave for a new job in a month. When some of my colleagues left the team for another one (but still remained in the company, which means we hang out around coffee regularly, it's not like they left entirely), they organized a ""goodbye party"" in a bar, where they paid for beers and snacks for everyone invited.<br>
I, on the other hand, am about to leave the company <strong>completely</strong>. I'll still see some of my co-workers with whom I have a rock band and some others that I got to know well and so we already agreed to go grab lunch together about once a week.</p>

<p>I'm considering organizing my goodbye party at home. <strong>I don't have enough money</strong> to pay for an open bar and I believe I could organize something nicer at home. I also believe that organizing my goodbye party at home might convey <strong>my want of keeping in touch</strong> with them. But I'm afraid my invitation will seem weird- why would I organize it at my place when I could do it in a bar? Please note that I'm not really inclined to disclose my financial ""limitations"" to my co-workers, although they may be able to figure out by themselves since I'm much younger and therefore my salary is significantly lower.</p>

<p>So here I am, wanting to invite my co-workers at home for my goodbye party, but I'm afraid they'll be embarrassed because it's too personal to invite your colleagues to your place. I'm autistic and an oversharer and so I usually struggle to understand where to draw the line between privacy and professional life.<br>
<strong>How could I invite them to my goodbye party at my place without embarrassing them for not doing it in a bar?</strong></p>

"How to convince my girlfriend to be open about the discussion of political topics","<p>My girlfriend and I have been together for about 5 months. She tends to be more left leaning in her beliefs and I tend to be more centered. </p>

<p>Every now and then she'll ask me something related to something she agrees with politically (often to do with feminism/race etc), and I would end up disagreeing with her. The problem arises however, when I explain why I disagree, and she, instead of understanding we have different beliefs, gets angry that I don't agree with her, going so far as to completely ignore me for a whole day (we don't live together). On the flip side, I do everything in my power to have a civil discussion and to further the conversation. </p>

<p>As an example, here is a conversation we had recently.</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong> : Did you hear that Kanye West thinks that Black Lives Matter is an excuse to whine?</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> : Yeah, I did.</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong> : Outrageous, am I right??</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> : Well, I don't think it's an excuse to whine necessarily, but I don't exactly agree with all of BLM's actions.</p>

<p><strong>Her</strong> : What, so you're a racist now?</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong> : I didn't say that. I completely agree to the general sentiment that Black Lives, do in fact matter. What I don't agree with is how BLM has gone about trying to prove this point to the public, with some members assaulting police officers who had done nothing wrong and things of the like. </p>

"Raising the stakes in a game without sounding eager or greedy","<p>I was playing cards with some friends. The game was based on points, which we could use for bidding, hence winning or losing them. The game seemed to go well, until I had the impression that the others were losing interest due to the low stakes of the game.</p>

<p>I wanted to offer raising the stakes, but at my first attempt I received a fairly negative feedback. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you find that the game is getting dull, perhaps we could raise the stakes? How about we play for a dinner? The winner gets invited to a nice one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The others perceived my suggestion as an attempt to earn more from the game, rather than an attempt to revive it. Note that I was rather losing when I proposed the change.</p>

<p>Given that I do not intend to propose a different game, or a variation of the existing one, how could I offer raising the stakes (e.g. betting a dinner, or singing a song, or even small sums of money where legal) without sounding too eager or greedy?</p>

<hr>

<p>A very important clarification, the game in question has a fairly relevant skill component to it, i.e. think bridge, or being able to count cards at blackjack, or planning a correct strategy at doppelkopf. Chance of course helps too in that cards are being dealt randomly, but it is definitively not the only driver of winnings.</p>

"How to explain to coworkers that being vegan does not mean I know everything about it?","<p>The other day, I was in a company meal with ~20 coworkers and someone offered me wine before adding: ""At least you know this is vegan."" (because I'm vegan). I don't like alcohol so I politely refused before adding <em>with a smile</em>: ""In fact, not all wines are vegan"" (which is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">true</a>). After that, all of my colleagues started to laugh at me like I was some kind of silly person who didn't know what she was talking about. <strong>And even after I try explaining myself, they still didn't believe me</strong> (because I was unable to give details).</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I'm the youngest person at my company, I look very young (I'm 23 but people regularly assume that I'm under 18), I'm a woman, I have been working there for three years and I'm like a student doing an internship (it's an simplification, my actual status is ""étudiante en alternance"" which mean I spend half my time in school and the other half at work; Kevin mentioned that it's called ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_education"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">co-op</a>"" in the U.S., and eggyal added that it's a “placement” in the U.K.).</p>

<h1>What I tried</h1>

<p>After my colleagues started laughing, I tried to explain to them that it was true and that during the process of fabrication, products of animal origin were used. They started pressing me with questions. Unfortunately, I didn't know much about what animal products were used, when and why (since I don't drink alcohol, I didn't care about the details). So, I tried to answer their questions but told them that I didn't know much about the subject and suggested that they find out on their own (implied: instead of asking me questions I couldn't/was not qualified to answer). My phone can't go on internet and they didn't care to google it up.</p>

<p>Since I'm vegan/vegetarian, I have to deal with this behavior a lot (this is just the most recent example). Normally, saying something like ""I read that..."" people are fine with, but when it comes to veganism, they aren't anymore. As a result, I try to learn every fact about veganism by heart so that I would be able to defend myself when someone is trying to ridicule my vegan commitment. But I'm only human and this is hard. Plus, turning myself into a human Wikipedia isn't really my dream.</p>

<h1>My Question</h1>

<p>How do I convey to my coworkers that: I don't know the details, they can look it up themselves (so they don't have to blindly trust me) but, please, stop assuming that this cannot be true and that I'm silly/stupid/whatever? </p>

<p>More important, how do I make them stop laughing at me? (I cannot control what they think but it would be nice if they didn't express it that clearly).</p>

<h1>Note and clarification</h1>

<p>I'm not good at human interaction and the only real social life I have is with my extended family (a big one, but still). Also, I hate conflict so, please, do not answer with a conflict-oriented solution.</p>

<p>There were 20 people there: some with whom I take my coffee breaks and that I like; some with whom I work in my day to day life and with whom I eat everyday; my direct boss (N+1) with whom I really don't get along (he is sexist, among other things); the big boss who likes me but doesn't like my N+1; and others. None of them were vegan/vegetarian.</p>

<p>I responded because they were talking to me and they said something false. I know a lot people think I should not have said anything, but leaving someone with a false belief seemed (and still seems) wrong to me.</p>

<p><strong>Strong emphasis:</strong> The argument wasn't about me being vegan/not drinking wine. It was about them note believing my statement (""not all wines are vegan"") which I couldn't backup with precise and complete details (just a vague ""animal products are used during the manufacturing process""). Details that they <em>asked for</em>. And since I didn't had enough details, they were laughing in disbelief while not carrying enough to fact-check.</p>

"How can I politely say to my coworker that he should not comment on what I am eating","<h2><strong>Problem:</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Examples of what he can say:</strong></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You should not be eating grapefruit, it's bad for you"".</p>

<h2><strong>More Information:</strong></h2>

<p>The funny part is that he is the only one that is fat at the table. Talking for myself, I think that breaks should be relaxing moments without negative comments. The problem is that I can't eat at another table as my manager always selects this table to let his engineers eat with their friends (including the man I'm talking about). <strong>So changing tables is not an option.</strong> 
Another ""problem"" is that he is the kind of person that doesn't like being told anything. </p>

<p>I've already told him that what I eat is my business, but he just said back ""even if it's your problem, you should not be eating this"".</p>

Open containers of alcohol anywhere in a vehicle is illegal where we live (Ontario), as I understand it. I can't prove that he's drinking and driving, or even drives with it as an open container (he's also a smoker, maybe he uses an empty one as an ashtray?). </p>

"Co-worker is too aggressively trying to make friends","<p>We have a new colleague. He comes from another region (same country: Germany) and is rather outgoing: He talks a lot (sometimes too much), is generally very friendly and is rather cheerful. He moved here, which means he has (to my knowledge), no social contacts here besides us.</p>

<p>The problem is: Everyone is annoyed by him. Whenever somebody talks about their weekend plans he immediately (and clumsily) asks if he can tag along, even though we have only known him for such a short time (few months). He does this so often, that people are more careful now when they say what they are doing in their free time. It is also painful to see all the rejections he gets (because he is asking so often) and the awkwardness that ensues.</p>

<p>I like him, but I do not want to hang out with him all the time. We did something once and it was fine. But I get why people are annoyed. I considered taking him aside and hinting at him that people do not enjoy being pressured into activities with him. People around here are just a bit more.. mellow, I guess? He is just so damn cheerful and enthusiastic that he annoys people. It surely is a hard situation for him, coming from a different region and settling into a group of people who know each other reasonably well and who also do stuff together in their free time. He seriously needs to step on the brakes, though.</p>

<p>For reference: We are all mid-20s or early 30s and work in a very small (&lt;20 people) place. Most of us have nothing to do with him at work (most of us work independently) and social interaction is mostly during breaks, which we all have together. </p>

<p><strong>How do I approach him about his aggressive friend-seeking behavior?</strong> I would probably say something like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Listen, Joe. You know that I get along with you quite well. But between us, I've heard colleagues complain about you asking about taking part in their activities all the time. In your region, people might be more outgoing, but around here people need some time to get acquainted. Maybe you should try to let things evolve more naturally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I really do not want this to backfire in any way. From all the people here, I probably have the best position to tell him, as we talked the most.  If I screw this up, I might hurt his feelings. I really just want him to be part of our group.</p>

<p>Before he joined us, we sometimes organized small team events (bowling etc), maybe doing that will help people get to know him better? But he might also take this as another opportunity to (unknowingly) annoy people even more.</p>

<p>I will probably do stuff with him in the future, but I don't want to be the only guy in the office he can hang around with. If he just were a little less intrusive, everybody would get along better.</p>

The latter professor had just given a talk at our college, and this was a combination of a question-and-answer session and a social event.</p>

<p>We were having dinner in a seminar room, at a rectangular table. I was the second student to arrive, and I put my coat on a chair on one side of the table, opposite another student. As I was going to get food, Professor Alice sat down in the chair next to mine. Other people filtered in, and eventually Professor Bob sat on the <em>other</em> side of me. The final arrangement had the three of us on one side, and three students on the other.</p>

<p>It was a little awkward for me. Partly, this was because Alice and Bob did most of the talking for the first half of the dinner (with students joining in for the second half), and so I was directly in between. Additionally, I felt singled out from my peers. I'm planning to do a project with both professors next semester, so I do want to get to know Professor Alice, but this was a bit awkward.</p>

<p><em>Bob</em>, <em>John</em> and <em>Alice</em> are old acquaintances of mine. They are a little older than me, mid-to-late twenties. We are not close friends, but we get along together well and see each other regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>:<br></p>

<p>I needed to deliver something to someone in another town. For several reasons, I didn't want to employ a delivery service (among them: valued personalty, also personal experience). Traveling to the town myself would have cost me almost a whole day.</p>

<p><sub>This was not a complicated or time-consuming task, not big, not heavy, not illegal, not immoral.</sub></p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br></p>

<p>Bob knows the person I wanted to deliver it to, and he also happens to commute there regularly - in this case the next day, actually. The delivery would have cost him maybe additional 10 to 15 minutes. He is friendly and reliable, so I approached him about it.</p>

<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I went to Bob, asked him and offered him compensation (a treat - our inofficial currency, let's just call it ""Chocolate""). Alice and John were also around. Now, Alice and John got involved. They knew how much the travel would inconvenience me and, before Bob could answer, weighed in.</p>

<p>Alice noted how Bob could ask for much more and John agreed that he shouldn't sell himself short, since I was dependent on him. Alice suggested to Bob (and also to me) that I should expose my chest to him. John noted that touching was also not too much to demand, which Alice agreed to. </p>

<p>I wouldn't have taken that deal. Alice's and John's tone of voice - it was just a half joking layer over a serious core, if you know what I mean. When a cheerful tone is employed to soften the blow.</p>

<p>Bob didn't say anything, but looked at me as if he was hoping for me to agree to the proposed ""payment"". Alice and John were also awaiting my reaction. This made me feel uncomfortable and confirmed my suspicion about the seriousness of it.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>How do I gently decline an indecent proposal on how to pay back my dues?</strong></p>

<p>Since the resulting situation was awkward for me, I'm sure I could have handled it better.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong>:<br></p>

<p>My goal is to be gentle, because Bob doing me this favor would have been the 
best solution for me. I also wouldn't want the situation to become more
awkward than it already was. And Bob is essentially a good guy. So I want Bob to help me, but not at this price.</p>

<p><sub>Note that if he felt the deal wasn't good, I could have offered even more compensation - although my original offer was a fair deal.</sub></p>

<p><sub><em>How it actually went</em>: While they were waiting for me to accept the
indecent proposal, we stood there in silence. I finally broke it by saying
that there wouldn't be much to see for him anyway. This didn't deter them and
the silence continued. Then I looked at him, said ""Chocolate, ok?"" and he accepted.</sub></p>

<h2>Clarifications:</h2>

<ul>
<li>My friends sometimes make similar jokes about sexual favors, but no one ever actually did it (at least to my knowledge). They have never asked anything like this of me before.</li>
<li>""Chocolate"" is not a code word. It's really something delicious to eat, no deeper or hidden meaning.</li>
<li>I said ""At first I could have handled it better"" because at first it seemed like just a lame joke and if they had followed up with something like ""just kidding"", I wouldn't have felt that awkward. But silence ensued as if they were waiting/hoping for me to accept their suggestion. This made the situation really awkward. But your questions made me realize that maybe it was an awkward situation for me only.</li>
<li>An answer doesn't necessarily have to be more assertive; it should still be gentle so as to not hurt anybody's feelings.</li>

"How should household chores be split for non-parent, different work-hour couples?","<p>My significant other and I have been together for years, but this is still an evolving discussion. We work different lengths of hours. One of us works a full time job, the other a part time job. </p>

<p>What are fair methods to determine how the chores should be divided? An even split? A disproportional amount to the person who works less hours? If yes to the latter, how should it be calculated? </p>

<p>The simple math solution would be Full time hours worked minus part time hours worked is the amount of additional hours the part time person should work. But considering the emotions of the two involved the simple math solution does not work. The end goal is to come to agreement that does not leave one feeling like an indentured servant, nor the other like they work non-stop. </p>

"How to calmly respond to friendly peer-pressure when it's a major pet-peeve?","<p>Every so often I find myself in a situation where a friend or coworker asks if I want to do something social, and I don't want to for some non-committal reasons. By ""non-committal"" reasons, I'm referring to nights where I need time to myself (I'm generally an introvert), don't feel like spending money, or have various personal things I'd rather get done (maybe work on some personal projects, clean my apartment, cook a meal I've been preparing, etc). In other words, I don't have a ""solid"" excuse such as a previous engagement, illness, etc.</p>

<p>In these situations, I feel that it's unnecessary (and rather cumbersome) to go into detail in my response, so I usually say something along the lines of, ""thanks for the invite but I don't really have time tonight"". Depending on my relationship with the person, or the type of personality they have, this is often met with friendly peer-pressure. They'll respond with questions and statements to sort of egg me on, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>""Oh come on, what else could you be doing?""</em>  </li>
<li><em>""What, are you doing laundry or something? You can do that kind of stuff any time!""</em>  </li>
<li><em>""It's just for a few drinks, it's not like we'll be out all night!""</em> (with my particular friends/coworkers, it's rarely ""just a few drinks"")</li>
</ul>

<p>This sort of peer-pressure, no matter how playful or well-intentioned, always frustrates me immensely. I see it as an invasion of privacy, and strongly feel that I shouldn't be expected to dive into the details of my night. With friends/coworkers that are particularly aggressive with their peer pressure, the situation usually ends in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> I give in, despite my best judgement. This is not ideal because it means I'm not taking my own needs seriously.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> I become openly frustrated with them, and say something mildly hostile, such as, ""I said I was busy, why don't you understand that?"" This is not ideal because it creates a pretty uncomfortable situation for the both of us. They are usually taken aback (they weren't expecting their playful egging-on to be met with anger), and I feel bad and somewhat ashamed with myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I better handle this situation, so that <strong>neither party feels bad in the end</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Additional info:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a 28 year old male</li>
<li>I'm introverted but certainly not a loner or reclusive, and I feel that I socialize a healthy amount, so please no, <em>""you just need to relax and get out more""</em> responses.</li>
<li>I understand that they're only egging me on because they enjoy my company and want to hang out, which is flattering, but doesn't make me any less frustrated.</li>
<li>I do enjoy hanging out with the particular friends/coworkers I have in mind, and as long as I at least know a few days ahead of time, I'm usually happy to go out with them. The scenario I've outlined here typically occurs when I'm asked spontaneously, and is certainly not the ""norm"" of our social interactions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why this peer-pressure bothers me</strong></p>

<p>As <strong>dbeer</strong> mentioned in the comments, it may be helpful to delve a little deeper into this topic. Off the top of my head, here's why I believe I become so frustrated with this type of peer-pressure:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>I feel it's an invasion of privacy</strong>. I could very well not want to go out because of a highly personal matter that I'm not ready to talk about.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I find it a little disrespectful</strong>. This may be a bit overkill, but when someone tries to coerce me into going out even after I stated I couldn't, it tells me that they don't think I'm capable of making my own decisions. As a side note, I'm specifically talking about <strong>persistent</strong> egging-on. A small little, ""aw, but it would be fun"" isn't a big deal to me.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I'm nervous about their reaction</strong>. This ones a bit more personal. Growing up, I had some bad experiences with friends who seemed legitimately angry any time I told them I didn't feel like hanging out. Sometimes I would even find out that they gossiped about me during the social outing that I didn't attend. In retrospect, I can tell that the issue was really on their end, but some of the anxiety that caused me has definitely carried over to adulthood.</p></li>

"How can I ask my coworkers for candid feedback on something I said?","<p><strong>Situation</strong></p>

<p>My team at work uses online chat extensively, since we're spread out over a few locations. There are also some people in the chatroom who aren't directly on our team but work on closely related projects, and who I've never met in person.</p>

<p>Recently someone in the latter group (not my team, haven't met) posted a complaint in chat about a feature I implemented. I replied to ask for more details about why he disliked it. A couple other coworkers jumped in the thread as well to say they liked the feature, and we came up with a couple ideas about how to address the OP's complaints.</p>

<p>The thread seemed to reach a decent resolution, so I was a bit surprised when several people - including my manager - mentioned that conversation (in person) to me during the week. It sounded like they might be worried I was upset, and I wasn't really sure how to respond. I admit I was annoyed by the way OP started the conversation, but I wasn't really <em>personally</em> hurt - and anyways, it's not like I wanted to complain publicly at work about him (especially didn't want to sound like I was dismissing his valid feedback!).</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p>Since several people now have brought this up, I'm wondering if I sounded upset in my chat messages. I often worry about striking the right tone at work and online, especially when I don't know the other person IRL, and it would be helpful to know if that happened here. So, I'd like to ask for feedback from the people who mentioned this.</p>

<p>How can I ask for an honest critique of how I handled the chat conversation, without making them feel uncomfortable or pressured?</p>

<p><strong>Why not ""just ask""?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not very good at giving direct feedback myself, especially negative - I hate being put on the spot, and I worry a lot about offending the other person. I also have social anxiety, which makes it hard to judge whether <em>my</em> feelings about this are likely to be shared by others. Also, I expect I'll have to bring up the subject myself, which I'm not sure how to do now that a few days have passed. Overall, I'm interested in advice on what setting to bring this up, how to broach the subject, and what to avoid / do during the conversation (since I don't want to ask nicely just this once and then throw away future chances by handling their response poorly).</p>

"How do I insist my wife gets rid of her recently bought pet spider, given that I'm arachnophobic?","<p>The title summarizes the issue quite well: I'm arachnophobic and my wife wants a pet spider.</p>

<p>She knows I'm terrified by all kinds of bugs, and she wants to buy it anyway. I know phobias are not good... But, hey! I didn't choose to be afraid of such things: I've been phobic for as long as I can remember, and haven't had any success dealing with it: therapy, counselling, support from friends... In the face of a spider, I simply freeze in panic, fighting an urge to run as fast as my legs can.</p>

<p>My wife is <em>very</em> aware about my phobia: I've talked about it with her, and (I thought) I had made clear that under no circumstance I'd tolerate a spider in my home. She told me: ""instead of being terrified, why don't you just face your fear?"" The intention seems noble, but it's a weak justification, given that it was said after the main intention.</p>

<p>Two days ago, when I arrived, she told me: ""can we go to a pet store?"". I told her: ""sure; why"", and she answered: ""just to get a little animal""... It took me a second to realize what she meant, and I literally began to shake and to ask (to beg) ""No! Please, don't! Not <em>that</em> thing!"". She simply and plainly told me: ""Take me there or I'll go anyway. You don't have to see it, it will be enclosed"". </p>

<p>She bought the spider (a tarantula), despite me begging her not to. She's studying a second career, and right now she's taking a course about arachnids. She planned to buy a spider with a classmate, and the original plan was for the classmate to keep it; however, my wife changed her mind and chose to keep the spider.</p>

<p>I'm terrified and angry. I feel ignored. I simply want to run.</p>

<p>As I see it right now, I have three alternatives:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cope with the thing: The spider stays, I fix the rules about its accommodation and try not to suffer about it. That will for the benefit of my wife, but it will make me unhappy (or at least, anxious two out of three hours I'm at home).</li>
<li>An ultimatum: Tell my wife ""the spider goes or I go"". If I succeed, I'll be happy, but I'll make my wife angry and resentful.</li>
<li>Simply assume that the spider is a sign of severe insensitivity towards me and go. That would be a terrible blow for both my wife and me... it would risk my marriage; at the very least both of us would be angry at the other for a while, and the central problem (the spider at home) would not be addressed.</li>
</ol>

<p>My main objective is for the spider to go. I simply can't be happy while the animal is here. So, the main question is:</p>

<p><strong>How do I insist my wife get rid of the spider without looking like an insensitive or stubborn guy?</strong> And, as a secondary objective: if my wife does not get the message (i.e. she does not get rid of the spider): how to communicate the ""ultimatum"" in a respectful, but firm and final tone?</p>

"How to approach my Boyfriend on his opinion about having children eventually?","<p>I've got a wonderful boyfriend who I can very openly communicate with. We've been together half a year, but we've been friends for years before that. I'm in my early twenties.</p>

<p>So far we have handled all difficult discussions with ease, but I'm still scared about approaching him with this topic. We both made very, very clear that we don't want children right now as we're busy with our lives. We often fantasize about the future and how we want to spend our lived together but neither of us ever mentions children.</p>

<p>We both don't like (most) children, get annoyed by toddlers and despise babies. Yet, I like the thought of maybe raising a kid one day, like two decades from now (in my late thirties). MAYBE. I'm faithful that when I start talking about this topic, we'll end up agreeing on it, like with so many other things. But I don't know how to bring this up without seeming like I want children. I could just ask assuming the negative - ""Do you ever want to have children?"" but I'd rather be more neutral.</p>

<p>How can I ask my boyfriend about his preference regarding children without him making assumptions about my own?</p>

"Parents and their kids in turmoil over third party issues","<p>I am a grown up man finished masters about to get married. My parents never went to school. I love them very much. They have given me and my sister enough care and love in upbringing us. As a person my father is chill type. He has some core level issues with his in-laws. They don't respect him much. Whenever he faces an insult from them at any family functions, he will drink heavily on the way home and discharges all the frustration on the soft-target: my mother. She doesn't like it for obvious reasons and in addition she backs her brothers all the time. I or my sister usually bring the situation to a standstill without any long term solutions fearing any extremes and considering my parents' raw emotions. And also mother has been prohibited from visiting her brothers by who-else, but she demands it. What could possibly be a long term solution for this situation?? </p>

"Is there a way to ask a person to not ask so many questions without coming across as rude?","<p>My aunt asks a lot of questions, some of which come across as invasive or non-constructive. One example is we were planning to meet at a mutual family members house and she kept asking me questions like which route I would take to get there. I eventually asked why and she said ""just making conversation"". For me this is slightly annoying because it was coming across as a logistical concern, not ""just making conversation"". Other examples, are my mom and dad recently went through a bad divorce and my aunt sometimes asks about his career etc. which I think she may turn into gossip. </p>

<p>Another question she frequently asks with for no apparent reason is ""where are you?"" or ""are you home?"". When I answer she usually quickly changes the subject or asks another question. This messes me up because if my plan changes or if I go out, then I'm not sure if I should inform her or if she was just asking for the fun of it. It could happen I waste time playing phone tag to tell her I'm no longer home when it didn't matter in the first place.</p>

<p>I would also add she's a very social person.</p>

<p>What's the best way to approach this? Should I tell her directly, try to deflect the questions or try to change the subject? Is it polite of me to just reply with ""why do you ask?"" I'm all for ""just making conversation"" but there's a time and a place for it and I find when talking on the phone it's not a great time. I’m introverted and it kind of stresses me out when people ask random questions. </p>

"My neighbour threatened to kill my cat. How to apologize and make sure he doesn't hurt my pets?","<p>My old cat goes into the yard with me while I water (I don't leave him outside otherwise). Apparently he has managed to scale a 6ft fence and go into the neighbours yard, because I had a fairly unpleasant encounter with my neighbour today.</p>

<p>I saw my cat pop up (from what I thought was behind the shed) and heard my neighbour mutter through the fence ""I'm gonna kill that cat, stay out of my yard"". </p>

<p>Now... I didn't respond to him because I was shocked (no one has threatened me or my animals before). I had some time to cool down and I think I will leave him an apology card with a gift card to the garden center. I don't want to talk to him in person because honestly he seems a bit unbalanced.</p>

<p>The majority of the message will be along the lines of ""so sorry won't happen again etc"". But part of me (a bitter part?) also wants to mention that he shouldn't kill my cat if he sees it again. I don't plan on letting my cat out, but things happens and I don't want him dead. I also don't want him throwing poison around and killing my dog. </p>

<p>What I hope to achieve is getting him not to kill my animals and perhaps act a bit more reasonably if he sees a cat in his yard (talk to me first without death threats through the fence?). I don't know if I should just apologize and leave it at that, or mention that in the future I'd appreciate that he let me know there is a problem first before acting on his impulse? I am worried that adding all this will just make him angrier. On the other hand he already muttered threats so in a way I hope he realizes it might not be an appropriate thing to say. </p>

"Use of ""what"" when asking for partial clarification of what was said","<p>I had it ingrained in me to avoid saying ""what?"" when I didn't hear what someone said, and instead ask ""pardon?"" to avoid sounding rude.</p>

<p>What if I only need partial clarification of what was said though, and I don't want to force the speaker to completely reiterate what they said just to fill in the part I missed?</p>

<p>For example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is the ****** coming along?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could say ""pardon?"", and force them to completely re-say the sentence again just so I can hear the one part again, or I could say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is the ""what"" coming along?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which most people understand as me asking for them to fill in the ""what"".</p>

<p>Is this considered rude though? I try to avoid use of ""what"" in situations like this, but I can't think of another obvious choice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is the ""pardon"" coming along?</p>

"How to decline physical affection from a child whose parents are pressuring them?","<h1>My Situation</h1>

<p>I am an uncle to 6 nieces and nephews. I live about 1000 miles away from the rest of my family, so I only see them 2-3 times each year. When it comes time to say goodbye, it is common practice for physical affection to be given out. My siblings and parents will hug each other and me. The children are encouraged to give out hugs and kisses to their grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. </p>

<p>I have two particular problems with this. The first is that the children don't seem to always want to give out hugs and kisses (and I think they should be taught bodily autonomy as early as possible). I know about <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/21351/11659"">this question</a> (which I happen to have the accepted answer on) which deals with helping children enforce their own boundaries. For this question I want to focus on the other problem, which is that <em>I</em> don't want the kisses. </p>

<p>I am fine with hugging my nieces and nephews if they want to hug me, but I do not want to kiss them or have them kiss me. The reasons for this are that children give very slobbery kisses (which I don't like) and that none of the adults give kisses to each other, so it seems odd to me that they would have their children do so. </p>

<p>The general conversation will be something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sibling:</strong> Do you have hugs and kisses for uncle Rainbacon?</p>
  
  <p>*Child hides face</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sibling:</strong> Come on, give your uncle Rainbacon a hug and a kiss and say goodbye</p>

"How to comfort and help a partner who can't get a job and started questioning own capability?","<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>My partner finished his bachelor's around two years ago. By that time he had multiple positive internship experiences and collected compliments from peers where he worked (some had even thought he was an actual professional, in some situations).</p>

<p>It just happened that his last internship was at a government run company and they don't hire interns, you have to compete for the full time position with everyone else when they open exams, thus upon graduating, he became unemployed.</p>

<p>During this time he has attended some interviews and gotten to the final step in many, but never got a job offer. He is working on the field, informally, for almost a year, but wage is low and it's not what he loves.</p>

<p>The situation is kind of dire at my country right now, unemployment rate is around 15% so you can tell that he is not the only one frustrated. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Current situation</strong></p>

<p>He just got another ""no"" for a position and suddenly became very sad and started questioning whether he did the right choice for his major or not, 6 years ago. He is even questioning his faith in God, which is particularly delicate for me, as I myself am an atheist.</p>

<p>He stated that he's completely lost and doesn't know what to do next. Here's what I did:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have some experience with hiring, but in a completely different field. I already helped him rebuild and improve his resume and offered to do mock interviews. </li>
<li>I advised him to start praying again, even though I'm an atheist, to see if he finds comfort in doing so, be it for the king what he has or for asking for help.</li>
<li>Rationalising, I told him we're bound to subjective calls on hiring process that we can't control, but we can be 100% sharp on our objective knowledge and let it not fail us on any tests, so I advised to study and study.</li>
<li>I reminded him that he was beloved by many professors and colleagues, to seek for referrals with them.</li>
<li>Told him to broaden his search for jobs to include opportunities in other cities or even states. My point is that he might get an offer there and even if he chooses not to accept, he will have learned what it's like to succeed on an interview and replicate it where it's actually relevant for him.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know if he's actually competent or not, as I only have his testimonials, but I believe he should continue to seek opportunities. How to comfort him with all the rejections? Should I let him question if he has the skills/qualities to do this job? Are any of my reactions incipient/unclear/worsening his situation?</p>

"How to cut-off my sister-in-law from me and my fiancée?","<p>I am an 27 year old woman. I will be getting married soon. I have a sister-in-law who is 3.5 years younger than me. I somehow do not like my sister-in-law at all. I have disliked her since the first time I met her. A two minute conversation was enough to know that I do not like her. After that I have had many conversations which have increased my dislike for her further. </p>

<p>Once I wished her good luck for her exam, and out of nowhere she suddenly said that she hates people who are good in everything. She herself does not have a career.

When me and my fiancée would go out, she would ping him asking where he is and when will he be home.</p>

<p>My fiancée seems a bit weird too in this aspect regarding his sister. He would ask me to wish her well on her birthday and wish her good luck for her exams. I think he knows it pretty well that I don't like her, still he would ask me to do this. He would tell her to wish me a happy birthday too on my birthday.</p>

<p>To be honest, I do not want her in our life. I am pretty sure she is nosy and would try to create problems and destroy my relationship. When we would go out, she would text him asking when he is returning home. On the other hand my family would never disturb me. What should I do? How do I cut her off from us?</p>

"How to convey seriousness in conditions when giving money to brother","<p><strong><em>TL;DR:</strong> I want to give my brother some money with a few conditions on how it is spent but believe he is unlikely to realise that I seriously plan to enforce those conditions. How can I convey my seriousness to him?</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I have an older brother whom I do/have gotten along well with for all of my life but is not so great with money/self control. Nothing so bad as having a gambling addiction, series of maxed out credit cards or anything of that sort, but as a particularly careful saver the difference made from his buying nice clothes, a modest car, a nice tv/speaker system, semi-regularly eating out and maintaining an enthusiastic social life is very clear. Obviously I have no problem with him or anyone buying these things, it is a personal decision of my own not to. </p>

<p>When I was 16 and he was 18 we both still lived with our parents and despite earning more than me, he would often ask to borrow small amounts of money. $20 here, $50 there and it accumulated to ~$500 before I started refusing to lend any more as it was a lot of money for me at the time. After two years of occasional nagging it was clear that I would never get that money back so I offered to forgive the loan if his old laptop I had been using for the past couple months (he paid $250 for it new) could be ""mine"" and that was the end of it. That is not to say I have never owed him. While studying at uni, I knew that whenever desperate I could sleep on the couch at his place and eat his food, use the shower, internet, get dropped off at a train station and he would not expect anything in return. And there were a fair number of times where I did exactly that.</p>

<p>Nowadays we each semi-regularly give/borrow/loan small amounts of money from each other but just recently he has mentioned in a more significant sense how he is running out of money and might have to borrow some from me. He recently lost his primary source of income and although there is no worry about his residency or physical health and wellbeing, the extra money for things like car maintenance, job searching, bills, general quality of life costs and the ability to buy things that will help in the long term would clearly be a massive help to him. Since I am aware of a number of these sorts of things coming up soon that are in his own best interest to buy, I am more than happy to give him up to $1000 which if he can return then great but I half expect, and am fully prepared, to never see that money again. However, he has bad spending habits and receiving enough money does not mean that he will buy these things that he needs. Based off my knowledge of his self control and past dealings with money I have no doubt that if I just gave him all the money he would carry on buying excessive items and then suddenly realise that he only bought half of the things he actually needed. I am happy to pay for his fuel, but not a $60 haircut and round of drinks for his friends. So when I do give him the money, I want to establish some strong conditions about what I am giving it to him for. When it is his own money, I am happy for him to spend it how he likes but since this is my own money, I feel it is similarly fair to spend it how <em>I want</em>.</p>

<p>After some thought the essential steps would be to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Seperate the amount I give him into sections to limit the carelessness at which it can be spent.  </p></li>
<li><p>Tell him what the money is for, and establish a boundary that if it is spent on other things I will not give any more money.  </p></li>
<li><p>Follow through </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Limit yes, but I am <em>not</em> prepared to only give minuscule amounts at a time or demand receipts/be asked and present for every purchase, that is far more of a strain on his time, my time and our relationship than I think its worth. Although I won't (and don't want to) know his specific purchases, if he were to for example spend the money going to a concert instead of fixing his car, both of these sorts of things I will know about anyway and can confidently use to enforce said rule. I do not want to be involved to the extent where I am basically be his financial arbiter and he would not want that either. The general understanding I already have of what he buys is more than enough since when it gets to the point where he has to ask, he would be well and truly <strong>out</strong> of money and I can be confident that 95% of what he buys would come from my money. 1 &amp; 3 are self explanatory and do not think I will not have trouble with following through and enforcing my boundary. <strong>My question is about <em>skills</em> or <em>techniques</em> that can be used to express that I am absolutely serious when I initially talk to him in step 2.</strong></p>

<p>For some context. There are a number of other issues that were expressed in a similar way, but we <strong>BOTH</strong> clearly acknowledge as not being serious. There are plenty of examples of this going both ways, from situations like ""If there is so much as a scratch on my car I won't let you drive it to {$Best Friend}'s wedding."" To things as trivial as ""You aren't invited to dinner if you eat that last muffin."" These cases are all empty threats and we both know it. Since using the car was known as the only feasible option left to travel to the wedding, and we both recognised it as something significant giving this over the top, false ultimatum was a way to express how much I didn't want it to be scratched and nothing more. If it <em>had</em> been scratched although I may have gotten mad, I am confident my brother would not have even have to ask to know that it was still fine to use the car when he needed. The muffin comment was a competitive joke, I immediately ate it in the face of his protests and yet there was no question about the validity of my invite.</p>

<p>So my worry is that even if I say ""I will not give you any more money if you spend it on X"" he may presume that I am just expressing that I don't <em>want</em> him to spend it on X rather than establishing a solid boundary of something that will actually happen. If I am able to properly convey to him how serious I am about the condition it will be vastly better for the both of us by helping with his spending, my peace of mind knowing what the money is going to and in the case where I actually do have to enforce the boundary at least he will be expecting it.</p>

<p>Asking for money is awkward and I assume he will try to finish the conversation as fast as humanly possible so a lengthy conversation about my thoughts may not work in this case...</p>

<p><strong>What conversational skills and techniques can I use to quickly and effectively convey to my brother that I am setting a firm boundary rather than just expressing my hopes?</strong> </p>

"How to make sincere offers across cultural boundaries?","<p>This often happens to me when I interact with Asian ""face-saving"" cultures, some South Americans that are really formal, and even some Americans who are really polite.</p>

<p>The general case is, imagine I want to make a genuine ask or offer and have it genuinely considered. The problem is, whatever I'm offering is unusual or not well-defined culturally or culturally just ""not how it's done"" to the person I'm offering/asking.</p>

<p>People often by default reject offers or kinda non-answer questions that are outside their cultural norms.</p>

<p>Specific example: Like Andre Agassi and Larry Bird, my back has always hurt. Since my teens, I've often preferred sleeping on the firm floor to a soft bed. I never sleep with a pillow. I also have an excellent relationship with my partner, and we are totally fine with sleeping apart, because we spend almost all our days together. ""Who sleeps where?"" is all too often a culturally-settled matter, rather than practically considered question of how to maximize everyone's collective preferences. Some cultures say old people get the best beds / rooms, lots of Latin cultures say couples get the best beds / rooms, etc. I might genuinely prefer to sleep on the floor on a yoga mat with a blanket vs a soft bed, as long as we're somewhere with climate control, reasonably clean floors, and no bugs. If another person/people would prefer the soft bed, group preferences are even further maximized by such an arrangement. Yet many people would be aghast at such an offer, because they culturally assume soft beds are better than nice hard supportive floors, couples have to sleep together every single night of their lives, elders must take the best beds, etc.</p>

<p>Is there any way to couch these sorts of offers or questions so that a person might seriously evaluate the offer, and genuinely consider my proposal or query, and understand that I will genuinely be happier with the culturally-unsanctioned alternative I'm proposing?</p>

<p>Other times, I want to offer money/time/effort, spend money/time/effort, or conserve money/time/effort in ways that certain cultures just don't comprehend.</p>

<p>What are general strategies for proposing culturally off-color ideas to people in persuasive, non-offensive ways?</p>

"How to tactfully refuse to provide academic help?","<p>As an undergraduate student(and a so-called nerd), I have had friends who requested academic help a day or two before exams. Now, I don't have much problem with helping them and I try my best to do that. <strong>However, you can't help everyone all the time.</strong></p>

<p>I learnt that the hard way in my mid-term exams because I didn't work enough on my weaknesses because most of my time was spent clearing any doubts(Solving the questions) my friends had. And those questions hardly ever overlapped with my weaknesses. Hence, my weaknesses remained exactly that. </p>

<p><strong>How do I refuse to provide help?</strong></p>

<p>Now, in my culture, it is sort of expected that if someone is good at, say, academics, they should help out the ones who are not so good at it. So, a direct no tends to harm relations with friends and also leads to you being seen as an arrogant jerk. I can tell them to come at a later time but they usually return at another time when I am even more busy and further excuses only serve to adversely affect relations. (<em>Note that: There is no severe deterioration. It is just that, it doesn't help with how people see you, and trust me, in my culture, how people see you, is very important</em>)</p>

<p>I have tried going to the library more often to counter this problem but the atmosphere in a library doesn't suit me and hence, even that is not an option. </p>

"How can I avoid signing the attendance sheet for someone who wants to sit out a class?","<p>There is a guy in my Master's classes, who says hi to me (and to a bunch of other women) and with whom I have occasionally engaged in small talk, mainly commenting on the lectures. </p>

<p>Last week, I missed two consecutive lectures because I was sick. Next time I had class, the moment the guy saw me he instantly was like, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey what happened to you? Why didn't you give any of us your phone number? Don't be silly, <em>we</em> could have signed you in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently, there are a number of women in this program and this guy, who sign each other in when some of them don't want to attend a lecture. No biggie to them. </p>

<p>So ideally when that guy asked me that question, I would like to have said ""Duh, because I didn't want to?"". The guy had already given me his name and number before I had the chance to respond.  </p>

<p>I decided to not think much of it.  I would never call the guy anyway.  We ended up exchanging numbers. It felt ""whatever"" at the time.  </p>

<p>However, I now have second thoughts about it.</p>

<p>We are only allowed ten absences in this course, and this is why a lot of students sometimes just show up to sign their name and leave. Smart, right? So far none of the lecturers have taken attendance and I have a feeling they don't care. They are getting paid. (Meanwhile, the number of attendees has visibly decreased). </p>

<p>Long story short, I don't want to forge someone's signature, even if it's just their initials. I find it unethical, enabling and so on...</p>

  Don't think like that, it means you like fights. Try to target fight

  100% then only reach 80%, you are targeting 40% and you will get only

<li>Don't bring others ( our parents, kids, relatives etc) in between us.</li>
<li>Start speaking with me within hours or same day after any argument or fight. -- She usually extends this period to 3-4 days at least.</li>
<li>After the silent period is over, discuss the issue with me so that we can avoid fight on the same issue next time. -- She usually never speaks about it, even I bring it up she avoids or listen without interest.</li>

<ol>
<li>In India, we marry only once in life (99.9% of people), so aligning with each other is very important else your life will be wasted.</li>
<li>I value peace inside home very much. I strongly believe that if one has money, fame, everything but no peace inside home, then one's life is worthless. So I am trying hard to avoid conflicts, resolve conflicts and maintaining peace.</li>
<li>I was top of my class and now work in IT. From my childhood people used to always say 'You know everything',  but my wife has almost no education (she went to school only for 6 years). So I strongly believe that I am eligible to teach my wife.</li>
<li>On the other hand, I used to listen carefully to advice. I believe that advice comes from someone's hard earned experience.</li>
<li>I strongly believe advising my wife is taking care of her. I cannot be idle when she is in trouble or when she misses good things.</li>
<li>I used to wish to live a 'more romantic, lovable' married life than others.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Real Goal:</strong> Still, I love her so much and want to live with her until my end. Whatever I am doing above are to achieve that goal, but in reality this marriage hurts me everyday without fail.</p>

<p>Either she disagrees by arguing/fighting with me or agrees and mostly doesn't do as agreed.</p>

<p><strong>I am desperate of saying same thing again and again</strong>, at the same time I want to learn the ways of communication to make her understand my views.</p>

<p><strong>As per my belief, my intentions are good, I am advising her to do good and avoid bad, but why doesn't she listen?</strong> </p>

<p>How can I communicate in a way she listens and acts accordingly?</p>

"How to try to make new friends? // How to get through a long ski season if I'm not able to Make any new friends?","<p>I'm 14 years old and I'm doing competitive ski racing.</p>

<p>This year, I moved up into an older ski group (U16). All my friends from the past year either quit ski racing to get a job, or they didn't move up to U16 and are still doing another year of U14.</p>

<p>So this year in my level there are 4 other guys. They are all really good friends and hang out together a lot. For the past few days I've been trying to hang out with them and become friends with them. Unfortunately I'm pretty bad at making friends and I'm a bit quieter. Because of this, they usually just tease me and don't want to hang out with me and usually just ditch me on the chair lift (I don't necessary blame them).</p>

<p>One of the guys is my age, and the other 3 are a year older than me. The only thing we have in common is ski racing, none of them go to my school or have other similar interests. They would be considered the ""popular"" guys and I'm the quiet kid/the not as popular guy.</p>

<p>The ski season is 6 months long, and on the average week we ski 3-4 long days, plus some times a night after school.</p>

<p>So I don't have much time to hang out with my good friends from school because I'm either skiing or trying to catch up with homework.</p>

<p>Also I don't do well with being alone for long periods of time, so if I have to up alone on the chairlift almost every time for multiple days a week, it will probably begin to drive me insane very quickly.</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>How can I try to become friends with the other 4 guys without seeming weird? And if I am completely unable to do this, how should I attempt to get through the next 6 months of isolation without going completely insane?</p>

<p>After a couple more weeks with him around, we agreed that he is likely being too protected by his parents (my opinion: most likely his mother, because his father is pretty strict), thus making him too reliant on others.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is trying to make a phone call. Even when the phone is well within his reach (conveniently placed by us), he still asked for someone to make a call for him. He knows how to make a call, he did it a few times before by himself, so he knows the code (password) to make outgoing call.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>After the work hour, he is always asking one of us to pack up his laptop. Yesterday I refused and encouraged him to do it by himself (after figuring out how much he is capable of). We cheered (kinda) him, and he tried to do it himself. Of course he can!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After figuring that he is perfectly capable to do most jobs he's currently asking people for help, I want to encourage him to learn to do things by himself. I certainly don't want him to get stuck in his wheelchair, and unable to do what he's perfectly capable of. Heck, if he wants to do sport, I'll definitely support him! (I think he has a strong body. I've seen him doing ""pull-ups"" using a 4-legs walking crutch!)</p>

<p>I'm sad that now he seems to ""enjoy being disabled"", as people always help him to do even simple stuffs (and maybe even didn't realize that he is perfectly capable of doing that by himself). I realize that this is not my business, if he wants to continue living like that, then go ahead. But I'm kinda scared of what will happen once his parents are gone.</p>

<p><strong>How to approach him to encourage him to be as independent as possible?</strong></p>

<p>I'm thinking to talk to him one-on-one, but I'm not confident that I can do that alone (I have a one-on-one encounter - with other person - that didn't go well). What can we, four persons in the room, do to encourage him to be independent? This can include us talking to him, or something we can do as a group, like refusing to make a call for him (while explaining the reason).</p>

I was able to choose between all laptops but I decided to buy a MacBook Pro 2017 because back in 2010 I had a MacBook pro as well and loved it to bits! I am very thankfull that my parents are able to give me such tech but after working with it for 3 months I highly regret my decision and want to go for a Windows laptop again. The MacBook starts to struggle because the RAM of the laptop is full when Photoshop and Google Chrome are running. And for a laptop worth €3200 that shouldn't be possible.</p>

<p>So what I am asking is how to approach my dad about this problem without sounding like a spoiled brat? My dad doesn't like losing money and selling the laptop means that some of the spendings will be lost because of it being ""second hand"". My dad also has quite a short fuse (gets angry quite fast if questions are asked at a bad time). </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> I contacted apple support about the ""ram issue"" but everything checked out fine. The laptop is in 100% perfect condition.</p>

<p>Should I make an ad for the laptop and wait for someone to offer me the desired amount before I approach my father? </p>

<p>Should I go to my father straight away? And ask him for any recommendations to resolve this ""problem"". </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Maybe also worth mentioning that the laptop I want to replace the laptop with is cheaper than the current one. MacBook €3199,- Dell XPS 15 €2599,-.</p>

"How to introduce myself to a coworker after a sufficiently awkward amount of time has passed","<p>I work as a junior programmer in a rather large office setting, and I would like to introduce myself to a coworker who works near me, but in a different field (possibly HR?). Unfortunately, I feel like this has been made difficult by the awkward situation I have placed myself in.</p>

<p>The only interaction I have had with her is a very brief work-related 
question she emailed me back when I started my job (about 5 months ago). Later she added me on LinkedIn, and I accepted her request, but for reasons I still can't fully explain, it never prompted me to talk to her in person, and a few months have passed since then.</p>

<p>Reasons for introducing myself and trying to get to know her:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>She seems like a friendly individual based on her interactions with other coworkers I have seen.</p></li>
<li><p>I feel very guilty for not talking to her after the LinkedIn request, and it feels like a missed networking opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>She is attractive and around my age.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Reasons for avoiding the introduction:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An incredibly uncomfortable amount of time has passed and it only gets worse.</p></li>
<li><p>Still feel guilty about the LinkedIn request, so I don't know how to bring it up.</p></li>
<li><p>The office space (open cubicles) has a hundreds of workers and I feel intimidated by the busy setting and the group of people she works with.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The situation bothers me even more because my coworker's cubicle is right next to the door, so I pass by her basically every time I go to the bathroom or enter/leave the office space.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>How could I introduce myself to this coworker?</strong></p>

<p>Should I try to wait to catch her in a more social event at the office rather than on the office floor during work hours? Should I bring up the LinkedIn connection?</p>

<p>I fully understand that she probably has no strong reason to initiate an introduction with me on her own. As I said, the office has many workers passing by her every day, and many of them seem to be socially awkward programmers, and it's evident that I am just one of them.</p>

"If someone you love wants sex, should you give it to them to make them happy?","<p>I feel stupid for asking, but I need a third party.</p>

<p>I have recently been looking back into the religion of my youth and I've decided it's something I want in my life. This would mean a few things, but the one in question is not having sex before marriage. I've been sexually active for years and it's something 
I've enjoyed, but not as much as most people. I am willing to give it up for the next few years. </p>

<p>My girlfriend/fiancée (no date, just decided we want to get married at some point) does not feel the same. When I expressed to her my interest in this religion, she was a little shocked, but asked me to tell her about it. I brought it up early on that it would mean no more sex for now, which she didn't like but essentially said she's willing to wait for me. However, now it's been a few weeks and she is very irritated and said she won't be happy in the relationship unless our sex life goes back to normal.</p>

<p>I would do anything for her, so i told her i would. I'm not very comfortable and it's not something I want, but I feel like I should for her. I feel like it's my fault, but I'm also sad because I feel like she isn't willing to do whatever it takes to make me happy, which i am willing to do for her. Is that a valid feeling? Did I make the right choice, or should i try expressing it to her again?</p>

"How to stop unwanted advice about my pet?","<p>Me and my partner have an indoor cat. She stays in our apartment except when we are away travelling, then we take her to my partner's parents to look after her until we get back (this happens 2-3 times a year for about a week or less at a time). Both the parents are very fond of her and especially the mother (let's call her Amy) loves taking care of and playing with her. When she communicates by phone or when we are visiting, she always asks how the cat is first.</p>

<p>Our kitty is healthy (physically and mentally) and quite well trained (she rarely gets into trouble). When she's visiting Amy's house she gets spoiled of course, but I don't mind at all. What I do mind though is that Amy feels entitled to give advice about how to raise the kitty - e.g. that she needs to eat in the morning as well, have access to all rooms when we are at work. This advice gets repeated almost every time we speak and it often has an accusatory tone which I am not fond of.</p>

<p>What have I tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kindly explain <strong>why</strong> the kitty cannot have all that and <strong>how</strong> this doesn't make her less happy.</li>
<li>Change the subject.</li>
<li>Not answer/speak at all.</li>
<li>Note that we have already discussed this and concluded it wasn't possible to follow the advice.</li>
</ul>

<p>What was the impact of my above actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Same advice given next time we meet, although I don't think Amy forgot the justification I've given previously. Anyway, I have repeated the justification quite a few times.</li>
<li>Same.</li>
<li>""Did you hear me?"" and further elaborating on what she believes must be done. And the same advice being given next time we meet.</li>
<li>Acted offended for the rest of the visit. Same advice next time.</li>
</ul>

<p>My partner - Amy's child - either ignores her or becomes a little rude (when tired). Ignoring her didn't work for me as I mentioned earlier and I really want to avoid being rude as I am too grateful to them for taking care of my cat. </p>

<p>NOTE: Amy has never had an indoor cat before.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way that I can avoid such unwanted advice from Amy (permanently if possible)?</strong></p>

"How to say no to people asking for charity without feeling bad about it?","<p>Now don't get me wrong, I know the title of the question can feel a little awkward, but I am a person who chooses his ""battles"" very carefully, therefore helping those in need is something that I don't do often, that I surely ponder a lot, and (sorry if this may seem arrogant) I get to choose <em>who I am helping</em> and for what.<br>
I wouldn't have any problems sparing some change, but I really feel bad, when I have to lie about it (<em>""I'm sorry I don't have any money with me""</em>), because I get pestered. This happens <strong>especially</strong> if people are asking for money for organizations that help children.<br>
My brain gets irritated every time I get stopped by someone who asks ""are children important for you?"" and my heart feels broken because I don't have the words to say ""they are, I realize what you're asking, but no"".<br>
Ignoring people stopping me makes me feel the same way.</p>

"etiquette in dealing with long cold war","<p>Let's call this friend, lady A.</p>

<p>We begun as friends three years ago through a dating site but she was warm with her affections shortly into the friendship through the show of her handmade gifts to me.</p>

<p>In the second month that we met, I've initiated a relationship but was rejected on grounds that my time abroad would span many years.</p>

<p>In the following week, I slept, dated and entered into a relationship with another lady. This relationship has since ended but in the three years I not only took our friendship for granted, being insensitive but also boasted my sexual escapade with other females to her to incite envy.</p>

<p>Yet, in this period, I've also made it obviously known that I have feelings for her and still cared for her.</p>

<p>Since last August, lady A has blocked me on all social media platform - except Whatsapp. </p>

<p>While I have recently got in touch with her via email on grounds of work-related matter and consequently chatted with her a bit via Whatsapp, she has again blocked me for <em>no apparent reasons</em>. </p>

<p>This short contact lasted barely three weeks.</p>

<p>To salvage the matter, I have called her to apologise last week but she refused to want to know anything in my life and felt no need for me to know anything in her life. </p>

<p>I have made known to her I would do anything it takes to mend the friendship and feelings between us.</p>

<p>On one hand, I want to respect her decision but on the other hand, I would like to preserve this friendship. </p>

<p><strong>What is my best course of action for any chance in mending the feelings between us?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of proverbial aggression by the posters against the actions I've committed. There is no doubt that my actions were harmful to her but I did what I did in a last attempt to protect myself - I've been in multiple positions where I've been rejected and told to <em>hang</em> around. </p>

<p>What transpired between lady A and I reminded me of the times I had to <em>hang</em> around; to be told that I've disappointed her by entering into a relationship a week after being rejected reopened certain wounds. </p>

<p>The actions I took which, consequently, hurt her was a strong defiance of my ability to retaliate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Has she actually told you to ""hang around""? (Comment by Em C)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She mentioned she doesn't want to know anything in my life nor wants me to know anything about her life but she also mentioned that ""we should just be acquaintance and speak once or twice a year"".</p>

<p>This lady is obviously hurt and I'm fully aware this is a delicate situation in which many things can go wrong. She should be given her time to heal and it seems important also for her to know that I was not behaving the way I did because I was a jerk by nature. I think I a penned letter explaining the rationale behind my past actions while reminding the little things I remembered about our friendship may be the last thing I can do.</p>

"How can I tactfully on a conflict-avoidance way, inform memorably a group of feminists some of their arguments affect our community because misandry?","<p><strong>Objective:</strong><br>
Remaining amicably, for them not to feel rejection on a personal way neither on a philosophical level, so they can still gather at our home and discuss feminism and activism, keeping hateful ideas out. I don't want to make them feel I'm dismissing their whole political stand, I've taken feminist postures many times myself because I take the side of justice.</p>

<p>But now I feel used because it seems some of them only listen to me when I'm actively helping their cause under their terms, but if I offer this type of insight they shut me out.</p>

<p>Phrasing confrontational arguments in a polite sounding sentence would not nearly suffice, that's why the <code>conflict-aversion</code> tag is there. I'm expecting a smart strategy that includes a way to measure success.</p>

<p>I care because my community is in fact troubled with double standards affecting both women and men. I've found many hateful speech and attitudes being fed.
I'm not a fan of judging people, only ideas. Some ideas stand in the way for them to be listened to.</p>

<p>I don't believe there are ""misogynists"" and ""misandrists"", but people acting on misogynistic and misandristic <strong>ideas</strong> I have no trouble debating this topic with men shooting themselves on the foot with misandristic comments coming from the ""macho"" spectrum, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yeah dude, we men are spendable, nature says so, wars prove me right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I don't know how to discuss with a feminist group saying things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Of course men are allowed to cry, but to be honest it kinda does make them less manly""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That will be done by robots soon and we won't need men.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is he good for if he can't (insert stereotypical manly skill)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've found it very difficult to bring up the topic. In the past I did approach a couple of groups with this issue. Their answers were similar to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Misandrism? What is that, does that even exist?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That's an anti-feminist made-up word""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is the same as being dismissed. </p>

<p>I tried to explain what I knew about it and made the observation that it applies to both men and women.</p>

<p>While trying to remain cordial and constructive during these discussions, there are individuals with a tendency to throw popular terms at me like ""mansplaining"".</p>

<p>Answering</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Telling you a word exists because the phenomenon exists is not mansplaining""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>didn't help. Defending my views become harder when you realize the word is not even included in most dictionaries (including apple's, windows, chrome's auto-correct tools).</p>

<p>The group I'd be approaching now has direct influence on a person I care about deeply, my girlfriend. They gather at the place I share with her usually after they have larger meetings. But I've also noticed those comments at larger meetings/gatherings (weddings, congresses, etc), not only my distant family but also friend's events and at other events where many women gather and men are minority.</p>

<p><strong>How can I approach an otherwise open-minded feminist group that seems biased against hearing about misandry?</strong></p>

"My new neighbours have very nicely requested something that I find unreasonable, how should I proceed?","<p>Background: 
We recently moved to a new neighborhood and it's rather dark at night (not many street lights). Most neighbors leave outside house lights on at night. </p>

<p>Issue:
About a month after we moved in a neighbor put a half-page letter in our mailbox stating that our outside lights shine into their bedroom, meaning they can't have their windows open at night. They've asked us not to use our lights at night but ending with essentially ""of course it's up to you what you do.""</p>

<p>Other info:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only spoken to the neighbor once (""hi my name is..."") for about 30
seconds since moving in</li>
<li>Neighbors in question are across the street and over one house, so maybe a couple hundred feet from the light source</li>
<li>I don't see how our lights (recessed floods pointing downwards) could be shining into their room, but also don't think they're lying </li>
<li>The outside area where our outside lights are intending to illuminate is very dark, e.g. wouldn't be able to unlock a car parked
there without the lights on.</li>
<li>Although I'm not too concerned about crime, the area the lights illuminate is steep so slips/falls are possible.</li>
<li>My wife thinks we should ignore the letter, and not give them any power over the situation. My MIL thinks the people are ""crazy"" for making the request.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible options I see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep using the lights as we want. They have the problem, so need to adjust.</li>
<li>Stop using the lights, since it obviously bothers them and we're ""nice people."" Remember to bring a flashlight when walking by the area.</li>
<li>Plan to turn the lights off at some predetermined time, like 10PM, except when we know we'll be out and need them on when we return (infrequent).</li>
</ul>

<p>3 Questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Is it reasonable for them to make their ""no lights"" request?</li>
<li>Do we respond at all? I assume we will live across the street from these people for many years.</li>
<li>How much do we ""give"" in trying to achieve a compromise, assuming they are even open to one?</li>

"How to try to get my neighbour to park their car in their assigned spot?","<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>I live in an allotment with a shared parking <strong>with assigned spots</strong>. One of my neighbours always parks their car in front of the door of my building instead of in their assigned spot. They also have access to the parking but they would never use it, <strong>despite the fact that it's not allowed to park in front of the building</strong>. The problem is, that the path where they park is not wide enough and so whenever they park in front of the building, it leads to two issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Their car blocks some parking spots and therefore prevents people from parking in their spot,</li>
<li>If we already have parked in our assigned spot, their car prevents us from getting out of it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I used my excellent skills in Paint to make a drawing of the situation:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZb74.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eZb74.png"" alt=""Drawing of the &quot;parking situation&quot;""></a></p>

<h2>What I've tried so far</h2>

<p>A year ago, I met them as they were getting out of their car after parking, and so I politely asked them if they had a reason to park here. They told me that their car's suspensions were too fragile to handle the little step that needs to be climbed to go in their assigned spot (the whole parking has such steps). Their explanation didn't make any sense to me (what car is not able to climb a 4cm step?) so I just let it go. They continued parking there since.  </p>

<p>I thought of putting a note on their windscreen to tell them they block the way but I found it rude.</p>

<p>There's already been accidents in the allotment. Their car is wrecked of getting bumped and my own landlord bumped their car because it was standing in the way. She warned them (and paid for the damage) and told them not to park there, but they haven't stopped doing it. <strong>I can't escalate to their landlord because they own their apartment. Bringing it to joint ownership meetings is a possibility, though (i.e. the allotment residents meetings).</strong> We don't have a building manager or common-property manager.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p><strong>How can I try to get my neighbour to park in their assigned spot instead of blocking the way?</strong></p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>My landlord told me she thinks this neighbour has OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), but I don't know that for sure since the neighbour never told me themselves.  They suspect OCD because of some behaviors of theirs, like stealing the whole building's doormats to cover their floor with them. They also have routines when they leave their car that makes me suspecting they indeed have OCD. If someone has experience with OCD, I'd be happy to get answers that take it into account as well.</p>

<h2>More details</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>They indeed actually park their car <strong>right in front of the door</strong>. It's not really a problem for pedestrians for we have a sidewalk between the street and the entrance door, so trollers can pass anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>The 4cm step I mentioned is actually a <strong>slope</strong>, so it's not a problem even for a car with delicate suspensions.</p></li>
<li><p>We don't have (to my knowledge) municipal parking management units. Even though it existed, they actually could not do anything since, as an allotment, <strong>it is a private location</strong> (and therefore a private road). The complex does not have any agreement with a private towing company to service the lot.</p></li>
<li><p>The location where they park is indeed a <strong>safety issue</strong> regarding a  situation where there is fire or a resident shall leave in an ambulance.</p></li>
<li><p>We're not paying for the spot separately from our rent and utilities (it's a whole package). Therefore, we can't just threaten our landlord not to pay for the spot for she would talk to them.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no wheelchair users in my building. </p></li>
<li><p>My landlord lives in the condo below the bad parker.</p></li>

"How do I effectively fix a situation in which I personally insulted a friend out of anger?","<p>I've been friends with three other men since high school, Alex, Michael and Luke. We're all in our mid twenties. Since not all of us live in the same city anymore, I created a Discord server for us to communicate, acting mostly as a group chat.</p>

<p>My friends and I often <strong>all</strong> participate in ""pranks"" with each other. Usually online, but sometimes offline. Some examples being:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purposefully making a bad play in a team-based game we're ahead in combined with a Steve Urkel-esque, ""Did I do that?""</li>
<li>Changing the virtual locks on our base in the game Rust, immediately ready to undo it once someone notices</li>
<li>We make fun of Alex, he's an artist, by saying things like ""Who would pay money for this?"" in reference to his art (we've all, on our own, praised his art in the past)</li>
<li>We make fun of Michael as a member of the U.S. military by saying things like ""Our nation's finest, people."" when he makes a bad play in a video game</li>
<li>We make fun of Luke for having a strong opinion on not sweating small details in the way he lives/his appearance, fondly calling him ""garbage man"" due to his tendency to keep trash/garbage on his floor in his room</li>
<li>We make of me for being a bit of a braggart saying things like ""Oh listen to Steve he's got a master's degree"" with a sarcastic tone</li>
<li>On occassion we've kicked another person out of the Discord saying something like ""Banned"" right before doing so, each time immediately reinviting and reinstating existing permissions/roles</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of everyone in the group, I indulge in this type of humor most frequently. I would say probably 5-10x as much. Although I'd say each of us pokes fun at the other at least once when we're all together online or offline. This is a behavior that I have <strong>actively been working on avoiding</strong> and I have made progress into less frequently doing this, which some people have noticed.</p>

<p>Our group is no stranger to disagreements, every once in a while things get heated, but for the most part they get resolved. In my case, I get a little more frustrated and often find myself taking a break from the group, leaving the Discord server for a weekto cool off abnd talk to whomever I had a disagreement and come to a resolution. This type of situation has <strong>never</strong> happened with Luke. Upon my return, I would be granted back the same permissions/ownership role until after the third or so time in which it was given to Alex and then Luke, later. I've had my personal disagreements with Alex and Luke with how they managed the server, but nothing that has gotten too out of hand or anything that's been personal.</p>

<p>Over the past two months of so, I had asked Luke to give all four of us a specific permission to manage a music playing bot in the server. This gave us the ability to skip a song in its playlist. During a conversation, we were having, I was made aware that a friend didn't know that Tom Petty had passed away this year and we jokingly talked about how we couldn't think of any Tom Petty songs besides ""Free Fallin'"". So I emptied the queue of the current songs and queued up ""Free Fallin'"" multiple times. Immediately, Luke took the permission away from me and removed all of it.</p>

<p>I was irrationally angry at this point. From my perspective, I was playing off of a joke and a permission that I had asked for specifically to solve pain issues (often times people would accidentally queue the wrong thing and no one could skip that song) was taken away. I left the Discord server, angry, fearful of what this meant for me, and feeling ashamed that apparently I couldn't handle that responsibility even though I thought I had used it in an ""appropriately"" inappropriate way. I snapped and personally insulted him on another messaging platform with the gist of it being, ""You have an extremely flawed personality and because of it you couldn't handle your most recent relationship.""</p>

<p>After this, I took a step back for a week to cool off. While I wasn't part of the server, I attempted to invite Luke, and two other friends, Sam and Bob, to dinner, my treat. At this point I had no idea how upset Luke was. After receiving no response from Luke, Sam had told me that Luke was very upset with me. They had been having a conversation with Alex as well about how Luke was ""done"" with me. He said that all of my previous behaviors combined with this made him extremely upset and that he didn't want to deal with me anymore. I heard this solely through Sam, but he had shown me screenshots of the conversation (that I did <strong>not</strong> ask for).</p>

<p>I felt horrible. I didn't realize I had cut so deep, even though that was what my angry self had attempted, especially since Luke is usually the one friend of ours who seems unphased by most things. So I apologized saying something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm sorry for the harsh words I used towards you. There's no real excuse for my behavior. I don't want you to think that I don't like you or don't think you're a good person. I was angry about something dumb and went for a cheap, easy blow in order to blow off some steam which was wrong of me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He hasn't responded and according to Sam and Alex, it doesn't seem like he's going to. He's ""done"".</p>

<p>I'm concerned about two things: my relationship with Luke and my relationship with Alex and Michael. They're all dear friends of mine and I'd hate to lose any of them; I care very deeply for them.</p>

<h3>Is there anything I can do in this situation with Luke outside of just waiting and seeing if he accepts my apology?</h3>

<h3>In the event he doesn't, what's the best way I can maintain a healthy relationship with Alex and Michael?</h3>

"How to tell colleague she is mumbling?","<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The other day, I attended an onboarding session that teaches new hires the history and structure of the company, and also a high-level overview of product architecture, pricing and support contract types. This event happens several times a year and is always held by the same colleague; let's call her Alice.</p>

<p>All in all, the session was okay. Alice has a lively, engaging style of presenting that involved anecdotes and the occasional gag. She also tried to inject some interactivity to avoid a boring, teacher-to-pupils like lecture atmosphere.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Alice is mumbling. She speaks loud enough, but she doesn't drop her lower jaw enough to articulate the words very clearly.</p>

<p>I know that this is a problem because in casual conversation among smaller groups during breaks, several other attendees mentioned it. Yet in the session itself, nobody ever asked Alice to repeat something, or indicated they could not understand her very well.</p>

<p>Maybe people (new hires &amp; existing colleagues) don't really tell Alice there is a problem because of these facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alice is the head of the sales department</li>
<li>She was with the company nearly from the start, more than a dozen years ago.</li>
<li>Up until recently, she was the wife to one of the CEOs (they parted amicably). Her last name hints at it, so she even mentions it briefly in the onboarding session.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, as Alice has a very strong personality, people may simply not have the guts to tell her.</p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<p>I really want to do something about it because I feel that the situation is bad for the company. However, Alice has just met me, so I don't want her to remember me as the guy who was nitpicking/critizing her.</p>

<p>So how can I make her aware of it in a polite and constructive way?</p>

<ul>
<li>I could talk to her in private (or more likely via chat as she is based in another location). How would I go about this to not insult her or sound condescending?</li>
<li>I could include my concerns about her mumbling in the feedback about the session content I plan to give to Jane, the HR assistant organizing the onboarding process as a whole (which also has other sessions). My idea was that Jane maybe knows better how to approach her.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Background</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am not a new hire, but part of the management of a much smaller subsidiary company that was acquired a few years ago. Some of my colleages and I attended the event because our company recently moved in with the parent company, and Jane from HR suggested we attend because we might catch some things that are new to us.</li>

"Unsure of how to handle upcoming high school reunion after being collectively ghosted","<p>My high school 10 year reunion is coming up. </p>

<p>I missed most of high school senior year due to a physical illness, the symptoms of which started the summer before. At the time, the diagnosis meant that I would have to try various treatments until I found one that worked for me as there was no cure. I eventually lost near 100 pounds and underwent relatively mild chemotherapy in addition to other prescribed medications with nasty side-effects. As I got progressively sicker, I spent more time stuck in my house and unable to go places because of high levels of physical pain. It was around this time that the two people I considered best friends <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosting_(relationships)"" rel=""noreferrer"">ghosted</a> me, effectively preventing me from partaking in any events with high school peers (as they were closer to other people and I had been 'forgotten about' while stuck at home. 5-6 years after high school (and 5 diagnoses later), I was cured and my life has since approached full normalcy. </p>

<p>About two years ago, I saw a snapchat from a mutual classmate, which alerted me that the two people that ghosted me were at a bar/diner close to my house. I went there and saw them, at which point they told me that they were wrong to ghost and would talk about it the day after. Come the next day, they chickened out. Since then, all of those classmates at the bar/diner that night have since deleted me off of social media. </p>

<p>The invite for the high school reunion came roughly a week ago and takes place in about 2 months. These are a few things that went through my head (<em>not my actual IPS questions</em>):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's possible that my attendance will prevent the attendance of some of my peers (such as those at the bar/diner). As it is a reunion and they were generally more popular/well-liked than I was by our peers, I expect more people are curious about them than they are about me. Do they have more of a right to be there than I do? </p></li>
<li><p>I do not think people outside of those at the bar/diner that night are aware of the ghosting. Could my (non-)attendance cause a domino-effect of events that would make others in my class aware of the issue?</p></li>
<li><p>If I do go, I would try not to rehash old dramas. But I'm not sure exactly how to act. Do I pretend like everything is cool, as if nothing ever happened? Do I say hi to them or avoid them?</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>And now to my actual question:</p>

<p>I want to go to the reunion and enjoy catching up with classmates. Regarding the people that ghosted me and their circles, I'm hoping to <strong>minimize the awkward tension</strong>. I'm not sure how to go about doing so. This is the question I'd like help with the most - <strong>how do I act on my end to achieve this?</strong></p>

"When is it rude to speak a language that other people around do not understand?","<p>When is it rude to speak a language that at least one person who can hear cannot understand? My family and friends generally are of the opinion this is rude behavior but I noticed with some new roommates and some answers to my previous questions some people do not have the same opinion?</p>

<p>I have a couple roommates from Poland that often speak a different language that other people can't understand. They do this in the common areas, even when other people are near them. I was very surprised to see that the Polish roommates invite over guests who can't speak Polish and speak it in front of them. To me this is very rude because it's excluding someone you invited. This has happened on multiple occasions and it's not a brief thing but lasts for minutes. </p>

<p>Is it cultural? Do some people not consider this rude? Obviously there's varying degrees but to me it certainly crosses the line when you invite a guest and in front of them speak a language they don't understand and the guest is left just sitting there awkwardly. I'm very curious how they interpret the situation and wonder if there's a way I can ask them what they're thinking? </p>

<p>I know it's difficult to learn a language, but one thing that makes this different from what I've experienced in the past is that they go straight into the other language where other people tend to try in English and then use their native language after having too much difficulty in English. To put simply it seems they don't even try English, though they speak it well when they do.</p>

While the place was not at all bad and I left on fairly friendly terms (as much as possible when your leaving itself hurts the company), I really love my current workplace and have no desire to go back. I've already decided on a ""no"" for an answer, but I can't come up with a good way to put it that minimizes the chances of them being upset. I don't want to burn any bridges, who knows what the future holds.</p>

<p>At the same time, I'm a person who really dislikes conflict, so when people try to pressure me, I tend to give in just to keep the peace. They, on the other hand, have no issues with pressuring people, and they could reeeeally use my help, so that's another thing I'm worried about.  I know I will not give in, but there is the potential for me becoming reeeeally uncomfortable. <em>I'm looking for some way of answering that leaves them with no further recourse but to accept it; where it's pointless to try and pressure me.</em></p>

<p>Some options I've considered:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Saying that I want to come back, and name a salary too large.</strong> This is risky. Obviously, there is <em>some</em> price at which I will move. If they promise me a million euros a month, I'll do it, of course. But where is that line? The real answer to that question I don't know myself. If I name the price too ludicrously high, I'm afraid it'll sound like I'm blowing them off. If I make it plausible, there's a chance they might actually offer it to me and then I'll have to either accept it, or tell them that I was lying. In addition, even if they do accept a very high salary, I'm not certain how long they would be able to pay it out. They have made some too optimistic decisions at past.</li>
<li><strong>Saying that I won't come back because there are some ""personal"" or ""family"" reasons.</strong> That's nonspecific enough and would prevent further prying (I think), but I also feel like this still sounds too much like an excuse. It's obvious that I'm not telling something and trying to avoid conversation. I doubt they will be happy with this.</li>
<li><strong>Telling them the truth by simply saying that I like the new place better.</strong> I believe this would be just followed with more questions about what <em>exactly</em> do I like here better, insistence that their place is pretty good too, more offers of a bigger salary, and other kinds of pressuring.</li>
</ul>

<p>So... <strong>How can I politely decline a job offer from a previous employer, avoid them challenging my reasons for doing so, yet not burn bridges?</strong> </p>

<p>P.S. Almost forgot - as for my culture, I'm from Europe. Hope that's enough.</p>

"How can I deal with uncomfortable silence from my partner?","<p>First of all, I want to say that I'm talking about when my girlfriend is silent, it's not 'silent treatment'. I don't feel like she has cruel intentions, or is intentionally trying to hurt me in any way when she goes uber quiet. A better explanation is that we are both anxious introverts. When she gets nervous, she gets quiet, but she tends to want to stay in the same room.</p>

<p>I have ADHD, and so find this silence petrifying, and generally get close to or have an anxiety attack when it happens.</p>

<p>Not all silences are uncomfortable. Sometimes they are welcomed. I'm happy to sit around with her in the sun, cuddling, lying in bed and driving together. I can be silent for long periods, by myself, or around friends.</p>

<p>One when it's an ambiguous silence where she stares at me, like she people watches on public transport. It's like she's waiting for me to say something. This can last for up to three days straight, while I walk around on eggshells.</p>

<p>I keep thinking (internally) the entire time: <em>""If you want quiet, why stare at me like you want a conversation?""</em> or <em>""If you want a conversation, why not just start one?""</em></p>

<p>I do know some of the reasons her silences start: </p>

<ul>
<li>When she asks me personal or politically loaded questions. I try to answer honestly. When I ask what she thinks about the topic, it's met with the shortest possible answer. Six words in some cases. When I ask why she wants to know what I think (her motivations), it's met with silence or defensiveness.</li>
<li>When she perceives that I have a frustrated 'tone', even when I am agreeing with her.</li>
<li>When she thinks I should be angry about something, yet I'm fine. So, this is the exact opposite to the previous point: a lack of frustration in my tone. Note: I've checked in with her when this happens, and she says there's no negative tone.</li>
<li>When she perceives me as anxious</li>
<li>When we disagree about a topic. This is when she doesn't talk to me for three days. I don't always need to be right, I admit my mistakes and apologise sincerely.</li>
</ul>

<p>We live together, so I have tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking her a question: she replies with a series of one-word answers, or none at all.</li>
<li>I've tried assertively mentioning it, in a variety of different ways. This seems to have made things worse.</li>
<li>Asking her what she needs/wants from me - she never answers that she wants anything.</li>
<li>Talking through the disagreement - this is a necessary step for her to start talking again. But it takes 2-3 days before she's ready to talk. That duration is the petrifying part.</li>
<li>Avoiding conflict/criticism - she doesn't have a reason to go silent if there's no disagreement right? Wrong. We haven't disagreed in a month, and she found a reason to bring up an insecurity from 6 months ago. Where she felt guilty for doing something wrong. I listened, reflected, and reassured her. The result? 3 days of petrifying silence.</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand that sometimes, silence is an answer. It's perfectly acceptable. The problem is when it's coupled with her stare. This makes the silence ambiguous. So I can't tell what the silence means, it could mean one of 1000 things. That's what makes me uncomfortable. </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything else that I can do to improve communication with her when she does this and handle the uncomfortable silence and staring at me?</strong></p>

<p>I'm seeking answers that are pragmatic, actionable, and long-term. Finally, I'd like to keep my actions honest, caring, and trustworthy. I love her deeply and don't want to manipulate her in any way. And I'm hoping to form a plan which includes trust, communication, and kindness.</p>

"How to befriend someone who doesn't like to talk?","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I’m a 22-year-old woman, my brother is a 25-year-old man. We were close growing up, but around high school we drifted apart. As of now I wouldn’t say there’s much friendship between us at all—though to be clear, there is also no animosity. I’ve come to realize that it’s very important to me to have a closer relationship with my brother, and I think the roadblock is our differing communication styles. </p>

<p>For me, friendships are definitely about talking. When my friends and I hang out whatever we end up doing is really just a backdrop for our conversation. I know I’m close to someone because we talk often, I enjoy hearing their perspective, and I feel like I can tell them anything. </p>

<p>My brother is very different. He very rarely initiates conversation-- I cant' think of a single instance-- and usually responds non-verbally or with very few words when people speak to him. I don’t think he’s shy or uncomfortable in social situations—he actually has a very large circle of friends, and goes out to bars and parties several nights a week. I also don’t think it’s only around me that he becomes quiet, because even his best friends joke that they’ve never heard his voice. This is also not a matter of shallow vs. deep friendships, as I am certain that there are strong emotional bonds between my brother and his closest friends. </p>

<p>I want to clarify that I never get unfriendly or disinterested vibes from him. He’s a perfectly nice guy, but also a very quiet guy.</p>

<p><strong>What I’ve tried:</strong> </p>

<p>My normal approach when I want to make friends is to ask leading questions until I hit on something they love to talk about. That approach emphatically does not work here. I’ll say something, he’ll smile and say about two words (or none at all), then the conversation goes dead until I say something else. </p>

<p>Because my brother has formed close friendships that don't seem to involve much talking, I don't believe that talking is his primary method of relating to others. I think I need a new way of befriending my brother that doesn’t rely on having a conversation. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>How do I become friends with someone who doesn’t like to talk? Or, more generally, what besides conversation can be the basis of a friendship?</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>I’m not looking for other ways to initiate conversation. I really want to reach out to him in a way that gels with his communication style, not in a way that gels with mine.</p>

<p>I am especially interested in hearing from other people who don’t like to talk, or who have friends that don’t like to talk. </p>

"How to talk to parents who undermine tutoring","<p>I do some in-home tutoring, and this sometimes means working in a family space. However, as a tutor, I also have to create a professional setting that allows the kid to focus and recognize they're working, not just hanging out at their dining room table.</p>

<p>Most parents get that and allow the space to be created, e.g. by chilling in the next room or working silently. But others will walk through with young siblings (very distracting!), put on a loud movie, come in and tousle the kid's hair, or urge them to do something that I don't particularly need but they see as the basics of hospitality: ""How can you not have gotten your tutor a glass of water?"" and so on. In one case, a parent has brought a kid to tears with scolding during a lesson. We lost a lot of time recovering from the disruption.</p>

<p>I have a few years of experience tutoring now, but I'm still not great at asserting the professional boundaries of a lesson. It's hard to overrule the fact that it's their house, their kid, and their money. Plus I'm young, being in my mid-twenties. (To be clear, these are objections I consider, not that I've been told. I rarely broach the subject.)</p>

<p>How can I communicate that despite those things, I need to set the ground rules?</p>

"How to bring up old problems","<h1>Situation</h1>

<p>When I talk to people, sometimes they will insult me, mock me or, make fun of me but I miss that this is what they are doing and laugh along with them. I do not do this all the time, I understand the obvious ones but from time to time more sneaky ones gets unnoticed. Sometimes I will realize after the fact or my wife will ask why I didn't say anything when they insulted me.</p>

<p>The problem is, this often happens when that conversation is long over and the topic is closed etc. Now, if I confront them, it is weird because I already laughed with them and said nothing when they insulted me. I often have trouble explaining the problem without them seeing me negatively or thinking that my wife put me up to it. When I do manage to get past this, then they will simply ignore it: ""it is water under the bridge..."" ""Why so much trouble for a very little inconvenience? we will not do it again if you say so"" etc.</p>

<p>I thought about changing the people. But it is not very plausible. Some of them are close family. I also seem to have this problem with enough people that it can't be solved by simply cutting a few people out of my life. </p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>I miss the opportunity to address issues while they are happening. I later understand the issue and if I cannot ignore it, it starts to bug me and I want to open that topic again to handle it properly. </p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How can I bring up and old issue without making a fool of myself/creating an awkward situation?</p>

<hr>

<h1><strong>Example Dialog:</strong></h1>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> I just bought this watch. Did you like it?<br>
  <strong>Friend:</strong> Yes, it is cool. But did not they have a male version of it?<br>
  <strong>Me:</strong> This is already male version. Woman watches have smaller faces.<br>
  <strong>Friend:</strong> Ah my bad, it is very nice (while everyone laughing)<br>
  and conversation continues...    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note 1: This did not happen but I could not come up with an immediate example small enough to fit here. And this one covers the basic concept.</em>   </p>

<p><em>Note 2: In my country (like many others), if you call a man ""woman/female/girly etc."" it is an insult.</em></p>

<p>So, when I think about this conversation later, I figure out he meant to call me a woman and people were laughing at me. Not laughing him because he could not tell a man watch from a woman watch. </p>

<hr>

<p>And usually I let this go. But if this bugs me too much, <strong>how can I open this topic again?</strong> My main problem with re-opening this issue is, I already kept talking to them as if nothing happened after the fact. Now returning back to that will be weird. I can imagine a number of possible ways it goes awkward:</p>

<p><em>(Option 1)</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> Hey, there is something bugging me since last night. You have called me a woman when I showed you my new watch. It made me sad.<br>
  <strong>Friend:</strong> No, I did not say anything like that. I just asked a question. You are making up accusitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Option 2)</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> Hey, there is something bugging me since last night. You have called me a woman when I showed you my new watch. It made me sad.<br>
  <strong>Friend:</strong> So you wasted your whole night just for a word I even don't remember saying? Then why you did not tell me right then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Option 3)</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> Hey, there is something bugging me since last night. You have called me a woman when I showed you my new watch. It made me sad.<br>
  <strong>Friend:</strong> I am sure your wife is provoking you. You were cool with that joke yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>(Option 4)</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> Hey, there is something bugging me since last night. You have called me a woman when I showed you my new watch. It made me sad.<br>
  <strong>Friend:</strong> Ok, I am sorry. Are you happy now?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, all the ways I can think of to approach this fails miserably. <strong>Is there any way to make this not so weird?</strong></p>

<p><em>(Sorry, this became a very long post but some explanation was requested.)</em></p>

"How can I convincingly communicate to a friend that I don't have a 'personal' mobile number?","<p>I dislike telephone communication in general, compared to face-to-face interactions. I am not interested in communicating with anybody with mobile phone, for socialising or professional purposes. <strong>I work from home now and am near-constantly reachable on the home land-line telephone number.</strong> </p>

<p>If I am out, nobody needs to reach me urgently anyway, except my family. So the only mobile phone I use is a ""family number"" for me to maintain contact with my parents and sister. This number is linked as a 'twin number' with my father's mobile under a ""family sharing plan"" offered by the telecom provider, and is not meant to be given to anyone else. The point is that <strong><em>the family mobile number is not the same as a personal mobile number</em></strong> because it is not even my phone or my number, and it could be used by any member of the family. </p>

<p><strong>I really don't have a personal mobile number</strong>, and it's mainly because I had several negative experiences with mobile phones when I used to be a high-ranking public health official in city administration for a 2-year period in 2010&ndash;12. I am not active on any social media except Stack Exchange which is apparently not a social media, and prefer to get communications by email rather than on a mobile. </p>

<p>However, it seems to be a new element of social culture here in India that whenever one meets an old friend / acquaintance, or meets someone new in a professional or personal setting, they end up asking for your mobile number. It is real-world social ""networking."" This happens to me routinely and I have struggled to give these people a good answer. People look amazed, disbelieving and hurt when I say that I don't have a mobile number. They want to know <strong><em>why</em></strong>. When I happened to meet an old classmate after several years last Sunday at the supermarket, this problem recurred:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After speaking with me for few minutes,</p>
  
  <p><strong>Friend concludes:</strong> OK I'll keep in touch. What's your Whatsapp number?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> you know my personality; I am not on social media.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Friend:</strong> still, you must be having a mobile number...</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> I don't have a mobile number. You can reach me anytime at my home number which you already know.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Friend:</strong> I seen a mobile phone in your pocket.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me:</strong> That's my mother's phone. You can reach me on that number too...</p>
  
  <p><strong>Friend:</strong> I don't want your mother's mobile number.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me (smiles sheepishly)</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Friend (disbelieving):</strong>  What? You really don't have a mobile number? Everyone has a mobile number. Why you don't have?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me (invents a weak excuse):</strong> I am changing my mobile number. The new number will be obtained in a few days. Meanwhile, you can reach me anytime at my home number.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Friend:</strong> OK, be sure to send me your new number when you get it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These people often look hurt when I say that I don't have a mobile number, as if they suspect me of being unwilling to share my mobile number with them. Some of them ask why, but I am not comfortable with discussing my reasons with these people. So I am forced to invent weak excuses. </p>

<p>It's a fact that I am extremely introverted and don't want casual telephonic contact with friends, relatives &amp; acquaintances. So my aim is to channel all calls to the one home-based land-line telephone number (or, alternatively, my mother's phone) so that I am actually reachable but people will use it only for a genuine purpose. However, I find that it is not enough for a person to be reachable on some telephone: Sharing one's personal mobile number has acquired a whole lot of social and interpersonal connotations so that not having a mobile number is viewed as unbelievable and downright counter-cultural in this age of instant communication.</p>

<p>If I meet this friend again a few weeks later he is sure to ask me again for my mobile number. How do I convincingly convey to friends and acquaintances that I don't have a mobile number of my own, <strong>without going into my personal reasons</strong> which I do not want to discuss with these people?</p>

<hr>

<p>Notes: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>honest yet blunt responses like ""this phone number is only for family members"", ""I dislike phone communication"" and ""I don't give anybody my mobile number"" are considered unfriendly in Indian culture unless you give them a full and detailed explanation of the reasons, which I don't want to get into in these cases. </p></li>
<li><p>As clarified by a very constructive <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/9852/how-can-i-convincingly-communicate-to-a-friend-that-i-dont-have-a-personal-mo?noredirect=1#comment39407_9852"">comment</a> from user @Cascabel, what I am really looking to convey convincingly to friends and acquaintances is that <em>I am not available for real-time voice-calling and WhatsApp-based communication via a mobile phone</em>, but saying that explicitly to them would be considered very unfriendly here.</p></li>
<li><p>May I also clarify that I am <em>not</em> asking for 'convincing excuses' as some members might have misunderstood, but seeking a convincing interpersonal approach to the situation?</p></li>

"How can I react better if someone confesses their identity that I have little or no knowledge of?","<p>Sometimes a person confesses to me in a conversation something that I don't know how to react to due to my sheer ignorance and lack of interactions with these people. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Person X: What are you eating?</p>
  
  <p>I: Chicken fillet!</p>
  
  <p>X: Whao! </p>
  
  <p>X: But I'm a vegetarian, if you'd like to know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, I'm not sure how to react. So my best reaction possible is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I: Ahhh~~~~</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I: Oh~~</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is because I have little or no knowledge of vegetarianism (and its siblings like veganism) and have rarely met such people in my life. Other such examples include LGBT, Christianity, Islam, refugees, etc.</p>

<p>These cases come almost always from my interactions with foreign citizens; even though 99.99% of the people I have interacted with in my life are people from my own country, the vast majority of these cases happen in my interaction with foreigners (that's why I'm not sure how to react), and I have encountered few or no such people from my own country.</p>

<p><sub>That doesn't mean these people don't exist in my country. They exist, but usually conceal their identities since they are still considered socially unacceptable or despised, or they live in a rather segregated way. I have no problem with these people but just am not sure how I should react.</sub></p>

<p>But I feel there is a better way to react. My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In these cases, if I just react by ""Ahhhh~~~~"" as I fail to come up with anything to respond, what kind of impressions do I make on the person?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any better way to react in these cases, without offending them? (At least I'm more inclined to believe it is rather rude to ask a question abruptly, such as <em>""Why did you become a vegetarian?""</em>)</p></li>

<p>I presented them with a thank you card and a box of hot cocoa with a ribbon. I didn't say, ""check inside"". I wanted it to be a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Weeks went by and I didn't hear anything. I don't expect a thank you for a thank you, but I began to wonder, maybe they don't like hot chocolate, and that gift card is going to waste in a box?

I didn't want to tell the neighbor I had asked because it would, to me, have appeared that I was trying to make myself look generous.</p>

"Discussing going to a therapist and seeing my father","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I'm a 22 year old male who had quite a rough past, however I will stick to what I think is important for the question. Currently I'm still a student. </p>

<p>When I was 16 I stopped going to my dad and seeing him altogether (still the case now). This was a huge event, I was mentally abused there. To be more specific: my brothers were physically abused from time to time by my stepmother. She has issues with anger management. While this is very bad, my father never acknowledged it and even denied that it was the case. The anger problems were never physical towards me, however the pressure was always present because of this.</p>

<p>My mother helped me get out of this situation and provided help when necessary. However she now tends to worry a lot for me, which makes sense considering what happened in the past. While she is not opposed to me going to a psychiatrist and my father, it will probably worry her very much.</p>

<p><strong>Event and result</strong></p>

<p>A few months ago my sister got engaged. While this is a happy event and I'm very glad that it is going to happen (she found a great man), this also correlates to something else. Going to see my father again after not speaking to him for 6 years. Because of this I think it is smart for me to go to an expert so I'm able to handle it well. </p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong></p>

<p>My sister currently has had contact with my father for ~1 year. I think it is safe to assume that my sister wants to get my father involved in the wedding. I did not discuss this with my sister.</p>

<p>It is not possible to <em>not</em> discuss this, because it will get out eventually.</p>

<p>I do not know specifically what would worry my mother (however that is a good point to address while discussing it with her). I do know she tends to get worried quite fast. She will probably worry the most about the impact the events will have on me.</p>

<p>Note that I think it is the best course of action because it will be mentally heavy to see my father again. Not going to see my father is not an option, because I want him to be able to walk my sister to the altar. </p>

<p>I plan to visit the therapist and my father alone, because I think that is important. </p>

"How to gracefully accept an implied/indirect compliment?","<p>Sometimes I'll be talking with someone who will slip an ""indirect"" compliment into the conversation.  Two examples:</p>

<p>(1) I was visiting my doctor for a somewhat ""childish"" (for lack of a better word) medical problem -- something that some people would associate with immaturity.  At one point, we had this exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: [Says something rather polite]</p>
  
  <p>Doctor: You know, my [medical issue I'm there for] patients are always the most mature ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2) This one is a little fuzzy and I might be misremembering, but it's still a good example.  I was in my high school's computer programming club, and I was talking with the club adviser (who was also the only CS teacher at the school) about something I'd coded.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: It was a little easier than I thought it would be.  [Note: This was only intended as a comment about my prediction of how hard it would be, not about my skill level.]</p>
  
  <p>Adviser: [Smiling] Well, some people just have a natural gift for this sort of thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In both of these examples, I responded by laughing awkwardly, perhaps muttering ""thanks"", and looking around the room until the conversation rebooted.  I feel that that was somewhat rude, as though I rejected their compliments.  However, the only alternatives I see are:</p>

<p>(a) Accept the compliment as I would any other, with a phrase like ""thanks, I try"".  This feels clumsy to me, because all the other person technically said was a neutral comment (""some people do this, some people do that"") and I would be treating it like a comment about me in particular.</p>

<p>(b) Verbally acknowledge that ""You have complimented me"", and then move on to a normal reply to the compliment.  This feels wrong as well, because stating ""you have complimented me"" (or worse, repeating a part of the compliment) would, I think, come off as bragging.</p>

<p>Should I have somehow acknowledged that the thing they said was intended as a compliment at me?  If so, how?  <strong>What is the gracious way to accept compliments like these?</strong></p>

I asked her what was wrong and learned that between her finals and her car breaking down, she has too much on her plate. I proposed to check her car and she accepted after she talked about it to another colleague.</p>

<p>As far as I was concerned, I would drive her back to her house, check her car, and go back to my place. She had been clear that we should only be colleagues and I was moving on myself.</p>

<p>While I was checking on the car, she was handing me tools, listened to what I was explaining her about her car, went to get tissue and water for me and told me I could use her room to wash my hands afterward. </p>

<p>I made some repairs on the plugs, and the car started as usual. She thanked me, I told her she should have it run a bit and drive around to be sure it wasn't a fluke. </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I didn't word this in such a way that she would feel pressured to take me with her but she did, and we went and drove around for 2 hours, talking, laughing. After that, we ate some fast-food while watching a bit of film at her place, and then I excused myself and went home. <strong>All in all, she seemed a lot more friendly during this evening.</strong> </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The evening went like we were good friends again, like before I admitted my crush to her.</strong> We again talked about the more personal topics that we used to talk about before I told her of my crush on her, stuff you don't usually talk about with new friends or coworkers. </p>

<p>Since then, we exchanged small-talk over texting for 3-4 days, which didn't occur since I admitted my crush on her to her, but she has been acting colder starting yesterday and seems to be reverting back from being friendly to being a cold and distant coworker. </p>

<p><strong>I do not know what to think of the situation and the dynamic between us, anymore.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p>I want to know where she and I stand, and plan on asking her directly after work this weekend, as I'm leaving on vacation afterward.
I know I can be a bit blunt and would like to have advice on the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting her to answer truthfully without pressuring her</li>
<li>Having a clear-cut answer on our relationship: Are we strictly coworkers, or also still (a bit) friends?</li>
<li>Telling her that I refuse to be used as a friend when she needs me, only to be treated cold and distant as a coworker again afterward.</li>
<li>Figuring out why she was so different when I repaired her car vs. before that and now. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, given the above, <strong>how do I approach a conversation with her about her behavior towards me, that will get me a truthful answer about whether I was used/just a coworker or not used/a friend?</strong> </p>

"How to ask someone to not leave their pee on the floor when they use my bathroom?","<p>I have a male nurse who comes to my house every so often to give me medication and observe me all day for any reactions. When he is here, he leaves pee puddles on the floor in front of the toilet (this is obviously urine - it is yellow). Due to my medical condition, it isn't easy for me to clean it up.</p>

<p>I would like to talk to him about this and let him know that I'd like for him to clean up after himself. However, I'm unsure how to tactfully ask him to do this and would like advice on what to say to him. </p>

<p>I do really like my nurse other than this problem of his. Requesting a different nurse is not really an option I want to consider. Having a nurse come into your home and stay with you the entire day is pretty awkward and I have been most comfortable with him, so far. He is also very skilled (the best nurse I've had) when it comes to administering my very complicated medication and I'd hate to lose him.</p>

<p>Edit: So, what I ended up saying was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, [person]? Sometimes when you pee, there's a little bit left on the floor in front of the toilet. Could you wipe it up next time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I should have told him it was hard for me to clean up, but I neglected to add that part because I was so nervous. He did not really seem surprised by my request, but was apologetic and said he would wipe it up in the future.</p>

"How could I convince women that I'm not trying to flirt with them but that I just want them to join a friendship group?","<p>I like forming friendship groups with people from the internet, in friendship web pages or similar, and I like them to be mixed with a similar percentage of women and men.</p>

<p>But there's a problem with this, making a woman to join the group is waaaay harder than making a man to join, easily I've to send 7 times more messages to women so the same number of men join.</p>

<p>This gets tiring some times, apart from wasting my time, specially if I try to build the group with a certain characteristic shared by all members it can become a titanic effort; they are free not to answer me if they aren't interested in a friendship group, as some men do, but I'm pretty sure that most that don't answer me is because they think my proposition for the group is just so I can flirt with them.</p>

<p>The latter is proved further sometimes when they start asking more questions to ensure that the group exists and in some cases where they looked somewhat interested when I've asked their phone number to join a whatsapp group so it's easier to maintain contact they suddenly stop talking to me.</p>

<p>Right now I send the messages in a neutral tone just talking about wanting to make the friendship group which their objectives would be and if they are interested in joining it.</p>

<p>I think this situation cannot be helped, but maybe I'm missing something that could make them less suspicious or even if they are that they would think ""even if I give him my phone, I could easily block him if he upsets me, so there's no point in saying no if I'm interested in trying a friendship group, for God's sake"".</p>

<p><strong>How could I better invite these women so that they understand what the invitation is (and isn't) and that encourages them to feel more at ease in joining?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><em>Edit: I'm explaining things better due to Ash request.</em></p>

<p><em>I mean a group to be friends, in which we get to go to places, or share a similar hobby or something like this.
Yes, making friends, specially making them in a way where our friendship is likely to be more possible, as I look if we have similar hobbies or the like.
I'm messaging strangers, with friendship web pages I thought it was clear.</em></p>

<p><em>Edit: I'm explaining some other things due to Imus answer.</em></p>

<p><em>I wouldn't call myself a random stranger, I ask women who are in friendship pages where they clearly state that the wish to have a friendship group, I'm offering them an opportunity to do so. If they aren't willing to trust even giving a phone number, how are they going to make friends if they distrust that much? Why they even bother registering on the page?</em></p>

<p><em>Also when they are finally on the group the first places I propose to go are always ones in the most crowded areas of the city, so they have no point of being suspicious.</em></p>

<p><em>I like more a mixed ambient in a friendship group, and as I'm the one who's building it, it's fair to do it the most of my liking as possible.</em></p>

"How do you politely stand your ground against authority who repeatedly press a question that you declined to answer?","<p>This questioner is positioned with authority and power in a professional context. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>An elderly relative's mental illnesses cause stuttering and awkward behavior that probably explains her often being selected for further interrogation and luggage searches, where she often encounters reviling customs agents (in Canada and UK) who interrogate her on too personal questions, e.g.:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why are you taking  medicine? Why are you refusing to tell me your specific illnesses?  Why are you being so uncooperative? </p>
  
  <p>Tell me the names, addresses, and employment information of all your doctors, family and friends. You're being evasive, and I don't believe that your illnesses are causing your behavior. If you still don't answer, I'll flag them and get them questioned too. Then you won't only have a problem with me, but with them too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After they ask the first time, she will politely decline with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sorry, but I don't wish to answer these personal questions. I am exercising my right to silence. I will no longer answer questions on the same topic. </p>
  
  <p>My medicines are clearly and correctly labelled by a pharmacy and with my doctor's names. I have nothing further to add to what I said. The same question was already asked and answered.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>But these answers are ineffective and sound too brusque, offensive. So what else tactful should she say? </p>

<h3>Optional Supplement</h3>

<p>The agents only repeat the question, while intensifying their threats, aggressive harsh tone, and their angry ferocious appearance and face: all which causes her to break down and cry, before she calls one of us or they finally allow her entry. Such interrogations' effects are grievous: her illnesses are then worsened, last much longer and in some cases remain for days. </p>

<p>The customs agents ignore her requests, or invent excuses, for her requests for a supervisor. They'll allege that no supervisor is free, or ridicule her request by asking why they should fulfill her requests if she's not answering them. </p>

"How can I effectively tell people that their defensiveness over me bringing up an issue is part of the issue?","<p>Seems like it would be kind of self evident, but it's something that I encounter fairly often when talking to some folks about issues of discrimination and bias that drives me crazy... </p>

<p>When someone from a minority group says ""that's racist/sexist/homophobic/etc"" and the retort from someone from a majority group is, more or less, ""no it isn't"" </p>

<p>Or when someone from a minority group complains about systemic discrimination problems, and someone who isn't affected by those discrimination problems feels the need to tell them that there's no problem.</p>

<p>It seems amazingly tone deaf. </p>

<p>And it kind of implies that the person who is being discriminated against, or feeling the hard end of the bias, isn't qualified to speak on their own behalf. Almost as if the person in the majority, who isn't being negatively impacted by the problem knows better, and is more qualified to say who is being negatively impacted, and by what.</p>

<p>So, not only does the person who's getting the short end of the stick have to fight for equality, they also end up having to prove their case to a seemingly endless sea of people, who have not experienced the problem, don't see it, and often don't want to see it.</p>

<p>To use pop-terms...  It's like a man having the nerve to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining"" rel=""noreferrer"">mansplain</a> feminism to women. Or a white American <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=White-%27splaining"" rel=""noreferrer"">whitesplaining</a> away about how America is now post-racial to an African American. Or a straight person hetsplaining¹ what is and isn't homophobic to ... well... me.</p>

<p>It seems like it would be really obviously rude to do these things, yet people do them.</p>

<p><strong>I guess I'm wondering if there's a more polite and effective way to point it out. Or if there's a better way to get the person doing it to realize that they're doing it?</strong></p>

<p>Often my response is some version of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, you know that thing you're saying isn't a problem?   </p>
  
  <p>You're doing it right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that seems to entrench the problem more often than not. It seems that the only thing you can do to the privileged to make them feel a tiny fraction of the sting that those with less privilege feel when these things happen, is to point it out...</p>

<hr>

<p>In usual fashion, people won't accept that a thing happens without one specific example, so here goes...</p>

<p>Not long ago I walked in on a conversation between two colleagues, not friends, or people that I work with, just people that I tangentially know. They were discussing how the LGBT rights movement had already accomplished its goals and was superfluous at this point.</p>

<p>I pointed out that they probably think that because they're not directly affected by the discrimination that the LGBT community still faces. Basically they don't see it because they're not in the position to see it.</p>

<p>They responded with a round about how people are too sensitive these days, and that the ""discrimination"" is largely imagined.</p>

<p>I responded by telling them that that's a bit homophobic. And went on to tell them about things like <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Gay Panic Defense</a>, that <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy"" rel=""noreferrer"">conversion therapy</a> was still legal in many/most parts of our country that there's no legal discrimination protection for LGBT folks where I live.</p>

<p>This in turn led them to double down without even addressing any of the very real problems faced by LGBT folks.</p>

<p><sub>¹ Annoyingly the only definitions for that one appear to be on some pretty awful websites... Hey looky there, another example... Great...</sub></p>

"How to influence a friend to stop escalating conflicts?","<p>A lot of interpersonal/communication advice out there centers on helping to de-escalate conflicts when you're <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/12485/methods-of-resolving-highly-emotional-conflicts"">personally involved in them</a> or <a href=""http://www.samnabilcounseling.com/single-post/2015/11/20/3-ways-to-deescalate-conflict-between-couples-and-friends"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can take a mediating role</a>.

<p>When someone's already feeling wronged, I think outright telling them that you think they contributed to the conflict could easily backfire. Are there techniques to help open their minds to the idea of trying to resolve interpersonal conflicts mutually instead of fighting back?</p>

<p>Edit to answer the comments:
In this specific case, it's someone who comes to me for venting and advice in general, but hasn't asked for me to weigh in specifically on their style of conflict resolution. Sometimes they do say things like, ""I don't know what to do!"" when describing a current conflict with someone else. Per Tinkeringbell's question, I don't know whether I should provide direct feedback but I would like to help them be more aware of how they are contributing to conflict escalation and what they can do instead. So ""provide direct feedback"" could be an answer to this question. Per baldPrussian's question, the answer is pretty much ""yes"" with the caveat that my expectation is that they would change their behavior if they knew how, and my goal is to help them know how, not to make them change their behavior if that is actually against their will.</p>

"How to ask future roommate to leave room?","<p>Next year I will be living with 3 other people in a 2-person paired dormitory on our university campus. Two I have known since high school, but the third is my current roommate, lets call him Ralph, who I get along well with. </p>

<p>Lastly, I have one more friend from high school who was planning to live with people he knew, but they backed out on him and if things stay the same he will be matched with a random roommate. He now wishes to take the place of Ralph so it would just be my 3 high school friends and I.</p>

<p>While I do believe it is <em>very</em> inconsiderate to ask a future roommate to leave, there are several conditions I believe make this permissible. Firstly, Ralph made friends with others on campus, and he considered living with them until deciding to join us (his would be space is occupied by a random person). This decision was probably tied into his wish to take his academics seriously, somewhat unlike his other friend group. He also does not know 2 his other friends (not mine) he could took with  well, but would likely only share a bathroom with them instead of a sleeping space he would share with the friend he knows. Also, he stated while my high school friends and I were looking for apartments that if we chose one over a dormitory he would simply room with his friends as he didn't want his priority of saving money to influence our decision. He has remarked that while he will live with us, he will spend the majority of his time with his friends in their dorm, which is housed in the same building as ours.</p>

<p>Compounded onto this, my friends from high school, while friends with Ralph, have made clear that they do not want to room with him.</p>

<p>My high school friends now want me to ask Ralph to change his room assignments from us to his other friends. I want to emphasize that it is his choice, and he should not feel pressured. I definitely don't want to state a reason I am asking him to leave is because my friends do not want to room with him and I also do not want to guilt him into leaving because my high school friend has to room with random people.</p>

"How can I politely ask a person why they did something, without coming across as being angry or expecting an apology?","<p>

Recently, I came across a person who keeps doing something I don't like them doing, for various reasons (though those actions are otherwise fine, just something I don't personally like). However, after repeatedly explaining to them why they shouldn't do that in my opinion, and good reasons for not doing that, they keep doing it.</p>

<p>Now, it could be that they have legitimate reasons for doing that thing. If so, I want to know those reasons, so that I can then stop telling them not to do it. Now, I could simply pull them aside, and ask:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did you keep doing [x] even after I told you not to do that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This asks them ""why"" they did it, but often comes across as my being mad at them, and asking them for an apology rather than an explanation. (In fact, when the reverse situation applies to me, I usually respond with an explanation, but that comes across negatively as ""justifying"" my actions - in this case, I want the other person to respond in the manner generally considered ""justifying"".)</p>

<p>One option is to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do you keep doing [x]? Can you tell me the reason?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in most cases when I used that, it didn't help, and in a few, it just added flame to the fire. <em>There isn't even supposed to be a fire</em>, I just want to ask for an explanation in a nice way. What's a good way to do that?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'd like to explain the specific situation that prompted me to ask this. I kept this hidden before because I thought people would be quick to reach for the ""close"" button without bothering to see that the question is on-topic and applicable to real-life situations as well. In fact, I want an answer that does explain in real life, because this has happened with me in real life too in the past quite a few times:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a certain Stack Exchange site (my most active one), there is a user who goes around editing recent posts mostly for spelling and grammar, i.e. minor edits. On most posts, including all answers, open questions, and closed questions that were closed more than five days ago, this isn't a problem, and I appreciate what they do. However, on posts closed within the last five days, this presents a problem, and these constitute a significant proportion of their editing. If a question closed within the last five days gets edited, it goes into a review queue for possible reopening in case it was edited to fix the original problem with the post; as their minor edits do not fix the post so that the original close reason no longer applies, we have to vote against reopening the post (this creates extra work for three users, the required amount to dequeue the post). Additionally, posts are only added to that review queue once per closure by editing, so by making their minor edit, this user is depriving the post author of their chance to have their own question reopened.</p>
  
  <p>Thus far, I've left comments pinging them on the posts they've edited, requesting that they refrain from editing posts closed within the last five days. Despite that, they have neither ceased editing such posts nor responded to a single one of my comments. I'd like to know why they still edit those posts. As I'm a reason-oriented person, giving me a good reason as to why they're doing it is enough for me to understand and stop questioning them.</p>

"Is reflective listening appropriate for text messages? Is there a better alternative?","<p>In my experience, trying to practice reflective listening over SMS or other asynchronous messaging platform doesn't work.</p>

<p>As a sender, if I send a reflection and we weren't deeply embedded in active conversation on both sides, I find that the other person often disengages, maybe texts back a few hours later sounding frustrated.</p>

<p>As a receiver, I get frustrated when someone sends a reflection or reflective question since it comes across as very noticeable/clumsy and I often don't want to talk the thing through with them. Maybe I said all I meant to say (e.g. why I had to cancel plans for this week--I don't need their empathy over that and don't want it when it means having to text replies back to them over and over) or I was going somewhere else and their responses are like roadblocks that stop me from where I was going.</p>

<p>Is reflective listening still applicable to messaging, and I just need to be more skillful? Or are other communication strategies better?</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by the slant of <a href=""https://business.tutsplus.com/articles/17-ways-to-use-active-listening-techniques-in-online-communication--fsw-3671"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> which emphasizes being more explicit about a lot of things--saying how what the other person said made you feel, specifying the response you want, asking the other person about feelings/reactions to what you said. Should these skills replace reflections?</p>

<p>Update: examples -</p>

<p>1) Person A is talking/venting at length about a situation with family that's really causing stress. Giving advice, platitudes, etc. wouldn't be appropriate, but I want them to know I'm listening and there for them. I reply, ""It sounds like this is really stressful for you"". They don't reply.</p>

<p>2) Person B messages me asking how my day went. I reply to the request for info but get frustrated by the follow-up questions since I don't want to talk at all but they keep coming:</p>

<p>B 1:50pm: How are you?</p>

<p>Me 5:17pm: A wide range of emotions. Currently worrying about my friend who's falling into a deeper depression and convinced that he's tried everything and nothing can ever work to make his life better.</p>

<p>B 5:44pm: Could he use some company?</p>

<p>B 5:45pm: Would he welcome it?</p>

<p>Me 5:45pm: He lives in [far-away city], but he's grateful when I call him.</p>

<p>Me 5:46pm: I was thinking of maybe sending him something?</p>

<p>B 5:47pm: You could?</p>

<p>B 7:54pm: What were you thinking of sending?</p>

<p>Me 4 days later: Eventually I realized it is more helpful to just send him more text messages and phone calls :P</p>

<p>This person's questions aren't technically reflections but they are active listening, apparently for the sake of trying to be supportive, but it's a burden for me to answer them, and they seem clumsy enough to annoy me too--like someone trying to relate without actually revealing anything of themself or bringing any interesting ideas to the table.</p>

<p>Also, to the point of reflective listening only being useful in some situations--that makes sense, that's why I'm irritated at Person B for messaging me in this way, but I usually spend several hours a week in text-based conversations that meet this criterion: ""Your friend is ranting to you about a complex situation and needs validation""</p>

<p>Common conversation topics over text or Facebook Messenger for me include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dealing with gender dysphoria</li>
<li>Body-image issues</li>
<li>Loss of friends to suicide</li>
<li>Interacting with abusive parents</li>
<li>Relationship problems</li>
<li>Harassment at work</li>
<li>Someone's LGBT coming out process</li>
<li>Mental health problems</li>
<li>Sex-related shame</li>
<li>Someone asking for counseling on an issue they're responsible for, e.g. a performer in the troupe they run who's been accused of sexual assault</li>
<li>Poverty/financial problems</li>
</ul>

<p>When I'm ""being genuine"" it works, but sometimes I don't have anything to say that's ""genuine"", but I still don't want to say nothing or resort to other communication strategies I know would be ineffective (like saying ""I'm sure it'll turn out okay""). I don't have an example off the top of my head but even when someone keeps engaging when I'm trying to do reflective-listening-style messages, it subjectively introduces discord. In an actual conversation (phone or in-person) I can read tone of voice or face/body language to adjust in real-time to stay more on the same page, but that isn't there in text.</p>

"How to contact a girl whose number I got from somebody else?","<h2>Situation</h2>

<p>Some days ago I went to a concert of the band of a good friend, let's call him Alex. He and his bandmates, invited a lot of friends to support them.
I know Alex pretty well since we've been working together closely for more than two years now and we also regularly spend our free time together. I know his non-work related friends only loosely.
Alex and his friends live in a different town about 30-40km away from where I live and even further away from the place where the concert took place.</p>

<p>During the evening I had a very inspiring and long conversation with a girl, who I didn't know before, let's call her Anna. We talked about a lot of different topics and emerged to a more and more personal level.
I somehow felt a connection between us. As it got later Anna was texted by her parents who were also in the city, that they are nearby and could take her home by car. We said goodbye and she left almost instantly, without exchanging any contact information.</p>

<p>The next day, I asked Alex if he knew her, he agreed and redirected me to one of his bandmates who sent me her phone number.
I wouldn't have asked him if there was a probability of meeting her again somehow, but since she lives so far away it is pretty unlikely that we would meet again.
I know I should have asked Anna personally for her number but since I am a really shy person and because she left so fast I didn't do it (shame on me).</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Now I am unsure about how I should text or call her without being seen as creepy or indecent, because I had to ask someone else for her number.
Should I talk about the fact that I didn't get the number from her and about who gave it to me? What would be the best way to open a conversation?</p>

<p>My goal is to avoid an awkward situation.</p>

<p>I was thinking of writing something like this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hi, here's Fimbulvetr, I really enjoyed our conversation at the
  concert. I would really like to repeat that. I really
  forgot to ask about your number so Alex bandmate XXX gave it to me, I
  hope that's ok for you.""</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am a guy in my early twenties, she is one year younger than me</li>
<li>This question is set in Germany if it matters</li>
<li>The distances mentioned are not a problem but obviously too long to meet her again randomly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I just wanted to give you a brief update on my situation. I know this question is almost two months old but nevertheless I think you deserve to know what happened :)</p>

<p>I am also from India and I really like receiving oral sex. But I have not done it with my girlfriend, since in our culture most girls believe that these types of things should be done only after marriage. We will marry in a few months.</p>

<p>After reading the above discussion, I fear that my girlfriend will not like to give oral sex to me. Because I really like it, her unwillingness to perform it might be an issue.</p>

<p>So, before our marriage, how do I ask her whether she likes it or not? Even though I have experience with oral sex, I am pretty sure that she does not. So I don't know how to explain it to her and how she can give me a good answer without knowing exactly what it is.</p>

<p>And I fear that if I asked it, she would think that I was going to marry her just because of sex and she may think that I have abnormal likes (If she doesn't know there is a thing called oral sex)? </p>

<p>So how do I ask my fiancée if she would like to have oral sex?</p>

"Friend constantly saying inappropriate things","<p>I have a friend from college who I think may have mild autism. He is extremely intelligent knowing all manner of world affairs, trivia, etc. and generally witty and fun to be around. However, he says things that are wildly inappropriate at times that are often denigrating to me and really upsetting. For example, sometimes he might make a joke about the holocaust that is incredibly rude in polite society but is hilarious in context. When he takes it too far however it is enraging. He can say things like ""Oh [me] said it was OK later if we take [my girlfriend, not present] out back and roll train (gangbang) her."" He does not seem to say this about other people and genuinely believes he does nothing wrong when saying them. When confronted about his actions he says things like ""I didn't say that!"" or ""What did I do?"" Or things of that nature.</p>

<p>The line between appropriate and inappropriate behavior is hard to draw sometimes because of the sense of humor that our group of friends has but clearly there are circumstances that are upsetting to me and I've made it clear about it before. We're both men in our late 20's.</p>

<p>How can I confront my friend about his inappropriate jokes without being immidiately dismissed?</p>

"How to deal with a super perfectionist classmate?","<p>I am 17 years old.</p>

<p>There is a girl in my class, let's call her Anne, who is very stubborn. For her to be happy, everything has to be perfect. I have no problem with it, as long as it doesn't affect me.</p>

<p>Here are two examples of what she does regularly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>She ""forbids"" us to close the roller blind, because it would be too dark for her then. To be clear, every other student has no problems with the light, she's the only one. Today she told us to stop at the perfect angle, which lasted us 5 minutes, so that the right amount of light comes through the window. This is most annoying if the sun is shining directly into my eyes or my laptop.</p></li>
<li><p>She is sitting in the first row and a friend of mine also sits in the first row. Today two girls, who normally sit in the first row were sick so I asked my friend if I could sit next to her. Between me and Anne there is one empty seat. I decided to sit exactly beween those two seats, so everyone has enough space. What does Anne do? She complains that I should move, so she has more space. By sitting between those two seats, she had half a seat more space than normally, but still she was complaining. Finally I moved back.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I tried to talk to her about these things, but she doesn't seem to understand how annoying and time-consuming it is for us others to make everything as she likes. She also is a very grumpy person, although she can be very friendly and nice sometimes.<br> 
Also she is very good at school, perfect in many subjects. Her personality is very perfectionist, she always does as the teacher says, but without any creativity and completely unresourceful.</p>

<p>Since there might be a chance, that she and I will go to the same university in a few years, I want to be friendly with her.</p>

<p>How can I talk to her, so that she stops being so freakingly perfectionist but without annoying her, too? How can I talk to her, so we can talk more to each other? If possible, I want to be friends with her <strong>and</strong> talk to her about her perfectionism, that annoys me (and many other classmates).</p>

"How do I socialise with a guy in the gym and in my hostel that I want to become friends with?","<p>I am a 20 year old male living in India. Most probably, I am bi, but I am not out yet. My problem is a mixture of shyness, attraction, and confusion.</p>

<p>So I live in a college in a hostel (hall) of 400 people and a common mess. New people come in for summer internships every year and this time in my hostel too. I started going to the gym two weeks ago with the sole motive to make myself feel good about myself and look better. I live very isolated and would not start any conversation just for the sake of talking.</p>

<p>I saw this 23ish and 6'2"" guy who also has a very nice moustache and at least one year of going to the gym. He used to do a full body workout of maybe three-day splits. So almost every day some of our machines were close to each other's. I shifted my time to a bit early so that I could find the gym empty and wouldn't have to talk to anyone while working out. I noticed that he did the same too. I am not implying that he did so due to me. I see him in my mess too. Some other eye contacts too around the campus. The same happened in the canteen too while we both were buying ice cream. If it matters, I went to the box first.</p>

<p>In a week, we both had acknowledged the fact that we live in the same hall, gym in the same time slot, are serious about it and live alone and quiet mostly. I at least have some people to talk to. But given he is new, he might not. Then suddenly I didn't see him for three days and figured out that he has changed his timings.</p>

<p>Sometimes I would run my eyes across the area he usually sits for eating and find him looking at me. It is not like that stranger eye contact that we make every day with so many people and ignore later. But recurring one which shows that okay we know each other, but there's no talking between us. </p>

<p>I am in no way interested in him sexually. </p>

<p>After this buildup, I have so many questions and confusions: Am I going to talk to this guy? Yes! <strong>But how?</strong></p>

<p>There are several ways I have imagined the ice breaker! For instance: simply saying hi, waving, or asking about his gym routine. Since he is the senior, I don't expect him to do it. I've also considered sitting in front of him or inviting him to sit with me in the mess, but I have already messed up such a moment with another guy, who also comes to the same gym, is in the same batch as me, and lives in my hall. He was there to talk but I just kept my eyes in the phone.</p>

<p>I have read on Reddit, posts which start (or end) with gym, approaching and hitting on people or people getting annoyed due to being hit on. I am trying to make this very clean and less creepy. But I cannot stop thinking about the possibility of him leaving the campus after summers and me never meeting him again. </p>

<p>I believe we can be good friends and given the very few I feel good with, I don't want to lose any. My goal is to become friends with this man, not anything more.</p>

<p><strong>How can I start talking to him, with the goal of becoming friends, after these previous interactions?</strong></p>

<p>Edit: What I have thought of doing was there in original question but was edited out for legibility. Adding to those remarks, these questions were dug-up for build-up.  </p>

<li><p>They are of opposite genders and it is for office culture. I cannot invite this guy out for lunch or coffee or, show up asking doubts. Although I had written about some ideas about having the lunch together in original question.</p></li>
<li><p>They regularly meet and <em>have</em> to talk. And also I have no big event coming soon. </p></li>
<li><p>3-5 times a month. In my case it is 3-5 times a week. Any bitterness can be ignored in a public space in that case but not in mine. </p></li>

<p><strong>I need an answer or guidance that considers this context and helps me <em>start</em> talking to this guy without creating awkwardness later by coming out as creep.</strong></p>

"My sister has an alcohol and drug addiction. How can I get people to stop asking me about her?","<p>I have a younger sibling, let’s call her Sarah. Who has a severe alcohol and drug addiction problem. I’m talking 9 separate rehabs, 10 in hospital detox’s and 4 different events in which she was almost dead and luckily saved by people smart enough to call for an ambulance at the right time.</p>

<p>We grew up in a small town where everyone knows each others business and my parents are very well known in the community. It doesn’t help that my parents are extremely wealthy and own businesses that draw attention to that fact. </p>

<p>Because I’m married, financially independent and live outside of their area I don’t usually get inundated with the ridiculous gossip that goes on in their town. I also have been able to avoid being constantly questioned by people regarding gossip about my family and their personal struggles, because I kept away from the area for the most part for several years. </p>

<p>However, in the last 2 years my sister has been overcome and destroyed by her addiction. She has decided she only wants to deal with me instead of the rest of the family. </p>

<p>Recently she had a dangerous situation occur that landed her in the ICU, on a ventilator, feeding tube, restraints, deep sedation and a personal nurse. She almost died, and due to the fact that the hospital told my family she will not be able to live through another detox and/or survive another bender, my family has started telling people about her situation. At the moment, we don't know where my sister is.</p>

<p>Now I’m being  inundated with phone calls and texts from people outside of our family. I feel hounded and harassed yet the messages I’m receiving are asking about her welfare and updates and such and seem caring. The problem is that I cannot discuss and explain my sisters situation with these people as it’s too complex and overwhelming to try to do at this point (we don’t know where she is.) </p>

<p>I also don’t want to spend my entire day responding to people’s questions about her because it saddens me and I need to have a life separate from this. </p>

<p>What can I say to people who keep asking me about this? How can I politely let them know this is a personal issue and is painful to discuss without being rude or sounding unappreciative about their concerns? </p>

"Working to resolve a safety issue after having been lied to by the person responsible","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>A couple sinkholes have appeared in a drainage area behind my house, which is surrounded by other houses in our neighborhood.  The area is normally flat, dry, and grassy, so I used to play there with my young kids before these sinkholes appeared.  I'm convinced that one is potentially deadly - it is about 2 feet wide and 11 feet deep.  Apparently these are not uncommon and are colloquially called a ""chimney sinkhole"".  It is certainly wide enough for children/small pets/maybe even me to fall into, and it could cause serious injury or death if that happened.  Moreover, because it is so narrow and in a grassy area, it is nearly invisible.</p>

<p>The property management company that manages financial/legal matters for our HOA is legally responsible for fixing these.  I've contacted the president of the property management company in an attempt to get him moving on it.  The person in question was initially very responsive, I gave him as much info as I could, and he told me it would get taken care of.  During later followup he initially said that he had contacted the county and they responded and opened a work order.  When I later offered to followup with the county for him, he changed his story and said that an engineer from the neighborhood was working with him on it.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>

<p>I called the county to find out if he was just making stuff up to blow me off.  He was.  They insisted that they are not responsible and would not handle something like this for my HOA.  I didn't find out whether or not he had actually attempted to contact the county (presumably he didn't), but either way his initial statements were definitely a lie.  I also discovered that the water management district in our area takes sinkholes very seriously (because they create an easy way for pollution to get into the local water tables), and will bring pressure on the property management company to make sure that the situation is properly dealt with (presumably including real-world legal repercussions).  Naturally I am following this up with phone calls to the water management district, and theoretically they will make sure this all gets fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Next steps?</strong></p>

<p>While the water management district may be able to resolve this themselves, I intend to follow up with him (via email).  My goal of this followup will be to see if in the short term this sink hole can be marked, and also to get him to start actively moving towards fixing this situation (instead of waiting for the government to start pressuring him).  I would also like to yell at him for lying to me, but I suspect that doing so would only hurt my first two goals.  I'm not sure what actions on my part are most appropriate and would most likely spur this person to action: ""informing"" him of the potential for upcoming legal pressure, calling him out for lying, or just generally trying to impress upon him the seriousness of the situation (because the sinkhole could literally kill someone).</p>

<p><strong>How do I convince this person to take immediate action on something that he is legally obligated to take action on, but which he has apparently been lying to me about so that he can avoid taking action?</strong></p>

"How to get roommate to be respectful, when communication has no effect?","<p>I'm a college student living in a small city in the US. I am currently sharing an apartment with two other women (Jane and Mary), both in their early 20s. We each have our own bedroom but share a kitchen and living room.
We didn't know each other prior to living together but have become friendly. We are pretty good at communicating with one another and speak to each other daily. However, Jane and I have been having problems with Mary for the past few months. There is no way we can move out or force her to move out; we must stay on the lease for the rest of the year. <p>Mary is loud and disrespectful (but not mean or aggressive). She frequently does things that either inconvenience Jane and I or put our health and safety at risk. Usually, she gives the justification that she was running late somewhere, drunk, or just scatterbrained when confronted. <p></p>

<p>For context, some of the things Mary has done that upset us include smoking in the apartment, forgetting to lock the front door, having guys over (this past week, 5 nights) and making noise until 2-3am, and leaving dishes in the sink for several days. Most recently, she left on a trip without telling us, leaving me to care for her cat. She often has people over with no notice, takes up the entire shared living area, and plays music or talks loudly.</p>

<p>Jane and I have tried several methods to improve Mary's behavior as a roommate (using advice from other, similar, roommate-conflict questions on IPS like: <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/12507/24494"">this one</a> and <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/1108/24494"">this one</a>,). We've tried to model good behavior. We have made a few rules, such as no smoking and no loud noise past midnight on weekdays, that everyone has agreed to. We talk to Mary within a day or two of individual issues occurring. I try to be empathetic; I know life can be hard for young adults and I often offer to help Mary with cleaning. </p>

<p>An example of what a confrontation usually looks like is (borrowed from <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/18624/24494"">this answer</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey, Mary. I'm pretty tired for my classes today; I got woken up late last night by voices. Could you try to keep it down? Maybe we could have quiet hours after midnight on weekdays, because it's hard for me to do my coursework when I can't sleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mary always agrees to change her behavior, but it's been getting worse. A few days ago, we had a meeting, where we discussed Mary's noise causing chronic sleep deprivation for Jane. Mary was dismissive. Tonight, it's back to the same behavior. I have escalated my language, for instance the door was left unlocked for the third time in two days and I told Mary that it was unacceptable that she was putting our safety at risk. She again brushed it off and has gone right back to leaving the door unlocked. </p>

<p>My question is, <strong>how can I get my roommate to understand that her actions are disrespectful and consequently act more respectfully</strong> when I have already tried speaking with her and setting boundaries? My goal is for my respectful behavior to be reciprocated; I'd like to remain friendly with Mary but it is not a requirement. </p>

"My mother does not approve of my boyfriend and she is not getting past it","<p>My mother does not approve of my boyfriend.</p>

<p><strong>Emotional Context</strong></p>

<p>To provide context - my boyfriend worked with my Mother. She was the executive of the company. I referred my current boyfriend(back then he was my friend) to the company. They hired him. After he started working there we started dating each other. For various reasons, he was not able to perform well on the job. This was in the first 6 months of the job. 
And stupid me back then kept telling him that if he is not going to perform in his job then I would leave him.
Lot of drama and stress happened for 1.5 years. We broke up twice.</p>

<p>He quit the company after 1.5 years and we broke up too. 
After 6 months, it was very hard for me to reconcile why I broke up with him. We have been steadily going strong.</p>

<p><strong>Personality Context</strong></p>

<p>My Mother is dominating determined woman. She keeps telling me that he is not the right person for me. He is not ambitious, he is not driven etc.</p>

<p>My boyfriend is more of the zen kinds. He does not believe in burning himself out on the job. He has worked for great companies. He is extremely smart and has got great grades throughout his childhood. The company he worked for above was his only down period.</p>

<p>My Father has been unwell for almost 18 years now and for most of my adolescent and adult life my mom has been very close to me. She has been my biggest support and I share everything with her. I am the only kid and I have no siblings.
My mother in some ways is materialistic. She believes in the ""brand"" of things. Like which school did he graduate, where is he working, is he the director of xyz ... And my boyfriend is not that. He has done extremely well, but he is not the director and neither does he aspire to.</p>

<p><strong>Current context</strong>
Recently my boyfriend was visiting me and I had to tell my Mother(because she suddenly planned a trip to visit me). 
So, when I told her my boyfriend is visiting me for few weeks she completely flipped out. She started saying that I don't like him, I don't approve him etc. We spoke only for ten minutes but it was emotionally very exhausting. </p>

<p>I have been working with my Mother from the past 2 years on this. I have been trying to tell her that its my decision and my life. I will decide whom I date, when I want to get married and whom I want to get married to.
She seems stuck and does not get past it.</p>

<p>What is the best way to handle a deadlock situation like this?
I do not think she will change her mind about him. I have come to terms with that now. I think she keeps saying all those things(where she puts pressure) with me, because she feels that I will break up with my boyfriend - That is not going to happen!! I am committed to him and I don't think her disapproval is a reason for me to break up. I have tried in the past and it does not stick.</p>

<p>I want to add why I like my boyfriend.
He is a great partner. I am inspired by him. I learn a lot from him.
He is lovable, caring and honest. He is the person I want to be with. 
I have known him for the past 8 years and we have been together on-off for the past 5 years - with past 2 years being more stable. 
I have no reason to walk away from him.</p>

<p>My question:</p>

<p>As previously iterated how does one handle a situation of this kind? I feel extremely frustrated and helpless.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. I understand that this is a common situation when parents don't approve of their children's partners but being the only child and my father being unwell puts a lot of emotional stress on me to be a good child. My Mother has done a lot for me and I feel have a lot of gratitude in my heart. She is the best Mother I can ever ask for. She has brought me up to be a strong, independent woman. And now I feel she is taking all this power away from me. She is not trusting me. I understand she comes from a place of concern but if there is one decision I want to make for my life - it would be this. </p>

<p>Thank you for your time and patience!</p>

"How to communicate with neighbour with banging door without making her uncomfortable","<p>I live in Australia in a block of flats. We are the middle flat of three. Each flat has a front and back balcony. Due to the nature of the flats the back doors will bang in the wind if not secured - this will be a constant loud bang, every 5-10 seconds which is loud enough to penetrate ear plugs due to its short sharp nature. </p>

<p>Not too soon after our upstair neighbour moved in she left her back balcony door open when she went for an early morning walk. It banged and woke us up at 6:30 am which was very frustrating. We left her a friendly note and also some supplies to attach it (normal string will break in a few days due to the stress from the wind). In the preceding days the door was secured so it didn't bang. She decided not to use our method. (although I find it difficult for notes not to be passive aggressive we attempted to write it in a light friendly manner trying to be helpful and not judgemental). </p>

<p>Wind forward 3 months and into a heat wave. She left her door open over night to encourage a slight breeze but unfortunately it came loose at 2:30 in the morning. This woke my wife up and then woke me up about 30 minutes later. </p>

<p>Here is the conundrum, what do you do at 3am when a door is banging, how do you contact the person in that house? I decided that knocking on her actual door was not ideal (as the entry way is dark and I am tall) I didn't want to scare our single female neighbour. Instead I went out the front of our property and rang the intercom bell. I rang a few short sharp rings until she answered and asked her to secure her door. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello, sorry to bother you but your door has been banging in the wind
  for about an hour, do you think you can secure it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note - I am English so find it hard to be rude even when tired and grumpy. </p>

<p>We slept badly that night but both understood it was a complete freak of nature that shouldn't happen again. </p>

<p>The morning after next we received a letter on our door from her. The basic gist of it was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sorry for waking you up in the middle of the night BUT</li>
<li>It was a complete accident AND</li>
<li>You make noise during the day too which I don't complain about</li>
</ul>

<p>(the tone felt quite aggressive as if the door banging was our fault - also noting legal sections and paragraphs felt completely unnecessary)</p>

<p>Finally she said something along the lines of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't feel comfortable with you ringing my door bell in the middle
  of the night. It makes me feel uncomfortable in my house and you
  should never do this again in future. Please refer to (section XX,
  paragraph YY) the noise regulations about noise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the part I am asking my question about: </p>

<p><strong>IF this happens again and I want to respect my neighbours wishes how can I communicate with her to close the door?</strong></p>

<p>I can only think of a few ways to get in contact with her:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Phone:</strong> She hasn't given us her number (we have given her ours and tried to arrange chats) and this might be off or on silent over night</li>
<li><strong>Front buzzer:</strong> She has specifically said she is made to feel uncomfortable by this</li>
<li><strong>Do nothing:</strong> And get no sleep while getting angrier and angrier</li>
<li><strong>Call the police:</strong> This feels like making a mountain over a molehill. As it feels like too small a thing to bother them with. This coupled with the fact that they will just ring her front buzzer anyway which I could do without calling the police. It also feels like an unnecessary escalation for something which should be resolvable anyway. </li>
</ol>

<p>It is worth noting a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have repeatedly tried to chat with her about it, we have given her our numbers, asked her to meet up and even arranged times. She has never messaged us (as agreed) and has always been out at times when we arranged.</li>
<li>We have given her our phone number and suggested we exchange phone numbers to deal with the noise but have not received any message from her (except paper notes on the door)</li>
<li>She is around our age (early 30s) so there is not a large age or maturity gap</li>
</ul>

<p>This question isn't about what we should do with regards to her per se (we need to find a time to chat everything through) but is more about how to communicate that we want to respect her boundaries but also want to get a good nights sleep. I don't want to say ""well if we can't contact you we'll call the police next time"" but honestly I don't know what we would do (probably ring on the buzzer if it happened tonight). I also don't know whether calling the police is blowing it out of all proportion or whether ringing the buzzer is for that matter. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that we are not keen on launching formal complaints. I feel that a good relationship with your neighbours is important and unless they are being very inconsiderate then it is better to deal with them directly instead of calling body corporate or the estate agent. </p>

"I am very close to breaking up with my girlfriend for selfish reasons; how do I talk to her about our relationship?","<p>I started dating this girl just over a year ago. We first met 7 years ago at college; we were only acquaintances back then. Fast forward a few years, we recognized each other at a work party and discovered we both work for the same bank.</p>

<p>We hit it off right away, and she had no problem expressing she was interested in me. I found her fascinating too. She's clever and witty, makes me laugh, and she showers me with a ton of affection, constantly. When she asked me out, I took a while to respond because I had to be sure. After my first (and only, at that point) relationship, I was single for 4 years, and I was very happy by myself and a relationship wasn't something I was looking for, as I was focusing at getting to a better place professionally. </p>

<p>I couldn't ignore her, however, and decided to give the whole dating thing a try. Just before our first date, she told me she was a high functioning autistic, she has aspergers, and has trouble dealing with social situations. Furthermore, because of her very violent and abusive ex (from whom she had to get police protection and relocation), she suffers from anxiety attacks, depression, and PTSD. Poor thing has scars all over. Still, I was determined to give it a go and knew it was going to be hard work, but I thought I could be a good support for her help her heal.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, I noticed that I would have no space for myself. She moved in, 2 months later, with me, without asking me; one day she came, and never left. Slowly all her stuff were moved and when I tried to talk to her, she would get hurt and assume I wasn't serious. </p>

<p>Over the year, I've begun to see the ""real her"", and the ""real her"" is a very sweet girl who doesn't want to hurt anyone and just wants to make some friends.</p>

<p>Due to her Aspergers, or anxiety, or past (or all of them), she can't seem to make any friends at all. I am quite a social introvert myself - I have plenty of hobbies and plenty of groups of friends due to those hobbies, and I spend time with the groups, in my own terms. I definitely hang out once a week at the least, plus most weekends. Obviously, I took my girlfriend to each of the groups, and initially she seems ok, but she has this strange thing of deciding that she doesn't like someone. Once she does that, she does everything to avoid that person. I have tried talking to her about it, and she just says they remind her of her abusive ex and withdraws into herself, and says she doesn't want to talk about it. Any further attempts seems to send her down the depression spiral so I let it go.</p>

<p>For example, I surf a lot. One of my surf buddies is a girl around my age. She's not single, but she's in a long distance relationship. I have 7-8 people I can call friends that I regularly surf with. This girl and I are very close friends, we've known each other for 4+ years, we get along well, we went Pokemon hunting when GO was a thing, and we went to watch animated movies when there was one. All of that was with the group. We never did anything together alone. When I introduced my girlfriend to the surfing group, she said she wasn't comfortable with how close my female friend was with me. No amount of trying to explain that there is absolutely no romantic interest between us seemed to satisfy my girlfriend. When I would try to arrange dinners with the rest of the friends, without the female friend, my girlfriend would say she is not comfortable with it, and the rest of them would know the girl is missing and not hang out. I now barely surf, because, even though my girlfriend says I can go surf, she becomes miserable when I go and sulks about it a lot. I'd rather not go surf knowing I am hurting my gf and I can't seem to enjoy the activity anyway.</p>

<p>Repeat that for most of the other groups of friends. One of them had a very small wedding and didn't invite my girlfriend (the wedding was planned before we started dating). Now my girlfriend doesn't want to hang out with them, because she has been excluded and bullied all her life and this friend brings forth those memories. Another group of friends I play Xbox games with, asked her a lot of questions and she doesn't like him. So now I don't invite them over to my place to play games. Yet another group of friends I rollerblade with came across as very aggressive, so now she doesn't want to hang out with them. You get the idea.</p>

<p>I can see why she can't make friends, and she relates one event to another and ends up stressing and having anxiety attacks about events that occured several years ago. You know how we heal from something bad over time? She doesn't seem to heal at all. Any time any of the topic of my friends comes up, she starts crying all over again as though it only just happened. When I ask her to let go, she says, ""what does that mean? I don't know what letting go means and I don't know how to do that, I wish I could make friends and I wish I didn't stress, but I can't help it"". So I don't know how much of this is PTSD and how much is her Aspergers. Or both.</p>

<p>Anyway, this relationship is costing me a lot of friends and I'm having to wear a lot of hats for her. She has no friends, so I have to be there constantly for her as a friend. She has no parents and I have to mentor her, she has no hold on facial expression and social situations so I have to constantly answer her about people's intentions and why something should be done a certain way, and why she doesn't deserve the pain. Among all this, the real, witty, charming girlfriend comes out very very rarely and I am finding it hard to maintain romantic interest in her.</p>

<p>At the same time, I am heartbroken for her and every time I imagine myself in her shoes, I am terrified. I can't imagine having no one to talk to, no one to ask how I am, not knowing people's intentions (She says that a person smiling and person being angry appear the same to her and she can't tell the difference), and I feel terrible and selfish when I think I should end the relationship so I can heal. She honestly believes (thanks to her ex) that she is worthless and has some serious lack of self confidence. Any time I give her a compliment, she questions and doubts and asks for explanation. she constantly asks if I love her, and if I am going to leave her. She says she can't tell if I love her, even though I take care of her and care for her and show her, both by words and actions, that I love her. It makes me sad that she can't tell I love her.</p>

<p>At this point, I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I should stick with her because I like her and try to work towards healing her, or if I should end it here and hope she can recover by herself. I have no doubt she loves me, and I've always heard about how difficult it is to find someone who truly loves you so letting this go seems, at times, foolish.</p>

<p><strong>How can I talk to her about how she should forgive people, starting from herself, and that it's okay to give people second chances and to hang out with others in a group if she doesn't like one?</strong> I get no chance to talk about all this because she withdraws into herself every time I attempt.</p>

"Finding out if my crush is gay","<p>I am a middle aged man living in western Europe. I have a crush on a female colleague who recently joined the company where I am working, but in a different department from me.</p>

<p>Today by random chance I saw some information suggesting that this woman might be gay.</p>

<p>Usually I don't care if my colleagues are gay or not, but obviously given that I have a crush on this woman I do care. And though we work in an environment where being gay is nothing to be ashamed of, it still would feel inappropriate to me (and uncomfortable) to ask her about it.</p>

<p>Is there a good way for me to handle this situation? Is there some way to phrase the question in a not too direct fashion so as not to stir up any trouble?</p>

"How to let people know I don't appreciate being ignored in instant messaging?","<p>When talking with people through instant messenger or texting, I find it rude when someone doesn't reply. The other day I had met up with someone I knew from school. He told me about a business idea he had, and expressed interest in working with me. The next day I messaged him about it and he ignored me (even though I got the read receipt). A day later I messaged ""aren't you going to reply?"" and he basically gave some short answer that I'm pretty sure was intended to be dismissive. </p>

<p>How can I set boundaries to let people know I expect a reply, even if it's something like ""I don't feel like doing this anymore""? Or is this just the reality when it comes to instant messaging etiquette? I know some individuals who do this more than others (i.e., it's a habit) and that is the focus of this question. </p>

<p>I agree sometimes a day is not long enough, and that read receipts may not have had time to reply. However, the question I asked was very straightforward (what is the name of the website?) and this same individual has done things like this before. Perhaps a better example is my friend was going to an event that I was going to as well, and when I asked him what time he would be arriving, he ignored me. Even replying ""not sure"" I would find more polite. </p>

"My girlfriend and her weight","<p>My girlfriend is chubby. I don't mind this. I like chubby girls, I find her very attractive as she is. She wears her weight very well. </p>

<p>She's decided to lose weight. </p>

<p>How can I be supportive of her decision and her progress without making it seem that it's a determination of her attractiveness, or my opinion on her body? </p>

<p>I'm trying to find ways to compliment her by acknowledging the weight loss as well as just her in general. Currently, I've been very separate in these compliments (I'm trying to make sure that when I tell her how good she looks, I'm not tying it to her weight loss. I want her to stop when she feels comfortable or happy, I don't want her to think that I want her to continue for my sake, or that I'll only find her more attractive if she does). </p>

<p>When I tell her about her weight loss, I'm usually saying things about how her clothes look looser or how she's much lighter (she's actually getting smaller but not much lighter, so I've been working out so I can give her the illusion that she's lighter, even if the scales aren't really showing it too much. She's gaining muscle, so her mass is equaling out) </p>

<p>I feel that I may be overthinking this whole thing, but I'm just trying to make sure I walk this carefully. </p>

<p>I just want to make sure the words I give her are the best words I can. I want her to be happy about her weight loss, but not make her feel it's important for our relationship. It's for her. But I also want to make her feel sexy because of all the effort. </p>

<p>In what ways can I improve my approach? </p>

"How do I tell a friend I can't afford her wedding?","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> – How do I tell a childhood friend (who has been spoiled her whole life) that both my parents and I most likely cannot afford to travel for her wedding (to which I am to be a bridesmaid) without making her angry/defensive?.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Anne and I have been close friends since we were children, as our families are close (her mother is my sister's godmother, my dad is basically the father she never had, etc.). Despite our families closeness, we live ~ 900km apart, thus limiting time spent together to a week every summer when they would visit us.
Enter Jack. Anne met Jack four years ago. They got engaged in 2016, the wedding is ‘planned’ for 2019. She asked me to be a bridesmaid shortly after they got engaged last year. They've just recently decided to have a destination wedding.</p>

<p>I moved to their Town 3 years ago for college (using student loans for tuition and rent), and graduated in 2016. After grad I lived with them briefly, for very generously discounted rent.</p>

<p>As Anne’s parents divorced when she was young and her father wasn’t around after that, her grandmother moved in with them and became the second parent to Anne and her sister. Sadly, Grandmother passed away last year, and they are still figuring out how to live without her. Apparently, Grandmother used to spoil them a bit – Anne+sister and Mother. Currently, Anne and Jack are living in Anne’s mother’s basement apartment for discounted rent (they consider the basement apt to be moved out). </p>

<p>Jack was extremely spoiled all his life (to the point where he didn’t know how to pack his own suitcase for a 2-week vacation – he’s 24). Anne has never really lived away from home.</p>

<p>After a few stressful months of living there, I finally found a job in my field just before Christmas (Excitement! :D) and almost immediately moved into a cheap boarding house. </p>

<p>Anne’s mother insinuated that she wanted me to stay at her house (she likes having someone around to chat since her kids have 'moved out'). Her argument was cheaper rent to counter the higher gas bill of driving 30 minutes to work (driving <em>away</em> from Town center and thus <em>against</em> morning traffic). As I have anxiety and had depression issues in the past, I couldn’t handle living there anymore (different lifestyles making my anxierty spiral) - or confrontation. I told her I needed to keep the mileage on my old car as low as possible as to not wear it out faster as my ‘excuse’ for moving.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Anne and Jack have decided that they’re getting married “down south” (a tropical resort somewhere like Cuba – they haven’t gotten more specific than that yet). Anne had asked me to be a bridesmaid before they chose this location.</p>

<p>As I am working an entry level help desk job and have four years of student debt, I doubt highly that this time next year I will have $2000~ to go down south. I only get 5 vacation days next year, and none for this year, therefore I would take unpaid days off. However, the money is the only thing I'm worrying about right now. My employer is really lenient, I'm almost positive we could work something out for time off. I don’t yet have any savings, and am basically still living paycheck to paycheck (have only been working 2 months). As a bridesmaid I would also be paying for my own dress/hair/makeup as well, though I'm not involved in planning the bachelorette party and such.</p>

<p>I’ve talked to my parents about it, and they don’t think they are going to be able to swing it either. From experience, if my parents tell Anne’s mother they can’t make it, she’ll probably get defensive and/or miffed. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How do I tell my friend that both my parents and I probably won’t be able to afford traveling such a distance for her wedding, without her taking it personally and getting angry/defensive?</p>

"How to approach Co-Worker who seems to avoid talking to me?","<p>So, I recently started working and so I'm new to the workplace.</p>

<p>I came in around the same time as the girl who sits opposite me (she has about 3 months on me). That being said, my first two weeks in, I had lunch (in a group of 4-5 people) and talked with her a few times after work on the way to the train station, etc.</p>

<p>After the initial weeks, I started bringing lunch to work and ate in mostly to save money and didn't join them for lunch (they didn't ask either). Now, when I say things at the coffee machine or just random conversation to her, she just nods and quickly leaves, or says nothing at all when we cross paths.</p>

<p>Additional info: during an office half day, I walked with them to grab lunch after work, during the whole walk they didn't really talk to me.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why her behavior changed and I don't have much issue with that. But now I have a project where I have to work with her and even when we discuss about work she will keep it short and prefer to discuss over skype messages than in person (did I mention we sit opposite each other?).</p>

<p>I'm afraid that if I try to initiate conversation too much (even for work) it would make what she already thinks worse (I have no idea what tbh).</p>

<p>Example of a skype conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: [details about the project], hope you're feeling better (she was sick)</p>
  
  <p>Her: OK, I'll do (part 1).</p>
  
  <p>Me: Thanks a bunch I'll focus on (part 2)</p>
  
  <p>Her: Good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is there any way I can approach her without making things worse and finding out what happened?</p>

<h2>Note</h2>

<p>I have no romantic interest in her, I just want to make my work life better.</p>

"How can I greet people when I encounter someone searching for bottles in trash cans?","<p>Often, when I bring out trash, I see homeless people (maybe not all of them are homeless, I'm not sure) searching for plastic bottles and other things in trash cans.

<p>Usually I just pretend they are not there, but if feels very awkward. If I say ""Hello"" or ""Good afternoon"", normally they just look at me and don't reply, so I'm not sure whether they prefer to be noticed.</p>

<p><strong>How can I greet someone I encounter while they're searching in the trash bin? Would it be more polite to not greet at all?</strong></p>

"Different budgets within roommate group","<p>I'm a third-year student/ junior at a US university, and I'm about to move into an apartment with three friends of mine. The main reason I wanted to move was to save money, and I thought this was the primary reason for my friends too.</p>

<p>However, we've been discussing what kind of furniture to get, and two of the other people are more focused on aesthetics than price. The two of us who are watching our wallets keep trying to talk them down, but it's becoming a problem because they keep offering to pay extra.</p>

<p>An example conversation we had about buying kitchenware:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: about two dish sets should do for all of us, right? or should we get three?</p>
  
  <p>A: I really want us to get a good dish set, like this on (links us to a ~80$ dish set)</p>
  
  <p>Me: Oh ok go ahead, I'll get one for myself then</p>
  
  <p>A: No, we shouldn't need more than these.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, I had to message them privately and lie, saying I didn't want to 'ruin' their stuff because I'm clumsy. What I really wanted to say was that I didn't want to share their stuff without paying for it, and I didn't want to pay for something that expensive.</p>

<p>Preferably, I'd like to resolve this without accusatory 'You spend too much for me to match' statements. I know they wouldn't push me to spend money, but they would insist that I can share whatever it is without paying because we're friends.</p>

<p><strong>How can I avoid accepting charity from my roommates while compromising on shared items?</strong></p>

<p>Edit : I've gotten a lot of advice from family, all of which said that disagreements about money can cause resentments in a relationship. I don't want to be 'that freeloading friend who never pays us back', and that's why I want to pay for stuff I use as much as I can</p>

<p>Edit II : We've all been moved in together for about a month now, and what we've done for furniture is ask if someone wants to own it. If no one does, we split the cost. We're still struggling to split grocery bills properly lol, but thank you all for your advice! </p>

"Becoming a better mentor","<p>I'm looking for advice on mentoring others (or perhaps communication in general). </p>

<p>I'm a newly promoted Senior engineer in my company and I'm managing a new hire for my company. It's been 2 months, and it's hasn't been a fun ride. </p>

<p>I've found my relationship with the engineer to be fairly antagonistic. I'm not even sure how to describe this, so here are some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>He's confrontational</strong> - Whenever I give him opposing feedback in his pull requests, he will very often come over and say ""hey, do you want to talk about this?""</li>
<li><strong>He's very resolved</strong> - During discussions, he has shown himself to be principled. However, I've often disagreed with his decisions and it's very difficult to convince him that he's wrong. It's stressing me out since this happens on a daily basis.</li>
<li><strong>He is a bad communicator</strong> - English is his second language, and the conversations I have with him have been difficult... He is stoic with his rationalizations, and it is very challenging to change his mind.</li>
<li><strong>He is ambitious</strong> - I've felt that he's always trying to one-up me. Whenever I speak, he would always try to follow with something.</li>
<li><strong>His way is better</strong> - When we get into a disagreement and come to an impasse, his resolution has always been ""let's just merge it and see how it goes"". I've let this happen a few times.</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand communication is a two way street. All of the above points can easily be a showcase of how bad of a communicator I've been. Here's what I've tried to do so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Enlist a third-party arbitrator</strong> - There was a heated discussion that was going nowhere. I decided to pull in another senior engineer in the company to help give a third opinion.</li>
<li><strong>Appeal to convention</strong> - It seems he doesn't value my feedback a lot, so I've been feeding him some blog post links during disagreements. </li>
</ul>

<p>I'm really stressed out. It's common for our discussions to degrade to arguments, where both sides feel their side is the right side. </p>

<p>What are some techniques I can employ to better the situation?</p>

"How should I behave after I was caught cheating in a test to convey that I'm truly remorseful?","<p>Last month I was caught carrying some cheat sheets during an engineering semester examination, not because I was afraid of failing but because I was afraid of forgetting a few key formulae and definitions. In hindsight, it was <em>really</em> really stupid idea on my part and I certainly believe that I should face the standard punishment. The incident has been reported and I'm almost sure  that all the six examination papers I appeared in the semester will be cancelled; I will have to retake the exams next year again but that isn't the biggest of my worries as I think I will be able to pass them all if I keep revising in upcoming months. </p>

<p>What I'm truly concerned about is that I let down my professors who considered me to be a fairly good student who used to more or less actively participate in the classes, and I expect them to be <em>very</em> disappointed in me. When I ponder on this, I myself feel so ashamed of myself that I've had several severe anxiety attacks and nightmares (almost every day) since that incident occurred; I'm currently on medication for anxiety and depression (not complaining; I totally brought this upon myself and I deserve the consequences). Anyway, it's still summer vacation for us and I will likely be called by the department's disciplinary council for a hearing in the next month, and then soon after the classes for the next semester will begin, most of which will be conducted by the same professors we had previously. I do not think <em>anything</em> I say at this point will improve their impression of me, and really I do not want to sound like a manipulative person. Moreover, I believe actions speak louder than words.  </p>

<p>Nevertheless, what would be a good way to conduct myself during the disciplinary meeting and subsequently in the next semesters' classes so that I can convey to them (over time) that I'm truly remorseful for my actions? (Please note that I'm <em>not</em> asking ""what should I say during the disciplinary meeting so that the consequences are minimized?"" but rather ""how I can regain a normal working relationship with my professors <em>over time</em>?"".) I do not think I have the courage to participate as actively in the classes as before, ask questions, or even look at them but is that something I should <em>attempt</em> at doing to restart a normal student life? I know that my relationship with my professors will likely never be like before again, but at this point, it would be helpful to know if someone went through a similar situation and how they handled it in the long term.</p>

<p><strong>P.S</strong>: If this question would be a better fit on Academia SE or I can improve it in this way to make it better fit the scope of this site then do please let me know.  </p>

<p><strong>Given that I live with her, how can I do this in a way to minimize hard feelings?</strong> Perhaps I can do it when I plan on not having to see her for as long as possible? I do plan on moving but in the mean time this isn't fair that I pay a lot of money and get woken up at night and my work is disrupted. </p>

"Helping my mom accept that I can't be available as much as she wants","<p>My mom moved to the same city as my wife and I about 5 years ago.  It's always been a bit rocky, but there is probably one theme that comes up the most regularly.  To put it simply, her expectations for my involvement in her life are simply not possible for me in my phase of life.  Regarding my ""phase"" of life:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have 5 kids (including 2 that are under 3 years) that keep me very busy.</li>
<li>More immediately, our youngest is 3 months old, and little people certainly make life that much more busy.</li>
<li>To add to things, my wife has been dealing with PPD, so life has
definitely been busy in the past half year or so.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are just the major pointers in recent history, but the overall reality is that my life is very busy literally every day.  Currently we usually text occasionally during the week, and then we usually see her in person 1-3 times a month (she usually comes over during the weekends for half a day).  Regarding her expectations (just a couple examples that come to mind):</p>

<ol>
<li>Sometime a few months she expressed frustration that I don't reach out to her regularly during the week</li>
<li>She often gets hurt if I don't text her back quickly enough (she texted me last night around 7pm to see how I was doing, and when I hadn't responded, texted me again at 8am this morning to ask ""Are you still alive?"").  Normally I text back quickly, but it doesn't always happen.</li>
<li>When she does visit she sometimes makes comments about how ""We don't get to chat often"" (usually I spend a good chunk of the weekend catching up on chores/errands, so when she does come over she spends more time with my kids than with me)</li>
</ol>

<p>During the former (frustrated that I don't reach out more during the week) I apologized and told her that I would try to do better, but explained that because life is crazy (the points at top), I simply might not be able to reach out to her as much as she likes.</p>

<p>Similarly, the texting thing has come up before.  This isn't the first time she's followed up a text with a sarcastic text because I took to long to respond.  I aim to get back to her quickly and usually do, but this time she got me in the middle of bedtime and I wasn't able to respond until the next morning.  In general I like text messages because they don't require an immediate response, but my mom obviously feels differently.  In this case I responded the same way I did the last time this happened - something like ""Sorry mom, life is busy and I don't always have a chance to respond immediately"".</p>

<p>I'm not trying to make up excuses here - most days it's wake up, get ready for the day, feed kids breakfast, work, eat dinner, start putting kids to bed (little people go to bed early), put wife to bed (she goes to bed early because of baby), sleep, repeat.  I understand her frustration, especially because I know she doesn't really have any friends, but spare time is missing in my life right now, and probably will be for another couple years.</p>

<p>I feel like she and I have touched on this topic a few times now, with me explaining that as life is just crazy and I can't always respond/reach out as quickly/often as she would like.  We seem to move on for a while and then it inevitably comes up again, in one way or another.  I feel like there is a larger issue here that I might be missing which causes things like this to keep popping up.</p>

<p>Might there be anything I can do to help my mom accept the way things are right now, and stop getting frustrated when I don't give her as much ""attention"" as she wants?</p>

"How to reply to small talk/random facts in a non-offensive way?","<p>I've discovered that when I have a conversation with someone, I sometimes answer in a somehow offensive way.<br>
For example:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Person:  I just read that actor is born in town X.<br>
  Me: So what? You're from town Y.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not answering in an annoyed tone more like a joking tone, but I can see, that the other person would still consider me rude. I'd like to know how to answer sentences like these, when I actually don't know how to reply and the question ""So what?"" or ""Why would you ask/say that?"" just pops up in my head.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not sure if this problem is actually this simple, because I basically only have arguments over this when it happens with my partner. We have an intercultural relationship, which was long-distance for a long time. Now I'm in his country and don't have any of my own friends, which is why his approval of me has become a lot more important. When a situation as described above occurs, he would stop talking or only reply in a resigned way.  </p>

<p>It took me a long time to find out, that it's my kind of response that puts him off and I can also see that it probably would put other people off. But when asking him, how would be a better way to reply (better meaning keeping the conversation positive or at least neutral and moving), he would reply ""That's just how you are and I have to deal with it."" I did state that I would prefer to not offend him/get on his wrong side, because I am kind of emotionally dependent on him at the moment and it makes me feel really bad/anxious.</p>

<p>So it comes down to two questions:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do I answer in a non-offensive way (to not put him off in the first place)?  </p></li>
<li><p>How can I resolve the situation after offending him, so I can feel safe again?</p></li>

"How best to come out to socially conservative (and religious) family members?","<p><strong>Some background:</strong></p>

<p>I have a small number of close family members, and all of them (apart from my siblings) are socially conservative (ranging from quite socially conservative, to very socially conservative).</p>

<p>About half of these close family members also belong to a sect of Christianity that is quite conservative and literal in their interpretation of the bible when compared to mainstream religion (I'm happy to share which sect if it's deemed relevant to the question).</p>

<p>I was raised in said religion but left a few years back; it was difficult at the time, but it's generally accepted at the moment, with the caveat that it's a subject none of us bring up at risk of painful arguments ensuing.</p>

<p>As an aside, I have a great relationship with almost all of my family, especially my parents and grandparents, and none of them (apart from my siblings) know, or even seem to suspect, that I'm gay. I'm also not currently living with, or dependent on, my parents.</p>

<p><strong>My current situation</strong></p>

<p>I'm worried that my parents (or other family members) might find out about me dating other men through word of mouth. Unfortunately, it's not as secret as it used to be, and I'm worried about one particular individual who now knows, and might decide to inform my family about this. In any case, I think they're going to start questioning my lack of a girlfriend at some point (I'm currently 24).</p>

<p>I'm starting to think that instead of continuing to hide it from my family, the best approach might be to tell my parents, and other family members, about it first. Rather than them hear about it through someone else before me, or start asking awkward questions that I'm not well prepared to answer.</p>

<p><em>What would be the best way to do this? Sit down and talk to them about it? Write them a letter? Tell a more distant family member (aunt) first to gauge their reaction before talking to my parents?</em></p>

<p>I'm really struggling to think of a good way of doing this; I'm expecting the reaction (at least initially) to be quite bad, but hopefully if I approach this in the right way I can mitigate that?</p>

"How can I be more assertive when telling my family that I don't want to marry?","<p>I am a 29 year old South Indian, been living abroad for sometime now, born into a conservative family that's religious and is society influenced/fearing in that what the society thinks matters a great deal, to my parents specifically and certain things have to be done at a certain time because it is ""right"" and on certain matters, what they say goes or has to. While they are entitled to their beliefs and opinions which I try not to get involved with as there are things that I don't agree with, I am not comfortable doing what they want me to do because they think it is necessary and that's the right way to do. Given my age, this problem has reached its peak where now they want me to get married. Arranged marriage of course. While I personally have a lot of issues with many Indian conventions and traditions, I do not have a problem others following it as long as they don't force it upon me to do it. In my family, like in most families similar to mine, 26 to 28 years is about the ""right time"" to get a man married and soon after, upto maybe 3 to 5 years later, they expect that person to have kids. I am simply against the idea of arranged marriage or having to marry when one does not want to or to have kids. I feel these are the choices of an individual. But in families like mine, this becomes a family affair where the family pretty much ends up dictating the terms through different types of pressures most important being guilt tripping. Parents, they will have a certain idea of how their child's life should be. I understand that, but I feel by doing only what they want me to, I don't know where I am in my own life. I do not wish to change their mind, while it may help me a lot. Because they are free to have their own thinking but at the same time but I wish they did not try to change mine. Here are certain things that I thought are worth mentioning:</p>

<ol>
<li>My older brother got married at the ""rightful"" age of 28 a few years ago, arranged marriage and is planning to have a kid soon. So he is the ""good"" kid. Which means, I have the added pressure of someone already doing it as expected in my family and that I have already crossed that age.</li>
<li>About a year ago, I tried telling them that I do not want to marry but it usually ended up being a Q&amp;A session where I am asked for reasons and I present them some which are shot down with no regard and they give reasons why marriage is necessary. Although, my main reason is that I simply don't feel like it.</li>
<li>In India, weddings are a big deal with requires months of preparation, hundreds of guests etc. This kind of celebration is not for me. If at all I want to get married, I would prefer that it is just the girl, myself, her blood related family members and those of mine. This I did not expect it to go down well and it didn't. I am thought of to be silly or simply gone nuts for thinking so. I have my reasons which are apparently impractical to them.</li>
<li>I am not planning to have kids. At worst, if my partner and I, really feel we need to, I wish to adopt. This again is seen as idiotic. And the question of ""If you have the capacity to have your kid, why adopt?"".</li>
<li>Matches are found by families via their friends, acquaintances etc. The next thing is to share horoscopes between the two families and check for compatibility. When both families find them matching, they think that's sufficient for a marriage and once the families inform each other of their results, the families go visit each other to confirm and go ahead. In these visits, the potential bride &amp; groom get about 5 mins or maybe 30 mins to speak to each other to decide if the other person is the right better half for them. And the emotional obligation is that we would usually come out with a ""Yes"" after the brief talk. This I find extremely difficult to take in as I do not believe it is possible to understand a person in such a short time. I told my parents that I needed more time maybe months before deciding and they did not agree to it. And I do not want to visit the girl's family before I decide she's the one. Because people around talk, and visiting and later rejecting is usually exaggerated by useless folk. While I do not care about what is talked about me, I care that such things may affect the girl very badly and future prospects for her may become more difficult. And considering the amount of problems women go through in India, I believe strongly that the girl should know what she is getting herself into and how many of us reveal the kind of person we are in the first 5 to 30 minutes of meeting another one?</li>
<li>Families think it is their responsibility to marry off their son/daughter. This mindset is very hard to change.</li>
<li><p>Guilt tripping usually includes and is not limited to:</p>

<p>a. Saying that I am selfish to think the way I do.</p>

<p>b. That I do not respect my parents.</p>

<p>c. Some grandparent wants to see me married before their time comes.</p>

<p>d. People are continuously questioning the parents as to why the son/daughter isn't married yet.</p>

<p>e. Fear that the society or people around would end up talking nonsense and create their own reasons for why the person isn't married.</p>

<p>f. Parents have a certain dignity and respect which I shouldn't tarnish (this includes the idea of my having a girlfriend, which I do not but it is my preferred option for a marriage) or dishonor the family.</p>

<p>g. I have a younger brother too. So I need to be done with so that his life should not be affected. More precisely, parents should not have trouble finding him a bride because of me.</p>

<p>h. That I am not maintaining the culture of the family that I was brought up in and living abroad has somehow changed me. The fact is, I have been living abroad only for couple of years now while my beliefs and idea have been this way for far more than that. Which the family does not want accept no matter how hard I try telling them.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I want to know is how to be more assertive when I tell my family that my views are just as important to me in deciding how my life should be hereon instead of being forced to live a life envisioned by them.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I did tell my parents that I might compromise on the grand wedding because it is everybody else's dreams while clearly stating that I am not happy about it. When I agreed to do this, they said, I should not tell the girl that I am unhappy about the grand wedding.</p>

<p>I told them clearly that the kids option is something that I will not compromise with.</p>

<p>But I also told them, it is the decision of the girl who might be willing to marry. And I wanted to be honest with her and told them that I need to speak to girl upfront and be straight about my views so that she can decide if I am a good fit for her. Because the things that I am asking for myself and for the girl are quite extreme compared to our traditions. But the girl has to decide for herself. But given that it is an arranged marriage and the girl would primarily be of my parents choosing, I know this would be a traditional girl who would be hurt with what I have to say but I need to say it anyways so she is informed.</p>

<p>But talking to a girl about this or for the time I might need before anything is even decided also seemed like a pretty radical thought to them and they said no. The initial offer was that I could talk to her for 5 or 10 mins when we visit the girl's family. When I said that is not enough time to understand a person, they said, ""Ok, 30 mins"".</p>

<p>I am hurting them. I am aware of this, I am not the kind of son they want me to be. Given the disparity in our thoughts, I may never be. But I want to remain true to what I believe in. There are things that I keep to myself despite wanting to be honest with them because, while they say ""be open and honest, we want to hear you out"", when I start speaking, it is usually attacked with ways on how my thoughts are wrong and it is ok for me to be wrong, everyone makes mistakes and finally they try to convince me of something that I know I will not be convinced about. One of the things I haven't told them still is that I have been an atheist for more than 10 years. Religion, caste etc are things that I do not like associating myself with. I cannot tell them this, because I know they will try to convince my otherwise and additionally now, they would still think I changed after moving out of India. My mother is someone I think I can convince. While I believe she has her reservations, I think she may come around. Because she wants me to get married, that is her wish. When I do it or who or how is not something she insists on, at least not to me. My dad on the other hand is very vocal about his views and thinks that I have strayed away from my path.</p>

"Needy friend uses me to avoid his parents, how do I tell him no?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a friend whom I have been very close with for a long time. A few years ago, when we were in high school, he came out to me and told me that he did not want to tell his parents, as they are very homophobic and would hurt him or kick him out of the house. Obviously I promised not to tell his parents or anyone else, and we continued our friendship as normal.</p>

<p>Currently we are both in college. He went out-of-state to get away from his family and live freely, i.e. not have to worry about hiding his orientation. He came back this summer to visit me and his other friends.</p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p><strong>He has been wanting to come over constantly, basically every day, to get away from his family.</strong> He does not want to spend time with them - they have said hurtful things to him in the past and made fun of the way he dresses and acts, and he has implied that he has struggled with self-harm because of the way they treat him. Because of all this I was obviously okay at first with him coming over more often than usual, and it was totally fine for a while. He would come over two or three times a week and we would just hang out and spend time together. No problems at all.</p>

<p>However, I am an introvert and I now have a full-time job, and he now wants to spend almost all of my available time together, starting the minute I get home from work. He wants to know when I get home and then immediately comes over then, and stays almost until I go to bed. He also wants to hang out on the weekends. When I say I have other plans or just want a day to myself, he makes me feel bad about it and reminds me of his home situation, and says that none of his other friends are responding.</p>

<p>It has gotten to the point where constantly being around him, talking to him and supporting him is draining me emotionally. When we are hanging out he constantly complains about his family and does not really ask me about my problems (and I have problems of my own). It doesn't feel like a mutual friendship anymore and I'm getting tired of it. I feel like his therapist and his getting-away-from-family hideout, not his friend.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p><strong>How can I tell him that enough is enough and ask for a break?</strong> Obviously I don't want to make his family situation worse or drive him to self-harm, but I cannot take this anymore. I'm exhausted and it's starting to affect my relationships with other people. Does anyone have any advice to deal with this situation as delicately as possible? I really don't want to lose the friendship, I just want him to let me have some time to myself when I need it and not make me feel bad about it.</p>

"How to respond to ""empty compliments"" after many years of playing along?","<p>I am currently a church musician (pianist) and have been at the same church for many years.</p>

<p>There is this one guy who quite frequently walks over to me while I'm playing, always making comments directed towards me such as ""you just get better and better every week"" or ""you have more talent in your fingers than I have in my entire body"". For one, I have not been working on increasing skill or learning more difficult music for the longest time, so I can't possibly get better by the week. On occasion, I even intentionally play music so simple that I use only one finger to play an entire song, and he still ""compliments"" me. Every time he does this, it becomes so repetitive, somewhat dishonest, and worthless, and all I've ever responded was ""Thank you"".</p>

<p>It's getting very annoying, and I find it more difficult not to roll my eyes or keep a straight face. I'm probably still going to respond with my best courteous ""Thank you"". </p>

<p>This same individual has voiced his opinion to someone else (I've overheard) that he thinks music in church is such a waste of time, and is the reason why he and his wife don't participate in congregational singing or attend music concerts held in church. And no, never has he specifically said to me that he appreciates my performance or even my efforts. To me, if one regards music in church as wasteful, it makes no sense to compliment at all those involved in it. So, whenever he ""compliments"" me, I feel like like he's being dishonest, or, if he really means it, I find the frequency of the complimenting quite creepy. I want to say something, but I don't know how to approach this kind of a situation.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is pertinent, but I know that this individual believes and upholds the idea that he can say anything he wants, and if ever it offends anyone, it's their fault; and to anyone even requesting him not to say certain things, he regards them as taking away his freedom of speech. I know this because he voices out these sentiments on his social media accounts. For those of you who really want to know how he reacts when told he is acting inappropriately - he posts stuff on his social media like:</p>

<ul>
<li>""I'm crazy, weird, etc. That's how I am. Deal with it. I'm not changing my behavior to please anyone.""</li>
<li>""You're telling me to shut up or act accordingly, so you are attempting to take away my right to speak my mind.""</li>
<li>""Once again, Facebook reprimanded me for my behavior. They know nothing about my rights.""</li>
<li>""I admit that people think that I think I know everything and are upset about it. That's their problem. I know a lot and their knowledge is all false information.""</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, those are clear enough indications that he doesn't want to be corrected, and any such attempts no matter how tactful, is equivalent to infringing his rights. I'll just suck it up and embrace the awkwardness of playing along as usual - much better than getting into a fight with someone like this, and yes, he carries a gun to church as he makes it visible, so I'll choose my safety just keep playing along.</p>

<p>So, for those who want to know, how do I tell someone if I detect they're being fake? Most of the time, I'll say nothing and give them back a fake smile. Sometimes, I'll tell them that they're too kind for saying such a thing. Sometimes, I'll tell them that I don't feel that I come up to par as they claim. No, I don't tell them off that ""hey, you're being fake. Cut that out."" But they stop complimenting me eventually. This guy doesn't.</p>

<p><strong>How do you conduct yourself when interacting with a ""chronic empty complimenter"" who also happens to get angry at any hint that he should change his behavior?</strong></p>

"How can I get my friend to stop calling me every day?","<p>I have a close friend who I have been very supportive of each-other and it's been a relatively decent friendship but lately it's gotten out of hand.</p>

<p>My friend calls me 3 to 4 times a day and texts me non-stop. To the point I almost expect it. He always makes some kind of excuse why he needs to call me, for example he will say ""I need you to call me. It's important."" or ""I have a question to ask you. Can you call me?"" Then even if I tell him if he can just text me or if it can wait, he will call me anyways. Doesn't even matter what I'm doing. I could be at work, or out in town, or doing chores, and I'd have to drop everything. And these conversations will go on forever, to the point of wasting my time because there talking about stuff I really don't care about or he talked about it already.</p>

<p>I've tried a few things. Ignoring him turns into a nightmare. He will begin spam calling and texting me till I pick up. I'll wake up after a nap or coming back from outside, only to find tons of messages and voicemails with a slow progression of him getting pissed off because I didn't answer his calls. And the direct approach only gets similar results with the same excuse: ""I have a right to call my friends!"" I can understand like once a week, but 3 or more times a day... that's excessive...</p>

<p>It's putting a strain on our friendship and I can't stand doing this everyday. I'm desperate for some way to fix this without ending what would be a perfectly fine friendship otherwise.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Answering some questions:</strong></p>

<p><em>Is there a chance of mental illness?</em></p>

<p>If you consider being short fused a mental illness. Otherwise, I'm sure if that was the case, I would have picked up on it. </p>

<p><em>Is there something in it for me?</em></p>

<p>No. I'm not a person who would use someone else for any reason and neither has he. Matter of fact, we hate depending on others. (Unless I have misunderstood what you mean.) </p>

<p><em>Is this a possible relationship issue?</em></p>

<p>I'm only clarifying this because I saw it brought up. I'm a dude, Hes a dude.  There's nothing between us other then a long-term friendship. I'm not even going to bring sexuality into the mix ether.</p>

<p><em>What is he calling about?</em></p>

<p>When he talks about ""urgency"" he usually dose have a problem, but its usually only <em>minor</em> problem, like something I usually cant help him with and sometimes I'm sure he could care for on his own. But from what I've caught onto, its usually only something he can get my attention for so he can go ""Well, since I have you on the phone..."" And then he starts talking to me about random things that just have no connection to his original problem and are simply not important.</p>

"How do I ask for an espresso if there's a good chance they don't know how to make it?","<p>I like coffee and I live in Russia which is not generally a coffee drinking country.</p>

<p>More often than not, when you ask for an espresso in Russia, you get 100 to 150 ml of liquid in your cup.</p>

<p>The cafes as a rule have the good equipment: espresso machines, grinders etc., but for some reason the Russian barista's idea of an espresso is usually take a big cup and wait for the machine to fill it all the way up. Sometimes you get a warning ""you know an espresso is a very small cup of coffee, right?"", which is a good sign.</p>

<p>I assume most people who are not familiar with espresso feel cheated when they get hardly enough liquid to cover the bottom of the cup, so the baristas and the cafe owners have to account for it.</p>

<p>At one place I had to ask to have my coffee re-made, and the response from the lady at the counter was ""wow, finally someone who knows how to drink the right kind of coffee"". But this is the exception rather than the rule, and most often you get pursed lips and avoided eye contact.</p>

<p>There are places which know how to make their coffee, and I'm familiar with all of them which are next to the place where I live. However when I'm eating out and want to finish my dinner with a nice cup of coffee, or when I'm away from home, I'm at the mercy of the person operating the machine this day.</p>

<p>I feel awkward when I come to the place I've never been before and try to tell the barista how to do their job. However, if I'm not specific enough, like in ""I want this cup to be filled this high, and I want it to take this long"", there is a good chance I get a full cup of watery and bitter swill from a good-meaning person. And it's twice as hard when you have to communicate it through the waiter or the cashier rather than talk to the barista themselves.</p>

<p>I have no problem being <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DleceyAO34M"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ron Swanson ordering bacon and eggs</a> if I know I have to, but there's always a chance the barista actually knows their job. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: how do I communicate that I'm ordering one sip of coffee and I mean it, without offending the barista?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: you totally have to be really really specific and use absolute units of measure if you want your coffee made the way they make it in Italy.</p>

<p>I'm speaking from experience. 4 times out of 5 if I'm not being that specific, I get my coffee severely over-extracted.</p>

<p>Russia is a tea drinking country, words like ""small cup"" don't really translate from tea to coffee. 100 ml is a very small cup of tea but a very large cup of espresso.</p>

<p>And the real problem is that the staff rarely if ever get complaints about being served too much coffee but get many about being served too little. If you don't assure them they won't get in any trouble by serving you two tablespoons of coffee, they'll pour you more, just to be on the safe side. </p>

<p>The best course of action is take the cup, mark the level with your nail and say ""could you please set the grind level one step finer than you usually do and fill the cup up to this mark here?""</p>

<p>As I said before, I have no problem doing that if I know I really have to (say the second time I visit the place), but it's awkward to start the first conversation with a barista by making an assumption they don't know how to do their job.</p>

<p>The question is how to avoid accidentally alienating the 20% of baristas who know what they are doing, given that the other 80% need the very specific instructions.</p>

"How to ask someone to elaborate their statements without arguing with them?","<p>It has happened many times to me. Also, but not exclusively, on *.stackexchange sites.</p>

<ol>
<li>Someone makes a statement. Often, but not always, they do this as a response to a question I asked.</li>
<li>What they say doesn't seem right to me! It is in conflict with what I think I know / it seems self-refuting to me / it seems to me to overlook something important that has considerable ramifications to the topic / etc etc.</li>
<li>I think that just accepting what I was told and moving on is likely suboptimal for at least two reasons: * I understand that I may be wrong and I may be influenced by some misconceptions that prevent me from understanding the topic, so if this is the case I would like to ask this person to clear my misconceptions (or else I won't reach understanding) and * It has sometimes been the case that it turned out I was right and the person to make the statements was wrong - another big reason to try to ask him to respond to my doubts rather than simply accept that he is right and I am wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p>However: All too often when I present my doubts to the statement-maker the results are not what I intended. I am often told I'm rude and argumentative; and even if I'm not being told this the person I'm talking to often simply quits the conversation. Even on SE it has happened at least twice to me: (1) After posting a comment under an answer I was told that because of my attitude the answerer would not answer any more questions from me in the future and (2) After posting a comment under another answer to another question I saw this answer deleted and my question downvoted.</p>

<p>My guess is that I have a nasty habit of crossing the line from asking a person to elaborate what they just said to fighting their statements and trying to prove them wrong. My guess is that while people typically like to elaborate what they just said they nevertheless don't like to see their statements attacked and don't like to have to defend them; rather, they quit the conversation. Makes sense actually; if I know better why was I asking in the first place?</p>

<p>I hypothesise there is one way to try to remedy the situation: try to somehow ask my follow-up question in such a way that it is clear that I am not doubting the accurateness of what I was told. To make the person I'm talking to believe that I believe I am wrong and they are right and I'm just asking them to help me understand why exactly am I wrong. I don't think I'm good in games of this kind, yet I tried this once or twice and I think the results were good; but nonetheless I don't like this method! It seems manipulative to me, it seems to me that by trying to achieve this I am actually trying to lie to the person I'm talking to because it is not true that I believe I am necessarily wrong and they are necessarily right. Often I turned to be wrong indeed; but since, as I said, it did happen a few times that I turned out to be completely correct I don't think I can nor should assume this outcome cannot happen again. And I want to be an honest person.</p>

<p>It would seem that I need to somehow both (a) avoid challenging the statement that was told to me, only ask to elaborate this in light of A, B or C, but at the same time (b) avoid communicating to the person that I believe they are necessarily 100% correct and my doubts are necessarily 100% incorrect!</p>

<p>How to achieve this? <sub>(And if this is possible? Ie doesn't (b) imply not (a)?

I'd go so far as to say I owe them a great deal for the practical help they have given me in the past. Now that they have a life-changing increase in wealth, I can see how they might be starting to feel taken advantage of.</p>

<p>I value our friendship far more than any amount of money. I want to assure them that I have no interest in their bank balance, only their continued friendship. Early on, they asked what could they get me. I jokingly said, ""House? Car?"" But I feel bad about that now because, honestly, I'm just happy to have them as friends.</p>

<p>How can I make sure that they never feel I am friends for what I can get? (Because I am not). I know I can say that I am not - how do I show it?</p>

"How to deal with a frank speaking and overthinking guy","<p>I am hanging with a group of friends all around 22 - 23 years old . One of us is sometimes having some anger and sadness at mixed times. It makes the group feel weird.</p>

<p>To detail these crises: he could get upset about someone for a petty reason, and starts speaking roughly and even sometimes insulting people. It makes us feel weird, but none of us are confrontation types of people.</p>

<p>Now the main problem is that only a few member of the group are supporting these crises. I had a problem with that, but I let it go. Some people of the group with background went deeper in the issue.</p>

<p>Another time the problem was that he was in trouble with people in the group and make it known to the one who is the best of them, but was also handling personal issues at that moment. With the same problem as the guy, I was not a help in reducing his resentment, and now I think I even made it stronger.</p>

<p>Although he is very rough talking, there is no physical violence involved or mentioned.</p>

<p>My question in the end is how should I act with this person?
Should I force myself to be a more confrontational person?</p>

"How to handle office chitchat","<p>I'm 30 years old, this is not my first job, and every time I start a new job, I promise myself to be more social and talk more with people. </p>

"Not having to explain my reasons for wanting to keep my last name","<p>As a female in the UK, I'm expected to drop my last name and take my (male) partners' name when we get married - there's no law against me keeping my last name, though it's generally frowned upon. </p>

<p>Ever since I asked my Mum from a young age ""Why does the girl have to take the guys last name?"" and she informed me that we don't, and in fact her Aunt kept her name when she married, I never wanted to drop my last name.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not saying that I'm expecting my partner to take my last name and drop theirs (though in this case, when it comes to it, he's willing to), I've always been willing to compromise and double barrel or we just keep our own names.</p>

<p>I find that it's generally males who have a problem with me wanting to keep my last name, females sometimes start of a little confused but soon accept my decision, whereas guys generally don't. As a result, I get asked ""Why?"". I have my reasons (which my partner knows and understands), though I don't see why they matter since guys never have to explain themselves. I was recently asked to explain myself, and I did, and he then belittled my reasons after saying he wouldn't judge me, which made me regret explaining my position.</p>

<li>For clarification, I do not have children, nor am I planning to anytime soon.</li>
<li>I'm aware that not all males feel as if the women should take the last name.</li>
<li>It's not always people who I don't know or aren't that friendly with who think that I should take the guys name, for example a (female) family friend heavily criticised my decision to keep my last name when it was brought up in conversation by my Mum, and even proceeded to say ""I don't see the point in marriage if you don't take the guys last name"". In this case my Mum defended my position and tried quickly to shut the conversation down before it became a heated debate.</li>
<li>I don't actively bring up this fact, it generally arises organically in conversation, and can be brought up by friends and family members who are aware (see my above point).</li>

"How to communicate to my spouse I can't stand unexpected touch without hurting their feelings?","<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>I've recently learned about my autism and still need to understand what it means. I have struggle being touched when I don't expect it and it hurts my spouse when I already tried to explain to them why I react this way. How could I at least make them understand that me not standing being unexpectedly touched does not question my love for them, and at most trying to tell them that I'd like them to stop doing it?</p>

<hr>

<p>I've been with my spouse for more than three years. I've always struggled with unwanted and unanticipated touch, but only recently realized this was due to <a href=""https://www.autism-society.org/what-is/aspergers-syndrome/"" rel=""noreferrer"">autism</a>, which I got diagnosed with last year. Before the diagnosis I didn't know why my sight, hearing and touch felt overdeveloped, and I would usually dismiss the physical pain it'd cause me - at the expense of my energy levels.</p>

<p>Now that I know the reason behind my differences (among others), I have a hard time dismissing the pain from this unanticipated touch, and I've been trying to simply avoid these situations. Please note that I'm fine with touching as long as I understand that someone's going to hug me, pat my back or whatever. It's just an issue when I don't see the person upfront. </p>

<p>My spouse has some struggle understanding this. For them, when we're with other people, I should know that if someone touches me, that should be them. I should be okay when they kiss my neck when I'm behind the computer with noise-cancelling headphones as well too. The thing is, my brain does not expect physical touch unless it sees it coming. </p>

<p>We've had a lot of people coming over lately and it happened several times that during these moments my spouse initiated unanticipated touching - be it by approaching me from behind when I couldn't hear them coming or by unexpectedly throwing balls at me - yes, they love to play. I've been very tired lately thence  I couldn't control my reaction and I would end up telling them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why did you do this? You know I hate when people do this to me!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After which they would look sad or angry and say ""I just wanted to hug"". It makes me feel terrible because I don't have much control over my reaction.</p>

<p>Over the years I've tried to tell them I can't stand it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It causes me pain when my body is touched without I had the time to anticipate it. My family used to make fun of me and repeatedly poke me when I clearly told them to stop and I may react violently when it happens. Do you think you could try to be careful not to initiate physical contact unless I'm aware you're gonna do it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and they said they understand, and I believe they do. But I also get why they get upset upon my violent reactions when they forget about it and touch me without letting me enough time to prepare. </p>

<p><strong>As I can't help my reaction, I would like to reassure them on the fact that not standing unanticipated touch does not question my love for them. How could I do that, when I already tried to tell them about the pain it causes me?</strong></p>

<h2>Clarifications</h2>

<p>We're both very tactile and enjoy cuddling each other. We talk about intimacy quite often and openly talk about our respective needs and wants. They never told me they lacked any physical touch. I genuinely think they do not touch me by surprise on purpose.</p>

"How to politely notify someone that they are not using proper car safety (possibly against the law)?","<p>The title feel awkward, so if anyone can improve it, that would be great. Here's what I mean:</p>

<p>Sometimes you walk along the street and see someone in a car without a seat belt. Let's assume it's summer, the window is open, they're sitting at a red light or something and you <em>could</em> talk to them, even if just for a moment.</p>

<p>Or a bigger one - people who have children in their car without any restraints at all. No child seat, no seat belt, nothing. Sometimes you also see an infant in the lap of an adult. These can be seen in parking lots or when parents drop their children off at daycare - also times when it's possible to approach them.</p>

<p>These are all against the law, and if there was even a small accident, the consequences are potentially devastating.</p>

<p>Sometimes there are also smaller problems - an obviously wrongly installed child seat; a child seat that does not fit the child; etc.</p>

<p>It kinda feels like I should do something, speak out... but on the other hand, it's none of my business. Telling them flat out will most likely result in a hostile reaction. On occasion it looks more like somebody simply didn't know what they were doing (so they could even be receptive to corrections), but when you see someone without a seat belt, then that's obviously a choice and not a lack of knowledge. And if there's a similarly unsecured child next to them, who really doesn't know any better and was just doing what mom told them...</p>

<p>What should one do in such a situation? Can such people be spoken to in a manner that makes them reconsider their behavior? Or should they just be let alone and the natural selection allowed to take its course?</p>

"How can I talk with these people that I owe money to solve the situation?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>First, about me. I've got Asperger's and (social) anxiety. I started my first job after college a bit over a year ago and moved into a nice apartment with a fully furnished kitchen and wallpapering and floors included. I honestly made a mistake with the apartment. The place was great, but too expensive. I had blown most of the little savings I had (college is expensive) on some furniture and the deposit before I realized how expensive things are. I could just about afford it and save up a little. Over the year I lived there, I managed to save up enough to cover the costs of moving. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I got offered a much cheaper <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_house"" rel=""noreferrer"">council house</a>*. I would save around 25% of my wages per year accepting it, so I did. The exact day I would receive the keys was ""somewhere in summer"". The people living there had offered to sell me their floors, blinds and their kitchen furniture. Their price seemed a tad on the high side, but they were really friendly and I was too anxious to counter, so I accepted. We agreed I would pay in two terms, one the day before they would give keys back and one on my next payday. </p>

<p>I hadn't even heard when they would receive the keys (I would receive them a few hours after they gave them to the council) when I received an angry phone call: why hadn't I paid yet? I nicely explained to them I hadn't heard when they were moving out yet, so I would call the council. I called the council and this day was 3 weeks in the future, but I paid anyway, just to be nice. </p>

<p>When I received the keys, I found out some of the floors were damaged below where furniture had been. They didn't tell me. I was now starting to find their tad high price a bit too high. After I moved in, I found out the dishwasher didn't work and one of the blinds didn't go up. Now their tad high price was just unreasonable. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>We moved around my payday, the day I was supposed to pay the second term, and then my grandmother passed, and, stupid, I know, I forgot to pay. Even worse, I seemed to have misbudgeted, and was out of the money for the second term. Can the situation get any shittier? They called me and my flight instinct kicked in, but I still answered the call. I was trembling, my voice cracked and I profoundly apologized and promised I would pay them as soon as the deposit for my previous place would come back to me, hopefully before the end of the week. They told me that if the money isn't in their account by Friday, they would come get all their stuff back and destroy the floor. </p>

<p>I want to pay them. Even if I think it is too much. I promised and I will do everything I can to keep my promise. I am incredibly scared of them coming over and trespassing. I'm scared of keeping the garden door open in this heatwave. I'm scared of talking to them too. But I think talking is needed to sort this out, so I want to be as prepared as possible for this talk. </p>

<p><strong>How can I talk with these people about this?</strong> I want them to understand I want to pay and I will as soon as I have money (my next payday or whenever the deposit comes back) and that they are not entering my house. </p>

<p>There is a written agreement with a description of the items, like ""fridge"", but no quality or price mentioned. Legally, these items are mine, although they are entitled to their money.</p>

"How to 'be heard' when discussing problems within a relationship","<p><strong>A previous partner once taught me what it felt like to 'hear and be heard', however, I'm struggling to replicate her sorcery.</strong>  </p>

<p>My current girlfriend is extremely problem oriented. While this is 
generally a great thing, when discussing interpersonal problems, she has attention issues which manifest as problem solving too early into the conversation or focusing on blame assignment or tangential topics before she understands the entirety of the problem (much like I use to). I've gently pointed this out many times, but she/we have been unable to break the pattern.</p>

<p>I tried to just be patient and let her respond and then bring the conversation back on track, but she is extremely garrulous, which inevitably tries my patience, leaving me feeling exhausted and unfulfilled. When she has a topic she wants to discuss I have found the best way to quell her wordiness without fully interrupting her is to interject with questions, however, when I am the one bringing up a topic this tends to backfire and just further derails things.</p>

<p>I've let her know how this makes me feel, and that I'd prefer if she was more inquisitive to ensure she understood me before answering or getting defensive. She seems genuine when she tells me she'd like to do better, but after 8 months of routinely addressing it, the problem persists.</p>

<p>I've tried enlisting outside help. Our therapist is better at interrupting her to get her to sit quietly for longer, but I can tell once she's thought of what she wants to say she's too distracted by it to really process what's going on. I even tried bringing her to a non-violent communication class, but she didn't really seem to understand the rules, what it means to be present or the point of connecting vs being able to just rant freely with a stranger.</p>

<p><strong>In summary, the 3-4 symptoms that I notice seem to always accompany my inablitly to feel heard are:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>She starts problem solving too quickly.</li>
<li>She redirects (either talking
about a tangential problem or by focusing on where to place blame).</li>
<li>She is extremely garrulous when she speaks / how it happening in conjunction with a derailment on an interpersonal matter I'm trying to bring up triggers me.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few times I have been awkwardly given a drink without the person asking me if I wanted it. It was hard for me to tell them that I didn't want it so I just held it and didn't drink it or gave it to someone else when they weren't looking.

"How do I convince my dad to support my mom’s surgery?","<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>My mom has been terminally ill for
almost a year and my dad has been the primary care taker. I recently moved internationally back to my home country and have been the secondary care taker since the past two months.</p>

<p>We recently settled on a major surgery as the next step for my mom. The surgery would be the only cure for my mom (5-year survival rate >75% vs 15% otherwise). However, it is very expensive - the surgery itself would be 6X of my parents collective annual pensions (they both retired) and post-op medicines required to take for life would take almost half of their pensions annually. However, they owned at least three proprieties in addition to some savings. I don’t know how much exactly. But it doesn’t seem that they don’t have money for the surgery if they want to do it. </p>

<p>My dad was initially very hesitant and very scared of the surgery. He kept talking about the worst case scenario - that we spent all the money on my mom and then what happens if he or I got sick? To resolve his concerns, I invited my dad’s best friends to come over and comfort him. I also offered to give them all my savings, which would cover half of the surgery expense. Also both I and my brother are quite young and healthy; We should be able to make some money in a few years. My dad finally agreed to do the surgery. My mom was initially not certain about it also due to the financial burden, but she was brought on board fairly easily after my dad and I became very affirmative. </p>

<p>Still he had a cancer scare for himself the day after the decision. I went to the ER with him and it was confirmed to be mild infections. </p>

<p>Things have been pretty quiet since then. We admitted my mom for the surgery and were told it should happen in three weeks. My dad also told me that he was a few phone calls away from borrowing the rest half of the surgery money from some relatives.</p>

<p><strong>Problems</strong>:</p>

<p>I thought everything was good. Only yesterday did I learn from him that he was still uneasy about his own health and went to do an enhanced CT, which was not what the doctor had suggested. </p>

<p>The result showed he had a small tumor on his liver. The imaging reported “possibly early HCC (hepatic cell carcinoma). Please refer to biopsy“. I immediately took him to a local doctor, who suggested an invasive surgery. I was not very convinced as the doctor didn’t explain why it would be the best option and am looking for further consultation with a bigger hospital. We also did a MRI today and are  waiting on the result.</p>

<p>He was understandably very upset. but it appeared to me that he was almost eager to believe it was cancer. He kept talking about the surgery and that he should start informing our relatives. Most importantly, he told me he was not sure if my mom should do her surgery. </p>

<p>I was heart-broken hearing about that, as it would be my mom’s only chance. There is a certain time window before which my mom are eligible for it.</p>

<p>He also changed his words about money, saying that he didn’t even know who to borrow the money from. </p>

<p>It seems to me he is backing off from my mom’s surgery. At the time I’m trying the most - I have been unemployed for the last two months to just take care of my mom. After giving all my savings, I would have tremendous level of financial pressure as well, while balancing care-taking and job search. </p>

<p>I know it’s an emotionally difficult time for him. I have cancelled my flight for my job search event to be with him. But it seems his diagnosis is still unclear. I don’t know the false-positive rate of the CT scan. We haven’t done biopsy. 
Even if it is cancer, financially there is no problem as he recently received full health care coverage for cancer (upon my insist). The five year survival is very optimistic (>90% based on my research). Given my dad’s otherwise healthy condition, there are a variety of options available for him as less invasive treatments. My brother recently graduated and joined the care taking force, so we should have enough hands as well.</p>

"How should I approach my crush if she's not interested?","<p><strong>TL;DR: There's this girl I really like, who is apparently not interested in me, 
since I've already made a move on her without any luck. 
Nevertheless, I've decided not to give up and make one more effort to try and win her over.
I want to prove my worth to her/impress her and make her think it over.
How should I handle the situation this time? How should I approach her? Text her? Only in person?
Which kind of attitude would be my best chance?</strong></p>

<p>And here comes the long story. It's been like 4 months that I'm in to this girl. Most of the guys I talked to,
do find her to be attractive but in my eyes, she's like a goddess, extremely beautiful. I'm 99% sure she's single,
we live really close to each other but don't know each other a lot on a personal level.</p>

<p>In the beginning, I didn't even have the guts to talk to her because I thought I stand no chance with her. At some point,
I realized I had to take my shot and approach her even though it seemed kind of pointless. I started talking to her both
in person when I got the chance as well as texting her a few times and she would react really calm and cool about it (not excited though)
, smiling etc, being kind of friendly as if we knew each other for a long time. But that was smalltalk she was just trying to be nice.</p>

<p>As soon as she realized I like her, it didn't go well (as I expected) and I already regret that the way I expressed myself was pessimistic without
any confidence at all and said some things that might have scared her away. When I asked her out, she read the message but didn't respond anything at all. 
Then, I had to tell her everything through text e.g. ""I really like you a lot and have been thinking about you for a while, even though I have
no idea if you're even attracted to me I want to get to know you better and just had to let you know how I feel to get it out of my system.""
Nothing vulgar or bad about it, but I do understand it was too much overwhelming for her and I blew it. Anyway, that happened 6 weeks ago,
I got no response to any of this, so I get what it means and tried to stop thinking about her or meet someone else, but it didn't work.
I went out with another girl but couldn't enjoy it or get my crush out of my head.</p>

<p>Having said that, I recently changed my mind and decided not to give up and try to approach her once again. Even though I'm well prepared for 
one more rejection, I feel like I have nothing to lose, so I might as well follow my instinct. Since then, I've only texted her once on her 
birthday with an honest and beautiful wish for her birthday when she actually did respond typically ""thank you, blah blah bla"". Other than that,
I bumped into her twice outside and both of the times I acted all chill as if nothing happened, I even teased her a little bit, she was laughing 
and later I got away, no pressure, it was not awkward at all. </p>

<p>These days I changed my profile picture and she hit the like button, which was so
unexpected for me. Obviously, that doesn't mean she likes me, but it definitely means that she's ok with what happened, not trying to avoid me
or terrified with the way I approached her back then. I mean like, if you really despise someone or think that he's creepy and you're fully aware
that he's attracted to you, would you do something like that? Would you ""like"" his picture or act normal and smile when you see him outside?
Probably not... It doesn't make sense, I almost feel like she's playing with my brain. Like she wants me to pay attention to her again because 
she is enjoying it even though she has no intention of going out with me. </p>

<p>Anyway, I have no idea what went wrong, I just assume that she doesn't like my face/style/appearence or just was afraid to be open to someone
she doesn't know well enough, or I didn't handle it right or maybe she doesn't want to get involved to any trouble because we have a lot of common acquaintances in the 
neighbourhood or she has her mind on someone else, or she wanted to be single for the time being during summer or a combination of all these
assumptions. Either way, I know it's almost a lost case already and it's irrational from my side to keep going after her, but unfortunately that's
how I feel, so please do not give me any advice to stop spending my time on her, I already know that I should and tried it without succeeding. By this point,
I just want to try once again to win her over. I need a way to surprise her or impress her, do something she wouldn't expect from me,
make her have a second thought on me and maybe make her consider me as an opportunity if that's possible. I just need to improve the situation.</p>

<p>There's a local event in a few days that I know she will attend and if I go there, most likely I will see her in person again and have the chance
to talk to her. Should I wait for this? Or text her anytime e.g. tonight? And what am I supposed to say? I want her to feeling comfortable with 
whatever I do, not to put any pressure on her like last time. Thank you for reading this long text, what would you do in my position?</p>

"How to tell someone they should honour their bid on my item?","<p>I am selling used textbooks online in a Facebook buy and sell group. Two people contacted me within a minute apart to buy the same book, which I had listed for $50 OBO (""or best offer""). I messaged back asking them both if they would pay more than my asking price of $50, since they had both messaged at the same time (I would have sold it to the person who messaged first if they had been farther apart). </p>

<p>One person replied back immediately, saying they would pay $60 for it, but no more than that. The exact conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: ""Would you be willing to pay more than $50?"" </p>
  
  <p>Them: ""I can do $60! ... But if they do any higher I'll pass.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other person hasn't replied yet. I told the person who replied immediately that if the other person didn't beat their offer soon, I would sell the book to them. </p>

<p>However, now here is the meat of this question, they just asked me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""So if the other person passes, did you want $50 or $60?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How can I explain politely that, since they said they would pay $60, I would prefer for them to honour that pledge?</strong> 
(It doesn't seem fair to the other person that I would take the $50 anyway.... or maybe I am just greedy ....)</p>

"How to explain to a friend I don't like them stopping talking to me due to a jealous friend/sexual partner?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a friend for almost three years now, we are both 24 y.o, we have always been so close and, even if we live far away from each other (+9000km), we have spoken every single day since we parted ways.</p>

<p>I have been to his country (in South America) to visit him in 2017, and he has recently come to mine to visit me (Europe). </p>

<p>Since the beginning we have liked each other, but distance and me being in a relation ship - with a guy I really love - made it impossible to have a romantic relationship. However, it's true that when we saw each other, we were behaving more like a couple than just friends: cuddling, spooning, holding hands… </p>

<p>I went to visit him in 2017, and after a month, he met a girl with whom he started a friends with benefits relationship and eventually ended up being her boyfriend. At that time, my friend and I were planning a trip of one month together, and his girlfriend got jealous.</p>

<p>During that time, she was getting jealous every time I was sending messages to my friend to the point that he had to show her the messages we were sending each other in Instagram, and he would stop talking to me if she was around, which seemed unfair to me, and I told it to him.</p>

<p>During the trip I asked my friend about his feelings towards me and his girlfriend, and he told me he likes me more and he enjoys talking with me more. He also said he didn't want to be in an exclusive relationship with his actual girlfriend.</p>

<p>Now, after the trip, he talked with the girl and told her that he had cheated on her several times and that he didn't see her as girlfriend, so they stayed as friends, which is cool if they feel like being friends. </p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>The problem came when now, after the trip and the break up, they met again (as friends), and he went to sleep at her house, and he stopped answering my messages. </p>

<p>That would be ok if he does so because he really wants to. I mean, I don't want him to feel forced to answer me, and I would be perfectly fine with it if it were his own choice. I have asked him before if he doesn't reply to me because he doesn't want or just to not make the girl feel jealous, and he always said the second scenario. </p>

<p>This is where I mainly see the problem. Because somehow he's being manipulated, not directly though, to stop talking to me or not talking that much, while he has the will to do it. And I believe him when he says so, because as soon as he leaves the girl's house he replies to all my messages saying ""Sorry, I was with the girl etc"". </p>

<p><strong>What I want</strong></p>

<p>What I want to achieve is to make him realize that his relationship with this girl is affecting our relationship. And that theirs is not a healthy relationship as she has checked messages I have sent my friend and he's stopped doing things we both like (talking to each other) just to avoid his ex being jealous again. </p>

<p>I am searching for advice as I want to say it in a way that I don't sound jealous of them being together again (as friends or whatever), as I am really not.  </p>

<p>I just want him to open his eyes and realize that it's not a healthy relationship. I am aware that talking about such a sensitive topic might make him feel like I am jealous and that I'm trying to get him to avoid interacting with her. As I said, we like each other, and I would like to handle the problem without making him feel this way.</p>

<p><strong>What I've tried so far</strong></p>

<p>Before the trip, when he started doing the same, I talked with him very seriously and I told him that this kind of behavior annoyed me, because he was not talking to me just because she was feeling jealous/bad. </p>

<p>When I told him about it, I also talked about his relationship with her and he realised he needed to tell her that he was not seeing her as a girlfriend and so on, he waited to come back from the trip and he said it.</p>

<p>He also stopped doing like that and he was talking to me while going to the toilet or so if he was in the girl's house or the girl was around him. </p>

<p>Now, I am surprised he did it again as I already explained him how I was feeling about it before (in July) and he seemed to understand it. </p>

<p><strong>Question?</strong></p>

<p>How could I approach him with the topic again so he can understand my feelings and that he is not in a healthy relationship? </p>

<p><strong>Additional information</strong></p>

<p>I don't want a relationship with my friend as I am more than good with my actual boyfriend.</p>

"How can I forewarn a schoolmate that I'll refuse to answer personal questions if we meet?","<p>This year is my husband's 10-year high school reunion, and some schoolmates emailed him about catching up — separately from the reunion. He's grappling with deciding whether: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>to go to the reunion </p></li>
<li><p>to meet up separately with some of these schoolmates, like at a restaurant. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>On one hand, he wants to see them and reconnect. I think he shall — he has no friends except me!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I get why he's grappling. Society, at least in Canada, finds his  job  very shameful and disrespected — it's <a href=""https://redd.it/8vaig5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">listed in this Reddit post</a> and we'd rather not say which.</p>

<p>I came across a <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/the-case-for-not-being-born"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The New Yorker</em> article</a> that feels similar. In our case, my husband is like Benatar, and his high school classmates like the reporter. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After finishing “The Human Predicament,” I wrote to Benatar to ask if we could meet. He readily agreed, then, after reading a few of my other pieces, followed up with a note. “I see that you aim to portray the person you interview, in addition to his or her work,” he wrote:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>One pertinent fact about me is that I am a very private person who would be mortified to be written about in the kind of detail I’ve seen in the other interviews. I would thus decline to answer questions I would find too personal. (I would be similarly uncomfortable with a photograph of me being used.) I understand entirely if you would rather not proceed with the interview under these circumstances. If, however, you would be happy to conduct an interview that recognized this aspect of me, I would be delighted.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Undoubtedly, Benatar is a private person by nature. But his anonymity also serves a purpose: it prevents readers from psychologizing him and attributing his views to depression, trauma, or some other aspect of his personality. He wants his arguments to be confronted in themselves. “Sometimes people ask, ‘Do you have children?’ ” he told me later. (He speaks calmly and evenly, in a South African accent.) “And I say, ‘I don’t see why that’s relevant. If I do, I’m a hypocrite—but my arguments could still be right.’ ” When he told me that he’s had anti-natalist views since he was “very young,” I asked how young. “A child,” he said, after a pause. He smiled uncomfortably. This was exactly the kind of personal question he preferred not to answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus I drafted the forewarning beneath that's obviously based on Benatar's, and recommended my husband to use it when he emails his schoolmates back, so that they can change their minds now if they don't want to meet, or be prepared for my husband's secretiveness if they still want to meet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd be happy to meet, but please note that I am a very private person who would be mortified to discuss subjects that ordinary people would discuss, like careers or education or finances. I would thus decline to answer questions I would find too personal. I would be similarly uncomfortable with a photograph of me being used, or being photographed. I understand entirely if you would rather not proceed with meeting under these circumstances. If, however, you would be happy to meet that recognized this aspect of me, I would be delighted.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But my husband finds this forewarning too kooky, unsociable, and unfriendly. </p>

<p>So, how could my husband forewarn a schoolmate that he will refuse to answer personal questions while not seeming like he is unsociable and unfriendly? </p>

"Neighbor is responsible for additional costs to construction of our house; how to convince them to pay?","<h1>Situation</h1>

<p>My girlfriend and I are in the process of building a house to start a family. We have hired a contractor that will arrange everything from start to finish to deliver a habitable house.</p>

<p>The lot we are building our house on is meant for two <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-detached"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">semi-detached</a> homes. Our neighbors finished building their home recently. During preparations for our house, our contractor discovered that the foundation placed underneath the common wall on our neighbors' lot is actually too wide and about 20 cm is placed on our lot (probably by mistake); it now blocks construction of foundations for our home. </p>

<p>That small part of our neighbors' foundation cannot be reused because each house needs to rest on its own foundation to allow both of them to move independently. Using this part of the foundation as part of the foundation for our house is simply not possible and cannot be presented as an answer.</p>

<p>Our contractor has proposed two solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove any of part of the foundation that is on our lot.</li>
<li>Move our home 20 cm and fill the gap with additional insulation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first solution will most likely damage the house of our neighbors and potentially lead to an unstable common wall. The second solution has no risk for any damage but reduces the valuable space on our lot by a small amount (though, certainly not negligible) and adds an additional cost to the construction of our home due to the additional insulation and exterior materials that are required.</p>

<p>We met our neighbors once before the incident and both parties clearly expressed the intent to have a friendly relationship for many years to come. Once our contractor explained the problem with the foundation, we contacted our neighbors and requested another meeting to discuss the solutions.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>The first solution could be enforced through court because we did not give permission to install the foundation of our neighbors' house on our property. However, letting the court resolve this issue will most likely take a few months to a few years. The relationship with our neighbors will be ruined (because their house will most likely be damaged) and we do not want to risk an unstable common wall.</p>

<p>We favor the second solution but obviously do not want to pay the additional cost to make it all happen. All in all, we would already voluntarily sacrifice valuable space on our lot to fix our neighbors' mistake.</p>

<p>We already briefly explained the situation and solutions to our neighbors over the phone but they immediately made it clear that they also have no intent of paying any additional cost because they simply do not have the funds to pay for it at this time.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>The additional cost is estimated to be 2400 euros. We could pay for it ourselves but obviously prefer spending it elsewhere. We also feel that paying this from our own pocket would hurt the relationship with our neighbors from our side for the coming years.</p>

<p>We are meeting our neighbors tomorrow.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the best course of action to get our neighbors to pay for the additional cost of moving our house as a result of their faulty foundations? During tomorrow's discussion, what arguments could we use that have the highest likelihood of persuading our neighbors to pay?</li>
<li>What general advice should we keep in mind when discussing this topic with our neighbors? Are there any big ""do's and dont's"" for situations like this?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>First of all, thanks for all comments and answers, they have most certainly be helpful to us!</p>

<p>We have met our neighbors and discussed the issue. We explained the problem as it has been presented to us by our contractor and stated the solution: removing the encroaching foundation that is on our property. We also stated that enforcing this solution is completely within our right because we are the owners of the property and did not grant permission for any such construction. Then we continued that the aforementioned solution entails a high risk of permanent damage to the house of our neighbors and that we were willing to accept a workaround that involved moving our house. We presented the cost estimation our contractor provided us and formally requested all costs be payed in full by our neighbors in case they chose this approach.</p>

<p>At the start of the conversation we emphasized that our aim is to find a solution that everybody is happy with and that others have forced us into resolving a difficult matter. Nobody at the table was to blame but everybody had the best interest in finding a solution that works well for all. Afterwards, we phrased our request quite formally just in case our neighbors would react badly to our proposed solutions.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, they reacted quite well and appreciated the fact we were so open and direct to them. They also emphasized they have our relationship as their primary interest because we will be living next door for many years to come. They have accepted our requests and will present it to the contractor responsible for the construction of their foundation.</p>

<p>In the meantime, our contractor already confirmed that their contractor has acknowledged the faulty foundations. It appears that they will resolve the issue themselves. Nevertheless, we have requested that all communication is also forwarded to our address so that we can keep up with how things are going.</p>

<p>For this outcome, I want to thank both answers that were posted before we had the meeting. One showed that a friendly tone is of utmost importance in discussions like this. The other also highlighted the fact that we should not tolerate grave mistakes and exercise our rights appropriately.</p>

"How do I recognize false praises?","<p><strong>Background</strong>: I am part of a club in my university which deals primarily in public speaking, debating, etc. It's been close to 6 months since I joined and to be fair, I haven't done quite well in debating tournaments.

However, my scores during these tournaments has only been average or in its neighborhood i.e. either slightly below average or slightly above average.

"Persuade community staff to be more lenient on unwritten ""rules"" about hot tub","<p>My wife, my children, and I arrived yesterday for a 2 week stay at a ""senior"" style 55+ Florida RV park with a hot tub. We are very well informed of the risks associated with children enjoying hot tubs and take the necessary steps to ensure the children are always supervised and safe when using the hot tub.</p>

<p>Today my wife was enjoying the hot tub with the children when a park employee informed her that it is illegal in Florida for children under the age of 18 to use a hot tub and that the kids must immediately exit.</p>

<p>I have researched and can find no such law, and in fact have found evidence that it may even be illegal to post signs enforcing such a rule (no such signs are posted here). I believe that the elderly park employee was either misinformed herself or may possibly have been guessing what the actual law is as a way for her to address her personal discomfort with seeing children use a hot tub.</p>

<p>As a parent it has been a regular occurrence for me to encounter individuals that believe that hot tubs on their own are inherently injurious to children without understanding that the risks of heat stroke and drowning are easily countered with simple safe practices, primarily involving direct adult supervision.</p>

<p>Since we will be here for 2 weeks and my children experience great joy from using hot tubs, I would like to persuade the park staff to not interfere with our parenting decision in this matter, but only if this effort has a decent probability of success and a very low likelihood of damaging our relationship with the park staff.</p>

<p>Some things I have going against me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being in my 30's I am much younger than the majority of staff and fellow residents in this ""retirement"" style RV community</li>
<li>Children are an uncommon sight in this community</li>
<li>Since I am here only a short time (2 weeks) the staff has little incentive to change their views to accommodate my family</li>
<li>The staff will likely be approached by other residents who express concerns about our children's safety and the staff may feel obligated to defend our parenting choices to other residents</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it likely I could persuade the staff to not interrupt my family's enjoyment of the hot tub? If so, what might be a kind, tactful, and respectful way of discussing this with the staff?</p>

"How to make aware co worker about their parking skills?","<p>I work in a MNC (Multi national company) in a populated city where having a car is necessary for transport purposes and daily commute.  </p>

<h2><strong>Question</strong></h2>

<p><strong>How can I tell/make aware a coworker (who is not in my team or department) about their parking skills?</strong></p>

<p>I have been working for this company for over couple of years. Parking is free where I work - courtesy of my workplace. However there are limited spaces, almost as many spaces as number of vehicles.
This co-worker of mine has terrible parking skills and uses 2 spaces everyday. </p>

<p>I have tried to illustrate the parking section where we are allowed to park.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mvd0.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5mvd0.jpg"" alt=""parking description of the issue""></a></p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong></p>

<p>My working hours are usually based on traffic and due to which I pop in late in mornings. Therefore most parking spaces are taken and only the slot next to my coworker's car is still free. However, because of their poor driving skills, there's not room enough for me to park (please see illustration below)</p>

<p>NB. this person is not disabled, I made sure of that.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gcq5B.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gcq5B.jpg"" alt=""Illustration of how said coworker park their car. It takes up two slots""></a></p>

<p>I have to circle twice to find a space or else park in section where someone has to ask me to move my car in case they want to leave (in front of the building).</p>

<p><strong>What I have tried so far</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I was having a light conversation with the receptionist downstairs once and I did mention to them about it, in case they can tell the car owner about it. I guess the receptionist wasn't aware of it as it's been a long time.</li>
<li>This person does not park do reverse park - Once or twice I tried reverse parking so close to his car's tail, as close as I can, so that he would struggle to take his car out and ask me to move my car (as described below). I'd have used that opportunity to talk him through nicely - hoping he'd understand.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXSGH.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXSGH.jpg"" alt=""OP&#39;s idea of reverse parking to prevent their coworker to leave without having to talk to them first""></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, his working hours seem to be longer than mine and I left early both times I tried this. Also this was a risky way, as there's a small chance of getting my car scratched.</p>

<p><strong>What I thought of doing but didn't</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Leave a note on the car</strong>. I have my reservations especially regarding this way: I personally find it rude to leave any note on any car. One might get aggressive and park in an even worse way.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Confront this person.</strong> We have shared places where all car registration numbers are shared amongst all employees. I know in which department this person works but never met him face to face. I do not usually get involved in such meters and I would want to use this as a last resort only.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How can I make aware my coworker that their way of parking prevents other people to use the slot next to theirs? I'd like to solve this issue in a non confrontational way.</p>

"How to prepare my girlfriend for the break-up?","<p><strong>Context:</strong></p>

<p>My girlfriend Alice and I have been together for the past 4 years, we're both 20 years old. I've recently decided to end our relationship for reasons related to some traits of her personality (e.g. anxious, lacking self-confidence, not quite lighthearted) and decreased physical attraction. But I can't do it right away because if I did, she would not be able to take her exams. Therefore I plan to tell her just a few days after them.</p>

<p>The thing is Alice suspects nothing at all. We have had contrasts but they've always been superficially temporary, as I try to be kind to her, even because she suffers from lack of self-esteem. In other words, she doesn't expect these problems are going to lead to a break-up. However, she irrationally fears it: despite me trying to push her to be more self-confident, she's always told me about being not enough for me, and that I shall leave her - even when I didn't want to. Relatedly, Alice has also often said that if I were to leave her, she wouldn't know how to live anymore, and even talked about suicide. I am pretty sure she won't do anything dangerous, but this is obviously not a healthy attitude from her - I've always tried to correct this, and even suggested to go to a doctor, but she always minimized, and after all <em>she has me</em>. I hope she'll have the courage to go after the break-up.</p>

<p>Also, Alice has an apartment way larger than mine, and we almost live together there. </p>

<p>Now, I still care for her, so I'm trying to find the best possible way. For example I definitely won't leave her alone before seeing her calm enough. Besides, I'll make sure her flatmate is at home when it happens, so that she can support Alice after I go, and anyway prevent her from hurting herself. </p>

<p>I will avoid telling her about what might be wrong with her, and focus on the fact that <em>I have changed</em>, and I need to recollect myself because my feelings for her are not as intense as before.</p>

<p><strong>Here's my question:</strong></p>

<p>If I were to prepare Alice through a longer period of time, how should I do it? It seems to me that stopping going to her apartment and remaining in a sort of limbo for days is in its own right, by contrast, something so big that might even worsen or elongate her suffering over all.</p>

<p>Also, I want to tell Alice that if she'll be willing, I will do whatever is in my power to help her get over this moment, and even stay friends with her when she does, if she wants to. How can I do so without running the risk of actually making it harder for her to go forward?</p>

"How to bond with my parents when I'm not especially open","<p>I'm in my mid twenties, recently graduated (2 years ago), single, living alone, and working professionally. I am not a very open person. I keep my personal life, professional life, family life, and friends-circle very separate from one another.</p>

<p>My parents have an empty nest now. I have four siblings, making there 5 children of my parents in total. I am one of only two that live nearby my parents. Occasionally, they like to drive over and visit with me, especially since I am one of the very few children they can easily physically meet up with.</p>

<p>I love the opportunity to spend time with my parents, at least in principle, and usually in practice. There is nothing overtly unhealthy about our relationship, they are very respectful parents and I believe I reciprocate that. Time doesn't stop for anyone, and after my grandparents passed away, I realized I don't want to take my parents for granted while I have them, or squander opportunities to bond with them while we share existence together. Therefore almost every time they ask if I'm open to them swinging by for dinner, I accept happily. The problem arises on these occasions, when we get together to bond and relate to one another. </p>

<p>The way this usually plays out, we pick a place to eat, and then eat and catch up. The problem I have is that I feel like I don't have a lot to share with them, or perhaps I don't have a lot I am willing to share with them. I can keep the conversation going for some time by querying and letting them share their lives, but when I come up with scraps in return, I think it is starting to stand out now, and it is a bit awkward. I can tell they are starting to notice it, but don't fully understand it yet, because they misunderstand. For example on the last occasion, my mom followed up the visit with an sms concerned that they chilled the conversation by offending me somehow (not the case, and I assured her so).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So what is it I'm asking?</strong></p>

<p>I don't know what 'the solution' looks like.. I don't know if there is something I should say, or a behavior I should change, or there's nothing that can be done, or even something else. So overall, it is difficult to distill this into a pointed question.. Whatever it is though, the following are what I am hoping to accomplish:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to be able to relate to my parents in a casual, fun, and relaxing way. I want to be able to bond with them regularly. </li>
<li><strong>I don't want to be the cause of any awkwardness or feelings of estrangement.</strong></li>
<li>I want to maintain the boundaries in my life (not at all costs, but just as a strong preference I have for some reason (I am not even certain why I am this way, I just am))</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What can I do?</strong></p>

<p>I think the concern about estrangement is key... I'm not looking for ways to <em>excuse</em> discussion of topics, or even excuse the obscurity. They don't ask pointed questions that I need to explicitly decline. They don't even know what they don't know.. All I think they really know by now is, I don't share a lot, I'm not very open, and there has clearly got to be more to my life than I volunteer to them. Some people may think that unreciprocated openness is a problem... ...and I can't decide. Our relationship has been fine <em>up to</em> this point, but if they truly start to suspect/realize they have a very small share of me, will they feel estranged? and will it weaken our relationship in their eyes (even though it has been the same and strong as ever in my own)? Is a relationship like this fair, or is it on unequal footing? Have I been in the wrong this way, or is this normal?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>People have requested I make this a little more concrete. To elaborate on some examples of dried up or dead conversation ends:</p>

<ul>
<li>My workplace is great, but the work itself is rather mundane. Work is normally a safe bet for getting a conversation off the ground among strangers, but among people I am close with, I personally just don't get any enjoyment or find any interest in going on about it. It feels to be a tedium and a drag, elaborated just for politeness.</li>
<li>In my personal time I have a number of hobbies. e.g. I game, I draw, I write... but circumstantially, each of these are either things they have an express lack of interest in (the particular games I play) or I am 100% not interested in sharing even the existence of (drawings, written works)</li>
<li>I spend time with friends and we have good fun doing things together, but again, circumstantially, the vast majority of this I'd rather maintain in a completely exclusive sphere from my parents. They do not know any of my friends, or what I do with them even if they did know them.</li>
<li>We occasionally talk about other family members during catch up, but this is kind of cheating because we all have contact with the family as much as one another, and it only serves as a (weakening) distraction from the fact I am not sharing about my own life.</li>
<li>It has occurred to me that maybe we should find some kind of activity to share instead of just a meal and conversation. We haven't talked about that in years, and it might be a viable route to reconsider, but at least the last time we considered it (years ago) we just couldn't think of anything we would all really enjoy together.</li>
<li>We have had very fun and engaging spiritual discussions before, in part because they are dedicated Christians and I fell very very much away from that. Over the years this has basically dried out though. Philosophically there is no further anyone is likely to be convinced. I have no spiritual life of my own to share. Occasionally they have an interesting bit of their own spiritual life to share, but again, it's one sided (them sharing, not me).</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this helps and I apologize for not including it in the original post.</p>

"When to cut the connection-maker out of a reply-all conversation?","<p>This has come up many times in my career and I've never felt sure what the right procedure is. If someone volunteers to connect me to someone over professional email, how much of the ensuing conversation should that person be copied on? Where that person is not likely interested in the following conversation nor able to contribute anything, do I copy them on the whole thing or is it polite to drop them from the discussion?</p>

<p>The conversation over email might go something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me (Todd):</strong> Hello Bob, can you help me with this thing?<br>
  <strong>Bob:</strong> No, but I know Gary who specializes in that.<br>
  <strong>Bob (to me and Gary):</strong> Hi Gary and Todd, I wanted to put the two of you in contact so you can collaborate on this thing.<br>
  <strong>Gary (reply-all):</strong> Hi Todd, sure, tell me about the issue<br>
  <strong>Me (reply-all?):</strong> <br>
  ....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point Bob is probably ignoring the conversation. I don't want to drag him through it but I also don't want to insult him or make him think I didn't follow up on the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>What is the professional etiquette around dropping Bob from the conversation?</strong></p>

"My wife has now decided she doesn't want have children, but I fear it's just because of mental illness (depression)","<p>37 y/o male. Wife (33 y/o) and I have been married for about 7 years. We fell in love deeply and quickly and were married within 2 years of when we started dating. We never really discussed having kids vs. not having kids until after we were married, but the understanding was kind of always that we would...or at least I thought that's what it was. </p>

<p>We moved several states away from where we grew up shortly after getting married. Now, years later after almost all our friends have a kid or kids, we still don't. That's of course fine in-and-of-itself, it's just to illustrate the point that with me pushing 40 and her at 33, the time is upon on. We <em>did</em> discuss having kids about a year ago - a very serious and formal discussion where we went out to a nice dinner and everything - and my wife came away from that saying should <strong>would</strong> have kids. Now, a year later, she has changed her mind because, turning 33 this year, she just ""thought she would want to by now, but still doesn't.""</p>

<p>Here's the thing: <strong>my wife suffers from serious depression.</strong> I of course try my absolute best to do everything I can for her, but sometimes it seems there's nothing I can do. I love my wife with 100% of my being....but I really want to be a dad and I always envisioned myself becoming one. I know I will deeply regret it later in life if I never become a father. I'm open to the idea of adopting a child, if that even helps her with the idea of parenthood, but I'm not sure if it would...we've yet to discuss that. </p>

<p>Because of my wife's depression:   </p>

<ul>
<li>She says she'd understand if I left her for another woman that want to have kids (I will not even consider this and it is insane to me)</li>
<li>Doesn't think she'd make a good mother (again, wholly illogical thought not rooted in reality)   </li>
<li>Has no clear vision or plans for the future. When I ask her what she wants to happen, ideally, she just says she doesn't know. </li>
</ul>

<p>Any feedback greatly appreciated. Thank you. </p>

<p>Edit: I suppose I'm just asking ""what would you do in my situation?"" I guess it sounds selfish, but I want to try and convince my wife to have kids...so if I had to have a single question, it would just be:  </p>

<p><strong>How can I convince my wife to stop listening to her depression and be open to the idea of having children?</strong>  </p>

<p>That's what is really bothering me - that she seems to be letting her depression make this decision for her, and I KNOW for certain she would be so, so happy if we became parents!! I know my wife.  </p>

"Declining helping with a (personal) project","<p>I'm into web development and due to my work situation I had a lot of free time on my hands. I had been helping people with their personal projects on a volunteer basis.</p>

<p>I recently got a full time job (and I may still need to work my old one part time, temporarily) and I'm not sure I'll have much time. Furthermore, I know some people asking for my help can sort of not really know what they want (for example someone just asked me for help with SEO and now wants to meet for coffee to give me the details and frankly I get the impression he might not even know what SEO is). </p>

<p>How can I politely decline such requests? How can I gauge what the person wants if there not very technical and might not understand what they are talking about? How can I make it clear I may have to abandon the project at any point? </p>

<p>I'm volunteering with another group and offered to update their website. This seems to have been a misunderstanding because to them update means add totally new features when I meant simply update text and pictures. They have trouble understanding sometimes complex CSS is required to get overlapping pictures that can resize to any screen etc.</p>

<p>All these people I care a lot about and don't want to go back on my word/offer.</p>
"
"How do I avoid academically 'shaming' a fellow student/friend?","<p>At school, my friend (let's call him Ivan) is quite intelligent. He's in enrichment classes, gets A to A+ grades and is very conscientious.</p>

<p>At the risk of sounding narcissistic, I am objectively one of the best performing students at my school/country (through national test results, etc.) and as a result often find my day-school subjects easy, but monotonous.
Before I continue, it might be important that my classes are held on a periodic basis. With a number of periods in a day, each period of my timetable refers to a specific class in a specific classroom. However, some of the classes (usually due to teachers, not content) are overwhelmingly viewed as wastes of time. I won't name these but as an example, such a class might consist of us discussing unrelated topics and not covering content up to an appropriate curriculum standard.</p>

<p>As a result, I often haphazardly approach schoolwork and classroom behavior. When I feel that a certain class is wasting my time (e.g. other students refuse to listen to the teacher -> stern talks, we have an incompetent substitute teacher) I usually dedicate that time to other things. As of recently, I've been dedicating that time to olympiad mathematics, and studying things like inequalities and functional equations seems more relevant to my overall learning then spending 50 minutes in a class not learning anything.</p>

<p>I'm certain that the class is a waste of time / counterproductive. I'm not sure whether dedicating time to 'being efficient' / actually learning useful information is the right course of action, but that's another question.</p>

<hr>

<p>In one particular class I'm in with Ivan (literature), I find the coursework and discussion relatively shallow. However, I enjoy the class, but because I find it so easy I usually do not put as much effort into, say, essay-writing and note-taking as someone like Ivan. Despite this, I always get better grades than him. Again, <strong>please understand</strong> that this isn't me trying to show-off - I just want to adequately contextualize the problem.</p>

<p>Ivan's noticed this and recently confronted (no negative connotation) me about this. He told me that it often annoyed him that he would put so much effort into rewriting and perfecting his literary analyses/etc. yet it seems like I write them half-heartedly and still manage to write excellent essays regardless. I fully sympathize with him - since there are still people above me and I once felt the same way about a particular person. But in my case, this just pushed me to try harder - and while I never reached the level I desired, it satisfied me that I had turned some sort of jealousy into a productive mindset. However, I'm not sure how to react to Ivan's confession. We share other classes as well, such as mathematics.</p>

<p>One thing I could do is to artifically degrade the quality of my work. This doesn't seem reasonable.</p>

<p>Another thing I could do is to encourage Ivan to act the same way I did - to manifest his jealously for my standards as a motivation for him. But to me, this comes across as pretentious - and given Ivan's already trying extremely hard, I'm not sure how well received this could be.</p>

<p>The third option is to stop being so easy-going about the course. I find the course easy (but enjoyable), but I wouldn't want to (superficially?) work harder than I need to. While I could write even better essays and be more proud of my work, I choose to dedicate that time to studying Olympiad mathematics instead, which I believe is more satisfying for me.</p>

<p>The fourth option (and the final one I can think of) is to ignore the situation - I shouldn't care what he thinks of my performance, right? The problem is, I'm relatively good friends with him and I want to, at the very least, maintain that friendship.</p>

<p>So my question is: what is a feasible solution that addresses Ivan's confession without compromising our friendship?</p>

"How do I keep in touch with a friend without spending long amounts of time with him?","<p>So I became friends with this guy in college about a year ago. He's not a very social person - I don't know any of his other friends, he doesn't share personal information easily, and is barely on talking terms with any of my friends (even though we all lived together in a dorm for 2 years). I do like spending time with him - he's very smart, and a good guy, but he's also a little too ... intense to spend too much time around.</p>

<p>Ideally, I would see him for 1-2 hours a week, spread out, and we'd get to hang out in small amounts. The way it happens is that I'll see him for about 4-5 hours at a stretch every three weeks or so, often late at night, when I'm tired (this could also be part of why I don't like spending too much time with him)</p>

<p>I haven't felt too guilty about getting him out of my room so I can sleep/work so far, because we lived in the same dorm. However, I'll be off campus next semester and I'd feel bad about dragging him out there for just an hour or two. </p>

<p>I invited him to someone's birthday party once - he showed up, spoke only to me, ate some cake, and left. I didn't see him wish the birthday girl. I doubt he'd be comfortable at parties.</p>

<p>I can't really say 'let's go get coffee somewhere' because that sounds too much like a date, and I won't be eating in the cafeteria too often since I'll be cooking. He also isn't on any social media and only uses normal text, which is something I barely use and often forget to check/respond to. So far his texts to me have been super short. He isn't big on small talk (""How did your exam go?"" ""We'll see when it's graded, won't we?""; ""What's up?"" ""A bomb went off in a church in Sri Lanka""). My roommate is actually convinced he has a crush on me since those examples are wayyy more information than he gives anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>How can I continue to hang out with him without those hang outs extending past 3 or 4 hours?</strong> I'm sure that if he comes to my apartment he'd spend a lot of time there. I'm not sure that I'd be very comfortable with going to his room.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatively, how can I enforce a time limit on his visits without being mean or rude about it?</strong></p>

<p>I also have a wife and three kids. I am not like him. I only spend when I see there is a need for it; like when it's been a long time since we last ate out, so we should splurge a bit and go out. I have pretty good savings and herein lies the problem. </p>

<p>My brother is not doing any savings and when I guide him to save money of his own, he simply says:</p>

"How to get to know people who don’t respond to greetings the way I would expect them to","<p>Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question, but here we go. In my college I like talking to people and making connections. I think I am an extrovert. Sometimes when I talk with other students I like to say “hey, how are you?” with a big smile. A lot of people just respond with a smile and they don’t reply back. Yesterday I asked two people how their vacations went, they barely said anything and just smiled a little bit. They didn’t ask me how my vacations went. </p>

We go to the same classes and we sit almost next to each other, we know each other's names and have said exchanged greetings like 'hi' a few times. I don’t hang out with them outside of class.

"How to adjust to a new country and its culture when people make you feel like an outsider","<p>I'll be honest here, I've had a weird childhood. I was born to a German mother and an Indian father. I have a German citizenship, but as I moved to India when I was 2, I know the Indian culture much better than any other. I basically grew up learning to fit in with Indians. Recently my mom and I moved to the USA. From what I'd heard about from my Indian and German cousins and extended family, the culture of the US was very accepting towards other cultures, and was a global culture, unlike any other.</p>

<p>However, after living here in the US for a few months, I didn't find it to be anything like what my family had described it. Everything I'd learned up until now from my Indian and German culture is completely different from what I've experienced so far.</p>

<p>My classmates do the same things that I love doing; like playing EDM, skating at the rink, chatting on Instagram, etc. Yet, they don't talk to me in class, even when I try approaching them, or they sarcastically make fun of me and  seclude me from the conversation.</p>

It often happens with non-technical coworkers that misunderstood something technical, but can also happen in a situation between friends.</p>

<p>I think it would be easiest to take the example of the workplace.se question:</p>

He is disappointed there is no new dad's room as newborn baby life is just as hard for dads as it is for moms.

The company needs to be more mindful of equality, so a new dad's room needs to be made too, so dads can unwind or have a power nap too.</p>

<p>I understand they are just trying to be nice, but this happens for <em>every conversation</em> with them, constantly. Sometimes even multiple times a day. These responses aren't instant, either, so there have been multiple times where it takes 15-20 minutes for them to even get to the point where they tell me what it is they want to tell or ask me. I find this to be extremely frustrating, and it causes me to dread a message from them. It means my next 20 minutes are going to be spent getting interrupted every few moments to answer small talk. When I'm focusing on something, this is extremely annoying.</p>

<p>Nobody else I know does this. Every other person will say something like ""Hey <em>name</em>, can you do <em>thing</em>?"" or if they insist on being ""nice"", will be something like ""Hi <em>name</em>, I hope the day is going well for you. Just checking to see if you'd like to do <em>thing</em> later."" This is much more natural and quick for both of us. They get the message across, they still get to be ""nice"", and I only get one notification so I'm free to answer it and get back to focusing.</p>

"How do I approach my date about texting less?","<p>I’m going on a first date tomorrow with a guy I matched with on a dating app a few days ago. In these past three days, I found him texting a bit more than I’m used to and it has caused some concerns for me.</p>

<p>My question is how should I tell him  that I prefer to text less without hurting his feelings on the first date?  </p>

<p>My expectation:
Since we have set a date to meet, let’s just text to figure out the logistics. Maybe check in the night before or the morning on the day of. </p>

<p>His behavior:
He would text me three, four times a day every day and seemed to expect more than just checking in. </p>

<p>Example: 
Today he started a trip and texted me to figure out when and where to meet. After we agreed to meet tomorrow somewhere, I thought the conversation was over. However, in the next 2 hrs, 5 hrs and 10hrs, he texted me again sharing pictures of his trip and asked me how my day went. I replied and he followed up with more questions. I felt a bit obliged and tired. </p>

<p>My concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I do not think I can do this every day. I’m not a person who’s always on the phone. My work is busy; When I’m free I like to engage in fun activities or enjoy some me-time. (See my expectation as above) </p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible that we have different needs for personal space? For me texting that much is something I’d probably only do with my boyfriend, where there is naturally a lot to share and communicate on a daily basis. But with a guy I just met, I’d expect to interact mostly just on the dates we’d go. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some context if it matters:
- We are both in our early 30s. I am and he seems too to be looking for a serious relationship. </p>

<p>TL; DR: matched a guy on a dating app. He texted a lot, I didn’t like it. How to communicate that on our first date? </p>

"How to reconnect with my unresponsive childhood friend?","<p>Growing up in a small town, I had one friend throughout my school years - we shared interests outside of the norm as well as certain difficult aspects of our family life, and even after we parted ways for further education (her going to a different country, across water) we somewhat kept in touch. That is to say, we didn't exchange messages much at all, but any time she was home (summer holidays and over Christmas most notably) we would meet and catch up.</p>

<p>During this time, a year after we finished school, she told me that she was diagnosed with a condition. To my knowledge, it is mostly incurable but is treatable, and can cause depression and low energy. I can't say for sure if this actually has any importance but I feel it might.</p>

I swiftly let her know it was an opportunity via text, and she seemed as enthusiastic as I was.</p>

<p>The weekend I moved, we met up. Regrettably, I arrived an hour late to our rendezvous, and I worry that rubbed her the wrong way; additionally, I think the meeting ended on something of a sad note. I may be remembering it worse than it is, but I definitely came away from the meeting feeling quite morose.</p>

<p>We haven't met since then, which is nearly a year ago now. Depression hit once again, and only exacerbated my inability to initiate conversations. As such, the messages we exchanged were extremely sparse - maybe one ""How are you doing?"" a month, which either went ignored on her end, or led to a few basic texts catching up, maybe once a season.</p>

<p>This didn't strike me as an issue until recently, when she indicated she'd like to meet up at the end of August in a text at the end of June. When the end of August came, I texted with another ""How's it going?"" and got no reply. Around a week later (a week ago now, start of September) I followed up saying that I hoped she was okay and that I'd love to meet up with her when she was free, and again heard nothing.</p>

<p>In general, I've not been very popular, or good at making friends, so I treasure the ones I do have - I may just not be very good at showing it, due to my insecurities. She's one of the few genuine friends I've ever connected with, that felt more than just a ""friendship of convenience"" as I've become accustomed to.</p>

<p>Is there anything more I can say/do to try to re-engage her? Or is this her way of cutting herself off from me, having found better friends? It's the living in limbo that's really hurting me - if I knew I could process and start to recover, but for now I'm clueless and hopeful. I've been considering actually calling her instead to more proactively engage her, but it's out of the ordinary for me, and I'd worry that it'd be rude to do it without warning like that.</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, but I wanted to give as much detail as possible! Am new here as well, so if I've done anything wrong, please let me know.</p>

<p>TL;DR - With depression as a possible factor on both sides, and after having texted occasionally with little response, how do I proactively rekindle a waning friendship?</p>

"How can I ask my friend to... well, be friendlier in the gentlest possible way?","<p>My friend and I have been friends for many years. We've traveled together, grown up together (since our early twenties) and her family and I are close. It's important to me to maintain this friendship - I love her, and we've been through a lot of ups and downs and supported each other through rough times and celebrated good times. She and I don't live in the same city, but we talk on phone frequently and visit/travel together at least 3 times a year. </p>

<p>I've noticed that lately, when we hang out, she sometimes acts unfriendly. She can be blunt to the point of hurtful with people she's close with (myself and her family). This seems to be ""normal"" with her family (at least, her parents have never expressed surprise or hurt when she has been what I consider ""rude""), but it's not ok with me. Last year after a particularly rude comment I took some time to calm down and told her that I didn't appreciate the way she was talking to me. It was hard but we had a good conversation and she apologized.</p>

<p>Problem is, she can sometimes still be curt, rude, and disrespectful in her tone. It's just a general lack of softening her words... for example, she interrupts me and doesn't always consider my point of view when making decisions. It gets to the point where I feel that I am ""walking on eggshells"" and I'm not even sure (from her tone) if she likes me - but then I think, this is crazy - we're such good friends! Have you ever hung out with someone who is ""hangry""? It's kind of like that.</p>

<p>She mentioned to me once that she had to practice ""softening"" her approach with colleagues because her manager spoke to her about her coworkers being ""afraid"" of her.</p>

<p><strong>How do I tell her I need that softened approach, too - without putting our friendship on the line?</strong> I need her to know I value her friendship, but that her behaviour seems to indicate that she doesn't like me, or that she doesn't value my opinion. I know she <em>can</em> be friendly on a consistent basis - I see it when she interacts with people she's not as comfortable with! </p>

<p>Particularly, I am struggling to find ways to use ""I"" statements when what I want to say is, ""You can be rude and disrespectful. I don't appreciate being interrupted. When we are traveling I need you to consider my point of view, even if it is 'less convenient' than making your own mind up"". How can I say, gently,  ""you're not friendly with me sometimes and it hurts""? </p>

"How to respond to someone strongly resisting a specific app for group communication?","<p>I'm in a college video game design course with a strong emphasis on group work. I'm highly invested in the outcome (I'd like to use the final game for a portfolio, if possible) so I decided to create a Discord server the day after the group was assigned, just to show some excitement and get things rolling.</p>

<p>Note that I'm not the assigned team leader so I tried to do this without stepping on anyone's toes. The rest of the team - save one - has joined the server, so I assume it went over well enough.</p>

<p>That one teammate has strongly resisted joining. At first, they said that Discord was not accessible to them because their phone was too full to install another app. That struck me as a bit of a flimsy excuse, but I took it at face value and suggested they use the website or desktop version of Discord instead, since the majority of the team had already joined the server.</p>

<p>They had also suggested a group text or Facebook as an alternative - I responded that Discord is probably a better tool than group text, but I avoided mentioning Facebook. That's another issue entirely - I don't support Facebook as a company, but I didn't want to bring that up and come off as feeling morally superior. I definitely do not judge anyone for using Facebook, and in fact I still have an account, but I avoid using it as much as possible. I feel strongly about this.</p>

<p>They responded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yeah I know it’s available on PC. But to be real with you I don’t use discord on a daily basis if not ever. It’s gonna be difficult to use this as means of communication since it’s not very accessible for me. </p>
  
  <p>I know discord has voice functions but that’s something available in other applications. And that’s why I proposed Facebook. </p>
  
  <p>I don’t really know how to contact the others in the team so I guess it’ll be easiest to get together before or after class next week and just discuss. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm conflicted here. On the one hand, I feel like they might have deeper issues with Discord that they aren't bringing up, and I'd like to respect that, if possible. </p>

<p>On the other hand, this response comes off as kind of combative to me, and it's hard not to feel like they're avoiding Discord out of laziness and slighting me in the process. I have reason to believe that English may not be their first language, but I haven't spoken to them in person.</p>

<p>This is admittedly pretty minor, but I feel like if this becomes a pattern in the group dynamic then we're going to run into trouble for the rest of the semester. If they can't make a minor sacrifice like this, will they be able to compromise on later decisions? I'm also worried about whether this says the same about me.</p>

<p>I don't really see a resolution, given the facts I know, that isn't me using Facebook or them using Discord (I certainly don't expect them to use another service given their reasons for avoiding Discord, although I would be willing). I'd love to find another solution, though.</p>

<p>What's a polite way to respond here? How can I approach this in general? It would be nice to resolve this over email before we meet in person, but I would understand if that isn't feasible.</p>

"How to handle people stressing me by standing too close in a line (and other similar circumstances)?","<h2>People standing too close</h2>

<p>In the lunch buffet room, I'm putting the food from the container on my plate, then scootch a step to the side, put some potatoes or whatever, then scootch again, etc. Right behind me, there's a person who stands rather close to me and moves immediately after my move. I'd describe it as <em>pushing air in my ass</em>, if you get the sense. Of course they're not physically pushing me, although the our elbows will on occasion bump into each other, and I need to think twice about how to turn around when lifting my tray (once I accidentally hit their hand and the food went all over the floor and on the person as well).</p>

<p>I've tried to handle it by asking the person if they could back off a bit so I could have the space. Probably a bad idea. Their hurry, enforced by my stress, is likely to perceive such a request as impolite and assaulting.</p>

<p>I've tried to move out of the way and ask the person to go ahead of me, (possibly pointing out that I recognize their hurry). Not well functioning either. Apparently, it risks to be taken as a sarcastic poke and the response is an agitated ""<em>what?! what?!</em>"" followed by an angry look and even more stressful waving me in to hurry up.</p>

<h2>Embarking and disembarking the elevator</h2>

<p>A similar issue at that office is people who <em>lean into</em> the elevator before others can disembark. Sometimes, I carry a cup of coffee.  My knee has been operated and I have rather poor balance, so in this circumstance, I try to wait a few seconds for the person to back out of the doorway and let me off the elevator  so I won't have go sideways. When that doesn't work, I back into the elevator and let the person/people (aka the wave) come in to the elevator. Then I go up and down like an idiot until I have a chance of getting out.</p>

<p>Sadly, that approach has also been aggravating to <em>the wave</em> and last week someone reprimanded me on the fact that I shouldn't have stayed in the elevator (the person realized that they kind of forced me to back in, and probably felt a bit stupid about it). The way I felt was that if I don't push my way back (causing annoyance) I will still fail by simply being modest (causing irritation).</p>

<p>What would be a good approach to improve some of the approaches mentioned above? Or, even better, what would be a alternative ways of handling them?</p>

<p>Note that I'm a large guy who's easily perceived as a threat or at least a physically substantial person (187cm, 115kg= 6'2"", 250lbs).</p>

"How can I drop out of a band without offending the band leader?","<p>Recently, I reconnected with 'Jake', an friend of mine from high-school, and he mentioned that he was starting up a new band. I told him that sounds really fun, and that I would check it out. I was under the impression that he had a band already formed and playing together, and they wanted to me to check them out to see if I would be a good fit for them. Instead, it turns out they have never played together, don't know each other, and immediately assumed I was 100% on board with joining before they had met me.</p>

<p>I just attended the first practice with them for the first time earlier this week, and to be honest, it was a rather painful experience. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most of the band members do not know each other, and have never played with each other before.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the band members do have have very much musical experience.</p></li>
<li><p>Jake has very little talent, but is overconfident about his abilities and plays with way too much energy. Since he doesn't play or sing very well, he just wails on the guitar and screams in the mic.</p></li>
<li><p>The practice was very disorganized. No one really stepped forward to lead the band. I would have expected Jake to, since he was the one organizing it, but rather than keeping people focused, he was just playing really loud and shrill guitar parts over people talking.</p></li>
<li><p>In my opinion, most of the music we played together was very sloppy and sounded bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Jake has a very loud and domineering personality. To the point where he will shut down other conversations without realizing it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I feel like if I continued playing with this band, I'd spend most of my time teaching Jake guitar parts, and trying to get other people on the same page about what were doing. And since I dislike the sound we make, I don't know if that would be worth it to me. Also, the way he talked about writing music together and playing local gigs and things like that made me realize that he is waaaay more passionate about this group then I will ever be. I think I would be a detriment to them when they have these expectations of the band going places and I cannot possibly be excited about playing with Jake.</p>

<p>I did however get along with the rest of the band fairly well. I could even see myself playing with the drummer in the future in a different context. But I have no desire to be in this band. Unfortunately, because of not starting out on the same page, they are all under the assumption that I'm fully on board with the band, when in my mind I was just checking it out to see if it would be a good relational and musical fit.</p>

<p>So I need to tell Jake (and the other members) that I am not going to be a part of this band, but I really don't know how to say this in a tactful way. Especially because in the end it comes down to: ""You sound bad and I don't get along with you"". (Not that I dislike Jake, I just find the way he does music very abrasive) I'm also concerned</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it might come across as too soon to leave them after only playing with them one time. And</p></li>
<li><p>The other band members might feel hurt that I don't want to play with them because of issues I have with Jake, not them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I have a few different questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How can I tell Jake that I don't want to play with them without hurting their feelings? I can beat around the bush, and say things like ""I'd rather focus on my other music"" or ""I'm busy with school"", which are both true, but aren't really the honest reason I don't want to play with them. I'm concerned he might come back with ""Oh that's fine. You want to play with us this summer when those aren't issues?"" or something like that if I don't give the honest reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Should I be more honest with the other band members than Jake? I'd like to let them know that I enjoyed playing with them, and that Jake is the bigger issue. But I'm concerned that being too honest with them would feel like insulting Jake behind his back.</p></li>
</ul>

"Should I have gotten up for my sister?","<p>Me and my sister have a relationship that goes up and down, sometimes we can go through one door and sometimes definitely not....</p>

<p>Right now its somewhere in the middle mostly because we don't see each other all the time any more, not a bad thing per say.</p>

<p>Now this morning I woke up and went downstairs to get some breakfast. I was following some program on the TV. The seat of my sister was closest to the TV and without any evil thoughts I thought I could sit there too (see was not downstairs).</p>

<p>So I  sat down and ate my breakfast while watching a series. Halfway through my meal, my sister comes down and asks me to get up and move to another place. My response was: let me finish my breakfast then I will move, right now I am following this program (was in the middle of something exciting). After she prepared her breakfast she basically demanded me to move as response I just stayed at her place and like I said before first finish my breakfast. Well from there we just got into a fight which is not that interesting. </p>

<p>My question is: Was I unreasonable? Should I have gotten up?</p>

<p>As I said the relationship is not all the time that  good, but this time I was not trying to bother her in any way. For a change she could have just taken another seat. We were literally talking about 5 min. It sounds pretty childish what we fight about, but every now and then this happens. So I am just curious. Any other suggestions are welcome.  </p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>The house is of my parents. I live on my own since half a year. She still lives at home. I am from the Netherlands (if that helps). We kind of sit at the same seat all the time. Its an unwritten rule. So in short there are 6 seats at the table. All of them are ""assigned"" to someone. Though this something that is never really told out loud. It grew that way. She is not owning the seat in any way or bought it like that. My parents did. Interaction in the house is mostly very direct.</p>

"Bad work results from voluntary co-worker","<p>I am currently working on a voluntary translation project for a game. We're working in a team of ~5 people per language (3 active translators in our case) in a Smartcat project. However, one of the translators (also, the one that does most of the translating) tends to deliver very poor quality results, i.e. bad grammar, missing punctuation etc., so that I need to go over most of his translations again to fix these errors.</p>

<p>My question here is: what would be the best way to communicate he might not be the best fit for the job without it coming across as insulting? And should I rather start talking to him or the project coordinator?</p>

<p>I know it's a voluntary job without pay and we can't expect the best quality, however it is still the official translation for the game and it's a game I care deeply about and I want the quality to be as high as possible.</p>

"How to keep my relationship with my mother intact after moving across country","<p>I debated back and forth for asking for advice because I feel like it's not a good enough issue and that this is pointless, but I'm going to try anyway.</p>

<p><b>Some background:</b> My mom does not like my partner of three years. She believes he has mental issues and not good enough for me.

I'm not as prepared as I could be, but I am definitely not going to end up homeless.</p>

My mother works on that day and can't get someone else to cover for her. She is livid that I would move out on a day that she would not be home.

"How can I have a relationship with my mother when I stand in moral opposition to what she believes?","<p>I have spoken to my mother once in the past 8 months. She has done things which were disrespectful to my fiancee and her family, and she holds views which I feel are morally reprehensible. I want to be able to have a relationship with my mother, but I also want to stand up to the things that she says and does which I feel are wrong. I don't know how to balance these things.</p>

<p>How can I have a relationship with my mother when I stand in moral opposition to what she believes?</p>

<h1>Details</h1>

<p>I'll try to divide this into a few sections, but it is mostly chronological.</p>

<h2>Boundaries</h2>

<p>My mother and I have had a complicated relationship. I moved home after college and started a master's program nearby. At that time I lived in her house and drove her car, she was supporting me. We did a lot of things together, including regularly rock climbing, going out to breweries and trying different foods. My parents are divorced (my dad cheated), and I feel that my mother came to treat me as a sort of partner, fulfilling that sort of emotional role in her life. Although to external observers, our relationship looked good (I would often get comments about how cool she was or that it we seemed to have a great relationship), there were issues of boundaries and communication. I wound up being essentially her chauffeur because she didn't renew her driver's license (no one understands why ultimately). My mother has a very dominant personality and I do not. I avoid confrontation. Many of these boundary issues were therefore my own fault for not dealing with them sooner.</p>

<h2>My relationship</h2>

<p>In 2016 I started dating a Muslim girl, and my mom treated her and her family rather suspiciously. Nothing extremely overt initially, but she started expressing occasionally her dislike of Islam, that she thinks Muhammad was a pedophile, that she thinks that halal slaughter is inhumane, that Muslim women who wear the headscarf are oppressed. I had been pretty much single for my entire life up to then, I had not had any serious relationships. My mother would call while we were on dates, or be constantly texting me to get my attention, she would get angry that I was coming home late or not informing her of where I was or what I was doing, she referred to my then-girlfriend as ""that girl"". She can be quite passive aggressive as well, not directly communicating what she is feeling. </p>

<h2>Racism</h2>

<p>My mother over the past few years has become more and more right-leaning conservative. While she used to be relatively centrist politically, being pretty socially liberal while being economically conservative, in the past few years her politics have veered decidedly towards the racist (she is white). In the past years I have heard her say things such as Black Lives Matter is an anti-white hate group or that Michelle Obama is racist against white people. She is strongly against any sort of affirmative action types of programs which benefit minorities because she feels that this means treating them ""differently"" than white people. Roughly speaking, she thinks that racism only means the in-your-face blatant racism, and doesn't believe that there is such thing as systemic racism, she thinks that minorities who speak out about racism are complainers who want to be treated different than everyone else, etc. When the movie ""Hidden Figures"" came out, she lamented (without having seen it) ""I'm so tired of all these white guilt movies.""</p>

<h2>Islam and Donald Trump</h2>

<p>I decided to convert to Islam in January 2017. I have been spiritual and religious for many years although no one in my family is and I never discuss it with them. I felt attracted to the path and I decided to convert. This didn't cause any major changes in my life at that time, my religion and spirituality are very personal and I don't share them with others much or discuss them openly. So it's not like I changed at all who I was around my mom or how I acted. However around this same time, my girlfriend discovered that my mom was on Twitter, and she was posting as much as ten times a day all sorts of Islamophobic, anti-Islam, anti-Sharia law, anti-hijab, etc etc sorts of things. She also started posting more anti-immigrant things and around this time came out in strong support of then-candidate Donald Trump. I personally strongly oppose Trump and everything he stands for, I have a very humanitarian view of politics, I identify as a ""radical"" leftist (I voted for Bernie but I am much more left than his platform, I am anti-war, I strongly criticize the US for its military and clandestine actions which have led to the deaths of millions of people around the world, I am anti-Capitalist, anti-Imperialist, and anti-Colonialist, I am not exactly a Marxist but I agree with Marx's assessment of capitalism, I'm a big fan of Noam Chomsky, etc etc).</p>

<h2>Confrontation and moving out</h2>

<p>Shortly after discovering my mom's Twitter, I confronted her about it, she defended herself, and I moved out. She accused me of abandoning her. We hardly spoke. I got engaged. My mom had always refused to meet my fiancee's parents, who are rather socially conservative Muslims who do not support dating before marriage etc (they don't know that we were dating but my mom of course did, my mom didn't like this because ""this is America and in America we date and they need to assimilate to our culture."" Not in those exact words but that was the gist of it), but about six months after moving out, last September, my mom called my fiancee's mother (having never spoken before) and apparently went on a tirade about how I was abandoning her, accusing my fiancee of stealing me from her, and various other things. I sent my mother an email outlining how I felt about what she had done and I stopped talking to her. </p>

<h2>Last contact, failure to address the issues</h2>

<p>I called my mother about two or three months ago simply to ask her whether or not she supported my fiancee and I. She picked up the phone and immediately started talking as if everything were fine and we had just spoken the day before, when we hadn't spoken for six months and the last thing she had said in reply to my email was not to contact her. I was quiet, and after she was done I said very calmly but directly that I had just called to ask her if she supported us getting married. She said, very seriously then, that she never had any problem with my fiancee but she doesn't support ""the way you treat your family"". My relationship to the rest of my family has not substantially changed, so really she means the way that I treated her. I said okay and then she immediately went back to being pleasant and started asking about something else. I told her I had to go and she got angry and hung up on me. Her behavior clearly indicates she does not want to confront the problems and wants to ignore them.</p>

<h2>Present Day</h2>

<p>Now to the present day. My family wants me to make up with my mom. They say I should just put politics aside, we should accept our differences, but we're family and need to have a relationship. They want me to just make things right, and none of them have pushed back against my mother in this, they all excuse her actions and no one has called her out for any of it, which is why I moved out in the first place. I couldn't support what she was saying online or how she treated my fiancee and her family. She has since made a new Twitter account and as far as I can tell she is even more of a Trump supporter than before, she repeats everything he and his administration say pretty much, calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt, praising the withdrawal from the Iran deal, pushing for the removal of illegal immigrants, etc. She shares memes which compare Trump to Obama and praise Trump for undoing Obama's legacy. I have even seen her make fun of trans people, which was shocking to me. The particularly sad thing is that my mother is a very well-educated person who has an extensive library and is very well read. Yet she does not critically examine any of the things she is saying or even bother checking whether they are even true. I accept people can be Donald Trump supporters, I recognize that many people disagree with me and that's fine. But what my mother is supporting goes beyond just Trump. She has become more and more nationalist, xenophobic, and racist.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is all very disheartening to me. I stand against everything she stands for. I am diametrically opposed to her political position. But this is also about more than politics. I am not willing to just ignore our differences on political opinions, because I believe that she is supporting racism, bigotry, and oppression of minorities. I believe she is supporting an administration which is causing the deaths of innocent civilians overseas, which is likely pushing the world towards war with Iran, which supports Israel despite the plight of the Palestinian people, which refuels Saudi bombers as they commit what amounts to genocide in Yemen, and more. To me this is a matter of morality. And more than just those things, I feel she was disrespectful to my fiancee and her family, and I want her to apologize for the things she did and said. I want to be able to have a relationship with her but I also want to stand against what she stands for, and I don't know how to do both. Today is mother's day, I am thinking that I should call her. I also want to meet with her in the coming weeks as I am heading back to my home state, and I want us to meet together with a counselor because I don't feel comfortable having a one-on-one conversation with her.</p>

<p><strong>How can I have a relationship with my mother when I stand in moral opposition to what she believes, and how do I approach a conversation with her given how she has behaved in the past?</strong></p>

"How to tell a friend I won't pay them for a favor they did for me?","<p>I recently received, out of the blue, a text message from a friend which very much surprised me.</p>

<p>In the message, my friend mentions that I borrowed her Netflix account for about a month (she said she calculated this from going back and looking at her browsing history in Netflix) and as a result, wishes me to pay for half the cost of a month of Netflix, or about $10.</p>

<p>I do not feel I owe this person anything. First, there was no mention of payment at the time I borrowed their Netflix. Second, around the time this happened, I was helping her a lot with various computer problems she was having. Third, this happened about 4 to 5 months ago. Fourth, she could and was using Netflix at the time. Whether I used it or not would not affect her bill.</p>

<p>She is asking me to meet me tomorrow to collect payment as she will return to her home country after that. How can I tell her I will not be paying her? We have friends in common so ideally I would like to do so gently.</p>

<p>Some things I've thought of telling her:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tell her I will pay her after she pays me for the tech support time I've spent with her (maybe this will make her realize how ridiculous her request is)</p></li>
<li><p>Ask her a series of questions to hopefully make her discover that her request is ridiculous (ie: ""Was payment mentioned at the time?"" etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Tell her I am busy and will not be able to meet her (which could backfire if she asks me to send the money to her local bank account or give the money to one of her friends)</p></li>

"Is it a bad idea to tell people that I could be a manipulative jerk if I wanted to?","<p>Without going to much into my personal psyche, here are some things I know:</p>

<ul>
<li>People can be manipulated relatively easily (1)</li>
<li>I know where I can learn to do exactly that (2)</li>
<li>I choose not to for moral reasons: I'm a firm believer that I should convince people with arguments and appeal to their ability to reason logically</li>
</ul>

<p>I often think of imaginary dialogue situations and I thought of bringing up something like <strong>""I <em>could</em> manipulate <em>you</em> to do what I want, but instead I'm having this nice conversation with you because I'm not a manipulative jerk.""</strong></p>

<p>While <strong>I want to convey that I'm trying to be good-willed</strong> and essentially put myself in a huge disadvantage if I ever would want to manipulate the other person later (I won't, but the other cannot know this for a fact), because the other person will likely be more wary of me, I cannot help myself but think, for some reason or another, that saying this line above would somehow make the other person think less of me. <strong>Is it generally a bad idea to tell people that I could be a manipulative jerk if I wanted to? And if so, how else could I convey my good-willingness to have a civilized discussion instead of some behind-your-back action?</strong> (3)</p>

<hr>

<p>Own thoughts: I think it doesn't sound so good because it is basically the interpersonal equivalent of ""Look, I have access to nukes and you don't, and that's cool because I won't use mine."" and I can see why <em>that</em> is bad. Also, maybe the other person isn't aware that people can be manipulated easily and I don't want them to get any bad ideas. I feel morally insecure enough about posting this issue on the Internet already.</p>

"How to ""Read a room"" and quickly perform an assessment of the mood, group dynamics or tension?","<p>During a course on interpersonal skills, we did several exercises to help us assess our own abilities. I realised that while I do fine with assessing mood, reaction and engagement in one-on-one conversations, I struggle in group settings.</p>

<p>The trainer called this ""reading a room"" but wasn't able to offer any advice about how to develop these skills from one-on-one observations to assessing a larger group.</p>

<p>I experimented with looking around the room during a role-play conversation, with the permission of the person I was working with. This upset them as I wasn't paying them enough attention during the conversation, and I believe their reaction was justified. I was also resorting to looking at one person after another, which in a large group will take a long time - much longer than most people take to 'read a room'.</p>

<p>I most notice trouble in situations where I don't know people very well, such as arriving at a party where I only know one or two people, or attending work meetings with other teams. It's often around a dozen people: any fewer than that and I can get by with looking at people individually.</p>

"Is using profanity only around some people considered two faced?","<p>From my perspective, profanity ""is what it is"", I don't use it frequently but I have no real issue with it.  Though, I do understand that some people do have issue with profanity.  Because of this, often I only use it when around those who I believe will <em>not</em> be offended, or where it's more normal (like in online gaming).</p>

"How can I best let my once-close friend know that I think our friendship is over--if at all?","<p>My once-closest friend and I have seriously drifted apart. It's come as far as that I do not want to invest any more energy in the friendship and I'd prefer it to just quietly end.</p>

<p>I am unsure, however, whether to tell him (live, or by e-mail) that I consider our friendship done. A complicating factor is that we are both part of an extended social circle centered around our bridge club, with many mutual friends. I do not expect him to retreat from that circle anytime soon, nor am I planning to.</p>

<p>A bit of background may be in order. We have been friends since college, and over the last few years have mainly bonded over board games and bridge. We are both around 40, and are both male.</p>

<p>I'll try to name a few reasons I want to end this, but I'll try and stay short:</p>

<ul>
<li>He complains a lot, always about the same things--mainly work and other people in his life. He takes advice about the issues, doesn't follow any of it and then complains again next time we meet. Rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>He has incredibly high expectations of people he interacts with in matters of communication, how they should behave and what they should do for him. And doesn't live up to them in return himself.</li>
<li>Connecting to previous: if I, in his eyes, failed his expectations, we have to <em>talk about it for a bit</em> and then he puts me on the defensive about what his slights are or, even, as he puts it, 'the standard of people you interact with'.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lately, we have had very little interaction. After I had to find out about his girlfriend's pregnancy through her social media rather than him telling me, I decided not to put any effort in this anymore. A few weeks ago, he (too late, imho) proposed to have dinner together again, with his partner and mine. I avoided that proposal and have not had contact since.</p>

<p>If I prefer this to die a quiet death, is it better I end things with him by an email or a talk? Or is it better to just stay quiet and hope that he takes the cues? I'd prefer to keep a respectful distance while still interact every now and then, because we are in the same club.</p>

<p><em>tl;dr</em>: My old friend has worn out my patience, partially by not initiating much contact. We are going to be seeing each other in social situations, but I want our friendship to be over, preferably quietly. Is it best to 'officially' end things with an email or a talk, or not?</p>
"
"How can I explain something to someone who doesn't want to hear it?","<p><strong>Background:</strong> My parents have recently changed to a vegan diet. They've discovered a lot of books, websites, and videos providing scientifically-backed reasons to eat only plant-based foods, and cut out animal products entirely. Since becoming vegans, both my parents feel great. </p>

<p>A family we are best friends with is heavily into nutrition. They have a huge focus on removing toxins from their diet, which can be traced back to causing a lot of health problems. They are very knowledgeable about this field. </p>

<p>I'm excited about eating better. The trouble is that the friends I mentioned above don't believe in vegan-ism. They think the idea that foods like milk, eggs, and organic grass-fed meat are bad for you, is laughable. </p>

<p>I really respect the knowledge these people have in the field of nutrition. They know a lot of stuff, and they've applied it to their own lives. But they disagree with the idea of going vegan. </p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> I would like to reconcile the discrepancies between the science-backed pro- and anti-vegan information I've discovered. On one side there are doctors and nutritional experts saying all animal products are bad for you for a host of reasons. On the other side are my best friends - who, though not professionally, really are nutritional experts all the same - saying that not eating animal products is a bunch of baloney. </p>

<p>The simplest way I see to reconcile these differences is to show my friends the evidence we've found, and have them explain to me why it is faulty or correct. <strong>I'm not trying to convert them.</strong> I'm just trying to understand for myself. </p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> My dad doesn't want me to do this. I've brought up my desire to show our friends the evidence and have them explain it to us, and his reply is always the same: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""They don't want to hear it; I don't want to force it on them. I don't want you to bring it up."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no transition in the conversation. Whenever I mention it, he shuts me down with more or less that exact line. The problem here is that I don't think he understands what I want to do. I'm not trying to convince anyone, I'm just trying to understand myself. </p>

<p>If they really didn't want to hear about it, that would be one thing, but I've seen nothing to suggest that. In fact, they bring it up themselves from time to time. However, trying to explain this and/or what I really want to do gets me nowhere with my dad. </p>

<p>My dad isn't really the kind of person you can have a logical debate with. You can try, but once you run into something he disagrees with, he starts getting invested in it. If you keep pushing, he starts jumping to conclusions about what you are saying (""So you want to do __?!?""), which normally isn't what I'm saying at all. If I keep pushing, he just shuts me down, saying he doesn't want to hear it, or acting like I'm being stubborn and talking won't solve anything. This makes trying to explain something to him - something which he disagrees with - nearly impossible. Unless there's another method. </p>

<hr>

<p>So that's really what I'm asking: <strong>How can I explain something to someone who assumes I mean something else, and just shuts me down?</strong> </p>

<p>Note that this question is about my dad, and not the friends. The friends don't believe in veganism, but they aren't trying to stop us either, and there's no pressure to convert them. Rather, this question is about how I can talk to my dad so he'll <strong>understand</strong> what I'm saying, and what I want to do. </p>

<p><sub>Please note that this is not a question about veganism, but a question about how to explain something to someone who doesn't want to hear it.</sub></p>

"Getting yelled at by (adult) roommate","<p>I rent a room in a large shared house. There have been some problems (see all my other questions) but last night I felt a line was crossed into disrespectful. Two weeks ago I heard music coming from someone's room at 2am so I knocked on their door. There was no reply. I sent them a text message asking if they could use headphones and there was no reply. Just yesterday this person out of the blue started yelling at me saying she felt targeted by me because I hadn't asked if it was anyone else. I said it sounded like the music had been coming from her room and she said I could've sent the whole group (we have a Messenger group chat) instead of just texting her.</p>

<p>I'm very confused by this. 1) how should I reply when someone's yelling at me? I would have liked to have used the kitchen but should I just go back to my room? 2) how should I treat the specific situation? It's very reasonable to ask someone to turn down music at 2am (and what confuses me even more is told me she has a job that starts at 8am). We are in very close living arrangement and things could get very ugly fast. </p>

<p>She said she wants a roommate meeting, which I think would be a good idea. But I'm guessing I should address the issue of her randomly yelling at me before the meeting? What words should I use?</p>

<p>Everyone is in their 20s and most people and international people who don't speak a common language as their first tongue (everyone speaks English but it seems that most people prefer not to, even in common areas when other's are around).</p>

I'm in New Zealand, but you can probably answer the question more generally than that. I work in an office environment working as a programmer, in a non-programming business. The office I work in has a mix of younger generation and older baby boomers. I fall under the former. I'm also slightly autistic so have difficulty reading social cues.</p>

<p>I recently bought a pair of Google Buds and they are explicitly designed to not be noise cancelling, so as long as I have them muted, I can hear and have conversations as per normal. They are also somewhat difficult to take out, so I would prefer to leave them in most of the time as taking them in and out of ears every 20 minutes or so hurts my ears and is a bit fiddly. </p>

"In a polyamorous relationship, how to go about telling ""I love you"" to new partner?","<p>Saying ""I love you"" means a lot like in any other relationship, specially since I'm always upfront from early days about not saying it lightly like some people do and to remove the cultural ambiguity from our relationship. During such early conversations we found out that for her ""I love you"" means the same than for us, more than a feeling, for us, it means ""I wan't you to stay permanently because I can't be without you and I'd do anything to guard your happiness"".</p>

<p>Providing more context as asked:<br>
As we are in a symmetrical type of polyamory (we don't date other people, we commit and stay faithful to whomever is in our relationship), we are flexible on how we date with each other, if one person is not available the other 2 simply go out wherever and the person who was busy is always welcomed to join, we basically share life for the 3 of us. This person is relatively new (almost a year) but has been increasingly staying over at our place, we share everything, we've talked about a future for the 3 of us together, she still has her own apartment though.</p>

<p>My long-standing girlfriend and I had been (not very actively) looking out for other girls since the start, it started very early because she opened up to me about being bisexual, I already knew because we had been friends for years and dated other people before we dated, so I took it as a reminder, a ""don't forget I also like girls"" type of reminder, to which I was very o.k. with, already had experience anyway. I was clear I didn't like fooling around and she agreed, so anyone else we dated would have to be someone who wanted to be with the both of us. We didn't even had to negotiate, it wasn't even a big deal. We didn't rush into that, we really enjoyed being only the two of us. So, every now and then a person would get close to us but not for long, different expectations, different ideas of what love means and entails, didn't work out. But this person is different, we've all developed a special bond.</p>

<p>I was thinking the right approach would be asking my long-standing girlfriend if she already felt the same, I've already seen all the signs that make evident she's in love with our new companion. We could take her together to a nice place and tell her there, or maybe agree with my girlfriend to tell her separately the same day on different circumstances made special in different ways, and later at night take her to a nice place with the 3 of us to celebrate.</p>

<p>But I really have no experience with that. I'm not sure if that is the best protocol, a different approach could be possible?
I don't have the skills, please help.</p>

<p>Please don't answer things like ""what if she doesn't say it back"" because we don't worry about that. She will say it if she feels the same way and if she still doesn't, we are not putting pressure, there is no need to rush anything, I'm very confident she loves us back though.</p>

<p>Not sure if this helps, but some time ago I was on the other side of the formula, with a slight difference because I'm not bisexual and neither was the man in that relationship, we didn't get that far but we hanged out together and I spent a lot of time at their place. I know from experience being in that position in which you are the one wanting to be <em>in</em> doesn't make you less valuable, I know because when they broke up they sort of fought about whom was going to ""keep me"". I was very much in love with both of them, I wouldn't have cared if they had told me separately or together as long as the 3 of us stayed together, <strong>but that's just me</strong>, that's why I'm asking for experienced advice. They ended up telling me separately after they broke up, that was a boomer, heart smashed to smithereens, but that's a whole different story.</p>

"How can I extend an olive branch, but also reinforce that another's behavior is not okay?","<p><strong>Some background:</strong></p>

<p>I started a wood working hobby a few months ago of which the loudest tools are my stereo, a table saw, and a router. I've had some passive interest from neighbors as they drive by, peering into my garage to see what I'm working on - but no complaints about the noise or anything. I only operate the loud tools during mid-day on the weekends so as to make as little impact as possible. I also align the tools so that saw-dust is blown <em>into</em> the garage and I shop-vac it constantly to make sure I'm not letting dust escape.</p>

<p><strong>The incident for discussion:</strong></p>

<p>I was in the process of building a table on Sunday and began working on it around Noon. The loud tools were in use on this project (table saw, router). Around 4:00pm, a neighbor that I'd never seen before came over. I shut the router off, took out my earbuds, and his first words were, ""Really?""</p>

<p>I thought that he was joking at first so I was cordial and explained that I was building a table for our dining room. </p>

<p>He was instantly angry (I suppose he was angry from the beginning - it just took me until now to catch on)...and he shouted ""It's 4:00pm, ON SUNDAY, ON MOTHER'S DAY!"" </p>

<p>I didn't really know how to respond to this statement and simply said, ""yes...I know...""</p>

<p>It's at this point that he yelled that he was trying to enjoy his dinner and couldn't because of the noise and he threatened that, if I went back to work, he would call the police. </p>

<p>I attempted to deescalate the situation by introducing myself and holding my hand out to shake - an invitation that he did take. I then said, ""let's come to a compromise. I'll break for a bit and then continue with the garage door down. How long will your dinner be?""</p>

<p>He then continued to yell, repeating that it was 4:00PM ON SUNDAY ON MOTHER'S DAY!</p>

<p>My wife had heard his shouting and was already in the garage by this point. She stated that I'd break for the day and the angry neighbor left.</p>

<p><strong>The problem I need help solving:</strong></p>

<p>I'm unsure how to move forward with this neighbor. Up until yesterday, I had never met or seen the man. Had he come over and simply asked me to quiet down, I would have (it's not my intention to be a neighborhood nuisance). </p>

<p>I would like to approach my neighbor to reiterate that, should he have an issue with my noise making in the future, then he should absolutely come by so that we can work out a good compromise.</p>

<p>However, I also want to make sure that it is absolutely clear that he understands that the level of aggression and hostility presented yesterday to me and my wife will not be tolerated and that there should be no reason why any interaction cannot take place with civility. </p>

<p><strong>What sort of tactic/strategy would you use going into this interaction so as to extend the proverbial olive branch, but to reinforce that his behavior was uncalled for and will not be tolerated?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit to respond to comments:</strong></p>

<p>Noise making is, indeed, a very culture dependent thing. In my locale, the law is fairly liberal on behalf of noise makers - operable time of day is 7:00am through 10:00pm and only the major holidays are exempted. </p>

<p>As stated above, I do not work during the week (not getting home from work usually until after 5) and this is my cut-off hour on the weekend as well. </p>

<p>The incident boils down to a neighbor being very upset over my noise making on a day that he viewed as more sacrosanct than I. Now, I admit to being unaware, and some may say, callous to his view. <strong>This is why I want to make amends</strong>. </p>

<p>On the flip side, my neighbor's overtly hostile and aggressive action was, in my mind, <em>never an appropriate response</em>. His attempt to use aggression and intimidation tactics, especially in front of my wife, <em>is completely unacceptable behavior</em> and it's <strong>this</strong> point that I also want to emphasize while resolving the situation.</p>

<p>I appreciate the insights given here and the different perspectives. If there is anything else that I can clarify - do as you do in the comments.</p>

"How to effectively communicate technical data/instructions without writing ""too long"" emails?","<p>I frequently find myself writing emails or technical documents that include a lot of technical information.  However, even when written to ""technical people"" about technical things, it seems that the length of the email is too long and therefore it goes unread, ignored, skimmed, etc. and I've become known as a long-winded person.  I'm starting to get flak for that, and I'd like to understand why or what I can do about it.</p>

<h2>How long is too long?</h2>

<p>It seems that the length of ""too long"" is absurdly short; longer than a couple paragraphs is considered too long.</p>

<h2>What are the details?</h2>

<p>Most of the reason for the long-windedness is an effort to be thorough, reduce known/possible miscommunications (some of which are highlighted below), and deal with the fact that the ""technical"" people aren't very technical, nor competent.  Sometimes the lack of competency is known (I'm instructing someone for the first time in something they've never done), and sometimes it's because they are deficient in prerequisite topics (common in my industry; explained below).  Often, I include screenshots with notations, and I leave them large to be easier to read.  That increases a page count quickly.</p>

<p>Feedback I get (from bosses and coworkers) is that such lengthy emails/documents are unwelcome and unwarranted, with an emphasis on time spent.</p>

<h2>Possible solution: Executive Summaries</h2>

<p>I've started to include an executive summary at the front, but I think I've passed the point of no return, and the email gets ignored or stays unread.  Part of that is because most people in the industry are overworked, part of that is email culture is to ignore things, and part of that is any reputation I have for being long winded.</p>

<p>Boiling down something to an executive summary may still be too complicated (another problem I deal with), or they feel like I'm being overly vague, arrogant, or condescending.  I haven't gotten much feedback about this in written form, but when I do that face-to-face, it's obvious they think I'm being overly vague.</p>

<h2>Possible solution: 6th grade reading level</h2>

<p>I was once told to keep emails and docs at a 6th grade reading level.  Attempting to do this was met with some success, until things became complicated enough that I had to start expanding them.  It's not easy to break things down into less complicated chunks, and often that means they wind up being bigger chunks.</p>

<h2>Some examples:</h2>

<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>

<p>I was handed a project to start working on, and as I went through the existing documentation, I wrote down questions and commentary ahead of a planned meeting to go over these sorts of things.  It was ~8 pages, so I used the auto-format capabilities of MS Word to generate a Table of Contents (ToC).  This takes all of a minute or two and makes it easier for the reader.  However, my boss, who was CC'd when I sent the document, clearly didn't like the ToC and was stuck on that, bringing it up anecdotally in a different meeting with no relation to this project.  I think it was because he didn't know how easy it was to make, nor how to use it.  I think ToCs are incredibly useful since they are CTRL+clickable.</p>

<p><strong>Clarity vs brevity</strong></p>

<p>I tend to remove pronouns and references in my written works because I find most people can't find the thing I was referring to, and stick on the wrong one.  For example, above, I changed </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think they are incredibly useful since they are CTRL+clickable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think ToCs are incredibly useful since they are CTRL+clickable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so that it was unambiguous that I was referring to ToCs.  This may come across as off-putting, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of ""basic"" skills</strong></p>

<p>While my industry works with technology, the people in it are usually not very tech savvy.  For example, only very few of them (~1/10) know about keyboard shortcuts like CTRL+C, CTRL+V, or that most programs have a search function built into them.</p>

<p><strong>Poor reading/writing skills lead to brain overheating</strong></p>

<p>I also find that people don't know how to use certain punctuation marks and therefore use them wrongly.  I've discovered that people use quotes ("""") to emphasize something, instead of to satirize it (like I did above for ""technical people"").  The former should be bolded, while the latter is often referred to as ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quotes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">air quotes</a>"".  I've also seen people confuses slashes with commas:  this is the same/similar, yet people would write a list of items as a/b/c/d, when it should be written as ""a, b, c, d."".</p>

<p>I suspect that when presented with technical data in a technical format, or just unfamiliar formatting, the reaction is a brain overload, or anger and resentment that they are unfamiliar with something.</p>

<p><strong>Region</strong></p>

<p>I'm in the US, and all of these problems come from people who were born and raised in the US, almost exclusively within the same geographic region.</p>

<p>I've found several articles that deal with the theory (such as <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022666424731"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Test of Interpersonal Theory of Depression in Youth Psychiatric Inpatients</a>, which gives a rather... short explanation (""<em>...the combination of depressive symptoms and excessive reassurance-seeking leads to interpersonal problems...</em>""), but this doesn't go into depth at all), but I'm having trouble understanding what exactly this theory <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>What constitutes ""excessive reassurance-seeking"" and ""depressive symptoms""?</p>

<p>Or, more generally: What is this theory? What exactly does it theorize? How is it applicable to life in modern society?</p>

"Appropriate response when someone announces pregnancy?","<p>When someone tells me that they or their partner are pregnant, my typical response is ""Congratulations!""</p>

<p>But I have found out that this remark is not always appropriate- notably when the pregnancy is unplanned. Sometimes I am informed about the pregnancy via text or online chat so it is harder to get a read on their feeling towards it. In some cases I do not know the person very well either so I do not know if I would expect them to be excited or distressed about the news. </p>

<p>I feel awkward thinking about asking <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2223/is-it-rude-to-ask-if-a-pregnancy-was-planned"">""Was the pregnancy planned?""</a> or ""How are you feeling about it?""</p>

<p>Specific examples: <br /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""So I'm pregnant."" / ""Oh, congrats!"" / ""No, not good..."" / ""Oh...""<br />
  ""Just found out that I'm pregnant."" / ""Oh, congrats!"" / ""I... I'm not
  sure what to do."" <br /> ""Oh yeah- (partner's name) is pregnant."" /
  ""Really? Congratulations!"" / ""..."" / ""...""<br /> ""omg
  guys im pregnant"" / ""congrats!!"" / ""no I'm SO F***ED""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all my personal cases I was not informed prior that the person/couple were ""trying for a baby"".</p>

<p><strong>What is generally a polite or appropriate response when someone informs me of their or their partner's pregnancy if I can't get a read on their emotions?</strong></p>

<p>Not sure if it is relevant for context but I am a 24 year old living in America.</p>

"How to interpret another couple's 'farewell ritual'?","<p>My spouse has a friend who we both like a lot and love to hang out with her and her boyfriend, who is also very kind, but not as close as the friend. None of us have kids, we are all in our early 30s. We see each other as couples maybe once or twice per year, although we live in the same city. We've had some really enjoyable ""couple dates"", and I, being a regular guy with relatively good interpersonal skills, would say that this could become a good friendship. There is just one thing that strikes me as awkward and I don't know what it means and how to handle it:</p>

<p>Every time we meet and then say Good Bye, our befriended couple says, very sincerely, that we should hang out more often and that we should go on a vacation together. So far so good, my spouse and I would really like that. But when we inquire later on about a new date or specifically ask about going on a vacation, there are excuses such as ""we are sick"" (we've heard that one at least a dozen times), and no reply at all regarding the vacation.</p>

<p>It's important to note that all four participants have been born and raised in Germany. Germany has a very low-context and direct culture. Usually, when we say something, we mean it. It wouldn't strike me as awkward if the other couple was from an english-speaking culture, as this ritual appears to be more common there. There is, of course, a chance that one of them is really sick that often, but my statistical gut feeling tells me that this is unlikely. ;-)</p>

<p>How can I interpret their behaviour(s)? Is it just ""being nice"" and not really caring about us? How should we respond?</p>

<p><strong>Edit for clarity:</strong> I would usually consider this as a nice way of saying ""no"", but there are other occurrences. For example, after we announced that we want to move to a city close by, we're being told, ""No, please don't move away! We can't hang out anymore that easily!"" -- This is not the usual ""nice-no"" one usually has to deal with. Why say something like that if there's no interest in hanging out anymore?</p>

"How can I say I want to be left alone without having to explain myself or lie about it?","<p>In all my jobs so far I have had coworkers who spent their lunch breaks together. At my current job there are a lot of restaurants close and everyone goes there during their break.</p>

<p>I'm a very introverted person, so social interactions can make me very tired, on top of a health problem that does that too. Sometimes I just need a breather during my break but I can't seem to shake my coworkers without lying to them or 'confessing' I'm a little tired of them.</p>

<p><strong>I've tried things like these:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Them: Are you coming?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Oh no thanks I'm staying inside. (with the idea of being alone)</p>
  
  <p>Them: Oh so will I then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: I'm running to shop x for a second, I'll see you later.</p>
  
  <p>Them: Oh no problem I'll join you.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Oh you don't need to, I can go alone.</p>
  
  <p>Them: I'd like to have a walk so I'm joining!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How can I avoid them tagging along?</strong></p>

<p>I understand they mean well and just want to be sociable and often I join their outings but sometimes I just need a break. I'd prefer not to say        I'm tired of social things or that I'm not feeling well and since I appreciate these people and need to work with them I do not want to lie either.</p>

"How do you greet people you barely know?","<p>I often find myself in situations, where I'd love to greet someone that I barely know. For example: when I'm doing my workout routine in the gym, I see a person that I once helped to e.g. lift something. Though I don't really know the person I would like to greet him/her properly.</p>

<p>The question(s):
How do I greet someone I just talked to once or helped once? What do I do if he/she is not looking towards me? </p>

<p>It's not that difficult with people from the same gender and age (I'm 22 years old male living in Germany), but it still feels weird to look more than usual towards him/her until he/she notices me. </p>

<p>It's not very important to me to get to know a person better, but I would like to increase the number of people that I can greet and also greet me even though they haven't spoken to me a lot. I think that would cause a way friendlier environment for all of us. </p>

"Mansplaining in an academic context","<p>I am a math grad student, who was recently accused of mansplaining by a female grad student. As I tend to be left leaning, this caught me by surprise. This question is an attempt to perhaps learn more about the term.</p>

<p>I was in a group of two men and two women at an ice cream parlor. Three of us were math grad students, and the fourth was not. We'll name them Man A, Man B (me), Woman A (the one who accused me of mansplaining) and Woman B (the non math grad student). Woman B asked a question about why math is useful. Man A (not me) started explaining about the uses of number theory in cryptography. I interrupted him at one point, and continued the explanation. Woman A laughed, and said that all that we had said was incorrect, and that it really has to do with elliptic curves, etc. I said that I could be wrong, but I had gotten my explanation from a youtube video. She smiled and ignored us.</p>

<p>I then invited Woman A to explain about elliptic curves. She did not respond, and kept smiling at her phone. Later, she accused me of mansplaining. Something to remember: Woman A is doing her PhD in number theory. Man A and I were not. We taken some courses though, and perhaps held an amateurish interest in it.</p>

<p>I did not exactly know what mansplaining was, so I looked it up. Google said that it was the act of explaining something to a woman in a condescending fashion. I messaged her, saying that as I was not explaining anything to her, how could I be mansplaining. She said that I was mansplaining, as I did not invite her to explain about number theory, as she was the expert in it, and I was not.</p>

<p>My view:</p>

<p>I had not started the explanation about number theory. Man A had. It was perhaps his prerogative to invite her to explain about number theory. However, it seemed that he got almost none of the heat. The accusations seemed directed at me, and she said ""yes he was mansplaining too"" only when I reminded her of his role. We have had strained relations in the past, but it would perhaps be futile to hypothesize whether that contributed to this accusation.</p>

<p>I did invite her to explain about elliptic curves when she disagreed with us, but she did not.</p>

<p>We started arguing about whether I was indeed mansplaining. Woman B (the non math mathematician) also said she didn't think it was mansplaining. But Woman A said that it didn't matter what she or I thought, the ""classy"" move would have been for me to apologize right away.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>How can I determine if I'm mansplaining or not, and what kinds of things can I do to avoid mansplaining?</p>

<p>As a man, is there any practical value to me to arguing if a woman accuses me of mansplaining?</p>

"How to ask my office to remove the pride decorations without appearing anti-LGBTQ?","<p>First, for clarification, I am not anti-LGBTQ. </p>

<p>My office has taken part in the <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/pride-month-2019-events-uk-lgbt-london-brighton-manchester-bournemouth-a8948786.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pride Month</a>, which is celebrated throughout the UK in June every year. The month celebrations end in a large Pride march in London (this year, it was on the 6th of July). In the office there were usual talks and gatherings, together with decorations (pride flags).</p>

<p>It's been two weeks since the end of the month, and the decorations still stand. I know some in the office are very actively involved in LGBTQ groups and activities. I'm just an average person who support their cause, nothing less, nothing more.</p>

<p>I do not want my office to become a bastion of identity politics, nor to be used for the interests of some particular groups. If we were to allow this, the causes to be championed are numerous, and in the end, you end up with an office which is being used for purposes which were not originally intended. As such, although I was happy to support LGBTQ cause during the Pride Month, now it's over, and so I think it makes sense to remove decorations (which are also present outside the office, visible to the public).</p>

<p>So, how can I communicate this matter to the admin team in charge of this stuff, without sounding anti-LGBTQ? I don't want to hurt sensibilities, nor damage my reputation.</p>

<p>Notice, the office is decently big (50 people), and not everyone knows each other well, so prejudice might quickly arise. </p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I can communicate to the admin team, which oversees the building (room booking, cleaning, use of space, etc). They do have an email address, which I imagine is visible to whoever is in there that day. Those decorations are reusable. For other events such as Christmas, they are removed when it is commonly judged acceptable to do so (e.g. for Christmas, they're removed at Epiphany).</p>

<p>I have no clue of what others think. I imagine those actively involved in the campaign have no problem with the decorations (and I'm not suggesting they are actively trying to leave them there forever). Maybe there are several who think like me, but are afraid to speak out. In the world today, if you say anything that might look anti-minorities, you become immediately a bad guy.</p>

<p>The goal? I said it. Just make sure the office stays neutral to social/political causes. We are not a company who has the defense/support for LGBTQ as an official core value, nor there is talks to make it one. So, at least for now, it feels inappropriate. </p>

"How to mend a friendship when my friend thinks I'm in the wrong and I don't wish to apologize","<p>I just created this account because I really don't know how to deal with this.
A close friend and I have been talking for a few months about her coming to my hometown for the summer, but we didn't set any specific dates. Meanwhile I invited (let's call him this for the purpose of this question) my boyfriend to come over as well, and we set on a week. Meanwhile, due to life and schedules my friend tells me she can only come that same week (that I had already told her my other ""friend"" was coming over). She doesn't want to come at the same time as the boy, which I understand, she doesn't want to be the third wheel. So I speak with the boy and ask him if he can come another time, to which he replies ""no, sorry. Why?"" I just tell him nevermind and go back to my friend and tell her he can't change his week. She replies something along the lines of ""it's up to you then"" and gets really mad that I didn't check with her before setting the date with the other person, because we had been planning for months and I decided two weeks ago to invite the boy, and I chose him over her. </p>

<p>I don't really want to apologize because I don't think I was in the wrong, but I want to keep the friendship. <strong>How can I resolve this fight, preferably without apologizing ?</strong></p>

"How to honestly answer questions from a girlfriend like ""How did you find this place"" without giving the impression I'm always talking about my exes?","<p>I'm in my mid-twenties and I've always had more female friends than male friends. I was in 2 serious relationships (one 1,5 year long and the other one 3 years) and 4 or 5 small ones, but they can't really be called ""relationships"". I no longer keep in touch with a great majority of all the girls I've ever met. </p>

<p>But I did a lot of things with these female friends and exes: visiting restaurants, parks, cities, going abroad, etc. I know a lot of places that are worth a visit or things which are fun to do together because I was there or did those things with some other girl before. I don't really hide this.</p>

<p>I've been in multiple relationships now where I always have a hard time telling those stories or speaking about certain things, because to my girlfriends I always speak about other girls or, especially, my exes (just because I did more stuff with the exes, so they come up more often as an answer). My girlfriends sometimes feel like I am constantly comparing them to each other. </p>

<p>Usually, it goes like this: My girlfriend and I go somewhere together to someplace I know is fine. We talk and at one point in the conversation, sooner or later, this magical question appears: ""Did you come here before?"" or ""Do you know this place?"" or ""How did you find this place?"". Or we go to some new place and in the conversation, I mention a story where I experienced something similar but different in some aspects or totally different. The magic question comes again: ""Who were you there with? Were you there alone?"". I've never had a feeling that these questions were asked on purpose to test whether I'm a womanizer or something, rather out of pure curiosity, just like when two people are getting to know each other.</p>

<p>I fought long battles explaining that those girls don't matter to me, and I'm telling her <strong>about the place or thing</strong> because of the importance of it in this particular moment, and not because of the girl I was there with at that time. </p>

<p>Adding to that, whenever we talk about myself and my past, my exes may come up. An example: I can say that I like dancing and I danced ballroom dances for 2 years (which is quite obvious that I had to have a partner). Or (this is a big one) about something that I didn't like about an ex or generally speaking about women. I'm afraid that I can mention my exes in a more casual setting like ""I'm glad that you're not like that one because she was always X and Y"".</p>

<p>For my next relationship, <strong>how can I honestly address those kinds of questions without coming across like I'm always talking about my exes?</strong></p>

"How can I jump into a fast-moving group conversation?","<p>Recently I was invited to a casual games night at a coworker's place, and near the end of the evening there was a group of about 6 of us (a couple coworkers of mine, a couple friends of theirs, my partner, and I) sitting around chatting. The topics were very interesting to me (think the future of humanity and AI and such) and I enjoyed listening to the different perspectives people had, but I also wanted to jump in and contribute my own thoughts.</p>

<p>I tried interjecting a couple times, but it seemed to go unnoticed and/or someone else started talking at the same time, so it didn't get far.. This isn't a new problem for me since I am soft-spoken<sup>1</sup> and can take some time to gather my thoughts, especially with conversations like that. However it usually comes up in work settings where I have other options (e.g. getting the attention of my team lead, or following up later).</p>

<p>Part of the problem may have been that I was visually blocked off from a couple of the most active participants, since I was at the end of the table and the person next to me tended to lean in. (Maybe I need to adjust my body language too?) The conversation was also kind of fast-paced, so by the time I had formed a comment, someone else was likely to start talking first. I didn't want to interrupt them or return to an old point just to say my bit once the conversation had moved on.</p>

<p>Overall, I was at a loss of how to signal to the group ""hey, I have something to say too!"" and <a href=""https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/have-the-floor"" rel=""noreferrer"">have the floor</a> without feeling like I was disrupting the natural flow of conversation.</p>

<p><strong>What tactics could I have used to insert myself into the conversation?</strong></p>

<p><sup>1: Please don't tell me <em>just</em> to talk louder; everyone heard me fine earlier when we were playing board games, so I think there's more to it than that. I can accept that talking louder is a part of the solution, but I'd really like to know what else to try.</sup></p>

"Being angry at people for no good reason","<p>I just (again) discussed an interesting problem with a close (female) friend. She frequently gets angry at people for no good reason. She is aware of the problem herself but can't help it.</p>

<p>For example, she is late for a meeting which the other party, fairly, frowns upon. This causes my friend to be very angry at that person. My friend knows that the other person has a ""right"" to be annoyed with her being late, while she herself has no reason at all being angry at that person in that situation but she can't avoid it.</p>

<p>My first advice to my friend was that she must learn to apologise and these days she is pretty good at apologising. She always gets back to people, including me, the day after and tells them ""it was wrong of me to be angry at you yesterday"" but this is exhausting for her.</p>

<p>Now we discussed how she can avoid ending up in these situations to start with. I think it is human to feel angry even when it is yourself that is to blame for the situation but I don't really know how I, or others, cope with it. It is kind of tacit knowledge. I can only tell her to ""analyse the situation rationally and if you realise it is your own fault, then shut up"" but that approach doesn't really work when the situation that triggers the anger is ongoing (obviously, when she has calmed down she can think rationally about the situations - that is why she is able to apologise later on).</p>

<p>What do you advise?</p>

<p>Edit: the goal is to act more rational in situations when she gets upset. Sometimes it is justified for her to get upset (e.g., when someone else is late for a meeting) but frequently it is not. How can she learn to distinguish between these two situations ""in the middle of it"" (she is good at making that distinction later on when looking back on what happened but then it is too late)?</p>

<p>I was feeling annoyed that they had not realized that they were slightly overstaying their welcome at our place.

<p>Note: I do not mind them both, they are both very sweet people and great friends to my sister. It is that my husband and myself need our space and we were already very tired from running the game night and his game had gone on for 3.5-4 hours already.

<p>When she gets the slightest bit behind in any game, she gets apathetic and says the game is stupid or there is no sense in playing, it's over anyways (but it's more like losing 1 point in tennis than a 7-0 in football). But when she is winning she is super happy and has fun. I really like to see her win and have fun, but it takes the fun out of playing when she wants to stop if I get ahead a bit. I talked about it with her, but she always says she can't help it that's just the way she reacts to losing. When I say but then it's not fun for me she says we should just stop playing. But I clearly see that she is having fun and enjoying the games too when winning and it would be a pity to give that up. I'm 24 and she is 29, so it's no teenage problem. Any advice?</p>

<p><strong>What I tried that didn't work:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I tried to explain her that it is just a game and it's more about fun and being together. </li>

Just some good ideas how to think about this problem and what could be done. I also especially like the quick reminder before the start of a game, because if the person that has the problem already accepts it as such, a quick reminder can do wonders and it is a really quick and simple option.</p>

"A stranger keeps calling and is confused that my phone number is his friend's old phone number","<p>A man called me a few times today- I'll refer to him as ""Bill"". He was looking for a man named Wayne. He is pretty upset that Wayne's old number happens to now be my number. He explained that he has used this number for years to contact Wayne and that he needs to contact Wayne to pick something up at his home (from what I understand)</p>

<p>I repeatedly explained to Bill that I was provided this number from my phone provider about 2 months ago and that I am not sure what I can do for him. He is concerned about Wayne as he has had cardiac issues and he thinks he may have suffered a heart attack.<br />
Bill was very chatty about his relationship with Wayne and I tried to interject with ""Does he have a Facebook?"" and ""Does he have friends that you can contact?"" but my questions went unanswered as he continued to talk about this dilemma.<br />
After quite a bit of back and forth, Bill asked me if I could contact my phone provider and ask them if they know Wayne's new number- because he does not know what to do from here. I told him that it is unlikely that they will know Wayne's new number (especially if he has a new provider or no phone at all anymore) and that if my provider DID have any information such as a billing address or new number- it is not appropriate for them to provide it to me.</p>

<p>Bill seems like a nice man but he is very upset that I have taken Wayne's phone number. I reached out to my phone company for any guidance and Bill is expecting me to call him with any information on Wayne later.</p>

<p><strong>What can I politely tell Bill to get him to understand that I cannot help him and to stop calling me?</strong></p>

<p>I know I can simply block his number but the poor man just seems so confused.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Resolution:</strong><br />
My phone provider got back to me and informed me that their numbers are recycled and the time frame is at least 3 months. They also said they won't be able to locate who was the previous owner of the number- so I passed along this information to Bill and he seemed to understand it.<br />
After some more back and forth it turns out that Wayne supposedly lives out of state and that Bill does not know much about the guy. Wayne bought a trailer from Bill a long time ago and mailed him payments in the form of multiple checks over time. So the trailer is paid for in full but Wayne never came to pick it up. So Bill called Wayne's number- (which is now my number) to ask him to pick up the trailer. Bill does know his first and last name so I gave him the 555-1212 number noted by baldPrussian.</p>

<p>Based on all the calls from Bill over the past few days, I began to get the feeling that Bill wasn't calling again and again because he was still confused- but because he is lonely and/or wanted to talk to someone. He often went off on a tangent and would ask me questions about myself (location, age, job, etc.) These conversations were hard to leave as he continuously brought up something else to keep me from hanging up.</p>

"Losing interest in girl I date because too slow dating","<p>I am currently dating a girl (19) who I (21) really like. She really does look good and has a great character. But one thing I actually at first really liked is turning kinda sour for me right now.</p>

<p>She, as we all, has had bad experiences because she went into a relationship too fast, and therefore she wants to get to know me really before moving on to the next steps. Which is totally cool for me, as I made the same mistake the last time as well.</p>

<p>We have met 4-5 times over the last month, approximately once a week, and when we met we had a great time. But the furthest we've gone is cuddling during a movie night at my apartment.</p>

<p>The thing is now, although we have a great time when we meet and write everyday, I'm kinda starting to lose interest because everything is going too damn slow. I really am not into just having sex, because (we talked about it) we both are looking for a long term relationship so I have no problem with patience, but it's going too slow, and she somehow does not want to meet more often than ~once a week and you cannot build a connection when you spend no time with each other.</p>

<p><strong>How could I communicate to this person that I really like her but that I am starting to lose interest because of the insanely slow pace of the relationship?</strong> The goal is to do so without burning bridges and preferably to get her to get in touch more often.</p>

<p>I want to clarify that this is not about going further on a physical level. I don't need sex asap. That is not a priority for me. But that she would be more open to meet more frequently to be able to build some connection (or not).</p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<ul>
<li>She seems to have loads of time; I can't make out why she can't meet more often.</li>
<li>I've already asked her out multiple times, both directly and indirectly, but there were rejections. If I asked ""What are you doing this evening? I don't have anything to do today,"" she sometimes said stuff like ""I'll be reading, or watching TV."" This means to me that she has free time but wants to spend it alone. It could also mean that she doesn't have any plans.</li>
<li>I am used to spending time with a person to bond. I don't like to talk about deep subjects while messaging - although I would like to do so personally - and so there's a lot of small talk, and so I get bored. I have the feeling she feels the same.</li>

"I look ten years younger. Is it appropriate to give a younger age in online dating?","<p>People don't age at the same speed. The variance for age of (non-violent, natural) death is several decades. And you can notice this difference in the speed of aging at an earlier age, too. Some people appear ancient at sixty, others are virile and look youthful at the same age.</p>

<p>I'm a bit over 50 years old, and yet people who don't know my age regularly guess that I am around 40 years old. The youngest I was thought to be was ""in my twenties"" when I was 45 years old. I couldn't quite believe that, and after repeated displays of incredulity on my part, the other person corrected themselves to ""thirty"". Today, my skin is still free of wrinkles, I'm slim and physically fit, and my lifestile is that of a 25 year old.</p>

<p>Face to face, much younger people readily accept me as one of their peers, and young women react very open to my approach. In fact my last two relationships were with women both sixteen years younger, and all my friends are between 25 and 38.</p>

<p>But in online dating, where one has to specify one's age, age is the prime selector after gender. Women that are only a few years younger (and sometimes look older than I), consistently sort me out as too old. The common reply (if I get one) when I write to a fourty year old woman is: ""I'm looking for a man my age.""</p>

<p><strong>Since I am consistently judged to be about ten years younger than I really am, is it appropriate to specify a younger age in online dating?</strong></p>

<p>As I look like I'm fourty, is it okay for me to pretend to be fourty in online dating?</p>

<p>The purpose of this lie is to enable me to get in contact with those women that would positively react to my approach in a face to face situation, instead of the women my own age who don't regard me as their equal due to my age-inappropriate lifestyle.</p>

<p>The other aspect is that I will probably live longer than those people my age who look their age. My greatparents all lived to around ninety, at a time when the average age of death was seventy. My parents are ninety and of good health. They might live to be a hundred. So in a sense I am not fifty in the same way than some other fifty-year-olds. Giving my ""real"" age would actually be misleading, if you consider age as indicating the state of one's health and the lifespan one has left.</p>

"How to get out of another group's interpersonal problems without hurting their feelings","<p>My friend ""Alice"" has an older boyfriend. He asked me out on a date <strong>right in front of her</strong> today. I looked at Alice, and she turned away. </p>

<p>I didn't know if this was a dare or serious, so I called him a jerk for asking me out, especially in her presence.</p>

<p>Alice later came to me and told me that her bf didn't care about her, and kinda started laying her emotional load on me. (So it wasn't a dare...)</p>

<p>I don't know what to do, because <strong>I don't want to be a part of this kinda thing</strong>. I feel that this is best left between them both, but I'm being dragged into this by Alice, who considers me as some kind of emotional problem solver. (Maybe I should send her to this Stack Exchange? XD)</p>

<p><strong>My question is, how should I try and come out of this situation without hurting Alice?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I found out yesterday after asking that Alice's bf is 19, and I was scared as hell. My mom spoke to him today, so no issues with him anymore. Alice is a neighbor, BTW, not a school friend.</p>

<p>I know it's extremely weird, I just didn't know how old he was when he asked me out. However, Alice is 16, and I'm sure she knows how to do her thing with a 19 year old.</p>

<p>In response to @KingGraham and @AlexandreAudin's comments:
Since she's older than me, I found it weird that she was confiding in me, and that her boyfriend asked me out when I found out his age. Maybe her boyfriend didn't know how old I was either, because I was hanging out with a 16 year old, and I'm really tall...</p>

<p>We are a group of about 30 people aged 19--40 who got to know each other at a 2-week scout meeting. We got really close to each other during this and try to meet regularly. Three of these live in a city quite far from me (3 hours by train).</p>

<p>I saw there's a concert of a band I like in their city, so I started a Facebook group chat with me and the 3 of them.

"How to convince my sister to talk to our family about her plans (or lack of)?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My sister and I (22F, Australian, twins) are both currently in Japan, but both with our own set of circumstances. I've been living in Japan for two years now after getting a job here straight out of university, while my sister has come to Japan last December for what was meant to be a 2 week trip - and has subsequently turned into a two month stay. Now, this usually wouldn't be a problem. She's an adult; she can make her own choices about her life. However, the reason for her stay and her lack or thought, planning, or communication on when (or even <em>if</em>) she'll be going home is putting a very big stress on the relationship between her and me, and her and our mum.</p>

<p>The reason for her visit to Japan was to spend time with her boyfriend (a Japanese man she met when on exchange study the year before last/last year), so I can understand why she would want to stay for a reasonably long time. Being in an long distance relationship and finally being able to see each other after a year no doubt makes it difficult to go home, but she'll have to within the next two weeks because she hasn't yet graduated from university and the last class she must take to complete her courses <strong>cannot</strong> be done online. She must physically return to the university to complete it. But she's never been fond of university, so it's a toss-up whether she'll even go back for that. And, for the past two months, whenever either our mum or I ask her if she's decided when she'll be going back to Australia she either says 'I don't know yet' or completely ignores our messages.</p>

<p>Now, we don't mind what it is she decides to do. Like I said, it's her choice and we respect that, even though it may make life lonely for our parents or dissapoint them. What we're worried about is that she has no plan at all, or that if she does have an idea of what she wants to do, that she'll completely leave us in the dark and cut off communication with us for some reason before long.</p>

<p>Mum has become frustrated, worried and stressed, and she's told me that she's afraid to ask my sister too much too often because she thinks it might push her away. She's also said that for all she knows my sister may have gotten married to her boyfriend (with whom she's been living these past two months, along with his mother) without telling anyone and will never come back home, which is not only distressing for our mum and I, but also for our dad (our parents are divorced), who can only communicate with us through email (and therefore the frequency with which we talk is much less than with our mum) and will never say whether he's worried or not, though he no doubt is.</p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong></p>

<p><em>How can I convince my sister to talk to our parents or me about what she's planning to do?</em></p>

<p>Neither our mum or I want to change her thinking or make her do anything she doesn't want to. We just want her to communicate and stop keeping us in the dark about her plans.</p>

<p><em>NOTE</em></p>

<p>Neither our mum nor I have any way to communicate with my sister's boyfriend or family, so asking them is not an option. My sister has only now, after two months, given our mum her boyfriend's address, so getting any more personal information about her boyfriend's family is most probably not possible. Getting information from my sister has always been like pulling teeth. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>We haven't always gone straight in with 'what are you doing with your life?' kind of heavy questions, and we aren't asking her every day or anything, far from it. The last time I talked (or tried to) to her about anything specific was something like two weeks ago. And although we've tried the gentle lead-in of 'how are things going?\how are you?' it's mostly met with answers that go nowhere and don't really have any room to wiggle in the intended conversation. This is the problem: the lack of reciprocated communication.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Added due to recommendation from the comments: My sister (as far as I know) is currently supporting herself financially through her own savings. She is not working (she can't because of not having the right visa) and she's said (a while ago, so not sure if the situation's changed) that while her BF offers to pay for her expenses she's politely rejected his offers whenever she can. I don't know how much she actually has left in savings though, and she would probably ask our mum or dad for help if she began to run out.</p>

"How to start a friendship with a girl I have a crush on and rejected me, when we had a big fight and stopped talking","<p>I have a crush on a girl. We've had a big argument recently. It was her birthday a couple days ago, so I wished her a “Happy Birthday!”. She thanked me and I started to talk to her, stuff as “Cool, what did you do?”. However, she replied with “ur mom”, I misunderstood that, I did not realize she was trying to make me back off. After that, she removed me as a friend.</p>

<p>When I asked through a friend if she was angry with me, she said no, but she also said that I was talking to her too much. At this point, I was confused, because I've send her less than 50 text messages to her in total, and she often ends the conversation really quickly. Eventually, we started to really fight, becoming very disrespectful towards each other and worse. </p>

<p>I've decided to apologize a couple of days later. Two days after the argument, I sent a heartfelt video of me apologizing to her. In the video, I explained that I got frustrated and send rude messages because of that, and I have a problem of not thinking before sending those kind of messages. Following this video, she said she forgives me, but she also said she never wants to talk to me again.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago, I told her my feelings. She seemed to reply in a low-key fashion way. I'm over the rejection now and only wish to be friends, but I didn't realize she was trying to make me to back of, and as a result she maybe thinks I'm a bad guy. I just wanted to start a conversation with her, she always puts a stop to it very quickly. I want to be friends with her, but it seems that it's impossible now. She still me on Instagram and removed me as a friend on Snapchat, so I think there's no hope to start a friendship with her.</p>

<p>So I thought I would reach out here, see if anyone has had this situation before. I don’t know what to do right now, and I'm worry that everything I do is just making things worse. <strong>How can I open the conversation again with this girl to become her friend?</strong></p>

"How would one explain to a friend that even if they're accepted to a University, it's probably not a good idea to attend?","<p>It's difficult to put into words without sounding mean or judgemental, but I honestly have no idea how else to put this. Just note that I only have the best intentions for everyone and wish for the best case scenario.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I have a friend who I've always felt strange about. Whenever we chat, it always felt like some of the things I asked of her just didn't compute for her. This commonly occurred when I asked her to justify her opinions that she expressed. Usually, she wouldn't be able to in a manner that conveyed logic. All of her opinions sounded like she was just regurgitating BuzzFeed/Tabloid opinions.</p>

<p>Despite this, she was accepted into a few universities, so I didn't think much of it. I assumed that she must've been very smart academically (math, writing, who knows?). This all changed about a few hours ago.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this same friend is deciding to switch universities (for the 3rd time). Incidentally, we're applying to the same school. About a few days before the application deadline, she asked me to review her application.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised that someone who has so much experience applying to universities (and getting in too!) was asking the help of a community college sophomore with below average writing skills. </p>

<p>However, when I read her essay, I was completely dumbfounded. I am not a good writer, but even I could tell it was a terrible essay. She talked about celebrities, <em>anime</em> and tap-danced around sensitive racial subjects with ignorance I have never witnessed before. <em>In a personal statement essay</em>. The essay reeked of informality, lack of direction and any common sense. </p>

<p>When I asked her for her previous college application essays, they were significantly better in both vocabulary, sentence complexity, and story-telling. Almost as if they were written by a completely different person. When I asked her about this contrast, I was right: both of her previous essays were written by two separate friends. In other words, she got into the universities because of essays she didn't even write.</p>

<p>Attending these Universities were in no way beneficial to her either. She still has no idea what she wants to major in and her average GPA was barely 3.0. I almost felt bad for her. Being a sucker for guilt, I did the same task as her other two friends did. We stayed up late into the night and submitted the essay minutes before the deadline.</p>

<p>Now, I realize I was screwing my friend over if she got accepted into the university. Like her previous two friends, I was setting her up for failure. </p>

<p>Now, I'm just a mere community college student with a lot less university experience, but my grades are near perfect and I've peer-reviewed essays for a few of my friends that got accepted so I feel that I have some weight to my words/questions:</p>

<p>A) [Should I/Do I have the right to] tell her the following:</p>

<p>B) If I [should/do], how do I tell her that the University she's going to (if accepted) probably isn't going to work out for her if previous Universities didn't? To an extent, I am unafraid to bruise her feelings and I think she can take it. But how do I word it for minimal bruising?</p>

<p>Before any confusion happens: she's not a bad friend or bad person. Outside of this, I enjoy spending time with her in our social circles. I honestly think she's just desperate. Her father is also a PhD from MIT, so I imagine the pressure for her is pretty intense too. I don't think he knows she's doing poorly in school and I believe he's under the impression that the essays she submitted to previous universities were written by her.</p>

"How can I talk about positive circumstances in my life without hurting coworkers who are in the opposite situation?","<p>Several times in the past, I've had a bit of good news which I'd like to share at work (or at least not actively hide). The issue is that often, a colleague is struggling in the same domain. I know how uncomfortable this can be from the other side, since when I was going through a difficult divorce I was invited (with everyone else) to a colleague's wedding reception. I knew it would be too difficult so I didn't RSVP either way and nothing was ever said about it.</p>

<p>Here's a couple of cases of 'awkward' interactions I have been involved with:</p>

<h2>Financial</h2>

<p>My colleague and I report to the same manager, but he's a 'standard' Web Developer and I'm a 'Senior' Web Developer and as a senior I earn a bit more. I'm also about 10 years older than he is and single and childless by choice. He has expressed (to me and other people) concerns about money, as he has a young family and a stay-at-home-mom wife, and worries how to pay all the bills. For example, he asks us (co-workers) if we can recommend cheap places to get car maintenance done.. etc. [nb: I don't have any influence over his salary and he knows that - I don't think it's a ""passive aggressive"" request for more money or anything like that!]</p>

<p>I now feel uncomfortable around him mentioning money I've spent on anything that may be seen as ""non-essential"". I have much more disposable income, but I feel self-conscious mentioning anything about something I did (e.g. buying a new laptop, getting the kitchen replaced with new units) as I think he probably wouldn't have the spare income for that. (We are Web Developers so it's normal to be geeks about laptops and stuff, maybe not so much about kitchens and such like.)</p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>My boss (different job) is going through a fairly involved breakup and divorce. Court cases and stuff.</p>

<p>I'm in a relatively new (3 years) relationship talking (to my partner) about engagement etc, but I don't feel like I can bring it up in the office. (It's standard in this workplace to bring in ""cakes in the kitchen"" to celebrate events like that but now I feel like I should keep it quiet.. to what extent? Getting married secretly?!)</p>

<h2>Work achievements:</h2>

<p>Co-worker has failed the certification exam for a particular technology (that is used in the company) a couple of times. I took the exam and passed it easily the first time.</p>

<p>There's a process to notify certification success to HR and it gets published on our Intranet. There's also a financial reward. However, I'm conscious of how co-worker will feel having failed a couple of times if I ""bask"" in the success of that. So I am wondering whether to ""conceal"" the achievement for the sake of co-worker's feelings. [and miss out on the money.. about $100 so not huge.]</p>

<hr>

<p>I'd prefer to not have to hide or edit out my life, but do not wish to hurt my colleagues. Having that in mind: <strong>How do I mention good news (for me) at work when there are co-workers who are struggling in the domain where I'm succeeding ?</strong></p>

<p>I replied that ""I agree. Especially if your anime were going to be filler-ridden anyway"". I actually agree that Toei should have made it because they know how to make an anime with filler bearable or even good, not sarcasm that means Toei is a bad choice because Toei only made anime full of fillers.

The teachers at school addressed me as a male, classmates didn't want to play with me because I was ""odd"", but a short haircut was what I had.</p>

<p>Seventh grade I made a huge scandal at my mum's hairdresser, and since then I've been growing out my hair. Nowadays I'm 30, and my hair is curls that go to my waist (or to below my hindquarters if I gently pull on a strand to stretch it to its full length). I love my hair. I'm not very confident about my appearance, but my hair is the one thing I think is beautiful.</p>

<p>My mum, however, still thinks I should get a pixie cut. She misses no opportunity to say that my hair is ""a mess"", ""a bird's nest"", that it makes me look ""unsophisticated"" and ""like a dirty hobo"". Also that I ""waste"" a huge amount of time taking care of it, where a pixie cut is much easier and faster to wash etc.</p>

<p>I have tried telling my mum how I feel about my hair, and how her comments are really unpleasant to me. She waves it off as ""bullshit"". My little brother (19) has told her more than once that he is uncomfortable with how she treats the issue. No results. She's right, I'm wrong, it's for my best, eventually I'll realise it and get a pixie cut like she says.<br>
I've also tried mentioning how my grandma always tells my mum that she's fat, and asked my mum whether she finds it pleasant. My mum's response? ""But she's right""! (She's European size 42 - not fat at all.)</p>

We do ""girls vacations"", she asks my advice about things about as often as I ask hers, generally we agree on things, I drop by to visit my parents about once a week + family outings.

"Is it impolite to exchange a dialogue via text in a professional environment?","<p>I have been had several experiences in a professional environment where contact is initiated by e-mail or via some form of social media (LinkedIn, WhatsApp, ...), where the person on the other side asks for a phone discussion. The reason they give for wanting to have this phone discussion is to ask some trivial questions that I feel could easily be asked and answered through a single e-mail or via the same chat where the contact was initiated.</p>

<p>In general I usually prefer text communication since I can't always speak freely over the phone, especially during work hours when I have to avoid bothering coworkers. Another factor is of time zone differences and then there's the fact that I often can't really understand people very well over the phone. Often, the sound quality on a phone call is too low for me to discern words well. </p>

<p>I sometimes get the impression from people that they are bothered by the text exchanges. I personally reserve the phone discussions for subjects that need an expedited response. </p>

"How can I wait in line for the bathroom without crowding people as they exit?","<p>When I'm in a public establishment and there's a wait for the bathroom, I prefer not to stand too close to the door, because then I'm right in the face of the person exiting.</p>

"How do I interact with a person at a bare minimum level without seeming excessively rude?","<p>How do I interact with a person at a bare minimum level without seeming excessively rude?</p>

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>I had an incident a couple months ago where a friend of mine told me that a person <strong>Yanny</strong> from our university had accused me of doing some rather horrible things to my ex from two years ago. </p>

<p>This person is quite close with my ex and they might be having some sort of relationship. After some probing of my friend for what was said, I found out that <strong>Yanny</strong> hadn't said much, but implied that I had done terrible things (terrible enough that my friend assumed physical abuse or worse). </p>

<p>Our break up was not pretty, and we did some stupid things, the both of us. My worst mistake was not breaking it up sooner and getting to the point where I rummaged through her things and read through her texts at some point when my trust in her was completely gone (yeah really dumb I know definitely a low point in my life). Under no circumstances did I ever though, in any way, threaten her physically or anything of the sort.</p>

<p>Anyhow, over the following three days I had an extended talk over text with this <strong>Yanny</strong>. He initially wanted me to profusely apologise for what I had done to my ex in the previous relationship (the invasion of her privacy). I explained to him that this is between me and her and none of his business (in a more polite way).</p>

<p>When he wouldn't listen I told him that we had already talked about all these things with my ex and that I thought that I had definitely crossed a line and apologised for it and stated that if she ever wanted to talk about this I'd be open to that. I also still added that this was none of his business and it was a two year old matter anyhow, him opening old wounds would not bring anything good to anyone's life. I also stated that it is a really sucky thing to do, to imply that I'd have abused my ex or something worse. </p>

<p>Finally he did come around apologising himself. I asked if he had said similar things to other people during these two years and he denied it at least (I don't know whether to believe him though, it's not an easy thing to admit).</p>

<hr>

<p>My friend who brought this to my attention is now more cautious around me (we weren't super close to begin with but he's an honest guy), maybe looking for signs of me to be some sort of covert abuser. My friend also contacted another mutual friend of ours on this and she advised him to have a little faith me and talk to me (and good that he did). I feel like this put some strain on my relationship with that other friend as well. </p>

<p>I have had a couple of months from this incident, but university is starting soon. I'll have to inevitably spend time with this <strong>Yanny</strong> person but I find myself still feeling angry and hurt. I feel like this person has crossed boundaries and I have trouble forgiving him. </p>

<p>I don't know how I can handle being with him in the same space and social circles (he's well enough liked). I will see him quite a lot in different extracurricular activities since we share a lot of friends in university. 
For example we go running together for an hour or so each week and have movie nights together. Also in the student commons area we see nearly every day.</p>

<p>I'd really prefer to just not interact with him at all and forget about him and this nonsense, but it's hard since we have so much overlap in university life. 
How do I interact with <strong>Yanny</strong> so that I can seem as little rude as possible and still minimize any contact with him, especially in events that last longer periods of time?</p>

"How to communicate to a new coworker that I am not comfortable being touched?","<p>Last week a new coworker joined our team, and yesterday we were both invited to eat lunch in the work cafeteria with some other colleagues that I have known for around a year and a half. As he, another colleague that I know quite well (and would describe as a friend) and I all went to leave through a small section between two counters, he put his hand on my back (kind of as though pushing me with what felt like a finger or a few fingers, and with pressure).</p>

<p>He is an Italian man who has moved to England from Italy for this job, and I am an English woman. I am aware that in Italy it is more common for people to have more physical contact with each other, and while I would maybe be comfortable with a close friend touching me on the back (though I am not sure as no friends have touched me anywhere other than maybe on the arms in a long time), I wouldn't really expect it from a coworker I'd only met the week before and so naturally I was confused and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>In attempt to communicate my confusion at being touched to him, I stopped walking and gave him a sort of confused and unhappy look, but all he said was ""you first"", as in, he was touching me on the back to allow me to step through the counter first. However, the way to communicate this here is more commonly by stepping back to let the other person pass and maybe saying ""you first"", it doesn't generally involve touching anyone. I should probably also mention that I wasn't stood in front of him, I was stood sort of to his left, which made it even stranger to me that he would touch me there.</p>

<p>Whilst I don't want to make it awkward by bringing it up now, how can I communicate in the future that I feel the way I am being touched is inappropriate, without embarrassing both of us as I feel like he doesn't really know that what he's doing is inappropriate? Clearly non-verbally isn't the correct way to go about this as he continued to touch my back, and I don't think I could reach to remove his hand as it was right in that middle point of my back where it's not easy to reach, so how would be best to approach this sort of situation if it arises in the future?</p>

"Asking a coworker to chitchat somewhere else","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I work in an open space and people there chitchat fairly often. I do it, my coworkers do it and everyone is fine with that (even if it can be a bit annoying IMO).</p>

<p>Today, one of my coworkers was chitchatting with another one and their chat was making me very anxious. They were talking about discrimination and there was some friction between them (they weren't really arguing, but not really agreeing either). </p>

<p>Since I didn't know how to politely ask them to go chat elsewhere without being seen as a killjoy, I ended up leaving the room (hoping that they would have finished talking about that when I would come back).</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How could I have asked them to go chat elsewhere without being seen as a killjoy?</p>

<p>Or without being seen as ""fake"" because I also chitchat in the open space about those topics sometimes? </p>

<h2>My relationship with those coworkers</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>One of this coworker (let's call them ""Alex"") is my ""work-neighbor"" (sitting next to each other) and we have a nice relationship. We chitchat often and even talk about discrimination together (which I'm fine with, especially because we share the same point of view so talking about this isn't tiring for me).</p>

<p>Alex doesn't know that I have anxiety issues but I wouldn't have a problem disclosing it to them.</p></li>
<li><p>The other coworker (let's call them ""Otty"") is new here. They are very polite and seem nice (from what I have seen so far). </p>

<p>Otty doesn't know that I have anxiety issues either and I am not planning on telling them (because I don't know them enough). </p></li>

"Why is this random act of kindness considered offensive flirting?","<p>In <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/18643/"">Offering to share my umbrella without sounding creepy</a> op, assumed to be a man, shares an umbrella with a woman because it's raining a lot. For some reason good portion of the response to this question revolves around flirting. </p>

<p>Given the situation, I don't understand why this is considered flirting at all. Furthermore, the top answer for this question mentions giving the woman the umbrella when she wants to part ways so she won't get wet. I'll be honest. This move is pure class from my point of view. It's just something you do if you're not going to walk another couple of miles in the rain. The issue is that in the last sentence of this paragraph the answerer mentions a date being a possible result of this action.</p>

<p>What followed this was a bunch of push back from who I can only assume to be women about how this was bad. None of the people who had a problem with this actually engaged with the act of giving someone else an umbrella. All of the comments were about the inclusion of a possibility of a date being a massive problem. Even the mod who deleted said string of comments asked for it to be removed. </p>

<p>Why is the suggestion of a date being a possible outcome of an interaction so offensive?</p>

<p>There are a few other answers to this question which also state that op seems to have been flirting and such kindness would have made the answerers uncomfortable. I just don't get it.</p>

"How do I respectfully ask my co-worker if he had received false negative feedback made on my account?","<p>Recently I have noticed that the relationship I had built with a co-worker seemed to be eroding. One of the possible reasons might be my manager giving false negative feedback to him on my account. Some context can be found in this <a href=""https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/115314/how-can-i-deal-with-abuse-by-my-boss"">post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>My goal</strong> is to strengthen a good working relationship with him. </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>:
He was the manager of my partner team. One of his team members was assigned to my project and “report” to me in this project. Our regular interactions involve weekly group meetings with all parter teams and managers and ad-hoc work assignment/brainstorm meetings.</p>

<p>We have been working together for three quarters. In the first two quarters we had built rapport. Discussions were open and productive, and we both gave each other high performance ratings and positive feedback in our official performance review reports. Outside of work, we also had a few very enjoyable chats at our company lunch where we about similar workout hobbies and books. Knowing a little bit how he sees the world and himself in it, I have a lot of respect for him as a person. </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: </p>

<p>Starting this quarter, my manager had been sharing with me “constructive feedback” that she claimed this coworker had privately given her. In the beginning, it definitely planted some seeds of mistrust and resentment in me, as I didn’t feel it was fair to only see one side of the story.</p>

<p>But I started to realize it might be her abusive tactics to sabotage the working relationship between me and him. My reasons are that 1) there was no private feedback from him in previous quarters. ; 2) she has demonstrated consistent behaviors of making false comments. It’s likely that she was lying about this too. 3) I’m not sure about her intent, but it’s possible she witnessed our rapport and somehow was not happy about it. </p>

<p>It’s also likely she was doing the the same to him behind my back, giving negative feedback to him made on my account. </p>

<p><strong>Other symptoms:</strong></p>

<p>He used to back me up in meetings, but recently his comments were almost always against mine. Sometime my suggestions and questions were just dismissed.</p>

<p>Our recent work communication has not been as effective as before. It seems that he was not opening up with me about his true opinions. </p>

<p><strong>My question</strong>: </p>

<p>How do I respectfully check with him if he had received some negative feedback made on my account? How do I ask if he had given feedback about me to my manager? </p>

<p>I think the best way to build trust is open communication. However, I do not feel comfortable revealing the weird dynamic with my manager. It might stir up a lot of emotions in me and I might be perceived as having personal problems with my manager instead of being objective. However, without that important context, I’m not sure if I’d come across as genuine. </p>

"Can I get my coworkers to consider using new techniques at work?","<p>I work in a small team of 5 web developers.</p>

<p>The team currently is used to using some poor and outdated coding and work practices that make development harder and inconvenient, and overall make our jobs more difficult and take longer. For example, all our code is in a few huge files, making it hard to find anything. Soon we will be working on a bigger project. </p>

<p>I would like to introduce my team to using modern js development. I already use modern JS development in my personal projects. Personally I think using better and newer technologies and practices will make our work better and more efficient and improve our experience.</p>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong>  </p>

<p>2 coworkers are my superiors (aka ""senior developers"") who are set in their ways and don't know anything about the technologies that I want to use.  They think up to date practices like automated tests are not useful and laugh at people who talk about these ""useless"" things. Other coworkers already know these technologies and would also be happy to use them.</p>

<p>He came to me a few weeks ago and expressed concerns that an important goal of his team was not progressing and that I and my peers should give it some priority. He seemed to be stressed about it. I explained that the task was actually blocked by another team and in fact I had been the one to push it forward. I also tried to reassure him by sharing the concrete steps that team was taking. He seemed to be relieved, smiled, said great and left. I thought we were good. </p>

<p>However, only a few days later he raised the same issue again in a group meeting with my peers without any acknowledgement of our previous conversation or specific action requests. </p>

<p>It made me feel really frustrated for a few reasons: </p>

<p>First, I was not sure how our conversation had landed with him. Was he not happy about the next steps I had scoped out? Did he need more support from my peers? Did he not trust me? </p>

<p>Second, I had gone extra miles to support his goal and there had been zero acknowledgement or appreciation. </p>

<p>Lastly, I was surprised to hear that he was misinformed in the first place, as his team member was working directly with me and they should be very much aligned on the progress, blockers and next steps. It made me think whether there is a process issue. I thought about possible reasons and suggested two solutions to him but none was taken.</p>

"When someone refuses to acknowledge they hurt you, what can you do to move past it?","<p>Emotional wounds cannot heal without an apology from the person who hurt you. If the person who hurt you does not ever acknowledge that, the emotional wound is left unresolved and it can really leave lasting aftereffects on your perception of the world and how you act towards other human beings.</p>

<p>When the person who  has wronged you feels absolutely no remorse for what they did to you, feels that they were 100% in the right, and will under no circumstances will ever take responsibility for their action, what should you do? I feel like trying to repress or forget about it is not a good way to deal with it. I feel like the conventional wisdom of ""don't be bitter; hanging onto hatred for a past wrong only poisons your emotional health; learn to forgive people, not for their sake but for yours"" is sort of a cop-out because the person who wronged you will feel completely free to do that sort of thing again in the future to other people because they will never face consequences for their actions. If someone were to steal from you, or sexually assault you, or cheat on you, or any possible thing that would hurt you physically or emotionally, there's nothing you can do to bring emotional resolution? Trying to get an apology out of them would only result in them either deflecting blame or giving an insincere apology to try to get out of trouble. Do you just have to accept that this person will never issue you an apology or acknowledge that they hurt you? You just have to eat the cost of a deep emotional/psychological scar?</p>

<p><strong>Main question/goal</strong>: What can you do to let go mentally and emotionally of someone's wrongdoing against you? So that it is not something that you are still bothered by, not something that you give too much thought to. With the main constraint being that they will never apologize.</p>

"How to suggest alternative music for my children to sing at my grandmother's religious funeral?","<p>My religious maternal grandmother passed away recently and my mother is involved in planning the services which will be held at a chapel and presided over by the religious minister. My mother just informed me that they are planning a musical number for the great grandchildren to sing and that it will likely be <a href=""https://www.lds.org/music/library/childrens-songbook/families-can-be-together-forever?lang=eng&amp;_r=1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Families Can Be Together Forever</a>.</p>

<p>The song is about how families that share gospel belief and ceremonies can live together after death.</p>

<p>My wife, our young children, and I left the church several years ago. Losing my bedrock of faith, confronting my mortality, and losing the possibility of an afterlife with my own family was challenging and heart wrenching. Hearing  ""Families Can Be Together Forever"" now causes me significant stress. I cannot bear the discord of my children singing to a crowd a song extolling an afterlife that this religion teaches they can never have a part in because of their family's lack of belief.</p>

<p>My first thought was to politely decline, but I am concerned about my children being excluded from a significant ceremony while their cousins are singing at the podium.</p>

<p>It would be simple to just politely decline, but I'm considering a response of the form:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I would love my children to participate if they could sing a non-denominational song. Maybe Somewhere Over The Rainbow, or Amazing Grace?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems like it would increase the possibility of my children participating in a meaningful manner. On the other hand, this is a religious ceremony planned by a religious family, and the black sheep of the family suggesting secular music for the services in this emotional time could be seen as disruptive and self-serving.</p>

"How can I reject volunteers that aren't a great fit for the job?","<p>I am involved with a local SF con, and I will be running the Info Desk, which has been defunct for a few years.   (Volunteer Desk guy would try to handle questions while doing everything else he did, and Info Desk was just a place where programs and maps were stacked up for people to take them.)</p>

<p>Basically it means hours of sitting behind a small folding table, answering questions for attendees (helping them interpret the map or know where the named-rooms are (often on other floors than the obvious ones)), knowing if any celebrities have changed their schedule, forwarding people to other appropriate departments if needed. </p>

<p>Most of the time I'll be staffing it with my husband, and I have asked a few other friends to indicate that I'm their target department.  There's also always a good number of just-a-few-hour volunteers that we can borrow to cover for us for short times.</p>

<p>I'm on an alumni-of-a-deceased-con group (we all used to staff it, but this group of cons was cancelled).  A lot of them have worked at a LOT of other cons, and attend even more, so I posted asked for any ""best practices"" they've seen, anything for me to add to the standard expectations.  </p>

<p>Alas, one guy's response was ""hire my son - he's great at Info desk!""  Nope, not so much.  No pre-information gathering, no keeping up with changes.  It was his 3rd year of this particular con at that particular hotel even, but he still was lost on ""where are the restrooms"", much less the more complicated questions about celebrity signings/photos.  No providing a schedule of who (within our tiny crew) was available when.  </p>

<p>So my response was ""No offense, but I think I work better with others.""  I'm cringing.</p>

<p>On one hand, my former-instructor self wants to advise him on what DOES make an awesome Info Desk, and just inheriting a magic sense of it from his father (who has been chair and president of some nearby cons) doesn't do it.  It's about research, and not being afraid to contact people until you know you have the <em>right</em> information to pass on to people. (example: photo-ops were pre-paid only -- no purchase available at the con, but he was saying ""just get in line and you never know."")  Sociability is part of it, sure, and a distinct hat? Great!  But INFO is the part of the name that I focus on.</p>

<p>If I didn't want to see some of the other panels, and if I knew I don't burn out by the last day of the con, I'd ONLY have my husband and I staff the desk.  It's not like there's any formal procedure like if this were A Job.  (Yes, we talk about ""staffing"" and ""hiring"" but except for top-level stuff, it's more about declaring a role and not being refused.)</p>

"How to ask my ex if she has a dependence relationship with me?","<p>I had a friend with benefits for almost one year who eventually became my girlfriend even though I didn't see her as so, I could say it was just by routine, we were seeing just each her and doing ""couple"" things so we started dating, even though we never talked about it. Let's call her Jennifer.</p>

<p>Jennifer's family situation is not good. Her brother is a drug addict and her father abandoned them and her mother. Moreover her family is poor. And she has little to no friends, I am the closest friend she has.</p>

<p>Even if we were dating, I didn't have strong feelings for her, I was not even in love and I was embarrassed to be seen with her as she is not beautiful. I know this is a stupid thing and I shouldn't care about what others say but I do.</p>

<p>Also, at that time (and still) I liked another girl who lives far away from me (different continents) so I can't have any kind of relationship with her. I have liked this girl for 2 years and a half now, but still I am not sure if I am in love with her or not, distance is such a big obstacle to me and she has a boyfriend. Let's call her Sophie. Sophie is my best friend. And the 3 of us are in our 20s.</p>

<p>The thing is that at the beginning, when I was seeing Jennifer as friends with benefits everything was fine as I could still see other girls at discos and so on, but Jennifer was not happy with that and we started an exclusive relationship. Some time after it, I met with one friend and we decided to go to the beach, so I cheated on her but I didn't say anything to her at that time. I know it's not good. </p>

<p>Also, I went on a trip with Sophie and I really wanted to be with her (physically talking) because I really find her so attractive and I like her personality lot, even more than Jennifer, Sophie asked me if I wouldn't feel bad about Jennifer and honestly I wouldn't have regretted it. Talking with her she told me I should tell Jennifer about me cheating on her and I completely agree, my family also told me I should. </p>

<p>When I came from the trip I told Jennifer about cheating on her and that I didn't see her as a girlfriend, she was so upset and I thought we would not even be friends but eventually we are going out every weekend to the cinema as friends and I am even sleeping at her home from time to time. Now, I don't have any problem with that, I have my feelings for her clear and I just see her as a friend or a friend with benefits, nothing else. I still like Sophie most, both her personality and physique.</p>

<p>But from this time on, I am starting to be worried of this behavior as could be a sign of her having a dependence relationship with me. As I have said she doesn't have many friends and her situation is difficult. But, at the same time, it feels weird for me that she wants to have contact after cheating on her and telling her that I don't like her as a girlfriend. </p>

<p>My question and goal is how can I gently ask her about it without breaking the friendship we have now? I don't want her to be in love with me again or something because it is not going to be the same way with me, and I wouldn't like to hurt her again. How could I approach her? </p>

Life has been very difficult for me this year; anxiety, depression, hospitalizations, outpatient hospital visits, health issues, financial difficulties and minor relational problems with my husband which I believe are really a result of all my above listed problems. I'd really like for my online relationship to move back into the realm of friends. He's dealing with some struggles as well and has been very open and honest with me about them. He's actively working towards improving his life as well.  I really want to maintain a friendship with this guy. We did well as friends in the beginning. Do you think it's possible for me to do this?</p>

"How to talk about what religious denomination you belong to without making the person uncomfortable?","<p>I recently came into contact with some close relatives (my paternal grandparents) that I've never met and we've been talking on the phone and over email for a month or so. I sent them pictures of my daughter's birthday party.</p>

<p>My husband and I are Catholic. We are not religious zealots and not 100% devout but I still go to church every Sunday and we are going to send our kids to Catholic school. This is usually something I don't tell many people or talk to people about because it can be a source of conflict. Especially coworkers and people I don't know very well. </p>

<p>Some people are uncomfortable with religion and if you tell them what religion you are they might feel like you are going to try to convert them or they might dislike the religious denomination that you belong to.</p>

<p>My son's baptism is this weekend and it's a big event. I want to send my newfound grandparents pictures of the baptism but I'm concerned that this could cause conflict. Given that my husband is Irish and I'm a Canadian of Romanian ancestry it could easily be inferred that it's a good chance that we could be Catholic.</p>

<p>How to bring this topic up with them without making them feel uncomfortable? I don't think they have any religious leanings. Is it necessary to hide it and how can I deal with any negative reactions?</p>

<p>Edit: my maternal grandparents were the Catholic Romanian ones. I have only just came into contact with my paternal grandparents who are Canadian. They have very distant UK ancestry. </p>

"How can one stop dubious advances of a married former partner without hurting them a lot?","<p>I am sorry if this is a duplicate, the closest situation I could find here is <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/10570/asking-an-ex-girlfriend-out-to-coffee-now-that-shes-married-and-has-a-child"">this one.</a> This is a bit long but given that I am not entirely sure if there was any advance to be concerned about in the first place, I think it is important.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>I was friends with <em>Alice</em> for a couple of years back when I was in High School and we enjoyed each other's company a lot. We dated casually for a while till we eventually drifted apart because we were both young and wanted to explore other possibilities and of course, college. That was 2010. It was not a bad break up or anything, we parted on amiable terms, but as it happens, we got out of touch entirely over the years. </p>

<p>Only <em>contact</em> that I have had with her since then was through mutual friends. Heard she met another guy and married about three years ago. </p>

<p>But then I got a text from her a few days ago (Please note all the communication below is via social media, we both live in different cities now). I found that odd but I was happy to catch up with her. I asked her if she needed something, she replied she only wanted to see how I was doing. I asked about her new life, found out she's a mum now and dropped out of college for some reason. She asked me if I was seeing someone, I answered honestly that I wasn't. </p>

<p>The <em>catching up</em> continued well onto the next day so again, I asked her subtly that why is she contacting me after all these years. She first gave me the old ""catching up"" reason but later admitted that her husband was abroad for some reason and she's been feeling rather lonely. To handle that, she says, she decided to use this time to catch up with all the friends she's gotten out of touch with lately.</p>

<p>It's not that I didn't enjoy talking to her again but something just felt off. Knowing her, I knew she will tell me what's wrong when she wants to. And she did, a couple of days later she told me about her marital issues, how she and her husband were drifting apart and how her husband is a suspicious/smothering kind of person. She drew parallels between me and her husband and how we are so different and he does not appreciate her at all. I listened, because well, I wasn't asked for an advice and it's not my place to meddle in her personal affairs. </p>

<p>The breaking point was when she asked me to switch to another app. I asked why's that? She replied that she doesn't want her husband to find out that we have been talking because of his suspicious nature. I told her that if her husband is not okay with her doing that, she should not be doing that without taking him in confidence. What followed was an emotional deluge. She went into extreme details about how she is unhappy with him, how her life is crumbling apart and how she is not trying to cheat on her husband, she just wants to be heard by someone she knows who cares, who values her etc. I spent the next fifteen minutes talking her into discussing all this with her husband and reminding her if she really wants her son to grow up in a broken family (She's always had strong views on a strong traditional family). She just wouldn't stop asking me to stay in contact with her. I told her that while I can't stop her from going behind her husband's back and possibly sabotaging her marriage, I refuse to be a part of it. With that I said goodbye. I got a few calls which I did not receive and then another call the next day that she is trying to stop bothering me but it is hard for her. I told her that's because it's the right thing and that I did not wish to be in any form of contact with her if she was going to keep it a secret from her husband. And after that I did not hear from her but she sounded pretty hurt.</p>

<h3>The Question</h3>

<p>I think I did the right thing but I still feel like I did it horribly. Of course it was going to hurt but she seemed very distressed. The ship's sailed but I'd still like to know if I could have done it in a better way?</p>

<p>My goal was:</p>

<ol>
<li>To convey to Alice that while I am not seeing anyone at the moment, I just don't feel that way about her any longer. </li>
<li>To firmly establish that I won't get into any sort of ""secret relation"" with her without accusing her that she is trying to cheat on her husband given that I am not entirely sure if that's what she wanted.</li>
<li>As a former friend, I do have her interests at my heart and I don't want her to throw away her marriage like that. If she wants to end things with her husband, she should do precisely that instead of seeking out former romantic interests to stay in touch with her secretly.</li>
</ol>

"How to reassure my boyfriend","<p>My boyfriend and I have been together 4 months and my anxiety is ruining our relationship. When we have a slight clash of opinions/different viewpoints it triggers my anxiety and it will turn into a full blown argument. <em>Or</em> I will read into things, assume he is angry with me, and constantly seek reassurance, which in turn annoys him, and then we have an argument.</p>

<p>I am about to enter therapy to deal with my anxiety. My boyfriend <strong>seems</strong> worried about this. Note: I may be mind reading but I had my initial assessment on Monday and that night I went to see him and he <strong>seemed</strong> off/a little more quiet and different, didn't want to have sex etc. he then proceeded to ask what was talked about in the initial assessment and seemed worried when I said she asked questions like 'do you feel depressed?' I <strong>assume</strong> he is feeling worried because I am going to therapy because of our relationship. </p>

<p>I could ask him 'how do you feel about me going to therapy?' but since he doesn't appear to like discussing feelings (because when we have in the past it escalated) I assume he will say fine. </p>

<p>I guess what I am asking is, is there a way where I can reassure him that the therapy is to better <strong>myself</strong> and is not going to ruin our relationship? </p>

"Girlfriend won't let me pay for her. How can I approach the situation?","<p>My girlfriend's parents won't pay for outside school classes she wants to take (like singing, for example) and I really want to be able to give it to her. There is something I can afford, but she won't let me pay for her no matter how hard I tried to get her to. </p>

<p>It's really hard for me watching her parents ignoring her feelings and needs. I want to be able to supply for her and though I'm unable to pay for everything, I can pay for this particular little thing. It would make me so happy to do so. It's devastating she won't let me. How can I show her how much this means to me? How can I start a conversation about this?</p>

<p><strong>Additional information</strong> (as requested) </p>

<p>Apparently money is an issue at her home. She is having a very hard time with the idea of ""taking from me"" even if not asked for. Apparently, it is nearly impossible for her to cope with paying with my money. </p>

<p>Her parents are really strict. They have a specific idea about her career (being a doctor) and anything that is not connected with that (e.g. singing, acting) is a privilege. Also, they really discourage her from doing stuff she likes and that is not what they like (e.g. singing, acting, dancing). 
Her mother does claim she is short on money, but it seems she might have a shopping addiction, along with poor management of her own money. I wouldn't be surprised if I found she has a negative balance in the bank. She repeatedly pays for stuff she probably can't afford and even makes her daughter feel bad for being a burden. (""I pay for all your stuff, the least you can do is.."") 
Apparently, she sometimes borrows money from her daughter (which she worked for on holidays and school vacations) and doesn't pay her back with the same excuse.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural and age differences</strong></p>

<p>I'm almost 19 and she is 17, but she is noticeably more mature than I am. We are both from Haifa, Israel. Note that legal age is 18, so she is still legally under her parents' care. Though we are from the same place (and even the same school) the way we were raised and educated by our parents are totally different. Firstly, Israel is a pretty new country in which most of the citizens live for only 2 generations. My family is from Iraq and hers from Hungary, which is a great difference in the Israeli society. Hungarians are considered ""Ashkenazic"" and Iraqis are considered ""Mizrahi"". It was claimed that the ""Mizrahi"" people were discriminated against by ""Ashkenazic"", but her mother claims to accept all cultures. Though her repeated mention of my race and culture in the ears of her daughter hints otherwise... I should say that we are both (me and my girlfriend) more connected to the western culture than anything else.</p>

<p>Also, her parents are much older than mine and are practically from a generation before my own. I was raised pretty liberally while her parents are very strict and treat her more like a property than a human being with feelings.</p>

"How do I get someone to call me by the name I prefer?","<p>Let's say my name is Fred. My family and friends call me that and when I introduce myself I use that name. Well, of course you can imagine that I'm registered as Frederick, but nobody calls me that. I don't like that name because I don't think it represents me.</p>

<p>To get to the point: I met the parents of a friend the other day (important: they are very religious people), and when I introduced myself (as Fred of course) the following conversation took place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Them: Come again?<br>
  Me: Fred.<br>
  Them: <em>(puzzled face)</em>...<br>
  Me: Fred.<br>
  Them: Were you baptized as Fred?<br>
  Me <em>(Thinking they wanted to understand my name's origin)</em>: That was Frederick.<br>
  Them: Ah, so I thought! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They kept calling me Frederick the rest of the evening. I understand that they may believe that I offend some saint after whom I was baptized by making my name shorter, but I think it's my right to be called whatever I like.</p>

<p>So, I was wondering, is there a polite but firm way to express that I want to be called by a specific name and not a variation of it? </p>

<p>As I've asked why is so and tried to explain I have a bad feeling to go to that party as she is not inviting him as well, she is now really really pissed off like you wouldn't expect an adult person to behave and then old me ok then I do not have to join her and my other children.</p>

"When should I tell others that I'm divorced/separated?","<p>While at the moment I am technically still married, I have been separated from my ex for eight months or so, with divorce pending.  In certain situations, I find myself unsure of when/if to tell others about this change in my life, and asking myself, <strong>When should I tell others that I'm divorced/separated?</strong></p>

<p>I have told some close friends and family about the situation, but there are some people with whom I am not close, that I'd prefer to not have to deal with the uncomfortable conversations that inevitably result, should I broach the subject (or should I object if they reference our marriage).</p>

<p>The problem is that a lot of people I interact with are aware that I have been married (10 years), and so ask questions about my ex like, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is your wife doing? What is she up to lately? Is she done with school?  Can you tell her I said hi?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Usually, if it's a simple question referring to my ""wife,"" I just answer the question, because I just don't want to deal with any additional drama.  If I <em>were</em> to say anything like ""we're actually separated"" or ""we're actually in the middle of a divorce,"" I feel (proven out by experience) it will inevitably lead to other questions and comments that I don't want to answer, like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh no, I'm so sorry!  What happened? I can't believe it! Why are you getting divorced? You guys are so great together!  Why aren't you trying to work it out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One place this happens often is at my kids' elementary school, where I volunteer frequently.  As a result, a lot of people know me, and a fair amount of people also know my ex (though she is less active than me), which frequently leads to situations like the one mentioned above.</p>

<p>I actually told one guy at the school that I'm relatively good friends with about my situation and now he's repeatedly trying to convince me to get back together with her, which is not the desired experience I want to have multiplied 20 times over.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that the more I perpetuate the idea that we are together, when we are not, it's essentially giving credence to a non-truth.  But do I really have to have 100 mini-therapy sessions with each person to convey the reality of the situation?  Is there any way or time to bring this up that doesn't result in many uncomfortable follow up discussions?</p>

<p>One part of why I don't want to get into it with these people who are essentially just acquaintances is that the reason behind our divorce is due to repeated infidelity on the part of my ex, which I do not want to gossip over or potentially tarnish her reputation over.  I also obviously don't want it to reflect negatively on my children in any way.</p>

<p>In addition to the school scenario, I also have similar situations arise at work, but less frequently, and also with neighbors, etc.</p>

<p>In general, <strong>I just don't know when or how to bring up our divorce to people in our lives, in order to minimize the negative impact on myself, my ex, and our children.</strong>  Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

"How to politely notify in an online conversation that I am a woman?","<h2>Context</h2>

<p>I am a woman and I sometimes post things online, on Stack Exchange for instance. Usually, my posts are very neutral and do not provide any hint of my gender.</p>

<p>It seems that most people assume that I am a man since they refer to me by writing ""he"". I don't take it personally and I don't feel offended at all. I'm glad enough people answer my questions!</p>

<p>That being said, I'd like to politely inform people who mistake me for a man that I am actually a woman. I don't want it to sound aggressive because I don't really mind and it doesn't change anything to the answer, nonetheless I think they ought to know in order, maybe, to realize that there are also women here.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How do I let online people know I'm a woman when they're assuming I'm male, without being awkward? I'm not a native English speaker so I'm not even sure how to phrase it in a natural way (and to that extent, maybe I should have posted that question in the <em>English Language and Usage</em> SE site).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Additional details</h2>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>It is true that as a developer, I sometimes post on allegedly more masculine websites. Yet the last example I have is a question I wrote about my bathroom door that could not be closed properly (on <em>Lifehacks</em> site). Someone commented an answer that suggested a solution implying me drilling holes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>perhaps he lives in rented accommodation and can't modify?</p>

<p><strong>Completely harmless</strong>, but I'm still considering informing nicely the user of their mistake.</p>

<h3>How about changing my user profile?</h3>

<p>Some people pointed out that I could fill my profile or indicate my gender through my avatar or username. Indeed that way people would be less inclined to assume I’m a man. Nonetheless, I feel that it would just bypass the problem: I’m bothered by the fact that there are approximately half of human beings who are female and that I still should state my gender online in order not to be mistaken for a man. Moreover, I prefer gender neutral answers whenever the gender is not relevant, and the best way to get them is to have a neutral profile.</p>

"How do I ask for ""forgiveness"" after asking a good friend's ex out?","<p>See <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/10712/how-do-i-tactfully-ask-a-close-friend-out"">this question</a> for more context.</p>

<p>I plan on asking my friend Penny out. However, the tricky part of this situation is that Penny and my good friend Kyle dated for about a year. They broke up two months ago on good terms.</p>

<p>I developed romantic feelings for Penny around three months ago.</p>

<p>I don't want to ask Kyle's ""permission"" to ask Penny out because I believe that although they broke up on relatively good terms that Kyle <em>could</em> be spiteful and attempt to muddle things up. So instead, I plan on presenting him a fait accompli after asking Penny out if things work out with her. I want to ask for his ""forgiveness"" after the fact.</p>

<p>I don't want to hurt Kyle and I know that most likely this <em>will</em> hurt him in some way. I want to minimize the damage because I do consider him a very close friend.</p>

<p>My friendship with Kyle is casual in the sense that we never really talk about feelings/issues in our lives. It's mostly a friendship based on a mutual interest in technology and gaming, so conversations about relationships and especially something ""dramatic"" like this aren't something we're used to talking about.</p>

<p><strong>How do I ask for his ""forgiveness"" if things go well with Penny?</strong></p>

<p>I would appreciate knowing...</p>

<ul>
<li>What tone to approach the conversation with</li>
<li>Phrases/words are helpful/detrimental to helping him understand/cope</li>
<li>How to deal with potential aggression/other emotional outbursts</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm firm in my decision to use the ""forgiveness"" tactic. Also, I would expect Kyle to have the maturity level of an adult because he is one</p>

<p><em>Note: I have not asked Penny out yet. I just want to be prepared to have this conversation if/when the time comes.</em></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Although this isn't necessary, I'll try to provide a little more reasoning why I decided to go with the ""forgiveness"" route over the ""permission"" route. I'm a very anxious person. It's already hard enough for me to ask a girl out and I don't need someone potentially psyching me out of it. Kyle is my good friend, but given his feelings he might not be totally accepting of this situation which could easily make it impossible for me to ask her out. I know logically and emotionally that I want to ask her out, but in a way I have weak conviction. I want to set myself up for success with Penny and hearing my friend being upset about a decision that I personally find healthy and beneficial for me would make it a lot harder. I also have no idea if the feeling is mutual and would rather have my attempt go unheard if nothing happened.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> A little more clarification. Although Kyle obviously could misinterpret things, Penny has told me exactly why they broke up (lack of communication, Kyle's apathy, and other such things) and he knows as well. In fact, I had suggested that they have a bit of a ""postmortem"" together to be honest and share more about what went wrong in a civil manner. They're both aware of why it happened and although it wasn't mutual they both ended up staying good friends. I understand Kyle may misinterpret my advances as ""Wait, did we break up because of X, Y, Z or was it Steve?"", but given how much honesty they've given each other, I doubt (although it <em>could</em> happen) he will think that I was involved (because I wasn't).</p>

"How to set and enforce a divergent personal boundary for a single problematic person in an online group of people?","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I have been playing an online mobile phone game for about 3 years now. The game is about building a castle, an army, and you go and attack either other players or computer generated targets. In the very beginning, I had my own alliance and encountered a problem-player, someone who exhibited unacceptable behavior online. Rude remarks, constant belittling and verbal abuse from this player towards everyone in the alliance (but especially me) eventually led me to kick them from my alliance (which is the only way of blocking them from chat) and block their personal messages (which I have kept blocked since 2016).</p>

<p>A few months after that I gave up my own alliance and with the rest of my members joined a bigger one, so I could count on more assistance when building and defending my precious online castle. This group was (and still is!) awesome. We're all either Dutch or Belgians in an age range from 13 to 76. They taught me how to play the game most effectively, and we meet up once or twice a year for a barbecue. </p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>The problem player recently joined the alliance I'm currently in. I've immediately warned the current alliance leadership of my past problems with this player (they know all the details), yet we agreed that we would give this player a chance nonetheless based on recent in-game behavior indicating a change for the better. In the first few weeks, everything seemed fine. </p>

<p>But now this player is becoming a problem again, in both chat (which can't be blocked, but at least other people can 'defend' me there) but also by other behaviors towards me in the game that can't be handled by either the leadership or other players. Both the alliance leadership and I agree that their recent behavior is a problem <em>given our past interactions</em>, yet no-one is really sure how to handle setting the boundaries for this player only. </p>

<p>As they're not a problem towards the rest of the alliance (yet?), we really like to try and set, and consequently enforce, a boundary specifically for them. The problem with doing this, however, is that some of the behavior I won't tolerate from this player, is okay with me when coming from others I don't have the same past with (because then I know it's just a joke, or will be followed up with constructive feedback for example). It's a bit like creating a boundary allowing one of my brothers to tell me in the most insulting way they can come up with that my hair looks really bad today, but at the same time disallowing the other brother from even looking at it. </p>

<p>I have already tried telling them to stop what they're doing again, but it was received with a 'You're just being a drama queen, you're singling me out, if someone else is allowed to do this, I demand to be allowed to do this too. You're seeing malicious intent when there is none, leave me alone and take your grievances someplace else'. </p>

<p>That caused quite a disturbance in the group chat, most regular players are willing to help me without knowing the full story of our past. The leadership knows about my past, and they all want to help me set and enforce a boundary too. Yet there is a minority of people that definitely feel like I'd be wrong setting this boundary for this player alone (including the player, there are about 3-4 very regular players in this group, who are not necessarily more 'vocal' than others).</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>Given that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everyone in this group is used to be treated equally by the leadership. We've never had the leaders (or other players) set boundaries/rules for a single person. Setting the boundary will indeed single this one player out,</li>
<li>The alliance leadership definitely wants to set and enforce this boundary for this single player too, is keen to help me, but wants to keep the confusion and discord within the group to a minimum,</li>
<li>Rules and decisions made by the leadership are generally received well and obeyed without question since their rules/decisions are applied to all players equally. In this case, not everyone in the group feels it is fair to set this boundary for a single person, and people have already protested as such,</li>
<li>Kicking the problem player from the alliance will be done, but only <em>after</em> an attempt at setting and enforcing the boundary has proven to fail as well,</li>
</ul>

"How to resolve conflict when neither spouse concedes?","<p>For reference, my significant other and I are in our early twenties. We have been married for less than a year.</p>

<p>We argue frequently- nothing too toxic, no swearing (which is offensive in our culture), no mimicking or name calling or physical violence. Unfortunately, some of these disputes are difficult to resolve and we are both fairly stubborn. Many of the arguments center around fairly inconsequantial issues. For example, one evening, my s.o., who we will call Taylor, approached me right before we left the house with the following:</p>

<p>T: Could you turn of the bathroom light since you were the last one out?</p>

<p>M: What do you mean?</p>

<p>T: The bathroom. You were the last one in.</p>

<p>At this point, I realize Taylor is right, I did walk in the bathroom after they left. However, I didn't do anything in the bathroom (just glanced at my reflection). As I thought about it, I became confused: why did my s.o. leave the light on? What reason did they have to believe I would be the last in the bathroom? Basically, I started feeling really bothered because their actions seemed petty and hypocritical.</p>

<p>Additionally, I try to generally leave things the way I found them- I don't turn off someone else's light, just like I don't throw their half-eaten meal in the garbage. So it's challenging for me to see how Taylor can justify saying I should have been the one to turn off the light.</p>

<p>I try explaining this, but Taylor remains convinced I'm wrong. We move on, but later that night the same issue came out but we didn't move on that well and just stopped talking for the day.</p>

<p>This is a recurring theme: I feel like I'm being logical and that I'm right, and Taylor is convinced I'm wrong. No amount of talking makes either of us change our minds. I want to make up, but I don't believe I'm wrong. And sometimes, Taylor refuses to move on unless I say I'm wrong. I don't feel comfortable lying, but in these scenarios I'm unsure what I can do.</p>

<p>My question is fairly simple: how can I resolve a conflict when we both want to work it out but are both still convinced we were right in the first place?</p>

<hr>

<p>Also, I found <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/1307/how-can-i-remind-someone-to-do-a-task-when-reminding-them-makes-them-less-likely"">this</a> question, which is similar, but I think only really applies to a closer type of relationship.</p>

"How to react to unfunny statements made by significant other?","<p>Sometimes my SO makes a statement that they find funny for obvious reasons, but I don't find it funny at all, and in fact slightly offensive. It's a statement meant to engage me in conversation, like ""why does this exist?"", so it's difficult to ignore.</p>

<p>My usual response is to continuously ask them what the funny part was until they realize that I don't find it funny. However, I don't think that's a good approach to use with someone I'm supposed to have good communication with.</p>

<p>I tried to talk to my SO about how they would expect me to react to what they were telling me, but they were ""confused I was asking for guidance about a basic social skill."" I was stumped at how to reply at this point, and gave up the conversation.</p>

<ul>
<li>What would have been an appropriate reaction that let the conversation continue while still letting them know I did not find it funny?</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I want to acknowledge that I understand what they're saying, and show that I don't share it, but then move on without being offensive. I find the ""I don't find that funny"" to be too blunt, and it opens an opportunity to ask why I don't find it funny, which would extend the uncomfortable conversation.</p>

"How to/Should I ask a friend about their close relative who died (not recently)?","<p>A group of my friends and I were sitting in our classroom waiting for the teacher to get there and start class. Two of my friends, Jim and Maddie, were talking to each other (and they were about the only ones talking in a group of seven so it’s not like I was eavesdropping). They haven’t talked much at all before and so they were going through the basic questions, what do you like to read, how many siblings do you have, etc. They got to the siblings question and Maddie asked Jim how many siblings he had. He said, “Eight ... nine.” After a brief moment for the humor of not counting your siblings because there’s so many he explained that, “Yeah, one of my brothers, he died.” And she said, “Oh.” And he said, “but we still count him.”</p>

<p>Now I didn’t catch, “died” but from the syllable spaces available in his speech I’m going to guess that he said “died”. He said it without much emotion and didn’t look effected by it afterwards, like it was a fact he’s said many times before. I know this can be an extremely sensitive topic, but knowing that his brother died brings up more questions for me. Like how old was Jim when this happened? Was he even alive? (He’s the youngest of the nine and the oldest is 20 years older than him, so that is very much a possibility.) How/why did his brother die? How old was he when he died?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I haven’t run into many people with deceased immediate family, just Jim, another friend (who I didn’t ask any questions) and myself. My twin died when we were three days old, so I never knew her, which means it never affected me. She never had a face and a personality, so it’s kind of just a fact to me, though a fact I treat with respect. So I have very little experience in this area.</p>

<p>I’ve known Jim for six months, and I would say we are friends, and not just friends because of circumstance or that we’re in the same place. Still, I’m not sure how to ask these questions or even if it would be appropriate. Depending how old Jim was when his brother died, he could have varying degrees of his own emotional connection.</p>

<p>We do get to talk one-on-one when nobody else is around, but that usually lasts a max of 10 minutes. We also talk one-on-one when there are other people around.</p>

<p>I know that these questions are very hard to ask and can be very hard to answer, especially if the topic is not brought up by the person who it happened to. But I feel like it will give me a better understanding of his life and the things that might have had a role in shaping his character. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
<strong>How should I approach asking these questions? Is it even ok to ask for facts about such a sensitive topic? Should I resign myself to just not knowing?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Other Info That Might Be Useful</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Jim is 16 years old and I’m female and a year older.</li>
<li>If you are familiar with the Myers Briggs Personality Type Indicator, Jim is <strong>E</strong>xtroverted <strong>T</strong>hinking. I just thought those two letters might be helpful. </li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide that would help people answer my questions.</p>

"How do I get my neighbour to stop disturbing with loud music?","<p>I live in an apartment, and my neighbour who is retired, lives by himself, and partially deaf likes to play loud music most days per week (morning or evening). This completely stresses me out, and can’t function at home while this loud music is going on.</p>

<p>I feel sympathetic towards him — after all, he has the right to enjoy music in his own home and make the most of his retirement (as long as the noise doesn’t propagate!) — but as I can’t function without a peaceful environment, I’m at wit’s end.</p>

<p>How can I get him to stop playing the loud music?</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Talking to him.</strong></p>

<p>He’s very reclusive. If I knock on his door and try to talk to him, I can only get 1–2 sentences in before he closes the door in my face. I only ever see him in a “chance encounter” in the apartment common areas every couple of months, and if he sees me, he tries to avoid me. I haven’t managed to have a proper conversation with him.</p>

<p>If I were able to have a conversation with him, I would explain how the noise affects us, and that it would be appreciated if it could be kept quieter.</p>

<p>I would also try to remain respectful towards him: after all, he has a right to enjoyment in his own home. (As long as the noise doesn’t leak through!)</p>

<p>(One exception to the talking-to-him rule: shortly after he moved in, before the noise was a problem, I invited him over for dinner and had a pleasant chat. He was a little “odd” but nothing concerning. During the conversation I learnt that he hates to wear hearing aids, something I feel sympathy towards.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knocking on his door when there’s loud music.</strong></p>

<p>It’s hard to get him to open his door, I would assume because he’s partially deaf (or he could be trying to ignore me).</p>

<p>If I knock with my bare hands, he doesn’t open the door, so I need to use a rolling pin. (Last time I knocked with my bare hands, I injured my knuckles and my hands were sore for a whole month.)</p>

<p>I don’t want to use a rolling pin (it feels unnecessary, and I have to hide it behind my back when he opens the door because I don’t want to appear threatening), but I’m forced to.</p>

<p>When he answers the door, I can only greet him (as friendly as I can manage), start my second sentence, but closes the door before I finish.</p>

<p>He does always turn down the music after being asked. (For that day.) But the next day, it’s just back to loud levels again. He looks very annoyed each time he opens the door.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable to expect that eventually he would get sick of answering the door and being asked to turn it down, but after a year it seems not.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Writing him a letter.</strong></p>

<p>Because I couldn’t get a word in edgewise, I wrote a friendly letter and dropped in his mailbox explaining the situation, expressing an appreciation for his love of music, and asking to keep it down.</p>

<p>I had some workmates look over the letter, who not only approved it but expressed admiration for how friendly it was.</p>

<p>The day after I dropped the letter in his mailbox was the loudest I have ever heard the music be played, which leads me to believe he was trying to take revenge on me.</p>

<p>(Later on, there was a period of quietness for a few weeks, so I dropped off another letter thanking him for the quietness. But a few days later, the noise started right up again.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contacting strata (homeowners’ association / body corporate).</strong></p>

<p>There is a strata manager (off-site), and an building manager (on-site). I have raised this with both, and quoted the fact that the strata by-laws explicitly forbid noise that disturbs other residents (time of day unspecified). While they acknowledged the issue, and claimed to have talked to my neighbour, it hasn’t solved the problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contacting police.</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, my neighbour was playing loud music at 2 AM. In those cases, I called the police (the non-emergency line).</p>

<p>In each case, the police took over 2 hours to arrive. I witnessed them knock on the door and walk off straight away. (They walked off so quickly I didn’t even have a chance to catch them and talk to them.)</p>

<p>I went to the local police station to talk to an officer. Contrary to my expectations, the officers were incredibly unhelpful and unempathetic, and told me there’s nothing they can do.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use noise–cancelling headphones.</strong></p>

<p>I got a pair of noise–cancelling headphones. While they get rid of white–noise, they don’t get rid of the deep bass thumping noises that come from next door.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get used to the noise.</strong></p>

<p>For two months, I decided to try to increase tolerance towards the noise. Think about it positively, accept it as a thing, observe my reaction to it in the third–person, and move back to the task I was doing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this didn’t help at all. Though I thought the thoughts, my blood pressure was high and heart rate did not go down at all. It’s now been a year of this noise, and it feels worse then when it first started.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Things others have suggested but don’t work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Getting him to mark the acceptable spot on his volume dial with a marker pen.</strong></p>

<p>This is a good suggestion, but only works if I can properly talk to him. As it stands, I can’t (see above). But I would be willing to try if it were possible.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Things others have suggested but have serious negative consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Moving out.</strong></p>

<p>Moving out would leave us significantly financially worse off (apartment has dropped 20% in value since purchase), and are 2 years into a 30 year mortgage.</p>

<p>Not to mention the unfairness, stress and expense of (a) looking, and (b) actually moving, and (c) the risks of experiencing the same problem in a new place.</p>

<p>If I could predict the future I could have bought somewhere else or rented instead. But I can’t, so I didn’t. I’m only interested in solutions that fix the real situation, not fix the immutable past.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Threaten him.</strong></p>

<p>I don’t want to do anything illegal, unethical, or things that will cause him to take revenge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cut his power, or remotely change his TV volume via Bluetooth.</strong></p>

<p>Again, illegal and unethical, and then I’d be worse than him.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can I communicate to my neighbour that he has to stop disturbing with loud music?</strong></p>

"What is the proper way to disclose ASD so that people do not tell ""You don't look autistic""?","<p>Related to <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/20696/but-you-dont-look-autistic-isnt-a-nice-thing-to-say"">this</a> but when on a due circumstance autism diagnosis requires to be disclosed. Such as workplace bullying or  public transport or an abusive work environment or to claim a government facility such as a transport fee concession etc. Unfortunately people tend to say some or some form of the statement </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You don't look autistic"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It hurts. Because it dismisses a life evading experience which is difficult to explain in brief, is very tricky, and unfamiliar. Not only hurts, it imperts a forceful belief of vague positivity that don't match my life experience. </p>

<p>Sometimes this is so extreme that I feel like there should be an entire subject on how many ways people react when they meet a disclosure of ASD diagnosis. The variants of the statement includes like </p>

  <li><p>You don't look disabled. </p></li>
  <li><p>You must not have the percentage of disability otherwise you wont be able to argue with so much sharp logic/ clear language/ cunning

  choosing to be pampered this way. </p></li>
  <li><p>Since some people told/validated you that you have difficulty in those social understandings, so you have not worked hard enough on it.</p></li>
  <li><p>Shame on you how you dare to disclose such negative? You might be seeking sympathy or being help vamp without triying hard yourself.</p></li>

<p>This single repeatitive experience made me very much <strong>afraid</strong> of disclosing the official dx. My question is; <strong>is there really any appropriate or nice way to disclose asd dx?</strong> (if necessary). My terapists recommend disclosure at least for safety reasons but destructive criticisms keep coming. </p>

<p>As I saw; telling people to google it is being considered as sort of offensive and revolts with reactions like you should not google about medical conditions and medical matter, though therapists encouraged me and parents to google about research article.  </p>

"How do I convince women that my intentions are pure?","<p>I have decided to do my once per year attempt to not die alone this week that has passed. I decided to ask this nice looking lady that I know for coffee. The problem I have is that for some reason I don't understand women seem to think when I ask them for coffee that I either want to marry them or have sex with them.</p>

<p>This is not actually my intentions. All I really wanted was her time and her company, but she made it clear she did not want to be my girlfriend which was odd because I did not ask her to be my girlfriend and I cannot understand why she would think this.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm not at the point in my career that I can consider a relationship. To be frank, I don't earn enough money for a woman. My father told me on more than one occasion that I should know the only hobby more expensive than women are children. I could afford coffee though.</p>

<p>I'm rather lonely and the company of a woman would be a very enjoyable spend of an evening. I don't expect or really want anything more from them than company and friendship, but I have a really hard time explaining that to a woman.</p>

<p>To be honest, if she just touched me I would have to do everything in my power not to have a panic attack right there on the spot.</p>

<p>I spend most of my 20s like a hermit and had long spells of agoraphobia that was hard for me to overcome. So it easy to say that social interactions are very hard for me. </p>

<p>It was very hard for me to talk to her at all, she is a strikingly beautiful woman, tall and thin and really looks like she could be a model of some sort. I went through weeks of internal strife before I got the nerve to talk to her.</p>

<p>I really fear the things that people might say. She decided to tell me some lark about her being too busy, but I don't know why she could have just told she was not interested.</p>

<p>I feel hurt that people would assume the worst of me. I'm not a bad person but when women assume bad things from me when they don't know me, it cuts me deep. I keep wondering if there is something about my personality that makes women think this.</p>

<p>I'm never going to talk to this woman again. Anything I say to her at this point would be futile and sound desperate. She thinks poorly of me and even though her opinion is not rooted in reality I'm still powerless to change it. I guess I should just make peace with it then. I just keep on wondering why people think this and what am I doing to make this a recurring theme in my attempts to understand the opposite sex?</p>

<p><strong>The question is how do I ask women for there company and make it clear to them that when I ask them to coffee, coffee just means coffee? Nothing more nothing less.</strong> </p>

<p>I spend most of my energy during the day just trying to invite people to have a human moment connecting with another human through conversation. Many people are in a rush, preoccupied or just don't stop for canvassers. </p>

<p>There are many people who would potentially be interested in chatting with me but the words I spewed out to greet them didn't strike the best chord as told to me by their response and/or body language. </p>

<p>I can't read minds as to people's preferred way of communicating just by looking at them as they are walking toward me. I am searching for the most 
""universal"" emotion I should try to appeal to since my goal is to make more people feel invited and excited about stopping to talk to me. </p>

  <li><p>Moment of your time for children at the border?</p></li>
  <li><p>What can I say that will get you to stop and talk to me?</p></li>
  </ul>

<p>What are some quick sentences I could say that don't elicit a feeling of guilt or judgement to creatively open the door for a rad conversation about what we can actually do as individuals to show compassion and kindness in efforts to create a better future?</p>

"How can I stop a person who is uncle of my friend and manipulates me for sex?","<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>He is uncle of my good friend, very elder to me and family man also. I am surprised with his unexpected demand of sex. I want his guidance but not at the cost of fulfilling his worst demand. How can I interact?</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>My friend has introduced me to her uncle for the purpose of some guidance help. I was speaking normally and respectfully with him. But after some days he started manipulating me by saying 'I love you' (through phone), started virtual sex, he used to send kissing symbols through WhatsApp and asked me where shall we go and how will we manage further meetings and all. I know this manipulation is all for sex. I was shocked (and my feeling was of humiliation). I was quite aware of the fact that he is a married person and father of 2 daughters. I had talked with my friend on the phone and told her all the things about her uncle. But I was again shocked because she blamed me for the incidence. I mean, she blamed me that I might have attracted him. I have again surprised because in college and for 3 years she and me were together in the same room and very good friends. She knows me very well that I never did anything other than study in my college days. And how could she blame on me. This incidence has broken our friendship. She blamed it on me. It means that now, she doesn't trust me. So, I don't want further communicate with her (as I think if she wants she will contact me whenever she will feel).</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>The uncle is very elder to me. He manipulated me in a very polite way (so that I could not understand his hidden aim). But I was aware of the fact. I am not at all interested in him for sex. But I want guidance. (Sometimes I think that why to take guidance from such worst person). But then I thought that let us keep my principle as it is and make changes into strategy. But what strategy of interaction can I adapt so that he will stop behaving like this.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Now, the main issue is I want guidance from the uncle but not at the cost of sexual relationship....</p>

<p><strong>How to interact with the uncle in order to stop him from behaving like this?</strong> </p>

<h2>Notes and Clarifications</h2>

<li>I was thinking to explain all the matter with his wife, but thinking

"How can I inspire a friend to develop critical thinking?","<p>I have a very close, very intelligent friend. We like to talk about ""brainy"" stuff, but in quite different ways. While I like to reflect and take apart knowledge and, generally, approach it critically, he's only interested in learning it and, to be unflattering, show off all the things he has learned.
Some things I observed:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He likes to learn new things, he's interested in a lot of academic subjects and loves to sit down and just read up on stuff</p></li>
<li><p>He likes to talk about these things with me, as long as its not a discussion</p></li>
<li><p>He enjoys listening to me monologuing on subjects in a reflective way. At the end of it, he will only adapt the conclusion and toss any nuance out the window.</p></li>
<li><p>When I ask him to see the other side of a coin, asking how maybe a person on the other side might see those things, he replies something along the lines of ""Well that person is an idiot!""</p></li>
<li><p>He doesn't like to ponder questions. When I ask him something he doesn't have a factual answer to, he rather abrasively answers ""I don't know!"" when actually I want him to ponder possibilities.</p></li>
<li><p>He's afraid of being wrong or, so to speak, ungraceful. He's a people pleaser and cares a lot about how he appears to others, and I think he's scared of loosing status by ""not appearing perfect"". He is more relaxed around me, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Kind of ironically, one thing we like to discuss is the different school systems we were educated in, and he frequently complains about his school not teaching critical thinking whatsoever, while it was a rather big focus in mine. So he does see that as an important quality.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To improve the quality of our conversations (and his knowledge, I mean, in the end it would benefit him too) I would like to achieve two things: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Show him he doesn't have to be afraid to step outside his comfort zone; and </p></li>
<li><p>Inspire him to be more reflective, probably by asking the right questions in a discussion.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm pretty sure that solving the first goal will solve the second one, as I my guess (!) is that he's uncomfortable about being reflective because he has never learned it and therefore afraid of stepping out of his depth when he does so. </p>

<p>So how could I go about that? What questions could I ask to lead him there?</p>

"How to remain gender ambiguous online?","<p>This question is inspired by <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/q/10756/4366"">How to politely notify in an online conversation that I am a woman?</a>.</p>

<p>In my non-internet life, I identify nonambiguously as female.  However, on the internet, it's important to me to be gender-unknown.  I don't want people to assume either gender.  Note that some of the places where I participate have 80 to 90% male participation.  Occasionally there is an awkward moment, typically of two types:</p>

<p>a. Someone refers to me as male.</p>

<p>In making a correction, I feel afraid of being outed.  (My posts may contain some subtle hints that an astute, intuitive reader could piece together.)</p>

<p>b. Someone refers to me as female.</p>

<p>In making a correction, I feel nervous that this will draw more attention to my gender status, with the result that more people will start scrutinizing my posts, and this increases the chances that someone might out me.</p>

<p>Some online moderators generally have little or no sympathy or interest in providing support around this issue, leaving me to fend for myself.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What's a good way of asserting myself in situations (a) and (b)?  I believe any wrong guess is best corrected early on, before more people's perceptions and assumptions are created and ingrained.  I would prefer a non-aggressive message, but assertive would be fine.</p>

<p>Would this work?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please don't assume my gender.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>What's a succinct way of letting people know that I prefer to maintain an unknown gender?  Or is this inherently risky? Because perhaps this stance is more prevalent online among women than men?  (If so, that complicates Question 1....)</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> 2/24</p>

<p>@sphennings <em>Are you wanting to identify as explicitly agendered online, or are you just wanting to be ambiguous?</em></p>

<p>Sorry, what's the difference?</p>

<p>@peufeu - At least one SE site frequented by approximately 80% male participants. In fact I was outed at one point, fortunately it was in a rather buried comment that few people actually read. The moderators refused to help. I eventually managed to get the outer to delete his comment. He had researched me online, out of curiosity, I guess, and figured out my gender from a particular ancient post on another SE site (which I have since edited).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> 2/25, responding to questions in comments:</p>

<p>@sphennings - <em>When you're online do you want for people to be unsure what your gender is or do you want to explicitly identify as neither male or female by saying something like ""I'm agendered."", ""I'm genderqueer."" or any other nonbinary gender identity?</em> </p>

<p>When I'm online I want people to be unsure what my gender is, and treat me as <em>might-be male or might be female</em>.  I want them to go through the mental calculation that says, Hmm.  If this user is female, then I read her post in such-and-so a way.  But if this user is male, than I read his post in this-other way.  So, in thinking about the post, I really need to keep an open mind, because there's no way of finding out for certain.</p>

<p>@peufeu - <em>that's weird. Is it a geek/engineering SE? On my usual list of websites no-one would give a damn about your gender, unless discussing relationships or other stuff where it matters like choice of bicycle saddle!... is it about religion or something? or are you doing undercover infiltration among an angry bunch of MGTOW?</em> </p>

<p>You can choose to believe me or not.</p>

<p>@Catija - <em>I think that what may be confusing some is the connection to the other question.</em></p>

<p>No direct connection.  I read the other question, and found it and the answers interesting.  They helped me formulate this question.  If you think it's better to remove the link at the top go ahead.</p>

<p><em>If you don't want them to know your gender, why does it matter if they use gendered pronouns for you?</em> </p>

<p>There is sometimes a power balance based on gender.  As long as I'm not identified as female on the site, other participants will not relegate me to that pigeonhole.  On the other hand, it would feel dishonest to try to pass for male.</p>

<p>@maskedman <em>Even after the OP's ""clarification"", things are not any more clear, are they?</em></p>

<p>What aspects are unclear?  Please let me know what aspect(s) need to be clarified and I will do my best.</p>

<p>@stochastic - <em>I think if I don't want to specify my gender, I just don't, and if someone assumes one or the other, I pretend I didn't notice. Does that not work?</em> </p>

<p>No, unfortunately. Once people start to refer to a particular user with a gendered pronoun, the assumption spreads to other users.</p>

<p>@WitanapDanu <em>I still remain unclear as to what the OP specifically would like to achieve under her normal account's activity. Keep everyone guessing while remaining mysterious? Be clear, in that context, that the gender is to remain unknown and actively discourage discovery? Just be considered a user and make gender immaterial? Or, some other specific result(s) that I have not identified. Different objectives require different methods.</em></p>

<p>When other participants read my posts, I want them to respond to the ideas in it, based on their intrinsic value and my reputation score, without being guided by gender-based internal scripts.  </p>

<p>No matter how careful I am from here on out, there is always a chance I will   be outed again.  If there's more that I can do to prevent that from happening, great.  If it happens again, I want to be prepared with an action plan.</p>

<p>A : I think that we should improve [something].</p>

<p>B : Why do you want this ? You know, there is always better and worse, you should accept what we have now.</p>

<h1>Example #2</h1>

<p>A : I would like to have a better salary.</p>

<p>B : There is better and worse, you should accept what you have now.</p>

"How can I find out what surprise my wife wants?","<p>My wife never gives any hints about what she wants for her birthday (even after extensive direct questioning), but is sometimes disappointed that I didn’t get her the right thing. </p>

<p>This time, it turns out she wanted me to organise a surprise fun event for us to go to as a family (we have young kids). Besides presents, what I had actually done was spend the afternoon with our eldest kid baking a cake for her. This was wrong - not what she wanted at all. I can see that it wasn’t much fun for her during the baking process as she had to look after the baby which is a normal-day thing, not a birthday-day thing. </p>

<p>How can I avoid this happening again? How can I get a better sense of what she wants? Remember, asking isn’t enough as she genuinely doesn’t know herself what she wants. We had a row, and I asked her to give examples of the kind of thing she would have liked to do, and she came up with nothing. </p>

"how do I stop attracting wrong friend?","<p>I am a 25-year-old  grad-level student, good looking, and introverted, but like socializing. Due to various studying opportunities, I had to change my cities and my country several times during the past 7 years. I can tell I have zero friends, With no best friend and even boyfriend. Concerning having a boyfriend, usually, I am attracted to the guys that they are not my type,for example, teenagers and...., it happens to me several times. So I have never had one. 
concerning girls, I usually have jealous girls around or gold diggers.</p>

  <p>Me: I am driving down to Manly. Would you like me to give you a ride?</p>

We have known each other for 12 years and I have been friends with her and her sister. I was not born in the country we are currently in and I have a different ethnicity. Unfortunately, the country I am from is experiencing tensions with country I'm living in and where my friend is also/the wedding is. I have lived here since I was 8 and I'm a citizen. </p>

<p>At the bachelorette party I tried to make conversion over dinner and mentioned that I have a friend in the military who has mentioned that people shouldn't contact her as she goes through training. I mentioned this and the bride yelled in the restaurant that I can't contact her because I'm from the country I'm from. The bride is the military and is serving currently and I know she hears a lot about the country where I'm from. Bridesmaid_2 told the bride that what she said wasn't very nice and tried to explain. I didn't say anything, only bridesmaid_2 who is also an immigrant tried to explain the situation and mentioned to the bride that it was rude what she said. </p>

<p>Maybe it is my fault because I never spoke to them about these comments, but I feel like if I have been friends with them for 12 years and in 2019 that they don't know that these comments are rude then maybe they will never know?

"How to communicate to my mother that I find it hurtful when she cooks dessert for everyone except me who is vegan?","<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>When my mom bakes a cake for us (whoever is at home but it's usually me, my little sister, my father and her), she uses eggs (which are not vegan), even if I will be there. How can I <strong>tell her</strong> that I find it <strong>hurtful</strong> to completely ignore the fact that I'm vegan, and thus can't eat the dessert?</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I'm 23, I have been vegan for 2 years, I live in my parents' house (well, not the past 6 months but I'm moving in again). I often cook the meal or part of it.</p>

<p>My mom hates cooking (I hate it too). She also doesn't like that I'm vegan and would probably wish for me to ""convert back"".</p>

<p>For the meal, there isn't a ""main dish"", there is just vegetables and starchy cook separately from the meat to make the meal vegan for me.</p>

<p>If she cooks something that needs milk/butter, she uses vegan alternatives but, if she needs eggs, she won't use the vegan alternative.</p>

<h1>What I have tried</h1>

<p>When I see that she is about to prepare a (non-vegan) cake, I ask her, why not use some maize starch(or some compote, depending) instead but she always told me ""that's not how I learned to cook"" or some similar excuse.</p>

<p>Sometimes, she will also say: if you aren't happy, you can cook. But the problem is, I do cook sometimes (just not cake) and I don't want to always have to do the cooking just because I'm the only vegan at home. Even though I know what to use as an alternative and would be able to tell her.</p>

<p>I didn't tell her (yet) that I found her hurtful because I wanted to avoid this (probably) difficult conversation.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How can I <strong>communicate</strong> to my mother that I find it <strong>hurtful</strong> when she cooks for everyone but me?</p>

<h1>Notes and clarifications</h1>

<p>My mother does cook vegan stuff sometimes but only if she only needs to switch cow milk with rice milk. If it involves eggs, she won't switch ingredients.</p>

<p>When there are multiple things to eat, I don't really mind not eating something but when there is only one dessert, I do mind. Especially since this happens on a regular base (~ once per week).</p>

<p>Please, don't tell me that I'm selfish. I just want to be able to enjoy a vegan cake the same way they enjoy the vegan meals that I make.</p>

<p>No, I can't go out and buy a vegan cake, they're not readily available where I live.</p>

<p>A lot of answers suggest to teach her to cook vegan. This might work, but it might also not work: last time I tried, she just let me do the waffles on my own. So, I would be grateful for other solutions that do not involve cooking.</p>

<p><strong>If the dessert is vegan, everyone will happily eat it.</strong></p>

<p>My mother usually cooks 2/4 of time, me 1/4 and my father 1/4. At least that's how I see things but everyone on the house probably has a different opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>The cake is usually for the four of us (well, three of them since I can't eat it). If it's for guests, I mind less not being able to eat it (because it's not really for me, because I usually know in advance and because I can prepare/buy myself something else if needed).</p>

<p>Some people seem to think that I'm vegan for health reason, I'm really, <em>really</em> not. And the last time I tried to eat a not vegan cake, I didn't enjoy it because I felt guilty. </p>

<hr>

<h1>Follow up</h1>

<p>I have asked my mother to tell me every time she wants to use eggs in a recipe (so that I can jump in and use something else instead). </p>

<p>I also printed and pinned on the fridge a summary table of what to use instead of eggs.</p>

<p>Finally, today, when my mother told me she wanted to make a pie using eggs, I jumped in and used Maizena instead (will she was cooking some other stuff). We didn't cook together but she mostly saw what I did and I hope that, if I do it often enough, she will start doing it by herself.</p>

<p><em>(but answers to help bring that issue with her are still very welcome if all this doesn't work)</em></p>

<p><strong>Notes and clarification</strong>:</p>

<p>I would rather have the answer to ""How to <strong>communicate</strong> to my mother that I find it <strong>hurtful</strong> when..."" but people keep giving me answers to ""how to have her cook vegan"" so I used their solution in the hope that I won't need to ""<strong>communicate</strong> that I find it <strong>hurtful</strong> when..."" </p>

"How to neutralise the behaviour of gym rats in the gym?","<p>I participate in group activities at the local gym, I'm new there (about three months,) however all other people have been members since a year ago. I can tell there is a special bond between the people. </p>

<p>I'm not shy or asocial, I've managed to maintain a very productive and positive relationship with other people around, but it seems impossible to build a normal relationship with some people there. </p>

<p>I tried to greet them, offering to do a workout together, and tried even to start a conversation. Sometimes there are just two of us, after greeting they never try to initiate a simple conversations about the workout we are about to do; they always talk about with other people and, after the workout ends, they just leave the room without a single word. </p>

<p>Why this is a big deal for me, you ask? </p>

<p>After a long day the only thing I want to do is go to the gym. As I have to encounter those people every day, it makes the whole experience very uncomfortable. Besides, we need to partner up and do workouts together, the lack of communication causes disruption and confusion.</p>

<p>In order to clarify the problem I go through a scenario I had two weeks ago:</p>

<p>We had to burn 400 calories on ski machine with three people. The two agreed to do 20 calories each for the first 100 calories, then scale down by five for the second 100 calories, and so on. The problem was, when I asked them how we gonna do the workout, they only said, ""You'll see.""</p>

<p>It's always like that, they communicate before the workout starts, they set the rules without including me.</p>

<p>By socializing I don't mean to chat with people about what's going on on their lives, I need to know the capacity of my partners, how much they can lift, how fast they can run...</p>

<p>By having this information, and getting to know the partners a little bit better, we can do a great workout. If I know the partners better, then I will push them when they need to be pushed or taking over when they need to rest so they can do the same.</p>

<p>I don't know if I need to confront them in person (if so then how can I?), or should I do something indirectly?</p>

"How to deal with my brother's life choices, and our parents' complicity and hypocrisy","<h2>Context</h2>

<ul>
<li>Me: 30F</li>
<li>Brother: 28M</li>
<li>Our parents: mid-50s M/F (still married)</li>
<li>Brother's girlfriend: 28F</li>
<li>Midwestern family (US)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Story</h2>

<p>For the last 5 or 6 months my brother has been dating a woman. Yesterday my mom told me that they are moving in together. In this conversation she also revealed that the girlfriend has been staying over at my brother's current apartment more days than not. Subtext: they are having premarital sex and intend to continue doing so by moving in together before marriage.</p>

<p>My parents are devout Christians (I am too, but less devout) and they <strong>ALWAYS, ALWAYS</strong> taught my brother and me to remain virgins until marriage. My brother clearly made other choices. And to be fair, they are 28 year old adults, older than my parents were when they married; bro &amp; GF can make their own choices.</p>

<p>It does make me a bit angry that he strayed from the path, but again, he's 28, not 18, so I think he is mature enough to make these decisions at this point.</p>

<p>What pisses me off is our <em>parents'</em> behavior:</p>

<h3>(1) Denying big aspects of my childhood</h3>

<p>After my mom told me they were moving in together, I asked her, ""Are you ok with them having premarital sex?"" and she said ""Yes, of course! Why wouldn't I be?"" I reminded her that she and my dad always taught us to wait until marriage. She said that she had never believed, or said, that we should wait until marriage.</p>

<p>I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy. I remember thousands of conversations in which my parents both told me, often screamed at me, to wait until marriage. I have hundreds of emails and text messages she sent me in college and later reminding me to avoid unchaperoned dates, avoid men in general, and never ever have sex unless you're married first. (That last one is the only one I actually followed.)</p>

<p>Even if they had a change of heart, they're denying that they <em>ever</em> taught us to remain virgins until marriage. That was a core value of my childhood and they're now saying it never happened.</p>

<p>To give you an idea of how ""core"" it was, they taught me that if someone tried to rape me, it was better to fight back and be killed than it was to ""allow"" oneself to be raped. The attitude was that premarital sex is worse than dying.</p>

<p>It was <em>dead</em> serious. But now they say they never said it or believed it.</p>

<h3>(2) <em>My</em> relationship didn't get the same consideration</h3>

<p>Despite my age, I have never had sex in any form. I've maintained chastity all my life.</p>

<p>I was in a relationship for 4 years ending 2 years ago. My ex-boyfriend was not a virgin, but he was accepting of waiting for marriage for me. Since all of his past encounters were consensual and with adults, I accepted his past as well. After 4 years, we felt ready for marriage.</p>

<p>But my parents wouldn't give their blessing. They forced me to choose between him and them: if we married, they said, ""You will be dead to us."" They told me they would never speak to me again. So I chose my parents over my ex. <em>Knowing what I know now</em>, I would have chosen my ex.</p>

<p>I'm incredibly resentful. My parents accept my brother having premarital sex, but they wouldn't accept me marrying <em>someone else</em> who <em>previously</em> had premarital sex <em>with other partners</em>. The hypocrisy is baffling. (I totally understand the so-called ""double standard"" of letting your son have premarital sex with other people's daughters, but not allowing your own daughter to do the same. That also sounds hypocritical, but it's a premise I accept. But this isn't that.)</p>

<p>It only hurts more that they're now saying they never even heard of my ex...just deleting 4 years of my 20s.</p>

<p>Moreover, they're willing to meet my brother's GF after less than 6 months; they refused to meet my ex-boyfriend even after 4 years - even when we were planning to get engaged. They never met him.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>My irritation isn't so much about my brother and his GF, it's mostly at our parents for being positive and accepting towards his relationship while they opposed and ultimately destroyed mine; and telling me that they <em>never</em> opposed premarital sex to begin with, while in reality they did, and it was a big part of my childhood.</p>

<p>So really the question is, how to cope with our parents' hypocrisy and with how they treated me relative to the red carpet treatment my brother is getting now.</p>

"Convincing superstitious people","<p>My mother believes in astrology (not the scientific astronomy, but the apparent effect of stars on human lives). She recently found out that there's something weird in store for me this year after consulting the astrologer. I'm supposedly born with a natural 'affinity' for getting physically hurt, and because of this my mother won't let me go cycling, which is one of my favourite activities.</p>

<p>I don't have anything against my mother believing in astrology, but I don't have any particular reason to believe it. I'm not atheistic, but I don't believe something that doesn't seem scientifically correct. However, if I try telling my mother that I don't believe in any of this, she turns it into a discussion on my faith in God and such.</p>

<p>How should I go about convincing my mother? I'm from India and 17 years old (not yet an adult).</p>

<p>My question is different from the <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/2883"">Arguing science with a passionate non-scientist?</a> one because my point is not to discuss the scientific evidence or talk sense into the superstitious. All I'm saying is I don't want any of their beliefs to come in my way and stop me from doing the things I love.</p>

<p>I'd like to add a little information: I know that my mother means well as I have a lot of important exams this year (which will determine where I study and then some more things). She wants me to be able to study peacefully and wants to avoid any risks. But on the other hand, I have one major recreation, and that is apparently taboo. That makes me really unhappy, and it doesn't allow me to study to the fullest... However, even sharing this point of view doesn't change anything. Any more thoughts?</p>

"How to deal with my mom's insistence that eight people are harassing her, even though there's no actual evidence?","<p>I'm 26, female, moved back in with mom and dad in April after a breakup with my ex-girlfriend (the relationship ended as she got a job elsewhere... I couldn't afford to live in NYC, but she could). I live in a large town in Texas.</p>

<p>For the past few weeks (well, since early August) my mom has been insisting that a group of eight women from a local office in the town center are harassing her constantly, and claims they follow her to the supermarket, the doctor's, the local car park and that they even propositioned her for sex!</p>

<p>There's no evidence for this; one of my friends knows one of the women and says ""Yeah right. They hardly even know her!""</p>

<p>Our neighborhood is a small area where everyone knows everyone else.</p>

<p>My mom showed me camera phone footage of the eight women in a car park and claims she heard one of them saying ""Look at that slutty Latina Indian skankwhore... she and her kid are freaky obese people!""</p>

<p>True, we are Latina and Indian (I'm partially Mexican, partially Indian; India as in the country) but there's not a large Latina community here; Indians are more common than Latinas after African-Americans and white people.</p>

<p>My mom claims that the eight people gave her marks on her body and stripped to her sports bra; I'm wondering if my mom did it herself, as there was something about her story that didn't ring true.</p>

<p>She claims these eight women harassed her in the local swimming pool about her choice of swimwear and pushed her against a wall in the changing room and showed me stomach injuries; again, something doesn't ring true.</p>

<p>I don't think it could be my dad causing the injuries, he's gentle and quiet and doesn't like to shout or get into intense arguments, so that can be ruled out.</p>

<p>She's obsessive about this group of eight women, even gone so far as to run appeals on social media to find out info on them, even contacting a news network over claims of racist harassment and Trump supporter behavior!</p>

<p>Mom has also displayed other odd behavior; she once ate twelve packets of M&amp;M's in a single sitting, then went out to the local 7-11 and bought ''more'' of them, and was binge-eating M&amp;M's all night long, ranting about these eight women and about Trump.</p>

<p>My mom is so obsessive about this group of eight women she's constantly emailing the media about them too.</p>

<p>I worry she's mentally ill. Officially and legally, she's not classified as that.</p>

<p>My dad doesn't know what to do, and wants to get help for her but doesn't know where to.</p>

<p>I think she needs help and can't see it, but don't know what to do. She taught me the value of recognizing help and I got help from her on very difficult math as a teenager and school bullying, yet now, I'm wondering if she's not taking her own advice on help and this is confusing me?</p>

"How to talk to my landlord about a playmate of his daughter stressing me?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>So I am living in a 3 party house, which was a generation house before 1 flat got free like 2 years ago and I moved in half a year ago (Might be relevant).</p>

<p>My landlord and his wife live in the flat under me, and his wife's mother under them. He has a daughter I would estimate in the age between 6 and 8.
It has happened 3 times now that a playmate of his daughter (I would estimate the same age) rang my door bell and asked me if she could come out to play. I told him that he had to ring another bell, and despite he was kinda confused, that sort of solved the problem for me the first 2 times. </p>

<p>But the 3rd time, on this Sunday was really annoying. The boy rang the bell and asked me if she could come out, I told him the same thing as the times before, a few minutes later he ringed me again, informing me that no one is answering, so I told him they apparently aren't home in that case. So he started asking me when they will be back and if I could tell her to come out to play.</p>

<p>I asked him to please not ring my bell anymore, which didn't stop him ringing it again 5 minutes later asking if she is finally available. And saying no, he asked continuous ""why?""'s. After I hung up, he started to ring ongoing for like 10 minutes and was licking the camera of the duplex system.</p>

<p>So absolutely nothing I want to spend my resting time on a Sunday evening with.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Now I want to ask my landlord if he could tell the child to not ring my bell anymore, as that boy seems to have a misconception about my bonds with the family of my landlord and apparently is not able to get it from my explanations.</p>

<p>Now the problem is, what ever I consider telling them, it sounds sort of demanding or could even be taken as a complaint. That could be a bad thing, especially since I don't know how much they actually could do themselves or if they themselves are eventually annoyed by that boy as well, because he is rarely understands the things they tell him to respect (And many other things that are unknown to me, making it difficult for me to decide how to approach).</p>

<p>I am on quite good terms with my landlord and his family.</p>

<p>My goal is to not make it sound like it is his responsibility or he is to blame for the bother (well he is from my point of view, but for the sake of living in the same house I want to avoid communicating that), and rather put emphasis on the fact, that the boy seemed to not see me as authority, since he ignored things like ""Don't ring my bell again"", and my landlord telling him the same thing might lead to a different outcome.</p>

<p>Note: The doorbells are labeled and it is very clear that my surname is totally different from the surname on the other 2 buttons. I assume, tho, the boy can't read yet.</p>

Anyway, when I bought my iPad I was too young to work at a real job. I used some birthday money to pay for pamphlets and I walked around and hired myself out as an amateur yard-worker. It was seriously hard work. I handed out 400 pamphlets and only 7 people followed up. I saved up my hard earned money and bought myself a MacBook and an iPad to teach myself how to code. </p>

<p>I don't really have anything to hide anymore but I would appreciate my iPad being my iPad. It seems like it would be unfair for my parents to invade my ownership like this. My parents will most likely (although, we haven't updated yet) take advantage of this new Screen Time feature in iOS 12 and restrict my usage because I have a really bad track record of hiding things.</p>

<p>I will admit, I used to look at pornography a lot. I was hugely addicted to it. Back when iOS 7-9 was still jail-breakable I figured out how to remove all the restrictions my parents had put in place and I could download whatever games or apps I wanted. I got caught doing all these things (Because your sins always find you out) and developed a ton of trust issues with my parents.</p>

<p>That was back when I was really irresponsible and untrustworthy. I <em>feel like</em> I have built a lot of that trust back up. I think it would be unfair for my parents to do this. I don't have a lot going for me. I'm only 16, technically still a minor which means my parents own my devices. I have regretfully proven myself untrustworthy before, which gives them a lot of incentive to invoke some restrictions.</p>

<p>My question is, how can I approach them and ask them to trust me and respect my privacy? I don't really use my iPad for much. Mostly just school, some gaming with friends, and multi-tasking with my job. I think I do a good job of regulating my own behavior. How do I tell my parents this?</p>

"Possible Girlfriend in the ICU","<p>Long story ahead, you've been warned. Could really use sound advice here.</p>

<p>Some background first, I'm terrible at reading social cues, to the point when I was younger medicos told my parents I might be borderline Aspergers.</p>

<p>I met a woman four weeks ago at a First Friday event. We got to talking and I took her out on the town later that night as an impromptu date. Really hit it off. Second date, she came a few minutes late, worked out (she had invited me to join her), then left with little said but we organized a 3rd date the following week.</p>

<p>We texted and called back and forth all week, sometimes several times a day. Lots of laughter and smiles every time we're around one another and over text. It's been years since I went on a date and haven't had any relationships or SO's ever, so naturally trying hard. I don't feel nervous around her, which is rare for me with the opposite sex. Not sure what we are yet.</p>

<p>Anyway flash forward to Sunday, 3rd date, I'm there early waiting for her. Event starts, she's still not there, okay I think, maybe running late. Eventually event is half over and I'm feeling rock bottom low. Duck out early, send a quick text to ask where she is, find out she's been in the hospital since morning. Naturally I'm concerned, so I send a handful of texts asking if there's anything I can do or bring to help her make the day less crappy. I hear nothing for 36 hours, then that her surgery went okay and she's at home recovering. Try to reschedule, this time for a movie night (low stress), we plan and I get everything ready. Food, popcorn, movies, candy, the works. Texting back and forth, being vulnerable with each other, I learn more. Long term health issues, a bad divorce in the past (he was an abusive twit), struggling to get work with the health stuff. Without prompting, I try to help- work is slow for me at the moment but steady, so I try to help her search and be supportive. </p>

<p>3rd date, try #2, no show. Get worried, turns out she's back in the hospital, more pain than was expected so they do tests, and within a day she's in the ICU. </p>

<p>Now I've only known her 4 weeks and been on 2 dates. We planned for me to visit this week at the hospital before the ICU happened. I'm not sure what we are yet. Haven't gotten intimate or even kissed yet (something I'd hoped for the third date- some cuddling/spooning and touch, she's big on hugs). I feel sympathy for her, but not sure if that's just the feeling you get when anyone is unwell or love. I don't have any close friends, beyond coworkers (and ex-coworkers) I don't get out much but I'm working on it. I feel light when I'm around her, normally I lean closer to sadness and apathy. I think I love her, told her so.</p>

<p>Should I visit her? Should I wait for her to recover and leave ICU to her family alone? We've both been clear about how we feel for each other so far, and she's insecure right now (rightfully so), but I don't want to impose and everything seems to be moving fast. I fear one or both of us might get hurt as we learn more about one another and don't want to hurt her. We're still in the early days and don't know much about one another. </p>

"How to convey who will be asked to join my wife and me in the delivery room without causing offense?","<p>My wife and I have just started trying to expand our family.  Last night, the topic randomly came up of who should be in the delivery room with us (if we are lucky enough to conceive) as my wife asked me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we be alone with the medical staff or should my mother [my mother-in-law] be in there with us?</p>

"How to respond to a friend insulting her own racial group?","<p>Here's the scenario:</p>

<p>I have a friend who had/has really abusive parents who are part of a tightly knit expatriate South Asian community from a certain minority ethnic/religious group here in our small-ish US city. She experienced the community as very toxic, and although she was born in the US, her parents have tried to force norms on her from their culture such as arranged marriage in addition to many shocking, flagrant examples of abuse that left her in a situation where being homeless after things came to a head with her parents was actually better than living with them. They still treat her in shockingly terrible ways.</p>

<p>So I'm very sympathetic toward her anger and need to vent about her community, but she does it by saying things like, ""Indians are the worst culture on Earth. Even thinking of my Latina friend, her culture has the toxic masculinity, but at least Latinx people are loyal to their own. In the Indian/Pakistani community everyone's trying to backstab each other,"" or, ""Punjabis--my dad's Punjabi--are known for being crazy aggressive,"" and so on.</p>

<p>I haven't been handling these conversations very well, since I'm torn between different desires:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support and commiserate with her--this ends up with me (and I'm white) agreeing with these racist viewpoints, by, e.g., sharing stories other South Asians have told me about toxic experiences in their cultures</li>
<li>Straight-up disagreeing with her since she's being racist, so I say things like, ""Indians don't all have the same culture, you're only from one specific community"" or telling her about really admirable South Asians I know or times when a South Asian I've known has explicitly taken the opposite stance of what she's saying Indians are like</li>
<li>Defending the honor of the many South Asians I've known and loved, who've made my own life successful, like the Pakistani mentor who set my career up to be successful and the ex-boyfriend who helped me recover from rape-induced PTSD</li>
</ul>

<p>But regardless of which tact I've taken, she keeps on complaining and generalizing about South Asians, and I either feel like I've been racist or failed as a friend to care about and give space for her pain. I want to draw a clear boundary that I'm not okay with generalizing about all South Asians or dubbing some cultures as completely inferior to others, while still being available to listen compassionately to her own experiences in her community, the toxic cultural strains she's experienced, her problems with her parents, and what sort of culture she wants to live in.</p>

<p>So, how can I change my approach to achieve this? And if she isn't willing to stop saying overgeneralizing racist things, how can I still be supportive without compromising my own ethics or feeling like I'm betraying the other South Asians in my life? Are there, for example, specific things I can say to reframe what she said so it's clear that I'm supporting her pain but not agreeing that how she's been treated is representative of all South Asian communities and individuals? Should I talk to her explicitly about setting this boundary, or just try to respond in a way that makes it clearer?</p>

"How to non-verbally communicate that I am listening?","<p>I recently got some feedback that people have the impression that when they talk to me, I am not listening.</p>

<p>Usually, when starting a conversation with people, I acknowledge them with something like 'yeah, what about it/what is it?', or I respond to people calling my name with 'yeah, that's me, what's up?'. </p>

<p>Anyways, as the conversation progresses, often people start talking more and for longer periods of time. I've always been told not to interrupt people, so when this happens I just wait until I get the impression they are done talking/making their point and then try to answer their question/keep the conversation going otherwise. </p>

<p>When being told something funny, I smile, when it's something disgusting/disturbing I'm sure my facial expression changes as well. But apparently, for a substantial number of people, I give the impression of zoning out when having long talks, even when I try to maintain eye contact without staring (which I was also told is a good thing). I nod to answer rhetorical questions. As for my posture, depends a bit on who I'm talking with and when, I do sit up when at work, but it's also during conversations with friends when we're all being couch potatoes and slouching...</p>

<p><strong>Are there any ways I can non-verbally communicate to people that yes, I am still paying attention to what they're telling me?</strong> I'm specifically interested in doing this non-verbally, so as not to interrupt the conversation. </p>

<p><sub>Bonus points for someone that can write me an answer with sources!</sub></p>

"Ending with my therapist","<p>I’ve been with this therapist for almost a year with the initial purpose of recovering from an abusive relationship. A lot of other stuff in life (loss of job, sick parent, etc.) has happened during the period and she has been the main support for me living in this foreign country. We have built trust and attachment, which allowed me to open up and heal.</p>

<p>However, I had to move back to my home after a prolonged job search and things have been a bit rocky with her ever since. </p>

<p>We discussed the move and arranged the transition in the last 4-5 sessions. She said it would be better if I could find somebody I could meet in person. She also offered to do remote Skype sessions just like last time during my visit in my home country for two months to take care of my sick parent. When I finalize my job search and settle down in a new city, and she would transfer me to a new therapist if she could find any there. The last in-person session was good. We said goodbye. I could see she wanted to hug, but I was not ready for that. I wrote a short poem for her which I planned to send to her via a post card once I settle in. </p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: 
However, the second to last session she commented something like I took more time than other people to process things. That comment was in sharp contrast with her previous encouraging and non-judgmental attitude. I was frustrated and said that “maybe I’m built this way!” But I  was deeply bothered. I felt it was a breach of trust as we had dealt with similar conflicts before and she knew that blame is a strong trigger for me. So why was she doing that? Why the sudden change? Was she trying to sabotage the relationship because I was leaving? I planned to bring this up in following sessions but found it very difficult.</p>

<p>A more disturbing problem came up two days ago when we had the first remote session. I noticed significant change in her attitude. And I became very depressed afterwards. </p>

<p>In the beginning of the session, she complained about the audio quality, tapped her fingers on the desk while I talked, and said she didn’t know how she could be helpful for me. I felt rushed and dismissed but was again unable to speak up. I tried to pull myself together and talked about something related to the abusive relationship. She listened as usual and I felt a bit relieved. She said that we could talk more and I scheduled another session next week with her. She ended the session in a hurry without the routine of closing up. </p>

<p>Immediately the session I couldn’t get out of my bed for the rest of the day. I had really bad sleep in the last few days. I couldn’t concentrate and do my job search as planned. It was the first time I was actually much worse after meeting her. </p>

<p>I did some reflections and realized that this therapeutic relationship is coming to an end and I have been trying to avoid it. As much as she had helped me deal with my avoidance pattern in my previous relationship, this time she could not be standing by me any more.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>

<p>I’m not sure if this remote therapy is going to do me any good. I’m saddened, hurt,  resentful and scared of future sessions. I would like not to have the next session but a brief phone call or an email to let her know how I was impacted. A potential outcome of this conversation is to end the therapy for good. How do I bring this up? </p>

"How to communicate better with my wife when she is in a bad mood and is slightly mean to me?","<p>Long story short, I have depression/anxiety. Some days I’m in a low mood and am extra sensitive.</p>

<p>My wife, like all of us, gets in her own moods, usually slightly aggravated, or snippy, or a little mean.</p>

<p>When these two personality moments collide, I get hurt easily and she then gets defensive as if she’s done nothing wrong when I tell her she was being mean.</p>

<p>If I step back from the moment I realize I’m extra sensitive, and she’s not all that mean. But over time her aggravated, snippy tone gets a bit much and I don’t feel the connectedness I would like.</p>

<p>My ideal for that situation is she would be able not to be mean, but if she is, she would be able to say “oh no! I didn’t mean to, I’m sorry!” Instead of “no I didn’t! No I’m not! ‘Sigh’ eye-roll”</p>

<p><strong>Example from today:</strong></p>

<p>I woke up depressed, but I attempted to shake it off. Texted her and ask if she wanted to spend the day with me (we’re currently staying in different locations cuz of her job). She texted back kinda annoyed “sure.” Now I know it’s a text but on a good day it would have been “ok!!! 😬😬” so it’s obvious with her. So I’m already cautious.</p>

<p>We talk on the phone. I try to be positive, and upbeat to sway the convo. I have bad cell service at my house so it’s cutting out. She gets annoyed that she can’t hear me. </p>

<p>She also isn’t the best storyteller so she tends to leave important details out. She’s telling me about how her sister will help her with work for the week, and if she should pay her the “full amount” for the job. Well it’s a 2-week job, so I asked, “why would you pay her the full amount? Isn’t it 2 weeks?” And she responded with an aggravated tone and a sigh and said “no... the fuuullll amount for one weeeekkk....not 2 weeks....why would I pay her for 2.....” </p>

<p>And me in my sensitive state couldn’t brush that off as easily and it affects me so I told her she was being kinda mean, which made it worse cuz she got defensive and said “no I’m not... how am I being mean??” Of course she said that in an unhappy aggravated tone.</p>

<p>Thoughts how we can communicate through these moments better?</p>

"How to communicate feelings and then stop communication with distant girlfriend?","<p>So we have been together for the past 3 years 9 months. Of course before our relationship we knew each other and did spend a couple of months before giving our friendship the <strong>""relationship""</strong> tag. We met when we were undergrads, and then continued it through our graduate studies as well. After our grad studies we both have been trying to get into PhD, and focus on our career. She being a bit academically weak I used to help her out in all possible way.</p>

<p>We always had a very transparent relationship. We had immense trust and respect for each other. Though we both had access to each others cell phone, emails, we never used to have that suspicion. It was mutual in nature.</p>

<p>Of late we are going through a rough patch. It all started around 7 months ago, last August. The frequent texts and calls stopped all of a sudden. Whenever I used to call it keep ringing only to get a call back as late as 24 hours. Whenever I conveyed my feeling to her regarding her sudden change in behavior she used to tell she wasn't well, she was away or my cell phone wasn't reachable.</p>

<p>I'm extremely sane as an individual and gave her all the space she did require (though she never once requested for it). Never did I try to enforce anything. Except for a few occasions where I did argue with her regarding her recent antics. Infact went as far as to tell that if she needed a breakup it's fine. She can have that. <em>But she told me how much I meant to her, and how much she was in love with me.</em></p>

<p>Things took a turn for worse in November where she went on a trip with her family for 15 odd days. In 2 days I would get a call that she was fine, and then she would hang up. I conveyed that emotionally I was down, and sad. She didn't give two hoots about it.</p>

<p>I can share a small incident that happened during her trip. I texted her in WhatsApp. She read it. No reply. Called her (17 times to be precise) didn't pick up. 14 hours plus went by no calls. Called her didn't pick up. Only to call back a couple of minutes later to inform that she was having a hard time with her Dad (just a background info, her Dad is pretty old and can't walk properly).</p>

<p>I did understand all her difficulties but couldn't reason with myself as to her sudden change of behavior. I mean who can't make a 1 minute call in a 24-hour time frame? At least if you love someone.</p>

<p>In December too, she took a sudden small trip for 5-days. These 5-days she maintained a total dead silence. No communication. I was so sad with all my previous experience I also never called her. I knew that once she returns should would call me and cook up stories. And she did shamelessly. I listened without any protest.</p>

<p>Yes that was the moment I was certain that she was cooking up stories. How? Did some digging and found out all this while when she told her trip was sudden, it was well planned out 3-weeks before hand. Secondly she was cheating academically and not sharing her resources. Like sending in applications for various jobs. It's startling cause I'm struggling and more or less have the same skill set.</p>

<p>And the time frame too matched. <strong>August.</strong> Confronted her, she confessed. She said she was sorry and she didn't knew what she was doing. I thought good. I gave her a second chance (ignoring my own inner voice, my friends and family), in the hope she would rectify. But the next day itself she did the same thing again.</p>

<p>She knows exactly how to manipulate me by playing with my emotions. At least that's what I feel now. I have been taken for granted too long.</p>

<p>I just want to know how to organically convey all my feelings and explain to her that I personally need to stop all communication with her (I am feeling emotionally and physically used).</p>

"Resolving conficts with customers as a waiter","<p>I recently had an unpleasant experience with one of customers in a club where I work as a waiter on weekends (it's my weekend job to get some money as a student). So far, I haven't had any unpleasant experience because of the club's nature (people usually mind their own business, they are friendly (and so are we :) ).</p>

<p>But this weekend, we hosted an event for some agency, whose parties tend to get ""wild"". Fast forward to two unpleasant experiences with customers: I, for the first time, encountered two guys throughout the night who said they gave me a 20-dollar bill (but I was sure it was a 10) when I returned them change for a $10 bill. I insisted on my side of the story with the first guy (I'm always totally sober on the job, always check the money and do calculations for change in my head etc.), but I got ""scared"" with the second guy (questioning in my head: ""What if he really gave me a 20? What if even the first guy gave me a 20 and I screwed him over?"") and returned him 10 bucks more.</p>

<p>At the end of the evening, when we counted all the money, sure enough there was $10 missing. I had to cover them from my own pocket (you can guess what it feels like being a student who works for $5/hour and covering money from your own tips which don't get extensive here in Europe...).</p>

<p>How could a conflict like that be resolved? I always insisted on ""the customer is always right"" rule when it came down to work at some other jobs, but you just cannot do it like that when it comes to money. What should I say in my defense instead of things like ""I'm totally sure that you gave me a 10.""? In conflicts like these, it's their word against mine and I can do almost nothing about it...</p>

"Forming new friendships as a 35 year old?","<p>I will try and keep this succinct as I could type pages upon pages. In short, I underwent a radical change in my life 4 years ago where I had to walk away from almost my total family (all but one sibling). My primary friendship was united with a sibling and at the time of the break I make the  (regretable) decision to close that friendship group. I had other friends, but they were few. I started a new job and made some friends there. I'm a person that seems to fall into states of a small close nit circle of friends. Anyways, I sadly become a very toxic person and started to push away (directly and indirectly) my new and existing friends. </p>

<p>I'm now at the point where I've confronted my personal issues and am working on the causes of the toxicity that I had had. But, I essentially have no friends. There are a few people on social media that I make contact with, but there is no one that I actually socialise with in person. If tomorrow I decided to have a party, I literally would have no-one to invite. I just started a new job and I've started to make 'friends' of sorts with a few people, but outside of that the only face to face interaction I have with anyone is with my sibling and her family (I live with them). </p>

<p>I recently turned 35 and to be honest, I have no idea how to now make friends. Where do you go? who do you contact? How does a person make new friends in their mid 30s? Is there 'friends sites' like dating sites?</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </p>

"How should I (and should I) inform my parents that I no longer believe that the religion I was brought up with is the truth?","<p>I am 15, and have always been intelligent and an independent thinker. I am also quite introverted, and may have borderline Asperger's syndrome. I live with my parents, who are members of the local (ultra) orthodox Jewish community, and they have attempted to raise me to believe in their views regarding God and religion. I, however, after some extensive consideration have come to the conclusion that I personally do <strong>not</strong> believe in what I have been told about life, its meaning and Judaism. I regard it as nearly certain that Judaism is false, but it is possible a God exists.</p>

<p>I attend a boys-only Jewish school, which includes in its curriculum long periods of religious study at the start of each day, which I am starting to find unbearable, mainly due to the fact that I now realise that the lessons, are in my worldview, patently false, and therefore pointless. I am also finding it difficult to keep up a charade of religious observance, especially when it includes long synagogue services and the upcoming ""High holidays""/<em>Yamim Noraim</em>.</p>

<p>As a result, it would seem that the solution would be to inform my parents of my decision, given that this is inevitable if I am to live a life according to my own principles upon being an adult. However, I am anxious as to how they will react. Neither of my parents grew up as Orthodox Jews (both took it up in their late teens, so the rest of my extended family are largely non-religious), and their own parents accepted their choices in life, so I hope they (rightly) feel that they owe me the right to make my own choices too. However, coming clean would mean that I could not really stay on at my current school and might entail rejection from my current friends (not to mention family), and as an introvert, I anticipate that I will struggle to adjust to a new school, especially when it is so different to my current, religious one.</p>

<p>I would deeply appreciate advice regarding the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Should I come clean to my parents or keep pretending for another few years until I can start my own life?</p></li>
<li><p>If I tell my parents, how should I do so?</p></li>
<li><p>How easily do you think I could adjust to a not-so ""sheltered"" state school? I am particularly anxious about the fact that violence and bullying could be more prevalent there.</p></li>
<li><p>How should I react if my parents try to coerce me to change my mind, or force me to stay on at my current school?</p></li>

"How to negotiate about drying clothes with someone from a culture who isn't used to it?","<p>I live in a shared house. Recently someone from India moved in. Though we have an electric clothes dryer, some of my clothes are not suitable to put inside. For example, a few dress pants, swimsuit, workout clothes (e.g. Under Armor), thermal underwear, should not go inside a clothes dryer. They should be hung to dry.</p>

<p>I had been using a collapsible laundry rack to hang my clothes to dry. I kept it in a common area (and told the roommates they are free to use it). I don't think it's hygienic drying clothes in my bedroom. The new roommate is very offended by my laundry. I tried to compromise and say I would only have it out one day and pack it up as soon as possible. She complained to the landlord. The landlord is also Indian.</p>

<p>I had a talk with them and realized they don't know some clothes can't go in the dryer. They have a lot of trouble understanding this. How can I explain it? Are there any websites? They just say they put all their clothes in and haven't had a problem. I guess when I was growing up most people had the unfortunate experience of putting something in the dryer that ruined it.</p>

<p>After I tried to explain that some clothes need to be air dried to my roommate, she said told me to speak to the landlord so he can build something. I don't think this will work, and he also seems to think anything can go in the dryer. Since it's necessary for me to clean my clothes at the extreme this is something I could move out over. I certainly don't want to go to extremes and I doubt the landlord wants me to move out. </p>

<p>EDIT: to everyone saying ""think of other places"" I already tried. Clothes won't dry outside in the winter. There's no space in the laundry room. There's no space in a closet (a comment suggest this). I am open to suggestions. I admit a common area is strange, but the space is there and I can't think of alternatives. I don't think my bedroom is good because there isn't enough space and the ventilation for moisture isn't good. </p>

<p><strong>Cultural background</strong>: in Japan, it is common to ""<em>confess</em>"" after about 3 dates/weeks (if you date once a week). We often meet in the following order. In order to make it easier to understand, it is written very simply:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Become friends → Eat food several times in the shop → Tell them you like → Become a couple → Join hands → Kiss</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cultural differences and questioning</strong>:</p>

<p>However, I do not know the general dating etiquette for Dutch people (or any people from overseas). I am confused about how many times does one go on a date before telling Dutch people (or people in the world) that one loves them? Is confessing via ""I love you"" accepted in Dutch culture?  Because of cross-culture differences, I don't want to make mistakes.</p>

<p>What I want to ask everyone is ""<em>the processing order until dating with her</em>"".</p>

<p>In what order do Dutch people (or people from all over the world) proceed?</p>

<p><strong>How can I convey my feelings to the woman I date without breaking the Dutch etiquette?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Additional notes (2019/10/26)</strong></p>

<p>Thank you, it took a while but I finished reading.
I understood your advice as follows:</p>

<h1>①Prerequisites</h1>

<h2>1. About she and I eating out together</h2>

<p>It is common to eat out with friends.</p>

<h2>2.Until you tell her that you are romantically interested in her, you are NOT dating (by her standards).</h2>

<p>I told her, “I want to talk to you more so let ’s eat out”.
So she may not have a romantic interest in me yet.</p>

<h2>3.Being a couple implies a steady, long-term and committed type of relationship that doesn't necessarily come with 3 or 4 dates.</h2>

<p>Thank you, I didn't know.
I think everyone is different, but how long do you get along?</p>

<h2>4. ""I love you"" is strong.</h2>

<p>It means that it should be done after more time, becoming a partner and getting along. When I get better, I tell her that I love her.</p>

<h2>5. The ""confession"" as you understand it, is a demonstration of romantic interest in someone, and expression of a wish to move the relationship from friends / acquaintances to romantic.</h2>

<p>This is what I mean by ""confession"".
When I want to have a romantic relationship with her,
""I love you.""
Is a mistake,
You should say ""I like you."" (Or a mild word).</p>

<h1>②In what order do Dutch people (or people from all over the world) proceed? You taught me two options.</h1>

<p>I ’m “Option 2” so I ’m going in the order that I write below.</p>

<pre><code>Go on a date → Join hands → Kiss (or not, depends on you and your girl) → Go on more dates until you decide to move to a formal relationship → Become a couple
</code></pre>

<h1>③ How can I convey my feelings to the woman I date without breaking the Dutch etiquette?</h1>

<h2>1. I'm calling ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do"".</h2>

<p>Japan has the same words! So thank you very much.</p>

<h1>④Managing expectations: Be aware that if you're just going to the restaurant together it doesn't necessarily imply a date for her.</h1>

<p>I understand. When I go to a restaurant because I want to have a romantic relationship with her,I tell her not to “eat out” but “to date”.</p>

<h1>⑤Managing expectations: Be aware that we (westerners) are much more comfortable with physical intimacy (holding hands, hugging, kissing, etc.) without being in a committed relationship.From our standards, you can even kiss and decide to not go on a second date.</h1>

<p>I understand. That's what I wrote below.</p>

<pre><code>Japanese kissed on a date → She has a very romantic interest in me
</code></pre>

<p>However.</p>

<pre><code>westerners kissed on date → she went as if greeting
</code></pre>

"How to say no to an extremely pushy friend","<p>My friend, which is also my coworker, likes to organise events for his friends. He invites a lot of people, but always expects everyone to join him regardless of if they have already planned something for that day.</p>

<p>Since I'm one of his co-workers, but we work in different locations, he uses Skype to ask me. This is our conversation that started yesterday. We're Germans so the texts are loosely translated. (Edited to hide personal information)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Him: hey, want to go to the movie? I'm gathering some friends.</p>
  
  <p>Me: maybe, what movie and when? :)</p>
  
  <p>Him: To the new ***. Next Friday at 8. We might go for some food afterwards.</p>
  
  <p>Me: ah, sorry man. Got something planned for then already.</p>
  
  <p>Him: can't you reschedule that?</p>
  
  <p>Me: nope, had it planned months before</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>About 2 hours later</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Him: where would you like to get food after the movie?</p>
  
  <p>Me: nowhere, I won't be there</p>
  
  <p>Him: let me know if you change your mind</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A bit later</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Him: What do you think of **** restaurant?</p>
  
  <p>Me: no idea, never been there</p>
  
  <p>Him: here's the menu (URL). Choose something in advance so we can order ahead Friday.</p>
  
  <p>Me: won't be necessary. I won't be there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Next day, in the morning</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Him: Don't forget to send in your order for Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point I started ignoring him</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Him: you'll be there right. I can count on you?</p>
  
  <p>Me: I already promised others. I can't come with you guys and that won't change</p>
  
  <p>Him: we're with 9 already. One more and we can get a discount.</p>
  
  <p>Me: Don't expect me to help with that</p>
  
  <p>Him: think a bit about it. I'll message you again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I have made clear enough that I can't come and told him I was busy that night. Yet, he still doesn't seem to accept that as an answer. This happens every time he plans something, and I'm getting really tired of it.</p>

<p>How can I make clear to this person that I can't come and that he has to accept that?</p>

"Asking for fees for an assumed free service","<p>During my university years, I had designed and developed my department website. It's been many years since I graduated, however, the office IT staff still contacts me if something goes wrong. This happens because the website was made using a web framework whose expertise is rare, and which is now getting outdated. Anyways, I respond to all their queries, as I feel a sense of belonging to the department.</p>

<p>However, time is more precious now and I want to stop this ""free"" continued support. I want to update/migrate the website so that it runs without issues for years. This will take about 2-3 weeks of dedicated time, which will require me taking off from my job. So, I would like the department to pay me some token amount so that I do not feel guilty for investing my time. </p>

<p>I want to communicate the same to the Chairman. However, he knows me well as a student and we hold a good student-mentor relationship. How should I ask him without making the offer appearing <em>cheap</em>? Or, should I drop the idea altogether and simply tell them to take someone's service professionally? Note that I personally want to refurbish the website myself as it has carried my name for years and I wish that it continue to do so. </p>

"What is Soda Fountain Etiquette?","<p>The other day I was walking with my cup to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_fountain"" rel=""noreferrer"">Soda Fountain</a><sup>1</sup> at a restaurant.

<p>This didn't result in more than a glare, but it <em>did</em> make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>How can I tell when it's appropriate to use the Soda Fountain when someone is already on it in the future (as opposed for waiting for them to be finished)? Is there some etiquette on how far away the two drinks should be for two people to use it at once?</p>

"How can I tell my roommates they are being too loud at night?","<p>Background:<br>
I'm a university student (USA) that currently shares an apartment with 5 other people, 2 people to each room. Typically, I have to get up early to go to work and then go to school after that. This means that I go to sleep much earlier than most people my age (around 10:30 P.M. most nights), so I can function at work in the morning. My roommates operate quite differently (going to bed after 1 A.M. most nights). Our walls are extremely thin, so if they are having a lively conversation, or if they are watching something, it bleeds right into my room. Additionally, my room roommate will burst into the room in the middle of the night, turning on the lights, waking me up from my half-sleep, as he tries to get to sleep himself. </p>

<p>This morning was a breaking point for me. Apparently, three of my roommates stayed up the entire night, burst into my room at 5:30 in the morning (shortly before I would normally wake up), waking up my other roommate, so that they could tell him of their night's escapades and go eat breakfast.</p>

<p>How can I let my roommates know that their noise is affecting my sleep in a tactful way that won't make them see me as a stick-in-the-mud (I consider these people my friends)?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: How can I tell my roommates they are being too loud without them hating me?</strong></p>

The dutch magazine always has covers of girls, sometimes in swimsuits or dressed a bit seductivaly but NEVER nude or topless.</p>

"How can I find out how many photos I should take If I'm given a film camera to take a picture?","<p>

On occasion, when I go to tourist hotspots, people sometimes give me their cameras and ask me to take pictures of them. Most of the time, those are digital camera (e.g. smartphones), and it makes sense to take multiple pictures. However, I may be handed a traditional film camera. (I'm experienced in photography, so I know how to operate different types of cameras.)</p>

<p>I read <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/23245/how-many-photos-should-i-take-if-im-given-a-camera-to-take-a-picture"">How many photos should I take If I&#39;m given a camera to take a picture?</a>, but none of the answers there address my question. Most suggest taking multiple ""trial"" shots and having them reviewed by the people being photographed. However, none of those are options with film cameras, where there is a direct cost associated with each picture (exposures on the roll of film), and it's not possible to have the photos reviewed (until the whole roll is shot and they get the roll developed).</p>

<p>Like the other question's author, I also get self-conscious thinking that they're thinking I'm taking too long, because with a film camera, I take my time to make sure the shot is just perfect.</p>

<p>How can I find out how many pictures I should take normally, if I'm handed a <em>film</em> camera? As the other question says, asking them directly seems rather unnatural. I'm not sure how the other person would react (it could come across as a derogatory comment about the fact they use film, of which I'd had many), but that could just be my self-consciousness. It can also show me as a naive person for clicking photos. </p>

"Cellphone-obsessed friend (and driver)","<p>I have a good friend who, in my opinion, uses his cell phone too much while we are hanging out. When we do things like go to dinner together as a group, he is often not paying attention, engrossed in his phone. During many conversations, sometimes concerning personal issues in which I value his opinion, he is continually looking at his phone (answering text messages, using Facebook, Instagram, etc).  When he does finally put it down to respond to whatever I've been saying, he often veers from the subject because he wasn't really paying attention.</p>

<p>Worse, he often drives and texts (or uses Instagram, or looks for music on Spotify). Things got tense the other day when he was driving and nearly ran a red light because he was not looking. I was already nervous from his lane drifting, and out of fear I yelled out something (not vulgar or offensive at all, but not particularly polite) to get him to put his phone down and pay attention. Now he is sort of upset with me for ""having attitude"" with him—but I am not going to apologize for simply having a fear-based reaction to a legitimately dangerous situation, regardless of how abruptly my request was made.</p>

<p>Another friend and I have brought up our concern with him, and his response is generally that ""it's not that bad"" and he claims he just has a better-than-normal ability to multitask (i.e. pay attention to what we are saying while simultaneously interacting with his phone). I know this is not the case because when I actually am paying attention, I notice his responses are not always exactly on topic.</p>

<p>As for the driving, I don't feel I can require that he not text and drive (despite it being illegal where I live) because he is an adult and can do what he wants. But given that there is already tension around this subject, I feel that always insisting that I drive when we go somewhere is going to come across as passive-aggressive.</p>

<p>It is a relatively new phenomenon in our 10-year friendship. I don't want to lose him as a friend but he is starting to be a drag to hang around with. </p>

<p>How can I communicate to him (while not ""having attitude"") that his behavior is putting a strain our friendship, especially when I've already seen that he doesn't view it as being a problem?</p>

<p>He lives far enough away that car travel is necessary to hang out. And we like to go on road trips together. How do I manage my safety in the car with him when it is not always practical for me to drive everywhere?</p>

"Asking to be made aware of a surprise because of anxiety issues","<p>I'm on the autism spectrum and I have anxiety issues. Doing unknown things in an unknown place terrifies me.</p>

<p>From time to time (~twice a year) my workplace would organize a ""team-building"" at an unknown place where we will do unknown stuff (because it's a surprise).</p>

<p>I have already done two of those. I always try to gather as much information as possible (by talking to coworkers and to some of the organizers). But, since the whole thing is a ""surprise"", I never manage to know much (or not enough in advance). So, when the day comes, I'm utterly terrified and really not ready to enjoy my day (which is supposed to be the whole point of those team-building things).</p>

<p>Even though I would probably still feel stressed if I had all the information in advance, it would still be much less stressful for me.</p>

<p>I have thought about taking a day off those specific days, but my manager already blames me for not going to the optional work dinner/party. So, not going to those <strong>paid</strong> team building day, doesn't really seem like a good idea (because I would be too badly seen).</p>

<p>So, how could I request those information and be taken seriously? When I talk about them, people often tend to dismiss my fear as ""don't worry, it will be fine"" or ""you are just overthinking this"". They don't seem to realize how important it is for me. </p>

<p>How can I convey that this is <strong>really</strong> important to me and that I truly <strong>need</strong> those information (and more than just one day in advance)?</p>

<p>Also, I would like to avoid bringing the fact that ""I'm mentally ill"" too much. I don't want people to think I'm unfit for my job because of those mental health issues that I have (and those team building days have nothing to do with what I do on a day-to-day basis). And I also would like to avoid people thinking that I'm using my disability as a tool for my own purposes.</p>

"What techniques are proven ways to fix an unbalance between levels of benevolence-based trust and integrity-based trust?","<p>In my <a href=""https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/a/22856/1599"">latest answer</a>, I explained the concepts of benevolence-based trust and integrity-based trust:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Intentions are more important than honesty for building benevolence-based trust.</p>
  
  <p>So, a pro-social deception, even if found out, can still make Alice trust that your friend has good intentions towards her. [...]</p>
  
  <p>Although prosocial lies increase benevolence-based trust, they harm integrity-based trust.</p>
  
  <p>Meaning that next time Alice asks your friend if a dress looks good on her, and your friend answers with yes, Alice might think twice before taking that as an answer: She might start wondering if you're just being kind or really being honest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm currently in a situation with a few people where there's a lot of benevolence-based trust, but it's getting in the way of the integrity-based trust.  </p>

<p>For example, there's been some private stuff going on that has my mother regularly voicing she feels like a bad mom. Whenever I tell her that's not true, and that she did a good job of raising all her kids, and that whatever those kids are struggling with now isn't her fault, she flat out thanks me for my kind words, but you can see she doesn't believe them. </p>

<p>I do want her to believe me though, and I've told her such. It doesn't help much. I tried being more honest and avoiding any pro-social deceptions, but that's not doing much good either. It mostly leads to people believing I'm only honest when I have something to say that isn't all that kind. </p>

<p>I realize that due to some past interactions with these people, while they still trust I have good intentions, they just can't get themselves to trust that I am also speaking the truth. I'd like to restore a certain balance here, work back to a relationship with these people where they can trust I have good intentions and also trust me to be honest whenever I say something kind.</p>

"How can I approach the situation where I feel I’m neglected?","<p>I’m the youngest child out of three and I’ve felt passive and alone most of the time since I was a kid. My oldest siblings were and are closer to each other (now even physically since I’m abroad). This feeling of not being seen or not fitting in with others has always been there and due to moving to different locations I don’t have a big social circle which I really miss. Unlike me, my brother and sister have never moved and have lifelong friends. I’ve left my home country as an adult some years ago and during one of my visits back home my brother had a party. As soon as one of their closest friends arrived she saw me and commented: “oh! I’d forgotten you had another sister!” This hit me so deeply, as someone had verbalized all those feelings of being invisible that I’ve had all my life. I’ve noticed that people do talk up about me and admire my lifestyle/achievements but never really have conversations with me or reach out to see how I’m doing unless they need something. I try to build connections by keeping in touch and doing nice things as much as I can but I end up nowhere after a while because I find it’s all one way. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: my parents were recently visiting me and during their visit my siblings would call regularly to talk to them. I also burned my hand while trying to serve my parents which kept me off work for weeks and my siblings were asking about that as well during the parents visit. However the contact has completely diminished since they’ve returned. I went out of my way to buy some presents for my brother, his wife and his son, and I would have liked if they acknowledged and thanked for receiving it. But as I say they haven’t even texted me once since my parents returned. Similar things have happened before (including my sister forgetting my birthday for weeks) and I’ve happened to nag to my mother about that where she’s then probably hinted it to my siblings so they’ve then called me which had no value to me anymore. I know I shouldn’t have expectations for giving presents to people but a simple “thank you” or even “how are you doing?” doesn’t cost much. I don’t want to victimize myself and want to stop feeling ignored and invisible if I can. Should I ring up my brother and ask if they got the presents? And if so, how to approach it so that I make my point without sounding nasty or passive aggressive?</p>

"Seeking clarification on the use of ""They/Them/Their"" as a personal gender pronoun","<p>We currently exist in a time of macro-evolution changes to our interpretation of gender and sex. The classical binary system of the Christian based Western cultures (and others) is being challenged and we are now identifying and given representations to those that present themselves as exceptions to this former 'rule'. </p>

<p>Personally, I am in total support of different gender pronouns that allow for a more complete categorical representation of the gender spectrum. Now, one that has caused a lot of confusion on my part is the use of 'They/Them/Their' as a singular pronoun. The classical use (based on the binary interpretation) is that it's use is collective (i.e. plural) or a state of unknown. So, when I refer to a group of males, females, or males &amp; females I will use 'they/them/their'. If I'm speaking to a generic human where the gender is unknown I equally use 'they/them/their' as a gender neutral term. So, in my research online (and I've found there's significant variances within the community) it appears that those that choose  'they/them/their' use this as a singular pronoun as they are neither male nor female. This appears to be an extension of the current binary system to a tri-ary system. Instead of 'he/him/his' and 'she/her/hers' we have a third category 'them/them/their' and that is their gender identity. That's great. But in doing so, we've lost two elements (a) A collective gender term and (b) a gender neutral term. </p>

<p>Now, when I've raised this before I'm generally told that 'they/them/their' still remains as a collective and gender neutral term. This is where my confusion is created. If I don't know if a person is male, female, or 'they' - what neutral terminology do I use? and equally if I have a group of people (male, female, they) how do I refer to that group of people?</p>

<p>It seems that if we use it for both, we are saying that people that are 'they' don't know what they are AND don't know if they're a single person or a group?</p>

<p>I suppose one option is that we no longer have gender neutral or gender plural terms - but my goodness, how can that be a positive change for our system of language?</p>

<p>I'm desperately trying to find information on this topic, but I've found that when I present these questions on FB LGBT pages I'm viciously attacked. I reject the principle that I have to just respect whatever another decides. I will call a person whatever they want, but I equally (if not more) find the consistency of language to be critical - How else can we speak without ambiguity to one another?</p>

<p>So, if anyone knows of credible information on this topic and/or whether I've misinterpreted the situation, could you please clarify. </p>

"How to repair my relationship with my sister?","<p>My sister and I were best friends growing up. In the past couple of years, she has met, dated, and married a guy with mental health problems that affect their day to day life. My sister didn't know the extent of his problems until after they were married (and to be fair- I don't think my BIL even knew how much he’d struggle).</p>

<p>The outcome is that my BIL requires regular reassurance and support. He struggles with crowds. He says he can't work (which was not the pre-wedding plan) so my sister works to support them both. He manages some minor cooking and cleaning in the house but the bulk of the household work is my sisters, including dealing with phone calls, bills, etc.</p>

<p>As a result, my sister’s money and time is tight. She is always looking exhausted when I see her. I feel sorry for her, equally, she knew at least half of his issues when she was getting to know him, so she has willingly taken on a lot of this.</p>

<p>My problem is that now my relationship with my sister has completely changed. We have not spent any time just the two of us since the wedding (though I have asked). Whenever we do something with BIL and friends I often have to offer to pay for the activity because my sister can't afford it. I have tried to spend time with BIL at least a couple of times a month when I get a workday with an early finish and my sister is still out working. I have given BIL lifts in my car as he doesn't drive. But I'm now starting to feel like an assistant rather than a sibling.</p>

<p>The final nail in the coffin so to speak was just recently. My BIL and sister’s 2nd anniversary. I gave them money in a card. (I knew they wanted money over a personal gift). It was more money than I could reasonably afford, and it was on top of constant purchases mentioned previously (which I'd made with the intention of helping my sister see our friends as otherwise, she might decline their invites out). They did say thank you as I handed them the card. But it sounded like the same thank you you might say to anyone passing you an item. And after that I received nothing. I almost wonder if they had expected more money and were disappointed, or if they were happy and just didn't bother to text to say thanks when they opened the card.</p>

<p>And for their anniversary they were able to go on their first holiday abroad of the year. I don't begrudge my sister this - she needs a break! But I haven't had a holiday abroad this year because my funds are so tight and I started remembering all the times I must have paid for their stuff while they were saving for this trip. It made me realise I'd helped them way too much. And been taken somewhat for granted for it.  </p>

<p>They have a new kitten and asked me to care for it for 3 days. They said cats don't need a lot of attention so, to be honest, I was expecting to drop in maybe twice a day and sort food and water and maybe play with the cat for an hour. Turns out kittens are not supposed to be left alone for more than a few hours (discovered via a friend and then internet). So I have had to reschedule tons of my diary over these 3 days to feel like this kitten isn't going to be left emotionally wrecked with loneliness or do damage to itself. It's surprisingly exhausting - the kitten barely sleeps during the day and I've just discovered that the friend who is going to be house sitting and cat sitting for them when the 3 days is up is actually coming late into day 4, so I'm still going to have to get over there and care for the kitten on day 4 too.</p>

<p>In short - I feel like my sister is worn out and I am just a crutch in her life now. We don't have any private chats, I only see her with friends when I've offered to fund it, and anything I do for her she doesn't seem grateful for. How can I address this with my sister to repair our relationship? I know with BIL it will never be truly the same, but I want it to be functioning. She has no idea how I am or if I need help. What can I say or do to try to reassemble this relationship?</p>

"Negative feedbacks and ""Language smoother""","<p>I don't know what is the ""scientific"" term for that but I noticed that, when people give negative feedback, they sometimes use ""tricks"" to make their words less harsh.</p>

<p>For example, they will use smileys or exclamative (""!"", ""?"") or sentences like: ""I <em>might</em> be wrong, but..."", ""It <em>seems</em> to me that..."", etc..</p>

<p>I call those ""language smoother"" and I remember reading an article about that saying that women use those ""tricks"" far more than men.</p>

<p>(<strong>Edit</strong>: <a href=""https://qz.com/work/1128150/your-companys-slack-is-probably-sexist/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here is the article I'm talking about</a> and <a href=""http://news.rice.edu/2012/10/10/women-use-emoticons-more-than-men-in-text-messaging/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here is the study to support it</a>)</p>

<p>What I would like to know is: How do ""language smoother"" work (from a psychological point of view) and how to use them properly (to avoid being seen as childish, unprofessional, or lacking self-confidence)?  </p>

<p>And, as an aside, if there is a proper term for that, I would be glad to know how exactly it is called?</p>

<p>Note that I'm only interested in written communication and mostly when it comes to interacting with people you don't know or don't know well.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm highly interested in external sources, especially scientific studies on the subject but I will still accept personal experiences as a backup. </p>

"How to clarify to a friend-now-co-worker that I want our relationship to be less extensive?","<p>I have known Bob for some five years - followed a few courses together, then worked closely together on a few projects, and now we share an office but work on largely separate things. Because we are both working part-time at home or elsewhere as well, we only meet each other twice a week or so.</p>

<p>Over the last several months (perhaps a year or so) I feel Bob has become very self-centered. Lots of things happened in his life (think marriage, house, children), so I can kind of understand, but he has also become very self-centered in conversations about more trivial topics (think DIY, gardening, cooking). In principle I like to hear what he makes/grows/cooks, but don't expect to hear the details of all the different kinds of screws/potting soil/olive oil without asking for it. When I move the conversation to something we have in common, or bring up something of my own, he does not say anything relevant but instead starts talking about one of his topics, only tangentially related to what I said.</p>

<p>Because we don't live close, a lot of our communication naturally goes over WhatsApp. I get sent photos and links of all kinds of things, and my first though with most of these messages is: <em>what made him think that I would be interested in this?</em> I usually don't reply, get a new, unrelated message the next day, don't reply, etc., and on the third-or-so message I reply with something like ""yes, nice"" and a lame excuse that I'd been busy. Somehow this does not get the message across that I'm not interested.</p>

<p>In the past me and my partner have visited them and vice versa. It is now clearly our turn to host them (we visited them several times, they us only once or twice), and we have invited them in more and less explicit ways over the past year. The last reply to this was (in-person) that it was too complicated for them to come, but that we are always welcome. I found that quite rude, since it suggests that they would be more important to us than vice versa. Furthermore I know for a fact that they visited others in our area. So we don't invite them anymore.</p>

<p>At this point I've given up on this friend. But because we share an office, I cannot avoid him altogether. I want to continue to have lunch with my other colleagues and can bear him in this context, but would like our relationship to become more strictly professional. His continuous stream of text messages causes some distress, since they are at times provoking or plain incorrect about things I care about (anything from religion to the software we use).</p>

<p>I may have been sending some mixed signals (not replying to messages but still inviting them over), but only in situations where it felt utterly rude to disengage.</p>

<p><strong>How can I more clearly communicate to this person I want our relationship to become more strictly professional?</strong></p>

<p><sub>(Context: we are well-educated western Europeans. There may be some form of asperger involved from both sides.)</sub></p>

"Asking my partner why they don't want me to pleasure them","<p>Whenever we are intimate, my partner never lets me pleasure them.
If I try to continue after I'm done, they just shoot me down with something like ""it's OK,"" or ""you don't need to,"", or ""don't worry about it.""</p>

<p>At first I thought they might be shy about it since there are other people at my home, but even if we're at a hotel or their place they still act like this.</p>

<p>We've been together for a little over a year and it's been great, but I feel like it would feel more special if it wasn't just me who is enjoying it.</p>

<p><em>About them:</em> They're a full time software engineer and also in a master's program. They're also older than me by a bit. Not sure what else is important? They don't socialize much, we met in an online game but we don't play much anymore. My partner is a lot more assertive than I am, so they're usually the ones to initiate and lead it. If I try to initiate they just take the lead and it's basically the same as usual.</p>

<p><strong>How can I ask them to tell me why they're unwilling to continue afterwards?</strong></p>

<p><em>Challenges:</em> I don't want to ask in a way that puts any blame for anything on them, or maybe in a way that doesn't make them uncomfortable or embarrassed if there is a reason for it. I never actually talked to them about it, it's just that whenever I try they stop me. I don't want to seem pushy or annoying when I bring it up.</p>

"How do I determine my boss's position on transgender rights?","<p>I am a transwoman. I am in the closet. I am starting to transition so staying in the closet long-term isn't an option. Before I come out of the closet I would like to gauge how I think people are going to react to the news. Tailoring how I broach the subject to the individual, if done well, can make the whole process smoother for all of us.</p>

<p>For people I know well this is easy. I have a sense of how each one of my family members and close friends are going to react.</p>

<p>But how do you guess the reactions of people you are not close to, like my boss? It would be weird if I went to him tomorrow and said, ""Hey, Good Morning. How was your weekend? By the way, what is your viewpoint on transgender people?"" That seems exceedingly awkward and unproductive. We don't have idle chit-chat conversations. Clearly knowing how my boss might take it, however, can affect me deeply and may change how I approach it. I am in the U.S. in an at-will state so I could end up jobless over this.</p>

<p>I have not tried anything so far. I don't know how to drop the topic casually when we don't talk casually. We are a small company and I don't interact with them or anyone directly very often. I come in, exchange pleasantries, get my assignments for the day, and am off on my own. I then see them again at quitting time.</p>

"How to express sympathy to a very great friend whose father is dying very soon?","<p>Right now I am confronted with a difficult situation where I want to ask for your empathetic recommendation. The father of one of my very best friends strongly suffers on cancer and is dying very soon (potentially even today). She told me about the actual seriousness when I wrote her to ask for a walk.</p>

<p>Our friendship is incredibly strong, so I want to be there for her in any possible case. How can I express the value of our friendship and that I am always there for her, no matter what mental constitution she is? I am unsure how to consider the situation with her dad in a reply. I don't know him personally, but she told me about him and her family many times.</p>

"How to ask a friend why they unfriended me on Facebook, and not make them feel cornered?","<p>I know being friends in social media don't equate to real friends in life. However I noticed a trend. Several people I hangout with on a regular basis unfriended me on Facebook. I can't help but wonder why. I still see them regularly. In fact one of them was the one who took the picture I use for my profile. I don't use my real last name and was wondering if my profile is coming off spammy? We certainly have used Facebook e.g. chat messages and invited each other to events. I guess now days there's nothing you can do with a non-friend as you could with a friend on Facebook.</p>

<p>What's the best way to casually approach this with out making the situation awkward and allowing them to be honest?</p>

<p>I'm thinking ""hey I noticed we're not friends on Facebook anymore, did you realize we got unfriended?""</p>

"Showing a homeless person that you care about their well-being","<p>Every day, when I go to work, I pass by a homeless person. At first, I just waved hello to them, but now I shake hands with them and, when doing that, they will start asking me questions (like ""how are you?"").</p>

<p>I believe they want to have a conversation and feel like a human being but, as someone on the autism spectrum, I struggle to know what to answer them and how to do the conversation. </p>

<p>When they ask me how I am, I do want to give them a meaning-full answer (something more than just a ""fine, and you?"") but I'm also afraid that talking about how work is going for me would be inconsiderate (since they don't have a job). As a result of this, I do answer with a ""fine, and you?"" and, since I don't know what to say afterward, the conversation just day (then I say ""Have a good day"" and I go to work). </p>

<p>I went them to know that I care (at least a little) about them and their well being. I would like them to know that I think of them as a real human being and not as some sort of furniture or nuisance.</p>

<p>So, how could I keep the conversation going while not being inconsiderate and also showing my interest in their well-being?</p>

<p><strong>More details about this homeless person</strong>:</p>

<p>They have a small dog, they suffer from diabetes, some days they aren't here but I don't know why (and I'm afraid that asking them might be too intrusive/rude).</p>

"How can I more clearly ask people to accommodate for my autism?","<p>I've got autism. This isn't always clear to people*. Sometimes I need accommodations for a sensory issue to participate in a normal way. </p>

<p>One time, there was a colleague with a strong aftershave, for example, who needed my help. </p>

<p>Sometimes these conversations go like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: I'm so sorry, your aftershave is causing some sensory issues for me. I've actually got autism and I've got trouble with some strong smells. I would really appreciate if you could tone it down a little in the future.</p>
  
  <p>Them: Oh, I get a headache from strong smells too sometimes. A painkiller usually solves it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Them: Wanna see New Movie tonight?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Sure! Shall we go to Cinema X? It's a little bit further of a drive, but we can use my car. They have those chairs where the people next to you don't touch you, while the closer Cinema Y does not. I don't like touching, you know. Autistic -smile-.</p>
  
  <p>Them: Stop being such a snowflake! Everyone else can deal with those chairs, I'm sure you can too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm aware I'm asking them to do something for me with nothing in return, but it really is a big deal for me. How can I achieve this better?</p>

<hr>

<p>*This means, in simple terms, that I have more brain-connections, which means I can easily get overstimulated. My brain uses more resources than for most people, which means I get tired faster. In very rare cases I can have an autistic meltdown, where some parts of my brain, like the language processing part, shut down. Sometimes autism causes underdeveloped social skills and/or language skills. It's different for everyone. I lack most of the autism traits you see in the media. My social skills are a little below average, but far from bad. Because of this, people tend to question whether I really have autism. This seems to stem from a misunderstanding of what autism really is. I often get told ""Oh, but you're so social!"". I usually answer by explaining that social skills can be learned and that I've got sensory issues. </p>
