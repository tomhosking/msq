"What is this blob found at the edge of a puddle on a forest logging road?","<p>Exploring the woods of the Adirondack Mountains, this gelatinous blob was found near the edge of standing water on a logging road. The entire length of this thing is probably just under 10 inches and it seems to be about an inch thick (didn't measure). The road was used about a year ago, maybe more, and has existed for quite a while. The puddle doesn't really drain, so it's there most of spring and whenever there's a lot of rain.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWSJn.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWSJn.jpg"" alt=""woods gloop""></a></p>

<p>There's not much human activity around this spot. Upstream of it is more forest for many miles. Of course being a logging road and a place where a photo was taken, there is some human influence and potentially petrochemicals introduced.</p>

<p>What could this blob be? </p>

<p>My first guess is poop but that doesn't seem to be the case because from what I've seen with dog poop it gets liquefied and dispersed by rain and water, not turned into globs like this. Beyond that, I have a hard time making any concrete guesses. A mountainous jelly fish? Maybe some kind of bio-chemical reaction from a few different 'ingredients' in the puddle?</p>

"How can I help an injured crow fledgling with a hurt leg?","<p>I found this guy right under my window, huddled in a corner and bleeding a lot (for a crow) from his leg. You can see that the leg is sort of twisted backwards on these two pics, and you can see where he was bleeding.  </p>

<p>Me and my family held him down and sprayed antiseptic on his wound and most of his leg, which he didn't mind too much. Over the next two days, he managed to stop bleeding and seemingly recover, becoming much more active and lively. The thing is, he can't fly. But he was constantly hopping on things to try to get outside of the garden (though he didn't fear us, he just wanted to get back to his parents, presumably).  </p>

<p>The thing that I'm worried about is whether his family is going to accept him back if we send him out again. We sent him out already once, and a neighbour found him huddled in a corner just like the last time, so he brought him home (though the crows sounded angry at him as he was doing so).</p>

<p>My grandmother disregarded our plan and put him out again in the morning while we were asleep, and the cawing woke me up. What I really need to know quickly so I can make a proper decision (whether to try to bring him back into the garden, which is very much near the nest, or whether to let him take the chances out there) is whether his family is going to abandon him for not being able to fly and for having an injured leg. I am PRETTY SURE (I'm not absolutely 100% sure that it was him but I'm decently sure) I saw a crow feeding him directly with my binoculars. However, I also saw that another fledgling that looked similar was flying.</p>

<p>The question is, if he can't fly and if he has a limp in one leg, will he survive? Will his family teach him how to fly, or will they abandon him for not knowing how to fly yet? The area where we live has a lot of stray cats, so that's the big problem.</p>

<p>Thanks, I hope someone can help me figure out the best decision. The reason we wanted to keep him in the garden a bit more is to feed him and wait until he can learn to fly in a safe environment that cats are more unlikely to enter.</p>

"How to keep socks from wicking rain off pants into boots","<p>My wife and I have been very fortunate in our long distance hikes - we've never been rained on except for our last day on the way out. So, while we have rain jackets that we pack, we've never packed rain pants or anything like that. We do have waterproof (Gore-Tex) boots.  </p>

<p>Recently we were day hiking in the rain and our pants got so wet that our socks started wicking moisture out of the pants and into our boots. So we need a way to fix this.</p>

<p>It seems like gaiters or rain pants are the two fixes for this. Our pants are quick dry so I'm not as concerned about them getting wet.  Gaiters seem like something we could wear all day if the weather seems iffy (under our regular pants but over the boots and socks) while rain pants would be something we put on when the weather starts to get bad. Is one of these a superior choice? Are there other alternatives we should consider?</p>

"Can ocean/saltwater fishing gear be used for freshwater/lake fishing?","<p>This is one of those instances where I need answers that are written as if you were speaking to a 5 year old. I don't know a whole lot about fishing.</p>

<p>My uncle likes to go fishing on the long island sound mostly but it's getting to be too much of a drive at his age. The majority of fish I remember him catching were porgies and other fish of that size. We're not talking huge fish and his gear reflects that. Rods and spinning reels. Lures, weights, etc. </p>

<p>There are some local lakes, rivers, creeks that have trout stocked by the NJ Fish and Wildlife division, bass and other fish. These are much easier for him to get to but most of his fishing has been in the same area out on a boat. When I think about freshwater fishing I get a picture of someone in waders with a fly fishing rod which would be too much of a shift in gear.</p>

<p>Main fish is large mouth bass and trout from what I can gather.</p>

<p>Can his ocean fishing gear (rods, reels line mainly) be used for trout and bass fishing in lakes, streams and rivers? If so I'm guessing at least the hooks, lures and other stuff that gets tied to the end of the line would need to be different as well as bait. IF this can be done can you make suggestions for a versatile setup to get him started fishing in NJ lakes and streams without getting into fly fishing?</p>

"Why does North Cascades National Park get so few visitors?","<p>Last year I went to Washington state and I visited Mount Rainier National Park, Olympic National Park, and North Cascades National Park.  I enjoyed all three of them.</p>

<p>I just saw a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia page</a> and was looking at the number of annual visitors for all of the U.S. national parks.

<p>Why would North Cascades National Park receive so few visitors compared to Olympic and Mount Rainier?  They are all about 2 hours away from Seattle.  Not only that, but North Cascades National Park is free - it does not have an entrance fee, unlike Olympic and Mount Rainier, which makes it even more puzzling.</p>

<p>In fact, North Cascades National Park is the <em>only</em> national park in the contiguous United States that is not on an island to receive fewer than 150,000 visitors last year.  Why is that?</p>

"How many days does it take to reach hiking X miles per day?","<p>On a thru-hike or section hike, people frequently hike 15-30 miles per day. New hikers are typically encouraged to start at around 8 miles per day, though, and work their way up, to give their bodies time to adapt, and avoid injury.</p>

<p>Obviously the time required to reach 15+ MPD will vary by person, but that's not a very helpful answer for planning resupply points. I haven't been able to find any <em>estimates</em> of how many days it will take the <em>average</em> thru/section hiker to reach X miles per day, though.</p>

<p>I've seen plans for new runners, to start at X miles per day, and work their way up to Y miles per day. Would something similar make sense for backpacking? If so, what would be sensible values?</p>

<p>Here's my rough guess, to illustrate what I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>Day 1: 8 miles</li>
<li>Day 2: 8 miles</li>
<li>Day 3: 10 miles</li>
<li>Day 4: 10 miles</li>
<li>Day 5: 12 miles</li>
<li>Day 6: 12 miles</li>
<li>Day 7: Zero day to rest</li>
<li>Day 8: 14 miles</li>
<li>Day 9: 16 miles</li>
<li>Day 10: 16 miles</li>
<li>Day 11: 18 miles</li>
<li>Day 12: 20 miles</li>
<li>Day 13: 22 miles</li>
<li>Day 14: Zero day to rest</li>
<li>Day X: {previous day + 2 miles, with zeros once a week}</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, something like this is just an estimate for planning, and each person would need to adjust it to their specific fitness level, pack weight, trail conditions, etc; and then listen to their body while hiking to know their actual limits.</p>

"Why train at less than max intensity? Especially if not training often","<p>I've read a lot on the many running sites about training.  The consensus seems to be that you should have a mix of:</p>

<li>long slow runs</li>
<li>intervals, fartlek, hill reps etc</li>
</ul>

<p>What doesn't seem to be explained is why bother with all that time and distance at significantly slower than your goal race pace?  Why not just run the distance you're training for as fast as you can?</p>

<ul>
<li>It's cheap.</li>
<li>It provides more space than a boat.</li>
<li>I can easily take a bicycle.</li>
<li>It's more easily replaceable in case of theft than a boat (plus, who would want to steal a raft?).</li>
<li>There are no worries about selling it or transporting it after the journey has completed.</li>

My worry is that using a vehicle with little steering and no engine can lead to life-threatening situations with river freight ships, like <a href=""http://www.intuitivmedia.de/data/picture/detail/865.jpg"">this one</a>, and cruise ships. I imagine getting caught in their suction can be very dangerous.</p>

"Could I have a postmortem on this suburban raccoon encounter?","<p>I know this isn't Great Outdoors in the sense of planning a vast trek and seeing vistas, but I wanted to ask for a postmortem on an unwanted great outdoors encounter in the suburbs.</p>

<p>I was getting back after a photo shoot with a pirate motif, and among the items I had borrowed were some things from my brother, including a not purely ornamental sword, which he requested that I return to him that night instead of later on when I would unpack everything else.</p>

<p>I went out and heard a scurrying when I opened the trunk, and looked and saw two young, maybe adolescent, raccoons that had been rooting through a toppled trash can and were looking at me with what I would interpret as curiosity, but no evident fear. The distance was eight or so feet, and I tapped the ground a few times with sword to make noise that would scare them away. Again, no evident fear. Only looking at me.</p>

<p>I kept at least as much distance to them and made my way back into the house. They didn't approach me, and I'm rather glad there was no fight; I would not credit myself with sure victory if the fight was archaic weapon vs. rabies bite. But what really unnerved me is that nothing I did seemed to scare them. I made the usual noises of a person walking around, opening a trunk, and removing clanging metal items and tapping the ground with one of them.</p>

<p>I ""won"" this event; that is, I don't need a rabies shot. However, I'm somewhat concerned that I could be close to them and making noises (admittedly, not very loud noises like yelling), and maybe they were keeping their version of respectful distance by backing out of the trash cans and getting to a place they could escape from, and perhaps their looking at me was wondering if they would need to take flight, but I still found the experience a bit unnerving. We have squirrels, chipmunks, robins, sparrows, and other fauna, in addition to domestic cats that don't know me, and none of them will either let you get as close, or make noise, without fleeing for safety. </p>

<p>So what do I have to learn from this? The biggest lesson may be something I already did, keep my own respectful distance and end the encounter as quickly as possible. And I did not do something stupid like assume that a bit of pointed metal will infallibly shield me from a darting raccoon.</p>

<p>But I wanted to check in and ask for any guidance. Especially in a suburban environment. <strong>Are there animals that are simply not afraid of much bigger humans?</strong> Are there any rules besides the obvious about minimizing one's chances for needing a rabies shot? (Or for that matter an infection; a bite can carry danger of assorted infections.) Would I have been better as soon as I heard noises from the trash can to simply go inside and leave fetching my brother's property another day? In this specific case the raccoons backed out of the trash can into an area illuminated by a window; I wouldn't expect anywhere near the same visibility for most nighttime, meaning most raccoon, encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Would it have been appropriate (in Illinois, outside of Chicago) to call for animal control ?</strong></p>

<p>Again, any thoughts are welcome. I know this isn't a great trek into the wild outdoors, but the wild outdoors have a way of intruding into carefully planned suburban and urban areas.</p>

"Venomous/Semi-Venoumous Snakes at Higher Altitudes","<p>When we camp in rainforests or even country side forest, we are supposed to be very careful about Reptiles, especially Snakes. In India out of the many venomous snakes, I have found Pit Vipers to be very common.<br>
That is why I have always considered the possible threats while choosing a campsite.<br>
But at Higher altitudes, like the Himalayas I do not have any information regarding their habitats. If I google it, I may get the information that I need. But, as far as I know and what I have learnt about Vipers, is, they have an organ called Jacobson's Organ which makes them to sense the heat signatures.  </p>

<p>In regions around Mt. Everest (where I will be going), in Sagarmatha National Park, they have <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloydius_himalayanus"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> Himalayan Pit Viper. I have confirmed that from a friend who is a Herpetologist and has worked in that region but never have had a chance to study the Himalayan Pit Viper.</p>

<p>For my question, this himalayan pit viper is just an example in case of Himalays, there can be many other species than Pit Vipers. I chose to ask w.r.t this because it is commonly found there. In other parts of the world, I believe there are Venomous Snakes, for that matter this question can also be taken as part where it generally snows!</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> If it is true about Pit Vipers being able to trace the heat signatures, does camping in the areas where it snows unsafe? Because, when it snows, it's obviously cold, and so is our body temperature. Yet, will one such reptile be able to trace the heat signature?</p>

"Is Gaia GPS inaccurate for distances?","<p>In a previous question, I had asked for help in finding a GPS app with certain features. That led me to find Gaia GPS and it has been great, no complaints.</p>

<p>However, I had a situation recently. I found a hike through an online guidebook and it was listed as 3.1 miles. I went out and did a track on it (with Gaia) and it came up as being close to 5 miles. I wrote to the author of the guidebook, thinking that he might want an update. He checked through his notes and also asked for my tracks from Gaia and showed me how Gaia can be inaccurate and my actual track was a really squiggly line adding all kinds of crazy distance. He said he also used Gaia and would get the same weird results. I dont know what he used to create the actual distances in the guide. He stood by his statement of the hike being about 3.1 miles. </p>

<p>But I'm still uncomfortable with this conclusion. The hike just ""felt"" longer than 3.1 miles. Also, there's the factor of time. I'm not a fast hiker at all but the loop took me 3.5 hours to do. For a 5 miler, that puts me at 45 minutes/mile - totally reasonable - but a 3 miler would be 1 hour+ per mile - no one is <strong>that</strong> slow! Time is the only ""fixed"" factor in this and that would indicate that its more than 3.1 miles. </p>

<p>So is Gaia really that inaccurate? Or is there something else at work here?</p>

I'm pretty sure I didn't kill all the hares, so where did they go?? The area has a mix of spruce, pine, and alder and I was finding all my hares in, under, or around the alder. The vegetation hasn't changed but the ground cover has - less snow, more bare ground, and a developing swamp thanks to the snow melt.</p>

<p>How about getting from Saariselkä to the parking lot in Aittajarvi, is it 
accessible by a car in late-May?</p>

<p>Do you think the UKK hike is suitable at this time of the season (if not, does anyone have any other suggestion for a multi-day hike in the Finnish Lapland).</p>

<p>Finally, what about the weather and what should we expect? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Any additional info will be greatly appreciated!</p>

"Do backyard birds prefer birdbaths with moving water?","<p>It's spring here in the Northeastern United States, and we're getting a large influx of the wonderful birds who will spend the summer and fall with us. Although we feed and water birds, and any other hungry outdoor creatures, throughout the year, we increase their options during the busier months.</p>

<p>This is also the season when merchants heavily advertise many varieties of birdbaths. </p>

<p>I've read a number of articles saying that birdbaths with moving water are better. They suggest that moving water increases attendance, and keeps the birds, and birdbaths, healthier. For instance, <a href=""https://erie.wbu.com/content/show/8793"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Birds find water sources by sight and sound.  Adding movement to your birdbath creates visual and audio cues that birds will hone in on, allowing you to draw more birds to your bath.  Properly agitated water can also deter mosquitoes from visiting your bath, as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://www.thespruce.com/bird-bath-fountains-385544"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This site</a> also claims that adding motion to water attracts more birds. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Water is essential for birds and while a simple bird bath can provide refreshment, more elaborate arrangements like bird bath fountains have many benefits and can attract more birds to any birder's backyard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm seeing a lot of ads for birdbaths with features that keep the water moving. Some examples are <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Water+Wiggler&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1rrS0h-TTAhUo8IMKHXs1APYQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=636#newwindow=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=bird+bath+Water+Wiggler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">water wigglers</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=birdbath+misters&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ_N71h-TTAhVJ4IMKHfeIAZkQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=636#newwindow=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=bird+bath+misters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bird bath misters</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=birdbath+misters&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ_N71h-TTAhVJ4IMKHfeIAZkQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=636#newwindow=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=bird+bath+agitator&amp;imgrc=kaG0dqtIZU7q0M:"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">agitators</a>, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=birdbath+misters&amp;newwindow=1&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ_N71h-TTAhVJ4IMKHfeIAZkQ_AUICygC&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=636#newwindow=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=bird+bath+fountain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fountains</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is that most of the sites I found that recommend these devices also sell them. </p>

<p>I'm seeking evidence that birds prefer moving, rather than stagnant, water, from reliable sources that don't make money from their recommendations. It would be even better if they specify which type of water-moving method is preferred. </p>

<p>Anecdotal answers through your own experience are fine too, and would be helpful.</p>

<p>My birds are the American versions, and include swallows (many varieties), sparrows (many varieties), cardinals, blue jays, grackles, robins, crows, finches, thrushes, titmice, woodpeckers, red-winged blackbirds, grosbeaks, mourning doves, canaries, and others in related families. </p>

"Definition of tributaries above/below a landmark","<p>There are many places where a special regulation for a river or stream includes tributaries ""above"" or ""below"" a particular landmark. If the tributary more or less parallels the main river, does the entire tributary count based on where it enters the main river?</p>

<p>Here's an example: Let's say a special regulation says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main stem of XYX river and tributaries above Miller Bridge is
  closed to fishing all year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let's say that XYZ river runs due south. There is also a tributary that mostly parallels XYZ river, and empties into it 1 mile below Miller Bridge. Since the tributary empties into the XYZ river below the bridge, does that mean that the entire tributary is open to fishing? Or, can you only fish in the section of the tributary that is south of where it would be even with the bridge (even though the bridge is on the main river, not the tributary)? If the latter, how would you even know when you were past it?</p>

"Can overexertion cause AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness)?","<p>Recently I did a trek in the Himalayan region and one of the group members was affected by what we believed was AMS at around 4600m. 
We had to evacuate the person from there and get to around 4100m before she stabilized. </p>

<p>On review of the situation we found the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>She did not have any headache or nausea. She just fainted. Which pointed towards lack of oxygen supply to her brain (subsequently she fainted around 5-6 times while we were bringing her down). </li>
<li>The person concerned was on Diamox (should have helped her acclimatize, but I realize that this is not a guarantee). </li>
<li>She was well hydrated (she was drinking around 4L of water per day).</li>
<li>She did exert herself a bit more than required before AMS hit her (she was breathless as well, which is a symptom of AMS). There were no symptoms of headache or any nausea before that (or even after).</li>
<li>Her oxygen reading was around 85% and her HR was registered at 140+ around the time she fainted.</li>
<li>We had to administer Dexamethasone steroid to boost her lungs up and we saw an improvement in her condition in about 45min.</li>
</ul>

<p>So my question is, can overexertion lead to AMS? Would it act as a possible factor in increasing the chances of a person being affected by AMS? </p>

<p><em>PS:</em> I had a doubt if it was AMS in the first place, but since  there's a possibility of lack of oxygen causing her to faint, I'm assuming it was AMS. </p>

<p><em>Based on one of the answers given by @wills, I'm adding further clarifications:</em> </p>

<p>The person concerned did mention that she witnessed the 'darkness in front of eyes' before fainting, so I'm ruling out weakness as the reason. Also, this continued to happen some 5-6 times in the next 1 hour or so. </p>

The combination costs 74 Euro, while a 800 g mattress with an inbuilt pump from the same low cost supplier is available for 24 Euro. I would pay the difference if I get the weight reduction without loss of comfort in mattress setup and emptying. </p>

<p>I watched a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o5Oxnk0xgk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> showing a similar pumpsack system from a brand name supplier (that specific system starts at 1:09 in the video) and it seems like you still have to use your own lungs for it. I really dislike pumping up a whole mattress with lung power when I am exhausted from hiking. </p>

<p>Has somebody had experience with the second type of mattress, especially in comparison with the first type? How much effort does it take, is it comparable to lung-blowing or the blow he needs in the video just a small part of it? Are there other difficulties with the inbuilt-pump system which make it less attractive than the pump sack system? </p>

"Can you safely use retired ropes for belaying children?","<p>Climbing ropes are UIAA rated for so many falls of an 80kg weight. After that number of falls–or a specific period of time based on amount of use–you are supposed to retire the rope. </p>

<p>But what if the person you are belaying is only 15kg? </p>

<p>When ropes pass their recommended retirement age it doesn't exactly render them useless, but if you're using a rope to belay weights more than 80% less than what it's rated for, does that mean the rope will be good for a period of time 80% longer than recommended?</p>

<p>In my mind, a 15kg kid using a 9.8mm rope would be the equivalent of an 80kg man using a 22.6mm rope, which would last close to forever, but you probably wouldn't want to take any big falls with it.</p>

"What fall factor will cause me to hit the deck with a typical dynamic rope?","<p>Say I'm leading on a single-pitch climb, or the first pitch of a multi-pitch. The maximum fall factor I could theoretically have without hitting the deck is 1, but that's with a static rope, which of course I wouldn't use in this situation. This raises the question of what is the maximum fall factor I could have without contacting the ground at my belayer's feet. (If the rope stretches, then it's helping me by decelerating me at least somewhat, but I'd really prefer not to touch bottom at all.)</p>

<p>By UIAA standards, static rope stretch for an 80 kg climber is supposed to be no more than 10%. Dynamic rope stretch is going to be greater than this static value.</p>

<p>The UIAA standard fall is a fall factor of 1.77, and rope stretch for that fall is supposed to be no more than 40%. In the first-pitch scenario, you can't actually have a fall that puts this much stress on the rope, since you can't fall past the belayer, but we can be sure than the rope stretch in a first-pitch scenario will be no greater than this. (Again, this is for an 80 kg climber.)</p>

<p>What I can tell from this is that the rope stretch <em>a</em> is in the range 0.1&lt;<em>a</em>&lt;0.4, which is a pretty broad range. Therefore the fall factor <em>f</em> that just barely has me kissing sand is in the range 0.6&lt;<em>f</em>&lt;0.9. What is the actual critical value of the fall factor?</p>

I assume you can't use this to build a rappel anchor unless you intend to leave the rope behind...? I can't see, e.g., how you would bail off of a multipitch route this way.</p>

"When to kill and bleed a fish","<p>I am getting into fishing (I bought an entry-level spinner and plan on going to some nearby rivers/lakes) and have been reading a lot of conflicting information in regards to the sequence of events that transpire from the time you catch the fish, to the time you eat it.</p>

<p>Obviously, first you must catch the fish, which as a newbie will probably be a bit difficult for me. Once I catch my first fish and determine that it's of legal size and is a species I'd like to eat, then I need to immediately begin preparing it.</p>

<p>I've read that bleeding fish (cutting the gills) helps remove the gamey odor that a lot of fish have, as well as removing certain undesirable toxins.</p>

<p>But what do I do if I'm not done fishing yet? What if it's still early in the day and I want to keep fishing for a few more hours? Obviously then, I need a way of preserving the fish so that it doesn't taint before I even get home. The thing is, I don't like the idea of keeping a fish alive once I catch it. Not judging others, just personally would rather kill it as soon as I catch it and put it out of the stress/misery of being caught &amp; wounded.</p>

<p>So, given everything I've read, I'm wondering if my following solution is viable, and if not, why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Catch the fish, and kill it immediately (probably a knife through its brain is what I've found to be the quickest/humane method)</li>
<li>Bleed the fish, totally</li>
<li>Throw it in a cooler full of ice, and continue fishing</li>
<li>When I get home, clean/fillet it</li>
</ol>

<p>The only thing I'm worried about here is that perhaps the fish will somehow spoil from the time I throw it on ice, to the time I get home (which should never be longer than 6 - 8 hours). Ideas? </p>

"True fish attractants?","<p>Most ""fish attractants"" are actually just mechanisms to cover up human scent (as <a href=""http://fishing.about.com/od/bassfishing/a/Do-Fish-Attractants-Work.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> article here as well as <a href=""http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CFPage?catalogId=10051&amp;mode=article&amp;objectID=29876&amp;storeId=10151"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> one point out). They don't actually <em>attract</em> fish, but they mask any fish-negative smells that the bait have come into contact with (your hands, cigars, sun tan lotion, bug repellent, etc.). This doesn't entice the fish to bite the bait; it simply entices them to keep the bait in their mouth for longer <em>if</em> they decide to bite at all.</p>

<p>Well, ideally, I'd like to find some way of attracting the fish to the location where I'm fishing. I could then optionally decide to use a fish ""attracant"" to mask any smells I've inadvertently introduced. So I'm looking for an actual fish <strong>attractant</strong>.</p>

<p>I could take a jug of some sort and perforate its lid with lots of tiny holes. I would then put the actual fish attractant in the jug (obviously, the attracant would be different depending on the sort of fish I'm looking to catch). I could tether the jug to my boat or to land with a rope. I'd throw the jug as far as I could, and because the lid has holes in it, it would fill with water, sink, and begin leeching out the attractant.</p>

<p>Two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this feasible/possible? If not, why? If so, what are some tried &amp; proven methods/best practices here?; and</li>
<li>If it is possible, where could I find different ""recipes"" for different attractants based on the fish I'm looking to catch. I live in upstate NY (Adirondacks), so the major species are: bass, pike, trout and musky.</li>

"Is it really that unsafe to touch a stranger's wound?","<p>I am about to participate in a first aid training workshop. Before I do so, I am supposed to pass an online first aid course. While going through the course, I came across this section about applying pressure to wounds in order to stop critical bleeding:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is always necessary to find an appropriate compromise between
  safety and promptness.</p>
  
  <p>For instance, you would probably not hesitate to put your fingers
  into e.g. the wound of your partner without any protection; It
  would be a more than brave action in the case of a stranger. On
  the other hand, the casualty may bleed to death before you manage
  to get a pair of gloves or a bandage.</p>
  
  <p>If the casualty responds, you can ask him/her to press the
  bleeding wound, and you can enhance the pressure over his/her
  hand. Or you can use a piece of clothing, etc.</p>

<p>Is it really that dangerous? Why? What should I do if the ""casualty"" <em>does not</em> respond? How much and why is it risky to apply pressure myself?</p>

"Placing protection efficiently when leading trad?","<p>I'm a beginning trad leader, having done about five easy fifth class leads. I've had some formal instruction, but don't currently have access to a teacher or mentor. I'm finding that I'm extremely slow as a leader, even when the climbing is easy, and I'm wondering whether this is can be improved by doing something about the way I rack my gear or the the steps I go through with my free hand. I would like to get more efficient so I can be more solid on more difficult climbs, complete more climbs in a day, and maybe start getting ready to do some multipitch.</p>

<p>Let's say I'm going to place a cam in a vertical crack, and I have a solid stance that gives me one free hand. I have a bunch of alpine draws on my left gear loop, and cams on my right, each with a carabiner. Since the draw has two biners and the cam has one, that's a total of three, which is one more than I need. I would probably place the cam with my right hand, then reach over with the same hand to grab a draw to use as an extension in order to reduce rope drag. I clip the draw into the cam's loop of webbing, and then I may need to manipulate the biner on its free end in order to increase the length of the draw (awkward with one hand). Then I probably need to pull up some rope, and I may not be able to do this without letting go of the draw -- ugh, now the draw may have dropped down into the crack where it's hard to get at the biner. I take the rope in my teeth, reach into the crack and pull the biner back out, and clip in. Now I've got pro at this anchor. I still have the extra biner stuck in the cam's loop of webbing, so I take that off and put it on a gear loop.</p>

<p>What could I improve about my procedure? Are there youtube videos showing experienced climbers doing this sort of thing efficiently?</p>

<p>[EDIT] I spent some time on youtube, found these three videos that might be relevant: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnVJ2blHbLs"">A</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbCEGGSQ-aY"">B</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxOdRA5Hkkc"">C</a>.</p>

<p>In A, at 0:22, he uses a cam without any extension. He pulls it off his rack, bites it in his teeth, and then turns it around to place it. At 1:11 you can see that some cams are on a doubled short sling, not just on the little loop of webbing a camalot is normally sold with. It's not an alpine draw; there's only one biner. The slings look shorter than a normal 60 cm sling, maybe only 40 cm? At 1:52, he has a nut that already seems to be on a quickdraw. Was it racked this way, or did he clip the quickdraw on during the climb?</p>

<p>In B, at 0:25, he has his cam on its little loop of webbing, which he extends with a quickdraw. Seems pretty efficient. At 1:11, he places a cam, then there's a quick fade and he has a sling with a single biner on it, which he uses for extension. Was there another biner on that sling, which removed during the fade?</p>

<p>In C, he advocates a rack with 6 quickdraws and 2 alpine draws. I'd been using nothing but alpine draws. I had an instructor tell me that basically quickdraws were only for sport climbing, not trad, because (1) you need to have more extension available, and (2) the stiff quickdraw can twist your pieces out of their placements as you climb past them.</p>

"Walking up the slopes. To walk brisk or to walk slow?","<p>This question has been eating my head for quite some time now.</p>

<p>I trek often and most of the treks involve climbing up to a peak or something similar. I usually carry heavy loads of around 13-15kgs on my back and I've always found that walking up the slopes of a hill/mountain at a brisker pace is easier with the heavier loads. I climb fast, rest for a minute or two and start off briskly again. However, I have met trekkers who have told me that this is not a good practice and it's better to maintain a slow pace while going up the slopes. I did try this a few times but a slower pace tires me down faster while carrying heavier loads. </p>

<p>Hence, <strong>which is better while walking up the slopes</strong>? Slower pace or the brisk one? Or is it just a matter of choice and nothing more? <strong>(Better in terms of the ease of the climb and avoiding injuries over a period of years)</strong></p>

<p>I would appreciate both personal preferences as well as scientific answers for the question.</p>

<p>Note: I am not referring to high altitude climbs <em>i.e more than 3000m</em> (at higher altitudes, slow pace is the only one advisable due to acclimatization). Also, the slopes I refer to have gradients from 30 - 50 degrees.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that I'm not worried about maintaining the group structure of a trekking group or the time taken for slow vs fast walk. I'm concerned about the injuries one might incur and the ease of the climb.</strong></p>

"Are there any animal behaviors that can be used to predict weather conditions within a 24 hr time period?","<p>There are many folklore tales of animals being used to predict weather.  Just a few examples from the <a href=""https://www.almanac.com/content/can-animals-predict-weather-animal-proverbs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Old Farmers Almanac</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When cats sneeze, it is a sign of rain.</p></li>

feet deep, not so severe; if one foot deep, a mild winter.</p></li>
<li><p>Bats flying late in the evening indicates fair weather.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have not been able to find much evidence to back these tales that I have come across.  However, although not necessarily a prediction, the relationship of a cricket's chirp to temperature does seem to show how in tune animals can be with weather conditions.  In fact, this relationship is also known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolbear%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dolbear's law</a>, named after the American physicist Amos Dolbear, who published an article on the subject called <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/2453256?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Cricket as a Thermometer</a>. It is expressed as:</p>

<p>Tf=50+(N60-40/4) </p>

<p>where Tf is degrees in Fahrenheit 
and N60 is chirps per minute</p>

<p>It is generally believed that Dolbear observed the snowy tree cricket to come up with his equation.  The formula is believed to be accurate to within a degree or so for the field cricket.  Generally speaking, the relationship is believed to hold true because as temperature rises, the cold blooded cricket's metabolism will also rise, providing more energy for muscle contractions and thus for chirping.</p>

<p><strong>Are there observable behaviors to look for in animals that can be a harbinger of changing weather conditions?</strong>  For example, say you are on a 2-3 day hike with no way to access weather forecasts and somehow you forgot to check the forecast before leaving.     </p>

"How accurate is the 3.5 - 5 degree F temperature drop per 1000 feet rule of thumb?","<p>Related Q (especially its link to inversion): <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/18785/what-is-the-relationship-between-altitude-gain-and-temperature-decrease-when-mou"">What is the relationship between altitude gain and temperature decrease when mountaineering?</a></p>

<p>This question is concerning the commonly used rule of thumb that an increase in elevation of 1000 feet will, on average, decrease the temperature by 3.3 to 5 degrees F (3.3 for moist air, 5 for dry). Some sources differ slightly in the exact numbers, but 3.3 and 5 are what I have seen most often.</p>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>I have read that local conditions on a mountain can trump this rule of thumb. Trying to understand this better, I found some examples of temperature <em>increasing</em> going up. I am wondering if this is a common occurrence or a rare one.</p>

<p>How closely can we trust this rule of thumb? Said another way: <strong><em>How often</em> does reality deviate sufficiently from this rule of thumb to reduce its usefulness?</strong></p>

<h2>My specific example</h2>

<p>I camped on Cascade Mountain in the Adirondacks at about 1500 to 2000 feet (460 to 610 meters) higher elevation than nearby Lake Placid. The temperature at Lake Placid was 37 F (3 C). One of the forest preserve stewards told me the next morning that she expected the temperature on the mountain to be below freezing.</p>

<p>This is not a huge elevation difference and perhaps not a great sample, but I am hoping to use it to help understand the conditions I was in and better prepare for future.</p>

<p>The mountain was wet below the tree line, so I would go with the lower change estimate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Temp difference: 3.3 x 1.5 = 4.95 = approximately 5 F <em>and</em> 3.3 * 2 = 6.6 F, so...</p>
  
  <p>Estimated temp: 37 - 5 = <strong>32 F to</strong> 37 - 6.6 = <strong>30.4 F</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Estimate: 30 to 32 degrees F at my elevation. 27 to 29 F (about -1 to -3 C) if we use the 5 degrees per 1000 feet estimate.</p>

<p>Since it did not feel below freezing and I never noticed anything frozen or frosted, am I correct to assume that the rule of thumb was not accurate in our case and that it was not actually at or below freezing? <em>I still am not sure how often the inaccuracies/inversions actually happen and am wondering if I can assume that it was the case in my situation.</em></p>

<p>In other words: <strong>what is the likelihood that the rule of thumb is not accurate? Is the likelihood high enough that we should always take the estimate with a grain (or more) of salt, or is the likelihood low enough that I should trust the estimate more than my gut based on how I feel?</strong></p>

"How warm should a sleeping bag be to sleep in summer in the Alps comfortably?","<p>I am looking to buy an ultralight sleeping bag, that would be warm enough for sleeping in the Alps in summer comfortably. I would be sleeping in a tent on a sleeping mat. I would probably be staying at around 2000, max 2500 meters. And I would expect I could be out there in between June and September. According to my research on the Internet, the lowest temperatures at that time and altitude should be around 0°C, possibly a couple degrees below, but most likelly a bit above. How warm do I need the sleeping bag to be?</p>

<p>Actually, I believe my question can be subdivided in the following subquestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I safelly assume, that it will not get much below 0°C in summer in the Alps at around 2000 meters altitude?</li>
<li>How much warmer will it be inside a tent? (very small two-person tent, two layers, no heaters)</li>
<li>Sleeping bags have temperature ratings for three categories: comfort, limit and extreem. Should I look at the lowest value of ""comfort"" temperature if I want to be able to sleep without feeling cold?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>So I have bought a sleeping bag, and would like to update the question with my experience. </p>

<p>I have decided to go with the ultralight (and expensive) option in the end. My new sleeping bag is rated +4°C comfort, and -1°C limit. I have tested it on a few trips in the mountains during this summer. When sleeping on warm summer nights at altitudes around 1500m, it was actually too warm. No surprise there, and not a problem either. </p>

<p>Another trip I took was in the end of September, when the nights were fairly cold already. I am not sure about the exact temperature, but it must have been in between 0 and 5°C. I was sleeping at around 2400. I must admit, I was a bit worried, but the only time I was cold was while cooking dinner outside of the tent. The sleeping bag combined with a cotton sleeping bag liner was certainly enough.  </p>

I tried them, liked them, and have used them for hiking ever since. They are incredibly comfortable and provide a ton of ankle support.</p>

"How did/do scouts venture into the wild?","<p>Scouts, messengers, pioneers exploring the frontiers of civilization - images of these sorts of characters paints an ancient archetype, one that I think could be useful to understand in present times. There may even be similar characters today. I'm hard pressed to find good information about these types of characters who scout out terrain, more specifically: <strong>what did their equipment and habits look like in their adventures?</strong></p>

<p>To clarify my search: I'm trying to figure out the general pattern of equipment and habits (ways of life) among the characters I listed above. Who are those characters specifically: could be American frontier explorers (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Beckwourth"">James Beckwourth</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Glass"">Hugh Glass</a>) or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_man"">mountain men</a>, a per-Columbian Mesoamerican scout, perhaps even <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier#Before_the_industrial_era"">a messenger</a> of civilizations past (I am especially interested in those traveling in uncharted terrain, so the messenger archetype may be less relevant given the use of roads, maps, and potentially backup and support en route). Military examples which focus on more than just an individual or small group aren't relevant to this question in that they apply much less to civilian interactions with the Great Outdoors.</p>

<p>I realize this varies by place &amp; time, and that this may be better fit for history. To clear that up: I am interested in overall patterns, so specifics of a certain time/place are helpful but specifics from multiple times/places and comparisons thereof are even better. Since I am trying to <em>extrapolate this to the present</em>, to learn lessons about how I can prepare for and interact with the Great Outdoors today and in the future, I see this as relevant to TGO.SE. A comparison of past examples of gear/practices to modern equivalents is very welcome. There may be modern examples that could help answer my question too (e.g. if we look into the lives of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swagman"">relatively modern vagabonds</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpacking_%28wilderness%29"">wilderness backpackers</a>).</p>

<p>In case this is too broad, as if a book could be written about it: answers of books or resources already written about this are much help! So far, a lot of looking yields only small tidbits of info here and there, so I could use a well-marked trail to clarity by someone who has tried to answer this before.</p>

"Whippet as trekking pole?","<p>I was wondering if whippet could be used as a trekking pole? Question arises from hiking on steep hills (no snow, dry grass), where any additional grip would be really helpful. I've read that most people offer to use ice axes in this kind of situation, but I was thinking, if I already use trekking poles, wouldn't I be able to accomplish two things (stability while walking and self-arrest/assist) if I'd substitute trekking poles for a whippet? </p>

"Hunting bears with a knife?","<p><em>Michael Strogoff</em> by Jules Verne (1876) describes how Siberian hunters used to hunt bears with nothing but a knife. This was ideally done with a single lethal blow, to damage the fur as little as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Michael Strogoff] was between the bear and the girl. His arm made one movement upwards, and the enormous beast, ripped up by that terrible knife, fell to the ground as a lifeless mass. He had executed in splendid style the famous blow of the Siberian hunters, who endeavor not to damage the precious fur of the bear, which fetches a high price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/2/From-Surviving-the-Streets-of-Russia-to-MMA-The-Story-of-Aleksander-Emelianenko-Part-2-13709"" rel=""noreferrer"">A modern source from 2008</a> describes that the bear can be first trapped with a wooden pole, and stabbed afterwards. That could indicate that the Verne passage is an over-simplification of the actual technique.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On whether people really hunt bears with knives:</p>
  
  <p>Emelianenko: Yes, they do. A few years ago there was an unfortunate incident. One sportsman, a world champion in wrestling ... what was he doing? Yes, he was putting a fork under the bear’s neck. [The practice of hunting bears with a knife involves, once the bear is in front of you, placing a long stick with a letter U-shaped end under the bear’s muzzle as it rears up to fight. Once the stick is in place, the bear isn’t able to bring its body down and the hunter stabs it a number of times, ideally killing it instantly.]</p>
  
  <p>And then the bear couldn’t attack him, and he was stabbing it under the ribs in the heart. And as he was stabbing it, that bear swung with its paw. It was dead already -- the paw was its last gasp with all its strength and basically took half of the wrestler’s head off. And of course the other hunters opened fire on the bear, but it was too late. He went to try his luck with a bear, and it didn’t come off.</p>
  
  <p>For me everything is still fine. I’m OK. I’ve done it and it was OK. About half a year ago, it was in Russia, in Siberia. Everything was fine. I put the fork underneath him and stabbed him in the heart. And that was it. The other hunters dismembered, prepared the bear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly are bears hunted with knives? I am specifically looking for the technique used by Siberian hunters in the past, but other examples could also be applicable.</p>

<p>Do these techniques still have practical usage nowadays? I would assume that bullets damage the fur more than a single knife wound.</p>

"The bow's length and its influence","<p>I'm looking for buying a new recurve bow for field archery.
I currently shoot a Hoyt dorado and I love it. I have two sets of limbs for it. One #35 set that I use for field and another #50 that I use for hunting. I love shooting it specially because of its length (60"" tip to tip) but I'm also aware the bow is too short for my draw length of 29.5 inches.</p>

<p>I know that bow length needs to match the draw length mostly because you lose precision when overdrawing it as soon as the string stops touching the limbs and just hold on the tips, string can swing sideways and affect arrow travel. (Unless you're natural for the sport. :) ). Similar thing happens to long bowers as the string doesn't actually rest on the limbs and instead it just held on the tips.</p>

<p>So, I've been thinking of buying a new bow, target type to use for field and I also know the minimum length would be something around 68"" (longer than that, the bow would become more forgiving).</p>

<p>Is there anything in my understand that is actually wrong?
Also, what else could be affected with a shorter bow?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"If I get a ticket for fishing without license, will buying a licence make my ticket go away?","<p>I live in Oklahoma where a relative and I were fishing. </p>

"What sort of crane, and what sort of snake?","<p>In an area near where I work in Monterey, I often walk during the noon hour and end up in a meadow that is much-beloved to red-winged blackbirds.</p>

<p>The other day I saw something unusual, though - as I walked into the meadow, I noticed a large bird - some sort of crane, I reckon - with a large black snake half-swallowed. When it (the bird) noticed me, it flew off several dozen yards, and then landed again at the far end of the meadow, standing there again, with the snake dangling. The snake must have been already dead, because it wasn't flopping around. I walked toward it/them to get a better look. The bird then lifted its head skyward, gulped down the snake, and flew off.</p>

<p>I didn't know cranes or crane-like birds ate snakes, and I'd never seen a big black (or dark brown) snake around here before. Is this normal behavior? What type of bird was it, probably? What type of snake was it, probably?</p>

"How to avoid cracking your windshield while strapping down a kayak","<p>I have an 18 ft. fiberglass sea-kayak, which I mount to the roof-rack of my junky old station wagon with Yakima ""Sweetroll"" saddles - ratchet straps around the saddles and bow and stern to the bumpers. Unfortunately, while on a recent trip I suddenly noticed a 3-inch crack materialize in my windshield, which rapidly grew to an 18-inch crack. </p>

<p>I didn't see any impact that started the fracture and no part of the mount or the straps actually rests on the windshield - so I'm concerned it was the tension of the bow and stern guy-lines flexing the roof and putting too much pressure on the glass. The windshield is fixed, but I'm a little gun-shy about putting it up there again. Is there a better way to distribute the pressure on the roof? Should I just not ratchet the bow guy line down as hard? (I generally ratchet it down pretty tight to keep the strap from vibrating madly)</p>

"Memory foam mattress topper for camping?","<p>I bought a queen-sized four-inch memory topper and cut it into two halves to get two twin(ish)-sized toppers.  I use one half on my bed at home, but that left me with another extra half.  I've heard people talk about using memory foam toppers for camping, and so I've taken this topper out into the outdoors (car camping only) on several occasions as well.</p>

<p><strong>Cool weather</strong></p>

<p>The problem is, I've had mixed results.  In cooler weather, the memory foam gets cold and hard and is only comfortable once you wait for the foam to warm up directly underneath you.  If you move in your sleep, this can be disturbing, as you have to wait for the foam underneath you to warm up for it to be comfortable. This isn't a huge deal, but it's not as comfortable as the same topper at room-temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Warm weather</strong></p>

<p>In warmer weather, the memory foam loses its ""memory"" and just ends up being super squishy foam. I believe it retained heat (in the summer, not cooler weather!) more than I would have liked.  Again, not as comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>Has anyone else tried this?  Is your experience different from mine? What am I doing wrong?</strong></p>

"Do squirrels have front and full peripheral vision?","<p>Our suburban yard in Massachusetts has a small woodsy area. We use a section for feeders for birds, chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, and the occasional bear or fox. </p>

<p>In an area of our patio, at least 20 feet from the closest feeder and that group of large trees, we put food down and stay within a few inches of, and sometimes directly on, the pile. Certain chipmunks, who we recognize by their markings, know where and when to wait for that food, and happily eat at our feet and even on our shoes. </p>

<p>This year, for the first time, a few squirrels have been daring enough to come  close and eat. I'm surprised because they're usually quite skittish as they get nearer to the house.  </p>

<p>In the first two pictures, I'm standing just behind the leaf at the bottom right corner, and the little squirrel, possibly a young <a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/42587/0"" rel=""noreferrer"">Red Squirrel, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</a>, is not more than a foot away. He stood in that sideways position for a few minutes, then turned to face me. He then came closer, right under my feet, to find whatever whole seeds had been left by the chipmunks, and ate for a while. (I didn't take a picture then for fear of scaring him away.)</p>

<p>In the other two pictures, I'm in pretty much the same place, although it's hard to tell. I believe that squirrel is an <a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/42462/0"" rel=""noreferrer"">Eastern Grey, Sciurus carolinensis</a>, which is common here in America, Canada, and also in a <a href=""http://www.nottinghamshirewildlife.org/animal-facts/grey-squirrel"" rel=""noreferrer"">variety of countries in the UK</a>. He starts by looking tentatively towards me, then moves to where that food is and puts his head down to eat. I don't know if he chose that pile of food because it was the nearest to him, but I assume so. </p>

<p>I'm wondering what they're seeing in each of their body positions. Can they see me, or the chipmunk, only with both eyes facing me, or do they only need one? Can the grey squirrel with his head down eat and watch me at the same time? Can these positions also allow them to see what's happening around or above them? </p>

<p>I'm also curious if it's seeing the cat, but there's glass in between them, so there might be glare or other factors. The cat's always pouncing against that window and the squirrels and chipmunks never run away, so either they don't see her or they feel safe knowing they're protected by the window. I admit I really just added the cat picture because it's cute! </p>

<p>This is not meant to be a highly scientific question. I'm just curious because I spend so much time watching and interacting with my backyard animals, and their behavior fascinates me! </p>

"Why do so many people hike with such light footwear?","<p>More and more, I see people hiking with very light-weight shoes.  To me, they look like regular sport shoes and they look to be lacking thick soles, waterproofness, or ankle support.  I thought this was a US phenomenon, but I saw that in two UK outdoor stores I visited, most shoes sold are such.  For example, a recent trip to Southern Utah, I partly hiked on popular trails in Zion National Park, such as the trail to Scout Lookout/Angels Landing and the trail to Observation Point.  Both trails include serious slopes where classical hiking boots (see picture below) would appear essential to me, yet I saw hundreds of people who hiked in lightweight shoes that looked unsuitable to me.  I observed the same in Bryce Canyon National Park, where a park newspaper lists improper footwear in a top-10 of injury causes as cause #3, #2 and #1. I did not notice this phenomenon on more remote trails or in other countries such as Norway, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, where outdoor stores sell hiking boots rather than city shoes.</p>

<p>Why do so many people hike in serious mountains with light-weight footwear?  Is it an active choice?  I've tried sport shoesonce or twice for a short distance, and it was painful — I can't understand that someone would hike anything that isn't flat tarmac in such shoes.  They wouldn't keep my feet dry beyond the first stream crossing, either.</p>

<p>By a proper hiking boot, I mean something like this:</p>

<p>The footwear I saw people using in serious terrain in the USA looked similar, but <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/11618/566"">this answer to my related question</a> points out those are trail shoes.</p>

<p>The concept of <em>trail shoes</em> is new to me, and I have not seen people hiking in those prior to my recent US trip, or I mistook them for sport shoes.  How can I tell apart a <em>trail shoe</em> from a regular light sport shoe?  Searching Google for <em>trail shoes</em> links either to running shoes or to shoes no different from the ones above.  Presumably, they are different from the ones above, that I wouldn't want to wear even for a 2-hour hike in the English countryside, let alone for a mountain trail (I tried exactly once and I've rarely had such painful feet, so either my shoes are different, or I am different).  Do people get <em>trail shoes</em> from <a href=""http://www.wildbackpacker.com/backpacking-gear/articles/the-cottage-industry/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cottage industry</a> manufacturers or are they sold in regular stores (just hard to distinguish from sport shoes)?</p>

"What are the advantages and disadvantages of a paracord knife handle?","<p>Whenever I browse knife shops or online stores I see many fixed-blade knives whose handles are essentially just a piece of paracord wrapped around the tang. From my anecdotal experience this also seems to be a fairly popular choice - I'd guess that easily 25% of fixed bladed knives in local shops/stores have such a handle (I live in Switzerland).</p>

<p>Personally I always disliked these kind of handles: if I spend some 100-300+ $ for a good knife I'd like to get a quality product, and for me this includes the handle. Why would I want a handle consisting of just a piece of string?</p>

<ul>
<li>A nice wooden or synthetic/carbon/etc. handle provides way better grip in my opinion, also it can't soak up water, and it's just over all a lot sturdier.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why are paracord handles so popular? What is the idea behind it?</strong></p>

<p>I get that you could unravel the paracord in an emergency, but let's be honest: a couple of foot length of paracord are not gonna decide over whether you live or die. And would it really be worth making your knife awkward and uncomfortable to handle just to get a piece of string?</p>

"What water is fit for cleaning hands & gear during a visit to the Great Outdoors?","<p>I am looking to setup dish and hand washing stations for a group of folks in a fairly-wild woodland, in a car-camping summertime setting, for 2-5 days (depending on the occasion). <strong>Is stream water fit for cleaning hands, dishes, waste bins/buckets?</strong> Water used for cooking or drinking will be well-boiled or from a known-potable source.</p>

<p>I'm hoping the answer to the overarching question will satisfy these sub-questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can stream water be used for washing dishes, cups, and hands, or does it need to first be filtered/purified? </li>
<li>What if that stream water is used in combination with biodegradable plant-based camp soap?</li>

"How do membrane-based boots breathe?","<p>Yesterday I was shopping for breathable waterproof boots* and this is what the salesperson explained to me. The shoe material does NOT matter. The damp air from the foot goes through the membrane (Gore-Tex) to an intermediate ""pocket"" between the membrane and the outside shell of the shoe. Once the shoe is removed, the dampness begins flowing back through the membrane and into the air, thus drying the shoe.</p>

<p>Is this correct? Do shoes not breathe through the outer layer at all?</p>

"When is it OK to hike off trail?","<p>I visited my local forest preserve recently (in a suburb of Chicago, IL) and found new signs every mile or so that read something to the effect of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please stay on the trail so as to preserve the natural environment
  beyond the trail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part of the joy for me in visiting a piece of nature is to go <strong>off</strong> the trail from time to time, so I found this new notice a bid disheartening. This particular forest preserve is about 4 miles long and 0.25 miles wide with a small river/stream running through it, and has lots of deer within its boundaries. My initial guess about this new rule is that perhaps because of the small size of the preserve and the amount of people frequenting it, they needed to create this additional restriction to minimize the wear on the surrounding land/habitat.</p>

<p>After doing Google search on ""off trail hiking"" I found at least one national park that says it's OK to do this on their property: <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/dino/planyourvisit/off-trail-hiking.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Off Trail Hiking</a>.  So, I now know that ""hiking exclusively on the trail"" is not a universal rule in the US.</p>

<p><strong>My original question:</strong> How common is this rule of staying strictly on the trail for forest preserves vs. a state/federal forest park?</p>

"Avoiding leaks from stove and fuel bottles?","<p>I used to use a liquid hydrocarbon-fuel stove for backpacking, but I hated it, one of the main reasons being that the stove and/or fuel bottle were always leaking and stinking up my car and pack. Mainly for that reason, I switched to using an alcohol stove for summer backpacking, and I'm very happy with it.</p>

<p>However, the alcohol stove is less than optimal for mountaineering in snow, since it takes a long time to melt snow, and may be difficult to start in very cold conditions. For that reason I've bought a newer, lighter hydrocarbon-fueled stove (MSR XGK).</p>

"How to attach signs to trees considering tree growth?","<p>I am trying to determine the best way to attach trail signs to trees in the woods.</p>

<p>The problem with trees is that they grow.  If you firmly embed a nail in the wood, the tree will eventually grow around the nail head.  When we put up small plastic trail markers (what we use a blazes), we deliberately leave a &frac12; inch or so gap between the nail head and the marker.  Put another way, we don't bang the nail in all the way.  This gives the marker room to slide along the nail, instead of the growing tree pushing all around behind the nail head, and eventually buckling and cracking the plastic marker.</p>

<p>I am now going to put up some aluminum signs that will last much longer than the plastic trail markers.  A tree could grow multiple inches over the expected life of the sign.  What I'd like is a way to mount the sign so that it stays on the outside, moving with the growth of the tree instead of getting swallowed up by it.</p>

<p>It seems that just the right diameter and length of nail might do it.  You want the sign to be held, but the nail be able so slide out as the tree grows and pushes against the sign.  What diameter and depth might that be? What studies are there that have looked into this? What experience do you have with this?</p>

<li>Have any accidents been attributed to this belay technique? (Or a similar technique -- holding the brake hand above the device does not count as similar though.)</li>

They are quite sturdy and apparently they are parasitic and can cause damage to living trees. They live a long time! I took a few and left the others for some other lucky passerby. Quite tricky to get off the tree though... seemingly if you cut free the trama layer, which is sort of like cork or suede, on the outer of the tubes, then let it soak in a mixture of water and ash, before boiling for an hour or so, then gently beating the material to loosen the fibers, you end up with a material that is great for taking a spark from flint/steel or ferro rod, and can smoulder for quite a long time, so you could use it to carry fire with you if you didn't have modern conveniences. Quite a cool fungus! </p>

I don't care for changing rooms, safety buoys, or supervision (but I'd appreciate not to have to wade through 3-metre high stinging nettles to reach a lakeshore).  If I identify a pond, lake, canal, or river, how would I tell whether swimming is permitted there?  Is it permitted unless explicitly prohibited, or is it by default not allowed?</p>

<p>I know some hummingbirds go into a state called <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/04/09/hummingbirds-and-torpor/"" rel=""noreferrer"">torpor</a>. Their metabolism slows down and they lower their body temperature to conserve energy.

<li>Where does it live?</li>
<li>When does it hibernate and for how long?</li>
<li>What type of areas does it hibernate in, such as den, tunnel, under trees? </li>

"Why are birds so nervous around humans?","<p>I bet the first thing that came to your mind, was...</p>

"What is the most severe temperature that a proper snow cave can protect you from?","<p>This question was prompted by my answer to <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/19785/under-what-conditions-does-heating-a-backpacking-tent-artificially-make-objectiv"" title=""when does heating a tent make sense"">Under what conditions does heating a backpacking tent artificially make objective sense?</a>. In my answer, I mention the possibility of hiking across Antarctica during the winter to experience the harshest cold that our planet has to offer.</p>

<p>You are on this Antarctic winter hiking trip, and you are chasing the cold. You know that the record cold is approximately -135F (-95C), and you are expecting you probably will encounter close to that, and you need to prepare for the possibility of a new record being set so you want to be safe down to a few degrees below that in case of emergency.</p>

<p>To assist in keeping safe, you build a snow cave. Though emergency snow caves are often not done correctly, let us assume that you did construct one correctly on this trip (ie: top of door below inner floor to trap heat, properly placed ventilation, doorway plugged up, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Normally, I hear people say that a good snow cave can keep the inner temperature at a pleasant freezing (32F, 0C) temperature even if the air outdoors is crazy cold. Would this still hold true at -140 degrees? At what point is it just so freaking cold that even a snow cave cannot be kept warm?</strong></p>

<p>The amount of snow that is insulating you does obviously matter. Let's say you dig into a small embankment, so part of it is more than a few feet thick. For the front of it where you dug into the bank and had to then patch up the front of your cave, I would personally assume a few inches at most, as I have read about safety concerns of cave-ins when people craft thick walls. If you are not concerned about such a cave in danger, then feel free to assume thicker if that is truly what you would do.</p>

<p>Assume that there is a modest wind. Enough that heat does not linger well around objects, but not enough to worry about the integrity of the snow cave.</p>

<p>So, <strong>what is the minimum temperature at which a properly constructed snow cave can no longer be expected to maintain a constant 32F/0C temperature without artificial heating?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Filter the water right away, when filling the bottle. This way I'm sure the water inside the bottle is safe for drinking. </li>
<li>Or fill the bottle with (possibly contaminated) water and filter it before drinking. This allows me to have my filter last a bit longer (as some water from my bottle could be used for purposes that don't require a clean water...) </li>
<li>Or, maybe, have a bottle with the filter in the drinking cap (or drinking straw), so if I want the clean water - I can sip it from there and if I need ""just"" water, I can pour it from the bottle directly (note: I got no idea if there are any good bottles with good filters/drinking straws like that). </li>

<p>My question is: <strong>short of drilling</strong>, how do locals decide the ice on their lakes is safe for winter sports?  I don't remember the criteria my father used, except on the larger lake the ice had to extend very close to the spill-way, which was in essence an artificial outlet stream.  (We stayed away from that area.)  If it was safe on the larger lake, it would be safe on the smaller lake.       </p>

<p>Where I live (Northern VA), the only safe assumption is that the ice is never safe.   </p>

But I have not found any tutorials that address the concept in any kind of comprehensive way. For this technique to be useful in an emergency situation or improvisational challenge, its critical to understand the fundamentals well enough to assess the starting materials you actually have on hand. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the fundamental necessary ingredients are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a source of electricity</li>
<li>a flexible, conductive material to connect a circuit</li>
<li>kindling</li>
</ul>

<p>But it seems to me that there is a tremendous amount of variety in those ingredients. Its not clear to me how to compare different conductive materials for the circuit.

Choosing a battery (or other electrical source) seems to be a matter of balancing risk against likelihood of success. If I was using a AA battery, I would not be particularly worried about shocking myself but would wonder if there was enough electrical power to actually ignite something; with a car battery those concerns would be reversed. But I have no idea what the danger of being shocked by something intermediate, like a D battery or a laptop battery, would be. </p>

"Gunfire in US national parks","<p>What are the consequences of firing a gun in a US national park due to distress? (for instance, shooting at an attacking animal, or firing in the air to attract attention when stranded)</p>

<p>There is a notorious controversy regarding the use of firearms for self defense, but let's set that aside and consider the following situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hiker in a national park got stranded, became scared for his life and fired in the air to attract attention.</li>
<li>Hiker was attacked by an animal, feared for his life, shot at the animal, missed and the animal ran away.</li>
<li>Same as 2 except the animal was hit, injured, and ran away.</li>
<li>Same as 2 except the animal was killed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's also set aside the complicated legal situation with regards to firearms in the US, and assume the hiker in question was carrying his weapon in a manner fully compliant with the applicable law.</p>

<p>Since gunfire is loud and considered suspicious, I imagine all 4 of these scenarios would attract attention from park rangers, rescue personnel, and possibly other emergency services. I imagine they would start searching for the source immediately, and probably arrive near where the shot was fired in a matter of hours at most.</p>

<p>Suppose also the hiker makes no attempt to flee or hide from anyone who does arrive. When someone arrives on the scene, and the situation is explained (ie. fired a gun because believed to have no other option), what happens next?</p>

<p>Would the hiker get a long lecture from the rangers and a fine? Would they get arrested? Would this be considered an irresponsible/unwarranted discharge of a firearm? Would shooting the animal be treated as poaching (even though clearly the intent was not to hunt)?</p>

"What equipment is needed for glacier hiking?","<p>What is the exact equipment I need for walking safely on glaciers? The route I will be taking is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hvannadalshnukur"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hvannadalshnukur</a> ascend from the ring road and same path descend. From what I could find out the path is not challenging gradient is constant and small, and the crevasses are either non-existent or more like small holes. The roping is just precaution. We all have mountaineering experience, but no previous glacier experience.</p>

<p>From what I gathered from this <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7020/how-to-walk-as-a-roped-party-on-a-glacier"">answer</a> and this <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3701/best-type-of-rope-for-glacier-travel?rq=1"">one</a>. I also read the safety research short rope PDF by Gottlieb Braun-Elwert, although I guess we will be long roping.</p>

<p>I need:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At least 10m distance between members (3 going total)</p></li>
<li><p>Thickness of the rope depends on how many times I expect to fall which is likely no more than 1</p></li>
<li><p>Straight hilt pick axe used for walking rather than vertical climbing</p></li>

"Lowering a climber from above using a belay device in autolocking mode","<p>I recently gave a belay from above to a group of five people who were all doing the same single-pitch climb and then being lowered off. (In this case the reason for belaying from above was that the climb was too long for top-roping from the ground with a single rope.) I was using an ATC Guide in guide mode, directly off of an anchor. Afterward, I went back and researched different methods for doing the lowering. Any comments on the following methods, or suggestions of other methods?</p>

<p><em>Method 1</em></p>

<p>Don't even lower people in guide mode. Reserve that for emergencies. When the climber gets to the top of the climb, have them clip in, then switch the belay device to normal mode and lower them off. This requires redirecting the brake strand like this: <a href=""http://www.climbing.com/skill/lower-away/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.climbing.com/skill/lower-away/</a> . (If I'm understanding correctly, the redirect is necessary because otherwise you would need to pull <em>up</em> on the brake strand to brake. That's both physically more difficult and contrary to your muscle memory.) You can attach a backup prusik to your belay loop.</p>

<p><em>Method 2</em></p>

<p>BD's instructional video <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM5c9wlTReo"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM5c9wlTReo</a> shows the technique at 2:37. They show the belayer using her hand to pull down on the release cord, which has been redirected through the anchor. I found this technique to be extremely fatiguing due to the large amount of force required from my hand. They also show a Munter tied to the harness used as a backup.</p>

<p><em>Method 3</em></p>

<p>This instructional video <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3zOisWbuB8"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3zOisWbuB8</a> shows yet another technique. There's some discussion here: <a href=""http://www.mountainproject.com/v/anyone-have-problems-lowering-a-second-with-atc-guide-or-reverso-in-guide-mode-/106715350#a_106718389"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.mountainproject.com/v/anyone-have-problems-lowering-a-second-with-atc-guide-or-reverso-in-guide-mode-/106715350#a_106718389</a> . He ties the release cord to his harness, so that his hands are free and he can apply the force to the release cord by using his body weight. He then has both hands free, and can use them to tend a Prusik backup.</p>

<p>What do people think? I haven't tried method 3. It seems nice, but I'm worried that in the event that the belayer slips and inadvertently puts his body weight on the release cord, the only thing saving the climber's life is the Prusik.</p>

<p>In the BD video, they show a Munter rather than an autoblocking knot such as a Prusik, which seemed odd to me. After some dialog in comments with Shem Seger, I'm going to write up my attempt to analyze this issue in an answer.</p>

"Is there a safe way to light and tend a small fire on earthy/peaty ground?","<p>When on slightly peaty ground, (i.e loamy forest rather than very peaty heath) is there any possible safe way to light and tend a small fire?

"Train yourself to need less water","<p>I'm interested in doing multi-day hikes (i.e. backpacking) in the desert where water sources are not readily available, thus requiring one to carry in enough water for the duration of the trip.</p>

<p>On  any given day I feel the need to drink <strong>a lot</strong> of water, much more than most people that I know.  About a gallon in a typical relatively inactive (working at a desk) day.  If I don't drink this much water, I start to feel thirsty.  To do a multiday trip I will be drinking considerably more water (at least 1.5 gal/day?) which will become burdensome: this would mean 36 pounds of drinking water for a 3 day trip.</p>

<p>Like I said, I definitely begin to feel thirsty and dehydrated (dizzy) if I lower my current water intake much at all.  Is it possible to train oneself to require less water per day (by slowly weaning down the amount)?  Or, alternatively, is it possible to adjust one's chemical levels (e.g. electrolytes) to retain water longer in such a way that you do not need to take in quite as much water?</p>

"Climbing barefoot/in toe-shoes?","<p>I recently went bouldering for the first time and liked it a lot. One thing I wondered about are the climbing shoes. The mostly form your feet to a very firm, compact package. So the following question came up in my mind:</p>

<p>Why don´t climbers embrace the power of their toes? Why can´t I find anybody climbing barefoot or in (toe-)socks or shoes like Vibrams fivefingers?<br>
Would it be worth a try or can I be sure it doesn´t work as well as climbing shoes?</p>

<p>_  </p>

<p>Of course, you would need to train your feet to get the strength you need. But considering the amount of training climbers put into their hands and fingers for things like ""one-finger-holes"" I think this is probably no good reason for not trying it with your feet...</p>

<p>I am primarily interested in indoor bouldering, but aspects for other types of climbing are welcome as well. I am aware that most gyms probably don´t want you to climb barefoot for hygienic reasons... </p>

"Why do different kinds of bug bites itch in different ways?","<p>I have gotten bit by 3 different bugs that have all given me itchy bites but they are oh so different.</p>

<p>The most recent one is a tick bite, today is the first time I ever remember having a tick bite. I could not feel the tick at all until I felt my neck with my hand. It didn't suck much if any blood(how do I know? It looked deflated and alive after I grabbed it and pulled it off). It immediately started itching after I pulled the tick off but that itch is resolving. There is no swelling at the moment.</p>

<p>Mosquito bites are also from a blood sucking bug but this is way different. I actually once endured a full mosquito bite while awake at night. I can tell you from that experience, a mosquito bite is painless at first and then as it continues to suck blood it becomes painful, almost as though it injected venom. After the mosquito flies off nothing happens for several hours. But then it becomes irresistibly itchy(so I rub instead of scratch it) and is like that for a few hours at a time, several times a day.</p>

<p>Spider bites are even more different. Whether I am awake or asleep, the spider biting me is unnoticeable. Then a few hours later it is just like a mosquito bite but worse(again irresistibly itchy for a few hours at a time, several times a day but the itch is much worse.</p>

"Are longer kayaks faster than shorter ones?","<p>I've been researching which kayak I'd like to buy, and I keep coming across the notion that longer kayaks are faster than shorter ones. I can understand that shorter kayaks have a greater tendency to alter course with each stroke, thus affecting your overall forward velocity, but if you correct for this in your calculations, it seems to me that a longer kayak would have more overall surface area than a shorter one, and would thus be slowed.</p>

<p>It is perhaps the case that this slowing of the longer kayak is not as pronounced as the loss of forward velocity experienced by the shorter kayak. Is there something else physically going on that affects the kayak's performance in the water that I'm not thinking of?</p>

"Can you put a tow truck stinger on a motorhome (RV)?","<p><strong>Some terms may not be global, inline descriptions for questionable terms</strong></p>

<p>A motorhome is RV with an engine (<em>as opposed to a camp trailer that is pulled by another vehicle</em>).  Many people will tow a small car behind it to use for running around when the RV is parked at a campsite.  </p>

<p>Currently there are 3 basic approaches to towing the car</p>

<ol>
<li>4 tires on the ground, with a towbar connecting the car to the RV</li>
<li>A tow dolly, a small trailer like device that the front tires of the car sit on</li>
<li>A full size car trailer that the entire car rides on.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first two it is not possible/recommended to backup with the car attached. You can backup with the full car trailer, but at the camp ground it is big extra thing to put someplace. </p>

<p>A 'wheel lift' or 'stinger' is a device on a tow truck that picks a car up by the tires.  There are several manufacturers in the US that makes ones that ""hide"" under the back of a pickup, cost start around $4,000 for a brand new stinger. A car being towed on stinger, can be backed up just like a trailer.  </p>

<p>By putting a hidden stinger on the back of a motorhome, you could backup without disconnecting the towed car AND not have anything extra to put someplace at the campground. </p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong> A stinger on the back of a Motorhome seems like a wonderful solution to many of the hassles of towing a car.  Why can't I find any examples (lots of googling) of it being done? If it is not possible/practical why? </p>

<li><p>Class A - This is purpose built on a heavy truck chassis. The exterior may resemble a bus, or camp trailer, the drivers area is an intricate part of the ""home"".  The truck chassis is not near any load limits.  </p></li>
<li><p>Class B - A complete van, as you would purchase from a local dealer to haul stuff, has an RV built inside it.  The exterior will look like a delivery van, possibly with special paint, custom windows, and possibly a raised roof.  The Drivers area easily access the camper area.  As built it may or may not be near load limits of the vehicle. </p></li>
<li><p>Class C - A marriage of the other two classes, A normal van is ordered from the Manufacture (i.e. Ford) but without a complete van body.  The body stops just behind the driver's seat. The RV builder builds a camper on the bare frame back of the van. The exterior will look like someone grafted a camp trailer on to a van.  Access between the drivers area and the camper may be difficult. As built it will most likely be very near the chassis load limit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of the above Classes, the <strong>Class C</strong> would not be a good candidate for a stinger, it would be near it load limit, while not impossible. it would be improbable. The <strong>Class B</strong> would be a good candidate for the stinger, but owners of them use them as both a camper and for casual running around, they would not have a interest in towing a car.  <strong>Class A</strong> these are the most expensive, and the largest, they are very capable of towing heavy loads, and can easily support the extra weight of the stinger and car. The Class A is the most likely to have car towed behind it.</p>

"Reclaiming water lost from breathing","<h2>What can we do to bring water loss <em>from breathing</em> down to the <em>absolute minimum</em> possible?</h2>

<p>Techniques or devices useful to adventurers with no frequent water access is what I am looking for, such as hiking or biking across a desert for longer than is reasonable to carry or find sufficient water.</p>

<p>Water does not necessarily need to be reclaimed by drinking. Any answer for which water that would be otherwise lost due to breathing but is in your body keeping you healthy instead is a good answer.</p>

<p><strong>See also</strong>: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/264/is-drinking-urine-safe"">""Is drinking urine safe?""</a> (Short answer: No) Urine is another one of the biggest sources of bodily water loss, and you can distill it back into pure water with a small amount of resources and a sufficient heat source.</p>

<p><strong>Food for thought</strong>: I recall that in the story ""Dune"" the people on that desert planet had access to wearable water reclamation equipment which reclaimed almost all of their water, not only from breathing but other sources as well. Dune is science-fiction, but it does make me wonder if such technology is actually available in reality; is there any easily portable equipment that can reclaim a significant portion of breath water in the same way?</p>

<hr>

<p>This question is inspired from reading <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/19836/12799"">this answer</a> to a question about water rationing and death from dehydration. From that question, and reading up on the topic elsewhere, it appears a reasonable portion of water lost per day can be due to water vapor lost in your breath. This can even be a significant portion of water loss in some environments, such as cold dry air.</p>

"Usability difference between 0.1 micron 0.2 micron filter bottles?","<p>We have been using older water filter bottles with charcoal filters. These are easy to drink from a combination of squeeze the bottle and suck will quickly fill your mouth with a swallow of water.</p>

<p>We are planning to upgrade to sub-micron pore filter bottles.  After much research it seems like the two midrange dominate products are the Sawyer (0.1 micron) &amp; Lifestraw (0.2 micron), both have a product that incorporates their filter into their purpose build bottle.</p>

<p>Depending on who you ask and what you believe they both have either vastly different or nearly the same, life expectancy and filtering ability. Leaving that aside and just focusing on getting the water from the bottle, through the filter and into your mouth; are there significant differences? </p>

<p>The difference between 0.1 microns and 0.2 microns is double (or half) what impact does it have on being able to get the water through?  </p>

<p>P.S. In most cases we have pre-filtered the water with a Camco 20 micron filter, into the fresh water tank of the camper.  Or we are using tap water from our local municipality.   </p>

"Why do almost all backpacking packs have top compartment (""brain compartment"") zippers facing backwards?","<p>According to <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/18939/12972"">this answer</a> to ""what gear should go in the brain (top most compartment)"",</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the brain compartment usually ends up becoming the knick-knack / catch-all pocket, for small items items that get frequently used</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I noticed that the zipper of the ""brain"" compartment almost always faces backwards, towards the wearer and the straps, rather than forwards towards the other zippers and pockets on the front of the pack.</p>

<p>Typically when I take my pack off, I set it down or against a tree, with the straps facing away. This allows me to open the pack and grab something out of the main compartment, and it makes it easy for me to access whatever water bottles or other equipment I've clipped to the outside of the pack.</p>

<p>But with everything else facing up, the brain compartment zipper is facing down. All of the ""small items items that get frequently used"" will fall out if I open the brain compartment zipper while the pack is in this position. So I end up having to turn it upside down to get things out of the brain compartment. The pack is usually heavy enough to make this rather inconvenient.</p>

<p>For a long time I've been wondering about the purpose of this design. What am I missing? Are people able to get stuff out of the brain compartment by reaching backwards while wearing the pack? I know that as for me, my arms are not nearly flexible enough to do this.</p>

<p>I asked the owner of the local military surplus store and he said that the reason for this design is so that the brain compartment zipper doesn't come open when the wearer of the pack is crawling through underbrush. I'm having trouble believing that most backpackers spend enough time crawling through underbrush to make this an important design consideration. Does anyone here have a more believable explanation?</p>

"Walking through a Thigh-high snow","<p>I have far less experience in trekking where there is snow. I believe walking through snow and through ice are two different techniques.  </p>

<p>I have heard past experiences from people that, fixing rope lines there isn't of much help either, as they found their ropes buried under snow. And, that sounds logical to me, because there is a major factor, wind, which blows snow everywhere.</p>

<p>It was early evening and I was walking our dogs near <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/FbkP6jnUJ6w"" rel=""nofollow"">Pendinas reservoir</a> in north Wales, UK. I saw a couple of buzzards (common buzzards, <em>Buteo buteo</em>) hovering on the horizon above some trees. I was watching the buzzards when I noticed a third larger bird. Wing span easily half the width of the buzzards again, so roughly 1 1/2 times larger than the buzzards. </p>

<p>I observed all three birds for some time through binoculars. They were quite some distance away though, so I couldn't quite get a really clear view. </p>

<p>At first I thought it was simply another (larger) buzzard but its wings seemed different; rather then the splayed finger wing tips of the other two birds, its wings seemed much longer and distinctly more pointed and downwards pointing at the tips.</p>

<p>It roosted in a tree on the other side of the lake. It was very distinctively a Raptor (which ruled out my other thought of some kind of sea bird). Again, I viewed it through my binoculars. It appeared dark brown and had a distinctive white patch on its chest. Again, quite some distance so hard to get a really clear view.</p>

<p>I went home and checked my bird book. The only bird I could find that matched the description of the size and the distinctive wing pattern was an Osprey. There are half a dozen nesting pairs further up the coast from me but they are not common by any stretch.</p>

<p>Based on my description do you think I could I have confused this bird with another? Or does the Osprey seem the most likely?</p>

"Bald eagle vs. vultures?","<p>I witnessed a bizarre scene on the James River in Richmond, VA, USA (1000 yards west of Mayo Bridge if you want to examine Google Maps). It was on a large rock in the middle of the river, where nearly 2 dozen vultures had congregated. There were so many I couldn't tell if they were atop some carcas, but I couldn't see one from 75 yards away. </p>

<p>Now here's the weird part. There was a large bald eagle that seemed to be vying for the rock. Eagle would swoop in onto the rock, look around like ""Oh, s*** this is more vultures than I thought!"". The vultures (at least those closest to the Eagle) would beat their wings and eventually the eagle would change position or retreat to prepare for another dive bomb. Eventually, the eagle flew away.</p>

<p>Some important details:</p>

<ul>
<li>There was a treeline about 300 yards from the rock, and there <em>may</em> have been a nest there. Not likely, but possible. Assuming this was a mother w/ chicks, maybe a chick tried flying and ended up dying on a nearby rock?</li>
<li>A lady walking passed said that vultures were ""all over the place"" this time of year on the river. Not sure how credible of a claim this was.</li>
<li>No recent flooding, and the shad (fish) are still running in this area.</li>
<li>The vultures didn't seem ""busy""; they looked like they were just hanging out waiting for something to happen.</li>

"Basic setup for trout fishing","<p>I am a whitewater kayaker and my GF, who does not kayak, sometimes accompanies me on river trips. She loves the outdoors and is never bored when I am boating (besides driving my vehicle from the putin to the takeout, AKA ""shuttle bunny"") but she has mentioned that she wouldn't mind to do some trout fishing.</p>

<p>While the water level needs for kayakers (higher flows) are different than for fishermen (lower flows), some of the rivers I paddle are dam released, IOW, the basic flow is low and then the dam releases, injecting a necessary flow for kayaking for a few hours, then it is low again.  So it could work out that she could fish on the same river where I am boating or find another stream with (stocked) trout nearby.</p>

<p>My question is, what is the basic setup for trout fishing with a spinning rod (which would be more basic than fly fishing)?  What size of rod is optimal.  Our rivers/creeks are mostly smaller (e.g. 30-100 ft across, 300-1400 CFS) with some rapids and some swimming/fishing holes in between and lots of trees around (which makes fly fishing less practical).  What kind of bait and test lines?  Other equipment?</p>

"Kayakers throwing their paddles when running waterfalls","<p>I was watching a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwpWl9WnO0Y"" rel=""noreferrer"">YouTube video</a> featuring clips from award winning kayaking films.</p>

<p>One thing I immediately noticed was multiple instances of kayakers running waterfalls who seem to be intentionally throwing their paddle away during the drop (you can see what I'm talking about pretty clearly at about 2:20). This seems to be contrary to what I always learned that your paddle is your life. I understand that for the initial landing not having your paddle in your hand might reduce the chance for injury, but it seems like the almost complete lack of maneuverability due to no longer having a paddle should make holding onto the paddle worthwhile. Not the to mention the expense of losing paddles if they run away or the time involved in trying to find your paddle.</p>

<p>Are these people just dropping the waterfalls and immediately bailing out of their kayaks at the bottom when the camera stops so they don't care about maneuverability? Do they just count on friends out of frame that have an extra paddle to give them at the bottom? Or is the risk of injury just so great above a certain height that the paddle has to go?</p>

"Does fordable by 4WD imply fordable on foot?","<p>I am investigating the feasibility of a hike looping around Hofsjökull.  Among the foreseen challenges are 17 crossings of named rivers (and many smaller ones).  All rivers I need to cross have 4WD roads fording through downstream from where I will be hiking, sometimes quite far downstream after the confluence of several more rivers.  From a driver's perspective, I have seen the recommendation, “if you wouldn't ford it on foot, don't ford it by car”.  Logically, it should follow that if a 4WD road does ford a river, it should be fordable on foot (weather permitting).  Is this accurate?  Can I infer from the observation that a 4WD road has an unbridged river crossing downstream that it may be fordable on foot upstream?</p>

<p>Just to be clear, the above photograph contains the entire legend of the map.

<p>A lovely delicate-looking creature flew in and landed gently on the top of a broken twig of marsh grass, only a few inches from where we were standing. It had a narrow, stick-like orange and white body; a red head with large black eyes (which for some reason came out white in the photograph); four lacy orange/red wings edged in white; and very thin long gray legs.  We stayed very still and it remained resting there for at least five minutes. Then another landed nearby and ""ours"" flew towards it, and they took off together. </p>

<p>From past experience, I assumed it was a dragonfly. However, for the first time, I recently heard of something called a damselfly. I thought that meant a female dragonfly, mostly because a damsel is a female. (According to Oxford and other dictionaries, a damsel is technically ""a young unmarried woman"" but that has no bearing on this question!) However, I've been told by a friend that, although they're in the same family, they're two different entities with similar, but unique, characteristics and behavior.</p>

"No Stop Limit for Recreational Scuba Diving","<p>No decompression diving (No stop diving) refers to ""diving that you can always ascend directly to the surface without stopping, yet without significant risk of decompression sickness"" (according to PADI Open Water Manual). A traditional way to plan a dive is to use a dive table (e.g., see the picture below). For example, if I have a 20-minute dive at 20 meters, then I'm in Pressure Group G, meaning that there's is G amount of nitrogen in my body, thus limiting the duration of my next dive.</p>

<p>However, my question is that, for example, if I want to do a 40-meter dive with air, why is my no decompression limit capped at 9 minutes? I would only have G amount of nitrogen in my body. However, if I dive at 20 meters for 45 minutes, I could have U amount of nitrogen! The amount of nitrogen in my body determines the No Decompression Limit, is that right? If so, why can't I dive til I have G amount of nitrogen in my body at 40 meters? Thanks everyone.</p>

"Self-diagnosis of hypothermia onset","<p>Does anyone have experience with self-assessment of early stages of hypothermia, in the context of the other subjective experiences that may come with solo wilderness adventures?  In my experience, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep deprivation, endorphins, adrenaline, feelings of elation/euphoria in the presence of wild nature can obscure the described symptoms, and thus cloud the decision to rally to reach the planned stopping point, or make camp immediately and warm up.  </p>

<p>Are there distinct telltale signs that occur before impaired judgment becomes a significant factor? </p>

"Is clipping onto the rungs of a via ferrata bad practice?","<p>I did my first via ferrata this weekend and noticed there were often long vertical distances separating the cable anchors. At times this length was around 10m. This meant that a fall before reaching the cable anchor, if both cables were clipped onto the cable, would mean you'd plummet 10m + the length of the lanyard into the rocks below. This would result in severe injury or death. </p>

<p>All the advice I have read seems to say that both carabiners must be attached to the cable at all times, but surely, if it's safer to do so, why not clip one of the carabiners onto the metal rungs of the route and have the other clipped onto the cable? This seems like common sense to me but I'm surprised it isn't mentioned anywhere. Is this practice frowned upon? Or is there something I'm not understanding? </p>

"Emergency use hydration products - effectivness vs cost","<p>My medical kit already has some MRE style clean water bags, purification tablets, as well as OTC anti-diarrheal pills at the ready. However, now, I am researching what options there are for hydration in a life-threatening scenario (severe dehydration, possibly including prolonged diarrhea or vomiting). I want to include such a product in my medical kit in case I or someone I encounter while hiking has life-threatening dehydration. While I must concede that much of the bio-chemistry is way over my head, I would still like to think I have compiled a reasonably well-informed list of products. I tried to find not only the hi-tech premium products but also products more on the thrifty-side. Here are the products I researched in order of most expensive per unit gram:</p>

<p><strong>Ceralyte</strong></p>

<li>Market: medicine, military</li>
<li>Price: 100g for $23.00 (10x 10g sticks)</li>
<li>Price per unit gram: $0.23</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DripDrop</strong></p>

<li>Market: military, firefighters and athletes</li>
<li>Price: 84g for $9.99 (4x 21g sticks)</li>
<li>Price per unit gram: $0.12</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pedialyte Powder</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Site: <a href=""https://pedialyte.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://pedialyte.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>Market: pediatrics, health enthusiasts?</p></li>
<li><p>Price: 272g for $27.00 (24x 8.5g sticks)</p></li>
<li><p>Price per unit gram: $0.10</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gatorade Powder</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Site: <a href=""https://www.gatorade.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.gatorade.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>Market: athletes</p></li>
<li><p>Price: 588g for $15.00 (12x 49g sticks)</p></li>
<li><p>Price per unit gram: $0.03</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pedialyte and Gatorade are not marketed as emergency hydration products; Pedialyte has a disclaimer on their website that their hydration powder is only suitable for mild to moderate diarrhea. That being said, the low-end products are quite a bit cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>

<p>Perhaps this is just a classic case of ""you get what you pay for,"" but I'm wondering if it's considered over-kill to buy military/pharmaceutical grade hydration powders for a hiking kit (72 hour bag). I'd like to hear from anyone with experience using any of these products. Are the high-end products like Ceralyte and DripDrop really heads and shoulders above cheaper products like Pedialyte Powder and Gatorade Powder? Better enough to warrant the price premium as shown above?</p>

<li>How should you behave when you meet them?</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>PMR446 radios use frequencies that in the U.S. and Canada are allocated to amateur radio operators. PMR446 radios can only be used in North America by licensed amateur radio operators. The conflicting allocations have been something of a nuisance to North American amateur operators due to use of the equipment by European tourists in the U.S. and Canada.[citation needed]</p>
  
  <p>Instead, the U.S. and Canada uses the FRS system, which provides a similar service on slightly different frequencies. FRS frequencies are allocated to the emergency services in Europe, notably the fire brigade in the UK, police in Russia.[2] Interference with licenced radio services may result in prosecution.</p>

Every time I go, it's different, depending on the wave action from the previous night, but there are usually at least a couple of good ""rock fields"" as I call them through which to sift for sightly souvenirs.</p>

<p>On some occasions there are several sand dollars, but usually none; one some occasions, there are several beaches dead animals (birds, seals) but usually none; sometimes quite a bit of ""sea glass"" but usually very little if any. Oftentimes there are a lot of pieces of ""holey"" rocks (light in weight, either light or dark grey rocks with perforations in them, but their relative abundance differs from visit to visit.</p>

<p>I believe Monterey Bay is quite deep and that the dropoff is pretty dramatic - does this have anything to do with the generosity of the Pacific in this particular spot? It seems that the opposite would take place - since the material to be deposited comes from quite a depth (assumedly) it would take a lot to belch it forth. </p>

<p>Does the variability of material depend on which spot, or which depth of the ocean floor is being scoured with a particular storm / series of waves?</p>

<p>Note: after an unusually heavy amount of erosion of sand (when the sea ""takes more than it gives"" such as Saturday night, which I noticed Sunday morning) there are also more ""treasure hunters"" (cats with geiger counters) out on the beach. What are they seeking - lost rings and such, which are closer to the surface after the waves strip away some of the topsand?</p>

"Are the birds that snatch bread out of the air ""more citified"" (tamer) than those who let it drop?","<p>I often take a slice of bread to the beach when I go on my beachcombing ramblings, and throw pieces of it to the shore birds that are, like me, combing the beach but, unlike my search for ""jewels"" are on the scavenge for grub.</p>

<p>For the most part, these avians are seagulls of one stripe or another. However, I notice a striking difference in their behavior: some will hover overhead and snatch the pieces of bread out of the air as I chuck them skyward, but most of them look at the bread to see where it's going to fall and then swoop down and sweep it up; or they just land on the beach in front of me and wait for a treat to come their way (I broadcast the morsels pretty equally, trying to give each bird a piece).</p>

<p>Are the air-grabbers hungrier than the more sedate ones? Or are they just more accustomed to humans heaving them their dinner and are thus ""old wings"" at plucking the tidbits out of the stratosphere before one of their mates gets an opportunity to intercept their meal?</p>

"Does freezing cut bait affect its attractiveness to fish?","<p>Some background:  I go fishing 3-4 times a week at a local river for catfish, carp, perch, bass, and sunfish.  My favorite bait for catfish (and the one that I find most consistent) is fresh cut perch/sunfish.  I will usually jig a small nightcrawler in the shallows to catch a perch/sunfish and then chop it up and use the fresh cut pieces to catch larger flathead and channel catfish.  This technique has which consistently produced bites and fish (regardless of where I'm at).  Recently, the perch bite has been super hot so I will end up catching three or four perch and only end up using maybe one and a half during that fishing session.  I have been taking the remaining bait home and freezing it and then bringing it out the next day.  The problem I have been finding is that the frozen cut bait gets <strong>significantly</strong> less bites than the fresh cut bait, somedays the frozen bait will literally get no bites in a 2-3 hour period.</p>

<p>My question is: does freezing cut bait really make it less attractive to fish?  The bait shops that I go to all sell their cut bait frozen so I figured that was standard practice.  But given the last month or so, I am really questioning if frozen cut bait is even worth using.  I guess additionally, I was wondering if anyone knows if there are any ways to make frozen cut bait more attractive to fish?</p>

"Am I packing too much for a 2-3 day hike in the forests?","<p>I have decided that I would like to hike.</p>

<p>I have read a bit on hiking, and bought some gear and a backpack to get started. I want to start with backpacking through mostly flat forests, and later advance to mountains in Poland, like Bieszczady, and Tatry.</p>

<p>The problem is, when I put on my backpack and put on the hip and chest belts, it felt heavy and cumbersome, making me lean forward. I was wondering — am I so out of shape, or did I pack so much unnecessary things?</p>

<p>My backpack weighs about 10.5 kilograms (or about 23 pounds) without the food and water with all the equipment I would like to take on a two to three day hike. Is this too much? For a two-day hike, I would like to add at least 3.5 liters of water, and around 1 kilogram of food, bringing the total weight to about 15 kilograms (or about 33 pounds). For a three-day hike, my backpack weighs about 16 to 18 kilograms (or about 32 to 40 pounds).</p>

<p>Here's what's inside my backpack currently:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A sleeping bag</p></li>
<li><p>A tent for two people</p></li>
<li><p>A foam camping mat</p></li>

<p>What would be the pros and cons of one versus the other? Is a Prusik any less likely to hold if the rope has snow or ice on it?

<ul>
<li>Should the device be switched on?</li>
<li>Should the GPS on the device be switched on?</li>
<li>What can I do to prolong battery life?</li>

<li>If I know they are looking for me, would they pick up the signal, if I switch it on for short periods every now and again?</li>

<p><sup>The smaller flare cartridges below are classic red signal flares, the larger cartridges are the bear bangers, which have a delayed explosive charge that makes a <em>really</em> loud bang.</sup></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UxiHd.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I'm familiar with bear bangers that you fire from a shotgun, but those are different, they're actually a large rubber wad that you shoot the bear with, so the bang is the impact the shot makes when it hits the bear. These pen launcher bear bangers get shot in the air, so the bang is the noise from the explosion. </p>

<p>Aside from being a lot smaller and lighter (and cheaper), these seem to me like they could potentially be a lot more effective than bear spray, especially considering you could choose to aim the banger <em>at</em> the bear in desperate situations, and it would be effective from a greater range, and could be deployed against more than one bear at a time. </p>

<li><p>We will probably want to carry sandwiches / snacky food for lunch, and have a big evening meal. How easy will it be to acquire sandwiches and snacks in the smaller villages near / along the route?</p></li>

<p>There are very few deer in this neighborhood, but I know dogs and other animals, like the fox that's been wandering through every once in a while, leave ticks here for our enjoyment! </p>

<p>It only recently occurred to me that birds might be affected. We can clean up most of the obvious places where the ticks hide in our yard, but that doesn't mean the birds are safe. Obviously we can't clean up the woods or water sources inhabited by the wild birds. </p>

<p>I don't recall hearing that birds are affected by ticks, but I've never studied it either. Do ticks like birds, whether in the yard or in the wild? If so, do they bite them as they do with humans, or do they hang on and use the birds as carriers? </p>

"What is this brown bird with a white area over its eye, found on the top of a pine tree in Ohio?","<p><strong>Any ideas what bird is making this song?</strong>  Unfortunately, this photo was the best I got, but I did get a lot of audio of it's call (the YouTube video has a bunch of them clipped together).</p>

<p>At the end of the video, you can see one of the birds (same kind as the one singing) fly away.  In case it's flight gives any hints.</p>

<p><strong>It sounds like it has at least two (maybe three) distinct calls.</strong> The one call, you can hear over and over, and was the majority of it's calls.  But it also had one where it had <a href=""https://youtu.be/Jtn7M1y1Pwc?t=22s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">7 or 8 super-quick chirps followed by a high-low, high-low (specific spot in video linked here)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rough Sketch</strong>
Update: I saw it today through binoculars, but still couldn't get close enough / for long enough. I did see that it had some spots or lines on it's stomach (similar to a young bird, but it appears to be an adult).  It was lighter brown than I was led to believe from the videos when it was silhouetted last night. It had a dark marking from its eye like a racoon, and white over its eye.  It is roughly 50% to 70% smaller than the robins we have around here, which are probably American Robins, as described on <a href=""http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/species-and-habitats/species-guide-index/birds/american-robin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a> from the Ohio Division of Wildlife. It appeared to be the size of a chickadee but with a longer tail. Larger than a gold finch. </p>

<p>The only times I've seen this bird, it was on the very top of a pine tree (like in the video). I've not seen it on the ground at all. There was a bird here last year that I never saw that was making a very unique sound. Not sure if it was this kind or not, as I wasn't able to find it and don't remember the song.</p>

<p>Today's look was quick, and I tried to remember as best I could, but again, it was from a distance, so the rough sketch below might not be super accurate.  The first time I saw it today, I thought it may have had some orange tint on its stomach, but didn't see it the second time.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>After much googling, <strong>it looks very similar to a female rose breasted grosbeak (if not exactly alike).  I can't find a song that matches though, so I can't verify if that's what it is.</strong></p>

"How to craft container for cooking and filtering/purifying water","<p>If a scenario in which you go in the forest or next to one, how are you supposed to craft a containers?</p>

<p>All the web-ressources I can find for filtering water thanks to the multi-layer rocks (from fine sand to charcoal/rocks) will need a container. Either something metallic, a can, or a simple bottle cut in half. But you don't find that far away from human presence. <em>Well, you might with all the debris left by our specie, but for the sake of the question let's assume you are somewhere you can't find it</em>.</p>

"Do doves go through a molting time of shedding and replacing their feathers?","<p>We live in Massachusetts, Northeastern United States. It's late July, and our temperatures this month have ranged between 70°F (21°C) and 90°F (32°C). </p>

<p>Mourning doves, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_dove"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zenaida macroura</a>, live here annually for many months. Lately some look a bit disheveled. They have fewer feathers, and some of their feathers are smaller, thinner, and more fluffy, especially on the back ends of their wings and body. They seem healthy, and we haven't seen physical damage either close-up or with binoculars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, we found a large amount of feathers matching the sizes and colors of those of the dove. They were dispersed throughout a small evergreen bush and on the ground. We assumed a bird had been caught by an animal. My husband searched the area for a body or bones, but didn't find anything. </p>

<p>A friend told me that the birds in this family molt, shedding feathers and replacing some of the older feathers with new ones. I've never heard of this, but it could make sense, according to that evidence. Is it true that doves go through a molting period? If so, what triggers it? Do both male and females do it? </p>

<p>Our mourning doves live in the United States and Mexico. They're part of a large family of doves called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Columbidae</a>, found in many countries.

"Roping together on an icy path?","<p>I'm planning a mountain hiking trip and one of the issues is that the trails that we're following will almost certainly be covered in ice.

The trails follow ridge lines and moderate slopes on relatively low altitude mountains (5,945' or 1,812 m). However there is the possibility that a slip on the ice will lead to sliding right off the edge of a cliff or steep drop.</p>

"What are the benefits of Vibram FiveFingers?","<p>Looking at the <a href=""http://us.vibram.com/shop/fivefingers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Vibram FiveFingers</a> shoes, I find myself wondering <strong>why?</strong></p>

<h2>What possible benefits do they bring as opposed to a traditional sole?</h2>

<p>Their web site seems to suggest that they are a more <code>natural way to use your feet</code> and then suggests a series of exercises to do to become used to the shoes. I'm not convinced buying a very expense pair of shoes that I can't wear until I complete a rigourous training regime is a good idea. I've not once looked at my boots and thought <em>I wish I could feel all the rocks under my feet</em>.</p>

<p>In all their marketing material (that I can see) they make no substantial claims as to what the tangible benefits are.</p>

<p>I'm tempted to suggest that they are simply a marketing gimmick, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Does anyone love these? Can they explain why and what benefits they bring?</p>

<hr>

<p>As a side note to this question I was speaking to a friend of mine at the weekend who's a manager of a national UK outdoor chain store (by far the largest chain in the UK). Apparently this company has decided they are a gimmick and that their days are over, apparently sales have been dropping for some time. As such they will no longer be stocking FiveFingers in any form. </p>

<p>Thought is was an interesting perspective as it seems to point to a decline in these types of shoes. If you really like these you may want to think about stocking up!</p>

"Where can I get long but light bottoms for water?","<p>I need clothing for kayaking in the summer. I already have the ""heavyweight"" equipment - thick neoprene longjohn and a whitewater cag. But for places where I need less protection from cold and injuries, I'd like something more breathable and less restrictive. </p>

<p>I looked into products marketed at kayakers and other water sport activities and ended up buying a kite surfers' rash guard for the top. I am quite happy with it, as it does not have the same hothouse effect as neoprene does. But the kitesurfers wear boardshorts as bottoms. They would have been OK for me, if they were available in long, but they end up well over my knee. </p>

<p>I would like some comfortable ankle-length layer which gives a small amount of warmth and can protect me from scraping my skin if I have to swim out, preferably also UV-protecting for the time I hang around before and after I get into the boat. And as all my watersports stuff, I'd like it to be quick-dry and machine washable. </p>

<p>The few striders sold by kayak stores are too short and/or made from neoprene. They're also quite expensive when compared to bottoms produced for other purposes. </p>

<p>Is there a type of clothing which covers the above criteria, the way rash guards cover them for tops? I was thinking of slightly denser pantyhose, but there are probably better solutions (is pantyhose quick drying?). Are there sports whose practitioner wears this type of clothing? </p>

"What refilling material or glue did you chose to resole your trekking shoes? (What works, what doesn't)","<p>Theses shoes are still good (picture have been removed), but the small missing part of the heel makes them painful to wear. I'm looking for the most efficient way to extend my shoes life (robust, cheapest, aesthetics and ecological). I'm looking for feed backs about what you tried: what work, and what doesn't.</p>

<p>The sole could be <em>theoretically</em> fixed in several ways:</p>

<p>● by adding the missing matter on the sole with a form-work
That would be the easiest solution : filling the missing part with some rubber like matter that would solidify. And maybe a bunch of small screws that would be cover by the matter and increase the adhesion between the filling and the remaining part of the sole. That would be super, but since I haven't seen anything about it on the web, it's probably because it doesn't work... Did you try it?</p>

<p>● by cutting few centimeter of the heel and gluing a new heel sole:
I'm tempted to use a piece of tire, that seems to work and that looks great. Did you try, which kind of glue did you use, which did last, which didn't? I know that <em>theoretically</em> many glue should fit <em>but</em> I also know by experience that resoling did failed most of the time (I spent my childhood running after my soles...). I'm tempted to use neoprene glue (contact adhesive) for the first adhesion to be completed by superglue for the tricky parts. What do you think?</p>

<p>ps: I would prefer practical feedback rather than theoretical advises (pictures of your experiments are warmly welcome!)</p>

  this bearing to a steep descent down a little gully (SH 61992 56084).
  Follow the faint path, at first to the west and then to the north
  west, to another short descent (SH 61800 56200). Continue descending

"Is it generally safe to hike a pass in a thunderstorm?","<p>Friend and I had this discussion, and came to no conclusion:</p>

<p>Hiking in the mountains.  Crossing a range through a pass.  Peaks on either side are a good thousand feet higher.  Are you at serious risk of getting hit by lighting?</p>

<p>More generally:  If you are walking a ridge line, and see a storm developing, how far below the ridge line do you need to be to be reasonably safe?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  </p>

<p><em>Since asking this question I've been doing more reading.  Unless the  the mountain is sharply above you -- better than 45 degrees, you only have a very moderate amount of protection.  45 degrees is steeper than the angle of repose -- 37 degrees -- the angle you can stack loose rock and not have a slide.</em></p>

<p><strong>So the 'best answer' is correct.  There is no safe path.</strong></p>

<p>Still: only about 15-20 people a year die from lighting strikes, mostly fishermen.  So the real question becomes:  How big is the whole risk?</p>

<p>While strikes 6-10 miles away from the base of the thunderstorm have occurred, most of the ground strikes are under or very close to the edges of the storm base.</p>

<p>If we take the LD50 radius of a lightning strike at 50m then it requires a storm with 133 strikes per square kilometer to land one near you.  A storm with a 10 km diameter would need to deliver about 10,000 strikes. to zot a person under it's immediate footprint.  That's several hours at one per second.  The storms I have experienced in the mountains are both shorter than that, and seem to be limited to a few strikes per minute.</p>

<p>Net conclusion:  Avoid the really high risk places, and enjoy the show.  Overall moving toward safety is better than staying put.</p>

<p>I've been unable to find stats on how much higher your risk is standing vs the lightning position (squat in a ball)</p>

<p>Overall on a per trip basis, I would rank risks largest to smallest:</p>

<ul>
<li>Accident traveling to the hike</li>
<li>Avalanche (low 30's per year, North America)</li>
<li>Climbing accidents (low 20's per year, North America)</li>
<li>Lightning (mid to high teens per year, US)</li>
<li>Wildlife attack (a few per year)</li>
</ul>

<p>This doesn't take into account the relative frequency of the activity.  Fishermen have a higher rate because they are willing to fish in the rain. And there are a lot more skiers and snowmobilers at risk of avalanche than of people walking the high country, or doing technical rock climbing.</p>

"Relative risks of various outdoor activities?","<p>I got into a 'discussion' with the vice principal of the school I work at.  He was worried about the dangers inherent in our fairly extensive outdoor program.</p>

<p>I pointed out to him that an analysis of the previous year's infirmary logbook showed that we had far more lost school days from basketball than we did from snowshoeing despite that the entire school snowshoes, and only about 1/3 have anything to do with basketball.</p>

<p>""Prove it""</p>

<p>And there I got stuck.</p>

<p><em>(Edit in response to comment: My VP considers the outdoor program far more lethal -- chance of dying.  So comparing injuries in the infirmary log struck him as specious. Yet this is not borne out.  Kids die playing hockey and football.  Not many.  Kids die in avalanches in school outings.  Not many. I'd like to get a handle on the relative risks.)</em></p>

<p><em>(Edit 2: Charlie, below has some interesting articles, and some of these are similar to the ones I found in  my groveling.  The problem is that few take into account the number of practicianers.  One article comments that falls are the leading cause of ER room outdoor pursuits treatments.  And if you dig further you find that more hikers were injured or killed than mountaineers.  But there are a lot more hikers, so if there was equal hazard you would expect more incidents. )</em> </p>

<p>I found tantalizing tidbits:  </p>

<ul>
<li>For the young teen male, there is about 1 fatality per 5 million downhill ski days. </li>
<li>The most dangerous sport is high school foot ball: Much more dangerous than either college or pro ball. (This made sense to me: High school kids are growing, clumsy; high school coaches aren't as well trained, fewer assistants.)  Hockey came close.</li>
<li>I found a lightning strike density map for Alberta.  The highest density strike zone runs 4 strikes/km2/year</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway:  <em>Some</em> insurance company I'm sure has collected these stats:  </p>

<p>Someone has written a report on the relative risks of various outdoor pursuits:</p>

<p>E.g:  In absolute numbers more people die in climbing accidents than are killed by lightning in the mountains.  But overall there are a lot more hiking days than there are climbing days.</p>

<p>How many people drown per million canoeing days?</p>

<p>What are your chances of coming to a sticky end cross country skiing?</p>

<p>Avalanche deaths per million days back country skiing?</p>

<hr>

<p>For each individual activity there are mitigations:  E.g.  Don't be on ridge tops during lighting storms.  Take an avalanche safety course, carry the radio thingies, and practice using them.  Learn how to right your sailboat.  Know the signs and treatment for incipient hypothermia.</p>

<p>OTOH  What is the relative risk between the pass and the peak on either side for lightning? In another question and the reading it caused me to do, it isn't safe to cross a pass.  Certainly more dangerous than crossing the street, but compare to crossing the Bakersfield freeway (8 lanes each way) How risky is it? </p>

<p>But I figure that insurance companies that underwrite various flavours of adventure companies have some more concrete numbers than this.  What do they use?</p>

<p>Does anyone know of either a stats heavy report on various outdoor pursuits, or a more general book on risk management in the outdoors?</p>

the makings of a debate started, but no definitive consensus was reached. I'm going to do my best to make an attempt to summarize each side:</p>

<h2>For</h2>

<ul>
<li>in a survival situation with only murky water available and whether
help is coming or not remains uncertain, an improvised filtration
system of rocks, sand and charcoal can make the water safer to drink (conceding it doesn't <em>purify</em> water)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Against</h2>

<ul>
<li>in a survival situation, it may be more constructive to devote time
and energy to getting home. </li>
<li>Additionally, there is no way to know that there was not a recently
decomposing animal (or other bacteria source) on the very sand you are using which would
introduce even more harmful contaminants into the water.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I see the logic in both sides of the argument, and I think there is an implicit distinction between filtering and purifying. With that in mind, when is it warranted to filter water in a survival situation? </p>

<p>For example, is the only use case to filter debris before boiling it over a fire to make it truly safe to drink? Or is improvised water filtration with sand, rocks and charcoal a waste of time and energy altogether?</p>

"What clothing would be appropriate for hiking in -18°C with up to 30 km/hr wind?","<p>I recently moved to Germany and am planning to do a hike in the Harz mountains.  The weather is expected to be around -18°C.  Most of the trail will be sheltered by forest, but the mountaintop is exposed to strong winds.  I am somewhat new to the cold climate and am wondering what others would consider appropriate clothing for this day hike.</p>

<p>I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Down jacket (outer layer), polar fleece and microfleece (intermediate layers), and t-shirt.</li>

<p><strong>After-hike edit</strong>:</p>

<p>The weather on the hike turned out to be much better than forecast; in particular: sunny and no wind. Two observations: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The puffy down jacket quickly became much too warm to hike in and was awkwardly bulky to stow (but was wonderfully nice and cozy for breaks).  I think I'll shop around for a lighter outer shell and a more compact down intermediate layer to add when necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>It turns out that my boots were terrible for walking on compacted snow. These boots are wonderful otherwise; I think the problem is that the tread has been worn away over the years and they need to be re-soled. So I would add: check boot traction on various surfaces, and/or bring traction-enhancing devices for compacted snow/ice.  Or perhaps the ""Hot Weather Safety Toe Flight Boot"" is simply not designed for ice?  Other than this issue, my feet were perfectly warm and happy.</p></li>

"What are the non-obvious pros and cons of an ""Instant Tent"" vs. a tent with shock cord poles","<p>Some newer tents have integrated pole systems where the poles collapse quickly but stay attached to the tent body.</p>

<p>The obvious pro of this design is that setup and takedown is faster and can be done by one person. The weight and size seems equivalent.</p>

<p>The pole design actually seems less likely to break than shock cord fiberglass poles, but harder to fix if it does break. If you've used one of these tents and the poles have broken in the field, how hard was it to repair?</p>

"Baby-friendly trek near Innsbruck","<p>My family is going to Innsbruck in August, and we want to do a 3-4 day mountain hut trek. This will be our first trek with our son, who will be 16 months old. I can see many, many huts and trails in the area, but I'm having a hard time ascertaining which ones are easier. For example, we don't want via ferrata, nor very steep climbs. Basically, we just want an easy trek - I'm sure that practically anywhere in the area will be lovely, we don't need somewhere <a href=""http://stubaier-hoehenweg.at/en/som/hoehenweg.1.htm/"">famous.</a></p>

<p>I don't mind arriving in Innsbruck and then consulting with locals, but I'm worried that things will be crazy in August, and if I don't reserve places in huts, they will fill up. Is this true?</p>

<p>Anyone have a route or area they'd like to suggest?</p>

"Are Dolphin sightings seasonal or serendipitous?","<p>I walk along Del Monte Beach in Crow City, USA (Monterey, California) quite often. </p>

<p>It is not too rare to see dolphins frolicking (so it seems to me, although they may just be going about their business, with no particular feeling of fancifulness or frivolity as they periodically arch their backs out of the water every several seconds/yards) about 60 feet (estimated) off shore.</p>

<p>However, it seems that either I have been very unlucky lately, or this may be a seasonal occurrence. What used to be common is now ""special"" - I saw one again last week for the first time in at least several weeks.</p>

<p>Is this because they would tend to be in Monterey Bay only during a certain time of the year (and not in late spring)? Is it based on a prey/predator situation, the temperature of the water, or something like that? Or is it just sort of a ""random"" circumstance or ""happy accident"" that I might happen to see them quite a bit for a stretch of time, and then an ""unhappy accident"" that I miss them for quite awhile (they're there, but I just don't happen to look in the right place at the right time)?</p>

"What materials are most durable for marine vessel interior resurfacing?","<p>When resurfacing counter-tops, ceilings, etc. in marine vessels, what materials stand up the best to moisture, yet are manipulable enough without excessive tooling?</p>

<p>This can be at many levels of difficulty.  I'm most concerned with the case of a sailboat at a mooring; which means you do not have access to AC power and the ability to place heavy items on solid ground.  Everything has to fit into a tender/dinghy.  So, the material has to be cuttable by battery-powered tools, or by hand.  It also has to be light and easy enough to move with a single-person in a small tender.</p>

<p>For example: Is linoleum counter top material good for galley counter tops?  Does the necessary adhesive stand up to marine conditions?  What might be better?</p>

"How to avoid tangling up the rope when throwing it before rappelling?","<p>When we rappel after a multi-pitch climb, we usually take up the rope (or both ropes when we use half ropes) so that we end up with one or two nicely lap-coiled ropes. </p>

"What's the easiest way of improving my strength without a large investment of time?","<p>I've been climbing for about 7 years starting when I was 31 years old.  Initially I made rapid progress as I learned the various techniques etc, but after about a year I plateaued and I haven't really made any progress in the last 6 years.  I have kids and I'm pretty busy all week so I only get to climb, with another friend my age at the weekend so as it stands I'm doing about 2 hours climbing per week.  I can reliably climb up to a French grade 6b or a bouldering grade V4 but that's about it.</p>

<p>People generally say that my technique is good but what I really lack is strength.  I see other people do routes that are beyond me and I get as far as ""that pull"" or ""that hold"" and I simply don't have the strength to do the move that's required.  </p>

<p>So here's the thing, I'd love to go up another grade and to be able to climb V5-V6 routes but it's clear that if I don't make a change to how much training I'm doing it won't happen.  I don't have a lot of time but I'm wondering what I could do with a few hours at home over the week that would help me improve at the weekend?  Would two 20 minute finger board sessions mid-week at home be enough to get me up a grade?  What kind of things would I be best investing my limited time in?</p>

I'm worried that she won't be able to hold me if I were to fall while climbing. Surely, we can't be the first climbing pair to have different weights...is there a way to fix this?

<p>Being 6' (1.83 m) tall, I'm a little worried about getting claustrophobic in the 16' (4.9 m) model, but the 24' (7.3 m) model seems a little.... huge. I go camping regularly and if I'm going to drop thousands of dollars on a tent, I would like to be able to use it after my project is done (edit: per the comments I should clarify that I usually go camping 3-4 weeks out of the year for 1-2 week periods at a time. I'm not looking for something for weekend trips). However, I've never camped in a tent this large and I'm not sure if something this size would be allowed, or would even fit in most campsites. Does anyone have any experience camping in a tent this large? Or can someone recommend another tent that would give me a little more head space, but would still meet my needs (listed below)?</p>

<p>Needs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Must be sufficient for 1.5 to 2 years desert living</p></li>
<li><p>Must be (reasonably) sand proof and able to withstand high winds</p></li>
<li><p>Must be at least 200 sqft (18.6 m²) with at least 100 sqft (9.3 m²) I can stand in (I'm going to be spending a lot of time in this tent)</p></li>
<li><p>Must have some sort of insulation/ventilation system or the ability to keep electronics and people reasonably cool (I'm going to have some solar panels with a swamp cooler or other form of air-conditioning to help with the heat, but my budget is pretty limited so passive methods of climate control need to be used wherever possible).</p></li>
<li><p>(I know I'm going to catch a lot of flack on this one) Must be a secure shelter for a domestic cat (Edit: I think I should also clarify that I'm not looking to take my cat on recreational camping trips. I can find a sitter for those. But, I need a way to care for her during the 1+ years I'm gone). I know it isn't a good idea to take a cat camping, but I have a cat with some medical conditions and special needs and I haven't found anyone I would trust to take care of her who is actually willing to put the necessary time and effort into caring for her. Due to the extended time period of my trip, I don't see many options short of dropping her at a shelter or putting her down. My definition of ""secure"" is that I can leave the cat alone in the tent for a few hours during the day and not have to worry about her baking alive, tearing through the siding and escaping, or other animals getting into the tent and eating her. Obviously no shelter is 100% safe, but (to give an example) I believe the turtle tuff would meet these needs as it has very strong siding which would prevent the cat from getting out, and would most likely prevent any other animals from getting in. Worst case scenario, the height and strong frame would allow me to hang a high platform the cat could escape to if a coyote or something did manage to break into the tent. Any other suggested shelters would have to give me the same level of comfort about the safety of my pet.</p></li>

Dyneema is a Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, UHMW), also known as high-modulus polyethylene (HMPE), or high-performance polyethylene (HPPE). Spectra is the same material. From my web search it looks like dyneema is more commonly used in Europe and spectra in the US.</p>

However, my girlfriends family loves taking me on outdoor holidays, the kind where you won't see another human being for a few days. During last years holiday, my cheap coat was clearly insufficient to withstand anything more than a light Spanish shower, so they surprised me with a 'good' outdoor raincoat for our upcoming canoeing trip to Canada.</p>

<p>Usually, I sprayed my coats with some kind of water-proof spray before use to make it at least a little water- and dustproof, since <em>'you should always do that before first use'</em>. However, this coat has some kind of high-tech breathing fabric that I'm not familiar with, and the labels did not provide any directions on whether (not to) spray the coat before first use.</p>

<p>So, my question: should I or should I not use water-proof spray on a 'professional' outdoors jacket? If yes, should I invest in a good spray from an outdoors shop, or will an all-purpose spray do? Or will this actually do more harm than good?</p>

<p>Specifically, it's Venturi ® fabric from Schöffel.  <a href=""http://www.schoeffel.de/shop/sterling/"">Link to the coat in question (if that's allowed)</a></p>

"What is the best rope material to use for climbing protection?","<p>I've been doing some research on what type of cord to use for resligning some hexes, and I found something very surprising <a href=""http://user.xmission.com/~tmoyer/testing/High_Strength_Cord.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the paper seems to suggest that while the <em>tensile</em> strength of high performance cord vastly outperforms nylon, the strength once it's tied in any sort of knot is significantly less. It also suggests that while other materials might outperform nylon when new, several of them rapidly degrade when stressed, to a tensile strength well below ordinary nylon.</p>

<p>Is this just a fluke? Is regular old 5mm nylon really the best choice with a rating, for example, of just 5.6 kN for slings? (Given the average breaking strength of a loop of 7mm nylon tied with a double fisherman's was rated at about 5/3 of the tensile strength, I'd think it's probably a -3-sigma rating pretty close to 9kN when tied... Obviously not tested though.)</p>

<p>It seems odd that it isn't more well-known that nylon is the best choice if it's true... Everyone seems to swear by high performance rope for slinging chocks and setting anchors, but it seems the ""high performance"" rope might just offer a better sounding number than an actual performance increase.</p>

<p>Has anyone had any experiences with cord failing on a piece of pro? What failed, when? What's worked? What do you trust? Does anyone have any other info on the failure of rope when in actual climbing configurations, and <em>not</em> just the tensile strength?</p>

"Is stringing a recurve without a stringer damaging to the bow?","<p>This is my first bow - it's a low-end recurve with a draw weight of 14kg nominal. At the shop they told me not to string it by bracing it against my foot, because the limbs get twisted sideways. They recommended I purchase a stringer.</p>

<p>However, I am a bit skeptical. Firstly, at the training grounds that I visited several times, the instructor was stringing the (I admit, very introductory, maybe 7kg) bows by hand and foot. Secondly, the guy at the shop also didn't use a stringer when he was test-stringing the bow.</p>

<p>So is a stringer necessary? If not, what is the proper technique to string a recurve without twisting the limbs?</p>

"Hiking/Scrambling Etiquette? (UK Specific)","<p>I'm an American who moved to the UK 2.5 years ago but didn't start doing a lot of outdoor activities until early this year (here, specifically, as the job that moved me over was very demanding at first.)</p>

<p>As such, I'm trying to find <em>documented and reliable</em> information on Etiquette for hiking and scrambling that might not be the same as the US. Here are some specific examples, but a well written article from a reputable source that discusses discusses overall etiquette would be better than answers to these specific questions. Does anyone have such an article they could point me to? (Article could mean blog from a reputable source, vblog, podcast, magazine article, etc.)</p>

<p>1) In the states, we frequently say ""on your left"" and then pass on the left when we mean to overtake. This is true for bikers, hikers, parents with strollers, etc. Plenty of people, especially in areas with lots of novices, don't know what you're talking about, but it's a widely accepted practice. I've noticed almost no one in the UK announcing a plan to overtake, but is there an actual preference?</p>

<p>2) In the states, cyclists and hikers should yield to horses and cyclist should yield to hikers (even though most hikers who also mountain bike will yield, knowing how much more difficult it is on the cyclist to start and stop, the established etiquette is frequently sign posted.)</p>

<p>3) Priority for oncoming traffic of the same type. I've always heard that uphill hikers/scramblers should have priority over those going downhill. I was recently told this was not true in the UK and that people moving downhill should have priority. This was based on anecdotal evidence though of a crowd of people getting annoyed with a group who insisted on priority moving past a group of nervous children coming down a loose rock slope on Snowden in the winter. </p>

"What to do if you are above timberline and your descent is cut off by a large forest fire?","<p>The situation:  you are backpacking and are above timberline.  Streams are ubiquitous, you are well equipped so exposure is not a problem, the entire party is uninjured and healthy.  But a large, rapidly expanding forest fire sprang up well after you left the trailhead, and your route down is blocked.  You have some food, but you will be on short rations if you have to take a long detour to get down.  (See option 2, below.) </p>

<p>Do you (1) activate your PLB (see definition of PLB at the end of the Question); (2) climb up to a pass and try to identify a fire-free way down on the other side of the pass, and activate your PLB only if you cannot find what looks like a safe way down from the pass.  </p>

"Does putting an item in a microwave oven kill ticks (and other bugs)?","<p>After a hike, we often find many ticks on us (and remove them of course). But the assumption is that some might still be in the clothing, on the shoes, etc. I don't want to throw the worn stuff in the laundry hamper, and have the ticks potentially crawl all over the house, and I also don't want to (or can't - think motel room) immediately wash after every hike.</p>

Then I throw them in the laundry hamper (or luggage) for later washing.</p>

"Big wall strategies for a three-member team","<p>I'm off this weekend for a three-day big wall with two other friends. I read ""Big Walls"", by Long and Middendorf, but the book is too old and doesn't really mention strategies for a three-member crew. For a two-member crew, the strategy is quite standard:</p>

<ol>
<li>Climber 1 (C1) climbs pitch, attached to a lead rope (R1) and carrying with him a second rope (R2), which will serve as a zip-line and a haul line;</li>
<li>C1 arrives at belay, fixes R1 and sets a hauling system for R2;</li>
<li>C2 lowers off the pig (haul bag), which is then hauled by C1 while C2 jugs R1 and cleans the pitch;</li>
<li>Repeat for next pitch;</li>
</ol>

<p><em>P.S: If the pitch is long and horizontal, a third rope can make things easier: not only it'll be used to lower off the pig, but also to cancel pendula C2 might have to deal with during the cleaning.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Now, when dealing with one more person, things start to get a little weirder, since there are many possible strategies. </p>

<p>A possible one I was thinking about is <em>Method 1</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>C1 sets off with R1 and R2, same way as before;</li>
<li>C1 arrives at the belay, fixes both R1 and R2;</li>
<li>C2 helps lower out C3, which will jug the fixed line R2;</li>
<li>C3 arrives at belay with C2 still waiting. After arriving, C3 sends a signal to C2 to start lowering off the pigs;</li>
<li>C2 lowers off the pigs and starts jugging the fixed line R1 and cleaning the pitch. Meanwhile, C3 and C1 are hauling the pigs;</li>
<li>When hauling is done, C2 is probably halfway cleaning, and C1 or C3 can start leading a new pitch. Hopefully C2 will arrive at belay before the leader is halfway through, because most of the gear will be hanging with C2;</li>
</ol>

<p><em>P.S: As always, another rope can be carried by C2 to help him clear the pendula and lower off the pigs.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Another one is <em>Method 2</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>C1 sets off with R1 and R2, same way as before;</li>
<li>C1 arrives at the belay, fixes R1 and pulls up R2 and two other ropes, R3 and R4. R2 in this case will be a very thin, 7mm zip-line;</li>
<li>C1 fixes R1 and R3 and sets a pulley system for R4;</li>
<li>C3 starts jugging R3 and leader starts hauling from R4 at the same time. C2 immediately sets off to clean the pitch;</li>
<li>After C3 gets to belay and helps C1 with the hauling, he or C1 can already start leading the next pitch;</li>
</ol>

<p><em>P.S: a fifth (!) rope can be carried to avoid pendula, etc.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I hope I was transparent enough in my descriptions. </p>

<p>Now, let's talk about the advantages of each method. Method 1 has the downside of C2 having to wait till C3 got to the belay to lower off the pigs, and only then start cleaning. But C3 is the fastest of the group anyway: he needs only to jug fast and tight. The main advantage of Method 1 is that C3 can help C1, which just leaded a possible A3+ and is thanking Odin for being alive, to haul the pigs. This method also involves a maximum of 3 ropes.</p>

<p>Method 2, on the other hand, can be faster: C2 starts cleaning immediately after C1 fixes R1. C3 can deal with lowering off the pigs and then can sprint up from a fixed line, to help C1 haul a little, and to lead the next pitch. C2 will be cleaning throughout the whole process, so the next leader will have available gear earlier than in Method 1. The problem is that at least 4 ropes <em>must</em> be carried, and that C1 will have to haul at least a little bit on his own.</p>

<p>Do you know another method? Does anyone have any experience with both of these methods and can suggest any improvement/comment?</p>

"Warning shot in bear encounter?","<p>I'm wondering if anyone else has had any experiences with guns and/or bear spray in combination, instead of just carrying one over the other? How have bears reacted to warning shots?</p>

<p>We backpack in bear country (black &amp; grizz) and carry bear spray as well as a handgun for our safety. Unless we're in a National Park, we will also have our Border Collie with us, mostly off leash (if you ever hiked long distance, over variable terrain with your dog(s), you know why a leash isn't comfortable or safe for either dog or owner), but not allowed to run ahead of us on the trail. I've read many stories, statistics and comparisons between using bear spray vs. a gun for protection, almost all of them favor the bear spray. I'm not disagreeing with these, but haven't found much advise on the use of BOTH.
We ran into black bear in the Wilderness the other day, on the trail, about 50-70 yards away. The dog was about 10 feet to my right, and we saw the bear just after it had spotted us. She didn't charge or bark. The bear checked us out, while I turned sideways, keeping an eye on the bear, reaching for my bear spray, and telling my hiking companion behind me of the bear. We were slowly backing away to give the bear an escape route, speaking to the bear and the dog. The bear (bluff) charged, and my companion shot a warning shot. Everybody froze. The bear stopped its charge. I discharged the bear spray, mainly to build a wall in front of us, as the bear was about 25 yards away now. The wind carried the bear spray cloud off to the side, it went out maybe ~10', not the 35' advertised on the can, I was disappointed in the product. We talked loudly and aggressively to the bear and stood our ground, the bear left. Despite being in the wilderness, this was on a fairly busy trail, at a lake used for camping as well. I'm assuming the bear was habituated to humans and looking for food rewards. We saw it again on our way back from our destination in a gully, this time we were louder and there was no wind, so the bear had spotted us beforehand and wandered through the creek and up the other side of the gully, clearly not out for a confrontation. After this experience, I don't see how one would ONLY carry bear spray, as the bear would have to have been so much closer in its charge for it to have even reached it/deterred it with the wind. The warning shot proved very effective in this case! </p>

"Is there any upper temperature limit for a given sleeping bag?","<p>I'm actually shopping for a new sleeping bag and am a bit in doubt about a question that I do not find treated anywhere: By investing an arbitrarily huge amount of money I can buy a sleeping bag to sleep snuggly down to -30° C and even below. But what about the other side? Let's say, I buy a sleeping bag with a comfort rating of somewhere between 0 and -10° C, can I use it also in a warm summer night? Or is there some temperature where it will be just too warm to use it even with zipper fully opened and used more like a blanket?</p>

<p>I'm aware of the fact that I will carry more weight and volume than necessary for an insulation that I would not need. I'm just interested about the comfort at the warm end of the temperature scale. So if I buy a bag with some reserve for cold fall or winter nights, will it be unusable in summer or only not the best choice I could have had? If it is unusable above a certain temperature is there some rule of thumb that says something like ""a bag that has a comfort rating of <em>X</em> won't be of use for temperatures roughly <em>Y</em> degrees above that <em>X</em> rating.""</p>

"Canvas vs Nylon Tent for Car Camping","<p>I'm looking for some input to determine which type to camping tent I should purchase specifically for car camping.  I really like canvas tents as many of their features are very appealing but I know they do have a number of drawbacks.  Below is a summary of what I have found in my research.</p>

<h1>My Background</h1>

<p>I do not need this tent to be portable (i.e. carried long distances) as this is intended for week-long trips with the family when camping in a single location, most often (but not always) at developed campgrounds.  My only constraint is with the packed size as I'm currently driving a small crossover SUV which doesn't quite have the carrying capacity of a pickup truck.</p>

<h1>The Comparison</h1>

<h2>Canvas Tents</h2>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Large - Lots of room internally with near vertical walls.</li>
<li>Waterproof - Easily maintained waterproofing using a product such as Kiwi Camp Dry.</li>
<li>Temperature - Cooler in summer and warmer in winter as compared to Nylon.</li>
<li>Durable - If well maintained (not put away wet, will last decades).</li>
<li>Repairable - Simple needle and tread can be used to make field repairs.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Heavy - Thick (but durable) material and steel poles contribute significant weight.</li>
<li>Bulky - For similar reasons to #1, they take up a lot of space when stored.</li>
<li>Price - Substantially more expensive than Nylon counterparts.</li>
<li>Stinky - Can develop an odor that's borderline impossible to remove, particularly if ever stored wet.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Nylon Tents</h2>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Weight - Very light, small tents are event backpack-able.</li>
<li>Price - Cheap enough to almost be disposable.  Large tents are not dirt cheap but are still 1/2 the price of their canvas counterparts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Not as durable - Waterproofing breaks down over time and seam leaks are difficult to repair.</li>
<li>Small - Large tents are almost (but not always) dome tents to take advantage of the small/lightweight curved fiberglass poles.</li>
<li>Temperature - Hot in summer and cold in winter.  Slightly invalidated for summer as only ""hot"" when the sun is shining and I'm not in the tent anyways.</li>
</ol>

<h1>My Use Case</h1>

<p>I'm leaning towards a Kodiak Canvas 9x12 cabin tent with a ground cloth and the attached screen porch option.  If anyone has any hands on experience with one of these tents specifically, I'm interested in how it stands up against the aforementioned points.</p>

<p>I elected for this specific model because the attached porch can optionally be setup or tied back to the main tent meaning that I could use it when no other screen rooms are available and we need a bug-free location for cooking and storing gear under a roof.</p>

<h1>The Real Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Can anyone offer some advice regarding their experience with the points in my comparison?  I've never stayed in a canvas tent so I am likely missing some important details.</li>
<li>Do you think that my decision to go with the large canvas tent is a wise one?</li>
</ul>

"Sizing up high altitude boots","<p>I currently use La Sportiva WildCat Trail Running Shoes size 43 for trail running/light hiking and Nepal EVO's size 44 for Ice Climbing and Alpine adventures.

<p>I am looking at purchasing La Sportiva Olympus Mons EVO's for high altitude such as Denali and other real cold expedition type adventures that require a double boot.  </p>

<p>My question is how much larger do I size them to accommodate for the swelling of the feet at high altitude?  Would one full size be ok?  I am thinking a half size for thicker sock+ sock liner and a half size for the swelling of the foot, is this accurate or should I be sizing up even larger?</p>

"how high does a fence need to be to prevent European brown bear to climb it?","<p>An entrepreneur is planning a campsite-hotel in Romania, <strong>with a full outdoor gourmet restaurant attached, with an outdoor kitchen.</strong>  There will be no cabins or other living structures, only tents and tepees. This campsite-hotel//restaurant should be attractive to people without much, if any, outdoor experience and allow them to live and eat outdoors without worrying about their safety from European brown bears. Living outdoors will be beyond the comfort level of many of the customers.  </p>

<p><strong>European brown bears are a danger in Romania, however docile they may be in other parts of Europe.</strong>  See this article from <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-romania-bears/romania-police-track-bear-after-latest-deadly-attack-idUSLNE88I02E20120919"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reuters</a> and this article from <a href=""https://www.romania-insider.com/bear-attacks-central-romania/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Romanian Insider.com</a></p>

<p>I need to enclose an area <strong>at least</strong> 50 meters by 50 meters (164 feet by 164 feet) or 0.6 acre.  For many reasons, I do not consider electric fencing as an option. It needs to be a physical concrete-pole fence. Metal will rust and/or will need to be painted regularly, and wood will be too weak probably. The area contains apple trees, and vegetables will be planted inside the area.  There will be at least two enclosed areas, one for sleeping and one for eating.  Parts of the fence will be behind bushes, so people will not feel confined, but they will know it is there for their protection.</p>

<p><strong>What height does the fence need to be, and possibly any other parameters? Not sure if spikes at the top would be of any use? Likely the fence will need to be quite strong, with concrete poles smaller distance apart then the size of a bear, so he can't pass between by breaking the weaker material between the poles.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Is this feasible at all, or will bears break through anything, and climb over any fence?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answers started going in the wrong direction, talking about locking away smelly food. Please focus on answering the question about parameters of the fence, not suggesting other solutions. There will be just too much smelly things inside to lock away: a large outdoor kitchen, restaurant, cafe, full-size freezer, not to mention growing vegetables and keeping chicken for eggs and goats for milk and meat.</strong></p>

"SERE Surival Kit includes velcro finger lights, but why?","<p>I have seen a survival kit that has been spoken well of by many reviewers: the SERE Air Force Survival Kit. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival,_Evasion,_Resistance_and_Escape"" rel=""noreferrer"">SERE</a> stands for: survival, evasion, resistance, escape.</p>

<p>It is a rather small kit fitting in roughly the size of an altoids tin box. In the kit there are the basic things that are axiomatic to survival such as: compass, first aid, signal mirror, flints and so forth. Then one item that stood out was finger lights with Velcro straps. It was just kind of glossed over in the reviews I saw, and I also could not get much info elsewhere on the internet. All I know is:</p>

<ul>
<li>one is red light (visible)</li>
<li>one is infrared (for use with night vision)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I thought perhaps it would be useful for putting it over your finger as you pointed at a map in a dark environment. While this makes sense, I'm not sure the space and weight these items take up in the kit would be justified if it provides merely more convenient map reading (with all due respect to map reading). Here is a picture of the SERE kit with the lights in the red circle:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Perhaps it is the Velcro strap and notion that the lights go on our fingers that confuses me the most; what is the advantage of this? What is the typical use case for such a device? Perhaps we can also Velcro it to a small twig or something?</p>

<li><p>How did your system do at emptying the majority of water from a fully flooded (post-wet-exit / skirt blowout) cockpit in reasonable time (actual stats, or just your qualitative assessment of how long it took vs how long you could reasonably keep the swamped boat upright)?  </p></li>
<li><p>How many times could it perform the above function (in terms of battery life, leg fatigue, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Have you had the opportunity to use the system as a matter of convenience, or actual safety (for example has it actually allowed you to keep both hands on the paddle to stabilize a flooded boat in unsteady water, or when conditions made rafting up with another boat tricky)</p></li>
<li><p>How did it do at the different but also useful task of getting the kayak close to completely dry, over whatever time period?  (My thought at justifying the weight of this system is that the few liters of water that typically make their way into my boat weigh a corresponding few KG).  Did your system drain the whole boat (including behind bulkheads) or just the cockpit?</p></li>

"How sophisticated a dust mask can one hope to improvise?","<p>A common improvised dust mask is taking a bandana and tying it over your nose and mouth. I'm asking this question because I'm wondering what else one could add to this set up if anything. First, I'd like to say I'm not knocking the classic cotton bandana dust mask at all; in fact, I appreciated its simplicity. </p>

<p>As for the use case or hypothetical scenario, we can assume it could be anything from pm 2.5 ridden smog that the wind blew over from a nearby city or factory unexpectedly. Or it could be a dust storm kicking up in a desert setting. It could be any number of things. To my knowledge, a cotton bandana would only offer limited protection in these hypotheticals. I'm hoping there is a way to improve it.</p>

<p>Ideally, we would research the area and bring gear accordingly. However, suppose we were caught off guard but we still wanted to make the best dust mask we could to protect our lungs. Going with the pm 2.5 issue again, this would normally require a specific, professional-grade mask. I don't hope to improvise anything better than that of course, but maybe there is a way to improve over the cotton banada? The cotton bandana can serve as a baseline.</p>

<p><strong>One Idea I had:</strong></p>

<p>The only idea I had using materials that an outdoorsman would conceivably have on him would be to nestle some <strong>activated carbon</strong> (useful for filtering among other things) in between the folds of the bandana. If it could somehow be secured there, would that not help a little with the pm 2.5 or other harmful particulates?</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> If my idea doesn't sound plausible, is there any way at all to improve upon the cotton bandana using reasonably common outdoorsman supplies? Or are we 100% doomed to suffer the full extent of pm 2.5's microscopic wrath without a professional-grade mask? What about for the case of a natural desert dust-storm?</p>

"Dangers of excavating caves?","<p>There are a lot of caves around where I'm from in the Southern Canadian Rockies, including the largest cave, and the longest cave in Canada, as well as the <a href=""https://www.google.ca/search?q=booming%20ice%20chasm&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF28eOppbWAhVF6oMKHVkuA2QQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1319&amp;bih=736"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Booming Ice Chasm</a>. The caves around here were carved out by the flow waters off of the continental ice sheet during the last ice age, so they aren't growing anymore, instead, <em>they're filling back in</em>. </p>

<p>It's obvious in some places where the cave dead ends that it used to go further, deeper, or higher, but the tunnel is blocked by scree. Even though many are filled in, there's still water flowing into or out of them, so who knows how far they may go, or whether they may connect to other unexplored chambers or even connect to other nearby caves. Chances are good that the entrances to lots of undiscovered caves in the area are buried by scree too.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is if there's any risks to excavating these tunnels? I don't think that they would cave in, they held themselves up just fine before getting clogged up with scree, I'm more concerned about digging <em>up</em> into the scree. There's one cave that may have a blocked entrance on the other side of the mountain it's in, which could be easily excavated from the inside out, but I don't know how much scree might be behind where we want to dig. I'm worried about an avalanche of scree pouring into the cave once we clear out enough of the tunnel.</p>

"How to clean cookware?","<p>When going camping on a multi-day trip, how do you clean metal pots, metal silverware and plates (for metal or ceramic)?</p>

<ul>
<li>It adds bulk</li>
<li>The dirty sponge will dirty up everything else in my backpack</li>
<li>Drying and cleaning the sponge when done takes a long time</li>
<li>Dumping soapy water in the wilderness is bad for the environment (and often against the rules)</li>
<li>In many areas (such as deserts) water is limited, and park rules say you should conserve water (and using up a lot of water to first wash, then rinse, then wash the sponge seems like a waste)</li>

In the summer, a good swim every morning works OK to wash the filth off of me but there is only so much of summer and I tend to go out all year round (perhaps even more so in winter).</p>

<p>Are there some basic tricks to keeping clean? Or do you just try to get used to the filth? To be clear, I am speaking of keeping my body clean, not so much the clothes, since those bother me less (and I can always bring a change of clothes for longer hikes).</p>

"What are some things to keep in mind when stealth camping?","<p><a href=""http://bicycletouringpro.com/blog/the-secrets-of-stealth-camping/"">Stealth Camping definition</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stealth camping is the act of quietly finding a place away from people where you can camp for the night and then quickly slip away in the morning without being detected. The key to stealth camping is to remain hidden at all times and to leave no trace of your existence during or after your departure from the site. </p>

"What to do when a moose blocks the trail?","<p>We were hiking in Colorado a couple of weeks ago (i.e., mid-June).  One day, I took Trail A and my husband took Trail B.  As he rounded a bend, he saw a moose on the trail about 50 feet away.  He stopped.  The moose did nothing.  He continued walking towards the moose. When he got to about 30 feet from the moose, the moose ambled off the trail, and, partially screened by trees, started eating.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Other than neglecting to take a picture, did my husband do anything wrong in this encounter with a moose?  (That is, was he dumb?) Should he have waited at the 50 foot range (when he first saw the moose) for the moose to leave?  Waved his arm?  Spoken or shouted?  Or is a slow-ish, confident approach good?  (I would have stopped, taken a picture, and waited until the moose left.)    </p>

"What to do when a snake blocks a narrow trail?","<p>Some time back I was on a very narrow mountain trail with a cliff rising to my right and a steep gorge dropping to my left. The trail was blocked by by the viper below (with the gorge just out of shot). The weather was chilly and the viper was sluggish, but quite aggressive and hissy. </p>

<p>I stamped my feet and clapped which normally scares snakes off, but it wasn't going anywhere and we had a bit of a stand off. I could have swept it off the trail with my walking poles, but this would have sent it over the edge of the gorge and killed it. I was short of daylight so eventually decided to rock-climb around it on the cliff above, at some risk to life and limb.</p>

<p>So my question is, when it's not practical to sweep a snake off the trail with a  pole or stick (as recommended in the answers to <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10098/meeting-an-unknown-snake-on-the-trail-what-is-the-best-thing-to-do"">this question</a>), is there anything else I could have done to persuade it to withdraw without endangering the snake or myself? </p>

"Carrying small game while hunting on foot?","<p>I like to hunt on foot, walking through the desert. I mostly shoot jackrabbits since those are plentiful in my area. However, I still haven't found a good system for carrying the animals back to the car once I am done. </p>

"How can I care for a wound that will be immersed in water?","<p>I got a fairly bad cut on my leg, not quite bad enough for stitches but will probably leave a scar. I have a camping trip planned this weekend at a lake where we will go swimming and kayaking. I expect the cut to be partially healed by then, but not to the point where I feel safe leaving it exposed. (I'm also a little nervous given a couple recent news reports about ""flesh-eating bacteria"", even though I know it's rare, and the incidents didn't happen near where we'll be!).</p>

<p>At home I have been wearing a fabric bandage, which allows air flow but only keeps it safe from ""dry"" contaminants.

He's since been back for more and has taken to wandering in and out.

<p>Why am I bothering with a wild bird, you may ask? Couple of reasons - I live near a very fast road and it'd be a shame for him to get flattened. He looks young and on his own and I suspect he's not truly wild; there are a couple of places round here that keep and breed pheasants (as far as I'm aware) and he may have come from there/ have been raised in some form of captivity. I've made enquiries with the locals but no one has responded to say they're a bird short, so if he's heading towards a career in the big outdoors, I don't mind providing a helping hand (and if he becomes a semi-pet, no big deal either, though he does poop like a trooper, so maybe he can stay outside)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wake up to my alarm clock at 3:30 in the night: it is time to wade, and the favour of the morning’s earliest hours is required, however masochistic that may feel. The weather conditions look optimal for the upcoming challenges: entirely dry, still, and as cold as it gets in July.<br>
  It must be roughly 8am when I start the Þjórsárkvíslar crossing: the dreaded springs of Þjórsá, Iceland’s longest river. One after the other, I leave behind all the threads of an endless web of streams and rivulets.<br>
  I feel a mixture of relief and disappointment about the smoothness of my progression, but it is not meant to last much longer; it is promptly dissolved by the appearance of the river’s last branch, frightening in all its breadth and might, surrounded by the notoriety of grim tales and warnings. The water’s depth varies in a range generously estimated to be between 50cm and 150cm. The prospect of confronting a violent flow up to my chest has admittedly been the source of many headaches over the last few days. In the end, however, the Þjórsárkvíslar will not treat me that badly. The water level suddenly rises above my waist, but with a detour upstream I am able to find a relatively innocuous course in shallow waters, all the way to the other bank. I do not know how long I have been soaking in the river, probably some ten minutes. What’s certain is that as I gain the high ground again, the bite of the cold has made me totally hazy, I am speaking in tongues and can hardly remember how to spell my own name.</p>

Some people are careful with their garbage, but there's plenty around.   </p>

<p>The bear didn't do anything aggressive, it just seemed curious. She didn't want it to get hurt so she called animal control to come protect it. Unfortunately, by the time the officer arrived, the bear had wandered off. The officer said he'd try to find, tranquilize and transport it for release at a nearby wildlife habitat area, but he couldn't promise anything. He said there's been a significant increase in bear sightings in her city over the last few years. City animal officers aren't properly equipped to protect them.</p>

<p>In his opinion, the increase is due, at least in large part, to the construction I mentioned. There's enormous decimation of natural habitats of bears and other animals. Ponds and other water sources are being drained, which is devastating for animals and birds. </p>

<p>He said food, shelter and security are no longer available to animals that have inhabited these areas for many years. This has caused bears (and other animals) to venture into areas where they wouldn't necessarily need or want to go in order to find food. The youngsters, such as my friend's visitor, might even be looking for their mother, family members, or other animals who are usually together in the woods.</p>

<p><strong>This is my question:</strong>
Does it make sense to assume that a significant decrease in their natural habitat would drive more bears into a busy city than would otherwise be there? Is there a causal relationship in this type of situation? Learning about this will help me in my approach to conservation, both personally and politically.</p>

"What happens to the bear after being pepper sprayed?","<p>If a bear kills a human, it is usually euthanized as in the case of a grizzly bear that partially ate a man in Yellowstone</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It also seems likely to end sadly for the bears. Park officials have captured the sow believed to have killed Crosby along with one of her two cubs. <strong>If DNA evidence matches her to the killing, she will be euthanized and her cubs offered to a rehabilitation center or zoo.</strong></p>

"Can forest fires cause a drought?","<p>Everyone knows that fires are a big concern during droughts, but can they also cause a drought elsewhere? I currently live just on the East side of the Canadian Rockies. All summer long fires have been burning in British Columbia and in Montana, and we've been down wind catching all of the smoke. We have not had a single significant day of rainfall all summer long. It rained a little only once overnight a few weeks back from what I can recall. </p>

<p>My best guess is that the smoke and heat from the fires is somehow drying out the air before it reaches the continental divide, preventing any kind of rain fall. </p>

"Is it legal to sail a personal-size boat in the ocean in Massachusetts during a thunderstorm?","<p>When I was younger, during the late 1960's and 1970's, my Dad had a personal-size sailboat, called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunfish_(sailboat)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sunfish</a>.  He loved it because it was lightweight, easy to sail on his own, and had room to include a few young children if we wanted to go with him. It was also easy to right by himself after capsizing, which we frequently did on purpose just for fun. </p>

<p>We used it regularly, on freshwater lakes and ponds throughout Massachusetts, where we lived. I would call him an accomplished solo sailor. </p>

<p>Each year during that same time period, we spent the month of August in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket,_Massachusetts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nantucket</a>, an Island about 30 miles off the coast of Cape Cod. Almost every day we sailed throughout the ocean waters of the region. Some areas were calm, and others were quite choppy and rough.</p>

<p>One day while he was out in the Sound by himself, a thunderstorm, including lightning, arose. He wanted to wait it out, but the Coast Guard spotted him. They brought him in, impounded the boat, and he had to pay a fine to get it back. I don't know if there were actual written rules he didn't follow, or if the Coast Guard just considered him a danger to himself, or a reckless person, and reacted accordingly. </p>

<p>What are the current rules in 2017? Can a Sunfish be sailed during a thunderstorm in waters off the Massachusetts/Cape Cod region? Is a permit required? Are there separate rules because of its design or weight class, or are the rules the same regardless of the size or type of boat? </p>

<p>If this question is easier to answer without it being specific to Massachusetts, that's fine. I just didn't want to make it too broad, especially since rules may vary from state to state. Feel free to expand it to increase the amount of useful information for the community. </p>

"Book about wolves raised by a man, his wife and a German Shepherd: familiar to anyone? Is basic premise plausible?","<p>Several decades ago, I read a book written by a man who rescued and raised two wolf cubs whose mother had been killed. He was sure his wife would welcome the cubs, but he was apprehensive about the reaction of his large, male German Shepherd.</p>

<p>The dog took one sniff of the cubs, and adopted them, starting by licking them clean (they were filthy).   I don't remember how the man and his wife fed them; I think they had not been weaned.</p>

<p>The book focused on the pack that developed.  The man was the alpha male, his wife the alpha female.  The German Shepherd was initially the beta male.  As a juvenile or young adult, the male wolf challenged the man, who instantly and forcefully responded, and thus maintained his position as alpha male.  The male wolf and the German Shepherd worked out an arrangement where the GS was beta in the home territory, but when the pack (led by the man) went far afield, the male wolf was the beta.</p>

<p>The man trained the wolves to live on their own -- <em>Born Free</em> with wolves instead of lions -- and eventually the wolves, who had started to roam on their own, left and did not come back.</p>

<p>I don't know the title, I don't know the author (it wasn't Farley Mowatt or Barry Lopez or Jack London)), and I don't know where this happened, but my impression is the northwest US or Canada.  The book was presented as the true experiences of the author.  Does this go <em>click</em> with anyone?  Does the premise of the book - the artificial pack -- jibe with what has been observed about wolf and dog behavior and their relationship to humans?   </p>

"Lowering other members of a party on belay after rappelling","<p>I, an experienced climber who knows how to rappel, would like to take some people on a scramble route that requires rappelling into a notch. The other people on the trip have standard top rope climbing experience (i.e. know how to tie in to their harness, and be lowered at the end of a top rope climb), but they do not know how to rappel.</p>

<p>My plan is to set up a rappel anchor, using one or more slings around a boulder and thread the rope through rappel rings, or more likely, quicklink carabiners. </p>

<p>The process to get down into the notch would be as follows:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Rappel to the bottom, and go off rappel  </li>
<li>The other person would pull one end of the rope up and tie in to their harness  </li>
<li>I would put them on belay and lower them down as if they had just a finished a top rope climb  </li>
<li>Pull the rope through the anchor and continue on</li>
</ul>

"Hiking boot help","<p>A couple of friends and I are going on a road trip this summer, and we're planning on hiking the Grand Canyon, Half Dome, Observation Point at Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Longs Peak. I've been trying to find a pair of boots for this juggernaut and I've been out of luck so far- at least, I've made it hard on myself in my pursuit.</p>

<p>For starters, I have a small foot. I'm a tall guy, six feet, but my feet are 9s in most shoes. My foot is narrow, too, and definitely low-volume. That probably has something to do with my dilema.</p>

<p>I picked up the North Face Storm Mid, and it was nice. I liked it. Felt right on my foot, except when I tried to crank it down to lock my ankle in- it was too short. My toe hit the front on downhills. To tighten it enough to attempt to stop it meant my sole just felt... pinched. Hot. I can't really describe it, it was just uncomfotable, and it didn't help the toe knocking. So I went back to the store and went up a half size, and the slipping was gone. But, another problem arose; my ankle started lifting in the boot. Again, trying to lock it in meant pain for my sole, so I decided to take <em>those</em> back too. This time, I got the Teva Raith mid, and as soon as I got home I realized I made a mistake. The ankle slipped <em>worse</em>, something I had noticed in the store but tried to tighten to mitigate. The tightness required to keep the ankle semi-solid was painful, again, and the boot just doesn't feel right on my foot. The last isn't the right shape for me. So I'm taking those back, too.</p>

<p>What do I do?</p>

<p>The store I've been going to has a no questions asked return policy, so I've been lucky in that regard. However they only have four makes of boots- Teva Raiths, Keens of some sort (I didn't try them, they're apparently very wide inside), North Face Storms, and a Salomon that was nice but had a little heel slip and was kind of wide in the toes.</p>

<p>Should I take back my boots for store credit, use that on something else, and head to another outfitter? One south of me has a slightly wider selection.</p>

<p>Should I go back to the Storm (which I liked, it was a nice fit- or so I thought) and try new ankle lacing techniques? I read about some that reduced the pain in my Tevas and helped the heel problem a little, they may be of help. Would an insole help with heel lift? Is the general sole soreness an artifact of tightness or a misfit boot? I've never had hiking boots before, so I'm not sure what to expect totally.</p>

<p>I don't want to seem like a Goldilocks of shoes, but I figure that whatever I settle on should be semi-comfortable given the use they'll see.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I can't find a boot that fits and this may be my fault.</li>
<li>Should I go back to the TNF Storm, which fit but had heel lift, and use an insole/lacing techniques?</li>
<li>Is general the general footbed pain I had from the Storm caused by overtighness or a sign that the boot just isn't right?</li>

However, I am worried by the prospect of polar bears, so I wonder how frequent they are.</p>

<p>I have two data points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gros Morne National Park, almost 500 km south of the Mealy Mountains, rates polar bears there as <a href=""http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nl/grosmorne/natcul/natcul3.aspx"">accidental visitors</a> (<em>Occasional visitor, no permanent population</em>).</li>
<li>Torngat Mountain National Park, roughly 600 km north of the Mealy Mountains, <a href=""http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nl/torngats/visit/secur.aspx"">writes on their website</a>: <em>Visitors travelling and camping in the park are in polar bear country and are at high risk of encounters.

I suspect the number of visitors for those parks ranges from less than a hundred to hundreds of thousands per year, but I'm only guessing.

"Trekking poles: what are the pros and cons of Anti-shock vs standard designs?","<p><em>This is not a shopping question just to preface that issue. I'm not looking for a specific brand or model of trekking pole. Also to add some background information, I have borrowed trekking poles once, but do not own any. They are a rather new thing for me to consider as I've been a bit stubbornly (and maybe irrationally) opposed to them until I began to have knee pain as I grow older.</em></p>

<p>There are several trekking pole manufacturers, and they all seem to have a myriad of options and models. One of those major categories is the <strong>Anti-Shock</strong>, (hereafter known as <strong>""AS""</strong>), or shock-absorbing models. These poles use different methods to reduce the amount of force transferred to your hands and arms upon the poles' strike with the ground. Well, at least that's my understanding anyway. <strong>Standard</strong> poles do not have this mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>So my question is what are the pros &amp; cons of each: AS versus Standard trekking poles?</strong></p>

<p>Just a few of the the things I'm wondering about as a jumping off point:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Effectiveness of the AS mechanism. Does it really make that much of a difference over non-AS poles?</p></li>
<li><p>Weight differences between AS and standard: noticeable or negligible?</p></li>
<li><p>Reliability: is one type more reliable than the other? Or are they about the same?</p></li>
<li><p>Are all AS designs roughly the same or are some better (more effective or more reliable) than others?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there specific occasions when AS is a definite advantage/disadvantage when hiking?</p></li>

It wasn't that cold (0°C/32°F) so I wouldn't get frosty fingers with those gloves without the wind, especially when I am making sports. Is the membrane not working like I expected? It is said to be 100% windproof, so wind-chill shoudn't be the major issue. Is this just marketing or is it the unfortunate exposure of the finger tips while cycling?</p>

<p>That all being said I am searching gloves for mountaineering. I am not explicitly planning to do winter tours. I was thinking in getting a second, thicker pair to wear over the thinner one. I don't know if this might be a good choice. I have to clip carabiner, use ropes and (un)tie knots. I will grab in the snow, it could be raining the whole day and there might be quite strong wind - and not just 30 km/h...</p>

<p>All those thoughts make me doubtful although I am not expecting really cold temperatures at all. So <strong>which system is recommended to protect the hands</strong>, if most important requirements are those for typical glacier/alpine tours:</p>

<ul>
<li>water- and windproof</li>
<li>good grip</li>
<li>layering?!</li>
</ul>

<p>Taking a pair waterproof gloves of construction workers besides the Softshells could be a solution? Or even add very thin liners or mittens?</p>

"What constitutes mountain exposure when hiking or scrambling?","<p>In this question, I focus on the fall exposure component. While I understand the perception of danger will vary from person to person, I'm having trouble characterizing mountain exposure. I can see where when you reach YDS (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_Decimal_System"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yosemite Decimal System</a>) 3rd class, it's evident that overall steepness usually makes the path exposed in some way, but at 1st and 2nd class ratings, how do we define exposure? I'll be asking a few questions here but they all aim to aggregate the attributes of a hike or scramble that would make it exposed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is the mere presence of a drop-off on one side enough to consider
that particular section exposed even if walking on mostly level
ground?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the footing have any impact, like loose scree on a long steep
talus (let's say over 35°)?</p></li>
<li><p>How long or steep does a slope have to be to become exposed? I have Greg Slayden's <a href=""http://peakbagger.com/climber/ascent.aspx?aid=315164"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mt. Columbia trip report</a> in mind where he mentions the constant steepness being overwhelming.</p></li>
<li><p>Is a narrow path traversing a slope that ends further below at a
drop-off considered exposed?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This question is inspired by my recent experience with Alan Kane's <a href=""https://www.mec.ca/fr/product/5048-163/Scrambles-In-The-Canadian-Rockies-3e-%C3%A9dition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies</a> guide. It seemed to me that what constituted exposure was strangely defined or that I didn't understand the concept. For example, I found the slabby ridge up the classic Mt. Rundle quite exposed at its narrowest point (and that's at the most a 2nd class hike), but didn't find the 3rd class moves up Mt. Temple to be that dramatically exposed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is vital that the tradition of commoning is maintained, as without
  the [grazing] stock, the forest would soon become a very different
  place. The ponies and cattle are the ‘architects’ of the land, feeding
  on the gorse and brambles that would otherwise become overgrown.</p>
  
  <p>Without this grazing, the scrub would develop into mature forest,
  reducing the ecological value of the area and affecting the
  recreational activities visitors enjoy across the forest today.</p>

<p>And just how close is too close?
Is there any real difference if it hits me or if it falls at an arm's length?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>I once heard that if it falls <em>really close</em> (but doesn't hit me directly) I'd be deafened. Temporarily, unless there's serious damage to my ear. And I'd probably be disoriented (which could be a risk in itself).</li>
<li>I read that electricity from lightning often travels through the ground's edges and bends (especially if wet); so one shouldn't be too close to a wall or cliff. Also, falling rocks could be an issue here.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are lots of things I should be aware of and not only the ones I mention.</p>

"How can I hike across the Grand Canyon if I don't have a backcountry permit?","<p>I am going to try to hike across the Grand Canyon in May, from the South Rim to the North Rim, and back. Unfortunately, I have discovered that I am probably too late to secure a back-country permit for the week I plan to be there. </p>

<p>My original plan had been to camp at Bright Angel, then 2 nights at Cottonwood (whilst I hit the North Rim and then came back), then again at Bright Angel, and back to the South Rim.</p>

<p>My question is, what is my best option for still taking my hike? </p>

<p>Here are some ideas that occurred to me, but I'd like to hear from people who have done it if any of these are feasible:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to full cross the canyon, each way, in a single day, so as to not need it. (Is this really feasible? I'm fat, I'm 40, and I do want to see things along the way!)</p></li>
<li><p>Pray hard that a permit is available when I show up. (I hear they reserve a percentage, but don't know how likely it is that I could secure one.)</p></li>
<li><p>Set out even without a permit, and just find a discrete place, not in a campground, where park rangers won't look for a permit. (Dodgy in the truest sense of the term - but what happens if they do find me?)</p></li>
<li><p>Just show up in the campground and take my chances without a permit.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>On the bright side, I will be in the area from May 12 - May 22, but knowing how to plan would be helpful.  (Zion and Bryce both seem too close to pass up)</p>

<p><sup>For future use, backcountry permits open up on the first of the month four months prior.  On February 1st, for example, all of June becomes open to reservation.  I'll save you the time of calculating - May opened up in January, and by February 24th, there was NOTHING in any campground in the corridor any time in all of May.

We would probably have a 2 week time period.</p>

<p>So a little background. I've talked to a number of people who have thru-hiked northbound on the AT, and have heard about the various sleeping conditions. Assuming a pace of about 5 months, would different bags be needed for March in GA, June in VA, August in VT, etc? Obviously I don't plan on carrying more than one bag at a time, but if need be bags could be mailed to spots on the trail at certain dates.</p>

<p>Minimizing weight is always #1 on the priority list, but staying warm up north in the later months would be #2. I've mostly lived in the VA region of the AT, so I am used to backpacking with a very lightweight sleeping bag in summer months. </p>

"The dangers of simul-rappelling","<p>To simul-rappel, the technique goes as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prepare to rappel as usual, passing the rope through bomber bolts;</li>
<li>Tie knots on both ends of the rope;</li>
<li>Attach your personal anchoring system (PAS) to your partner's PAS or belay loop (or remain tied to him in any other way);</li>
<li>Set the gear to rappel from a single strand of the rope simultaneously with your partner, who's going to rappel from the other one;</li>
<li>Weigh the rope and be absolutely sure neither you nor your partner has its weight placed on the PAS, but on the rope (standard procedure: never untie from something that's hard to untie from). In other words: make sure you're both tied to the rope and balanced only by your weights;</li>
<li>Untie both PASes and rappel down singing a beautiful song, preferably in a sonorous language like Italian, Portuguese of Russian (German and Polish songs may cause accidents);</li>
</ol>

<p>This method is faster than usual rappelling. Many people use it frequently, and even more people have used it at least once. I like using it a lot, and one of these days a friend came to me saying that another climber got freaked out after hearing he used simul-rappelling in a daily basis. According to this guy, simul-rappelling is more dangerous than rappeling.</p>

<p>This got me thinking: imagine the belay is bomber and your rope is trustworthy (if those are not matched, then rappelling won't be safe regardless of the method). Then why would simul-rappelling be more dangerous than rappelling? I can only think of one situation where this is true: the weight difference between the climbers is considerable <em>plus</em> they're not attach to each other (as when rappelling from opposed sides on a spire). Overall, this is easily solved by remaining attached to your partner - actually, sometimes going down is <em>only</em> possible if simul-rappeling (like when one of the climbers is so light that the rope won't run through the brake - this happens sometimes to children).</p>

<p>Does someone have a clear, precise reason for simul-rappelling to be more dangerous than rappelling? Since most climbing accidents happen during the rappel and many of them are due to the fact that one of the climbers didn't actually pass his/her rope through the breaking device, I'd say simul-rappelling is actually <em>safer</em> than standard rappelling, since both climbers need to be balanced on the rope (using their braking devices) before lowering themselves.  </p>

"Why do Old Town canoes have dramatically higher capacity than Osagian canoes?","<p>I've been thinking about buying a canoe for a little while now. Growing up my family had an aluminum canoe so I've been looking at aluminum canoes in addition to the plastic canoes commonly seen in sporting goods stores. Today while looking at the canoes it struck me that the <a href=""https://www.osagian.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=1&amp;product_id=78"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Osagian 17'</a> canoe has very similar dimensions to the <a href=""https://www.oldtowncanoe.com/canoes/recreation/discovery_169/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Old Town Discovery 169</a>, and <a href=""https://www.oldtowncanoe.com/canoes/penobscot/penobscot_174/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Old Town Penobscot 174</a>. Both Old Town canoes have a capacity nearly double the 780 lbs. capacity of the Osagian canoe. The major difference that I can see is the Discovery is 2 inches taller and the Penobscot is 1 inch taller than the Osagian. I would be inclined to attribute the extra capacity to the height difference but Penobscot has 100 lb more capacity than the Discovery even though it is 1 inch shorter. This means that length is a bigger factor than height for Old Town canoe capacity.</p>

<p>Additionally the shape of the boats seems similar from a top view. Not that a couple of pounds weight would equate to hundreds of pounds of additional capacity but the aluminum Osagian canoe is lighter than either of the Old Town canoes.

"Indoor vs. Outdoor sport climbing","<p>As I started indoor climbing this year I would like to know what distinguishes it from outdoor sport climbing, especially when you are lead climbing.</p>

<p>I know that there are huge differences in safety, like outdoors</p>

<ul>
<li>there aren't always bolts available as belay points (like indoors) so we need to use the less safe cams/friends, nuts, ...</li>
<li>bolts might be insecure</li>
<li>stand isn't as stable so we should belay dynamically</li>
<li>bigger falls because of less belay points</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Besides from safety, what are major differences between sport (indoor) climbing and rock (outdoor) climbing?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the difficulties comparable to indoor scaling systems?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for the last point I can think of tougher conditions outdoors (again safety issues or strong wind, wet rock, psychology aspects and so on) and pure length of the routes. Besides that, I <em>guess</em> an indoor UIAA 6 should be as tough as an outdoor UIAA 6.</p>

"Some mobile helper for tree climbing?","<p>When I do geocaching, I meet sometimes caches on trees. Some of them can be climbed by me without equipment, but in some cases I miss some flexibility or height to reach them :)</p>

<p>Is there any mobile (by mobile, I mean, I can put it to regulary city rucksack I go with to job, and it doesn't fill in fully, like normal rope) device to help me climb such trees? Some kind of short rope that can be thrown when I miss 1 meter to the branch above me? </p>

"How to dry Gore-Tex boots in the field","<p>I'm thinking of switching from old and heavy army boots to modern trekking ones. </p>

<p>Trying to choose between Gore-Tex and leather with waterproof coating only, I can't get over a simple question - </p>

<p><strong>What do you do when water gets inside your boot?</strong> </p>

<p>It happens quite often when you cross swampy grounds (50% of my hikes) and occasionally find your leg ankle deep in water - usually I just dry inner soles and boots (since my old ones don't care about heat) near the campfire, but it's not an option with modern boots (I've read a lot of sad stories about those who'd tried it) so, as I see it, the only way is to take 'em inside the tent or even a sleeping bag for a night. This won't make them dry, but, well, at least less wet and not ice-covered (if it happens during autumn or spring). </p>

<p>But I feel pretty unsure that it will work with membrane-protected boots. So, once again - how do dry your boots when they get wet and you're far away from home?</p>

"Gloves for knuckle protection that can get wet but not necessarily waterproof","<p>I am looking to replace my <a href=""http://www.outdoorplay.com/NRS-Creek-Kayaking-Gloves?gclid=CJDY_9_4l74CFcNlOgodgQwAvg"">NRS creeking gloves</a> that I use for kayaking ""bony"" rivers and creeks where rock contact is a real possibility.  The problem that I have with them is that the seams are not done very well or neoprene is simply not conducive to hanging onto many seams so they tear easily.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this seems to be the only glove on the market that is designed for this purpose.  I was thinking of perhaps goretex gloves that offer some degree of padding on the fingers and knuckles and don't really need to be waterproof as long as they resist tearing in wet conditions.  Their purpose is not to protect against the cold but against impact, so wetness is OK.</p>

<p>So I was thinking about perhaps dirt bike or mountain biking gloves of some kind.  Or perhaps some gloves that commercial fishermen use.  Any suggestions that would meet my needs?</p>

"Why are unequalised anchors acceptable for fixed-point belay systems used while ice climbing?","<p>The Association of Canadian Mountain Guides demonstrate Fixed-Point belay systems in <a href=""http://vimeo.com/44869774"">this video</a>. </p>

<p>Fixed-point belay systems as demonstrated make no effort to equalise the loading on the two anchors, but the video also states several times that fixed-point anchors are only appropriate for solid gear: bolts or ice-screws. </p>

<p>Fixed-point belay systems don't follow <a href=""http://www.gainingelevation.com/content/sereneernest-anchors"">SERENE (or ERNEST)</a>. Why is this? </p>

<p>When considering 'bomb-proof anchors' in rock (bollards, for example, that have significant ratings [upwards of 80kN]), using two anchors in this fashion might allow for more ideal placement of the belay point: directly on an anchor, rather than between two anchors. If a single anchor is extremely unlikely to fail, this seems reasonable; I'm happy belaying off a single bollard in our area. </p>

<p>What is different about ice climbing? Are ice-screws considered stronger than natural protection in traditional rock climbing? 
What are the advantages of ignoring equalisation and creating fixed-point belay systems? </p>

"Learning to fall when leading: what is good fall technique?","<p>I'm learning to lead climbs, and I'm terrified of big falls. Part of this is learning to trust my gear placements, but a large portion is because I don't know <em>how</em> to fall - I've only taken small falls (while top-roping). This has an adverse effect on my climbing - I pump out very early while placing gear, and place too much, because being even a little above protection is very scary. </p>

<p>Is 'learning to fall' something that climbers do through practise or through on-the-job training, as it were? </p>

<p>This isn't something I've seen addressed much. Is there a 'good fall' technique for lead climbing? Are there things during the fall I should be doing? </p>

"Recommendations for anchoring long rope swings","<p>Some questions about rope swings similar in size to the the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B36Lr0Unp4"" rel=""nofollow"">corona arch swing</a> which has an accompanying <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm6pd-uvMeA"" rel=""nofollow"">setup video</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Assuming you can avoid rope abrasion, do swings like this damage
climbing ropes? Swing goes straight into a pendulum with no/limited free fall.</li>
<li>The figure eights get very tight at the anchor. I've
heard people say you should loosen them, retie them, or cut them away
after several jumps. Any truth to this?</li>
<li>We set up a prussic
chord at the anchor. It attached just below the figure eight
knot that secured the jump line. This kept the weight
of the jump partially off the knots. Are there risks associated with
this - eg. can prussics weaken a system like this, or cut the rope?  </li>
<li>We also jumped onto a prussic (primary), with an atc below, with
overhand knot below that. We clipped the bite from the overhand knot
to our belay loop. We did this because we jumped with a backpack and
had to rapel to the ground after the swing completed. Slightly clustered, but we wanted to easily rapel after the jump was
completed. Any feedback on this setup?</li>

"Where have all the sandpipers gone?","<p>(long time passing).</p>

"Can deep wave action be partially predicted by lunar phases?","<p>Where I walk weekly (Del Monte Beach in Monterey, California), I beachcomb for shells, glass, and particularly stones. Most of what gets cast up is rather dull and uninteresting - gray and black rocks of no particular noteworthiness.</p>

<p>However, there are always at least some gemlike little rocks of various hues: yellow, green, white, orange, caramel and chocolate brown, reddish-brown, pale blue, etc. These are often well-worn and oval.</p>

<p>Every foray differs from the previous (quantity and ""quality"" of what gets thrown onto the strand by the relentless waves), yet certain stretches tend to have a consistent concentration of these gemlike stones.</p>

<p>I reckon quantity is determined by the strength of the tide, so full moon and new moon can be expected to produce a good harvest.</p>

<p>Storms would be another factor, obviously.</p>

<p>I assume when certain deposits are washed up, it's because the waves are ""digging deep"" in certain locations on the ocean floor where these types of stones tend to be concentrated.</p>

<p>So I can predict in a small way what portion of the beach will produce which type of stone; is it possible to predict with a greater certainty which area of the bay is going to get scooped out based on lunar phases and weather patterns?</p>

<p>Basically I'm wondering why certain spots on the ocean floor are ""reaped"" on one occasion but not on another. Is it such a complicated interplay that it can't possibly be predicted?</p>

"Extending a two bolt anchor with one sling?","<p>I took some kids out climbing last night at a small crag popular for top roping, but I wasn't too impressed with their choice of anchor placements, or lack of additional hardware considering their placement. On one of the routes, if you were to clip into the bolt hangers, you'd be unavoidably crossroading your carabiners. </p>

<p>I had a 120cm nylon sling on me, so my solution was to extend the anchor over the bulge of rock like so:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MNPRy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MNPRy.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It seemed pretty SRENE to me, the only flaw was the potential for extension, but using a bulky nylon sling seemed to make extension less of an issue, when I unclipped one of my biners to test how it would extend, it simply didn't. The amount of friction generated from the nylon made it very difficult to pull through, I actually turned one of the hangers a bit while trying.</p>

<p>My question is, is this an appropriate method of extending an anchor? What would be a better method of extending an anchor such as this one?</p>

"Rope between legs while leading on rock, ice","<p>When you're lead climbing, the most common way for the rope to hang naturally, if you don't do anything special, is usually between your legs. Is this OK on rock? On ice? Why or why not?</p>

<p>On rock, the impression I get is that it's fine, as long as you don't back-step the rope. I have heard people in the gym tell people not to do it, but I suspect they're either wrong or oversimplifying. Flipping through some rock climbing videos on youtube, I pretty quickly came across examples of extremely skilled sport climbers with the rope in this position, e.g., <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P5akoQ_eNI#t=380"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P5akoQ_eNI#t=380</a> .</p>

"is it a good idea to cover a tent with a tarp to protect for heavy rainfall?","<p>Last summer, I went camping with my family for the first time. We bought a second hand tent, similar to the one on the picture below. We had a great time, but after a rainstorm that went on for 24 hours, the tent started leaking at the seams at the top, causing the rain to drip down at the inside and soaking our sleeping bags. More rain was coming for the next day, so we were forced to pack up our wet tent and return back home a few days earlier than planned.
Back home, we discovered that the rubbery sealing of the seams had worn out, so we have repaired this, but it might not provide enough protection for heavy rainfall during a next camping trip.
So I was thinking to bring a large tarpaulin and use that to cover the tent at the top.
Is this a good idea ? Or might this get dangerous if heavy wind gets under the tarp ?

"Cooking by pouring hot water into plastic bags?","<p>Recently I came across <a href=""http://www.polylina.co.uk/pour&amp;store.html"">pour and store bags</a>. They seem a bit similar to the bags for trekking freeze-dried meals like Travel lunch. That gave me the idea of preparing the meals myself beforehand and packing them into such bags. It sounds easy &amp; clean on the hike: just take out the bag for one meal, pour hot water into it and wait a while. The bags could be reused, which is a plus.</p>

<p>Is something like this a common practice? Which kind of bags would be good for it? (I mean, it has to be 101% food safe and withstand the hot water.) I do realize there’s only so much variety of such meals that I can prepare at home without freeze drying, but I don’t mind. I’m mainly curious if the system works and what bags to use.</p>

"How to get more information about a planned tour?","<p>This summer, I plan to walk from the Wormser Hütte in Austria to the Heilbronner Hütte in Austria. I know that this can be done in 1 day, but when googeling, the tour length differs a lot. Some sources speak about 20km(12.4mi) and 1000hm and others about 30km(18.6mi) and 2000hm.

"Why aren't aluminum canoes more popular/prevalent?","<p>Growing up we had an old aluminum canoe. It looked kind of ugly, and had some dents, but it was a great boat. Over the past 5 years I've been in various sporting goods stores in California, Colorado, and Idaho looking at canoes. Every single canoe they have on display is plastic. They never have aluminum canoes. Aluminum canoes that I've found on the internet are price competitive (generally slightly cheaper), and weigh less than the plastic canoes. </p>

<p>My own biased perception is the aluminum canoes are more durable, hardier (in and out of the water since they can't warp if stored in the sun), require less maintenance, and if they are damaged are easier to fix. I know that I'm biased so I don't understand why the market seems to be dominated by plastic canoes. What am I missing? Why are plastic canoes everywhere and aluminum canoes hard to find? Is there something in the pro/con list between the respective build materials that makes plastic canoes a clear winner?</p>

"Is a full waterproof coat more important than waterproof trousers for hiking?","<p>I've spent most of my working life outdoors (forestry mostly), but have not done much hiking, which I now intend to do. When working outdoors, my clothing consisted of a wool shirt and waxed cotton waistcoat, anything else would just be ripped to shreds within a few months. If it rained we'd get wet, shelter in the truck for lunch, come home, dry stuff by the fire and then start again tomorrow.</p>

<p>Obviously, this system isn't going to work so well for hiking as I might not be able to have a fire so I'm looking to upgrade my gear. The thing that's confusing me is that there seems to be a plethora of coats available, but very few waterproof trousers and even fewer waistcoats. Intuitively, from my time working outdoors, getting my arms wet was no worse than getting my legs wet in terms of cold/discomfort, as long as my torso stayed dry. Most places though seem to think a full coat is the most important bit of kit with some leggings reserved for it it's really wet.</p>

<p>Is there some logic behind this that I'm missing, or is it just convention? As far as I can tell from experience in the rain, if you wear a short coat, the rain all runs off it onto your thighs, making them soaking wet, so unless you plan to don waterproof trousers <em>every time</em> you put a coat on, you're going to get wet legs. If you're going to accept wet legs in all but the worst of rain, then why not wet arms too and keep everything lighter and more free to move when it's not raining?</p>

<p>Since putting on a pair of waterproof trousers over boots and all every time it rains is such a faff, I'd be inclined to wear a waterproof waistcoat like I used to at work and carry a poncho to cover arms <em>and legs</em> if it rains. Is there something wrong with this set-up that I'm missing, it doesn't seem popular?</p>

"Down inside of a sleeping pad does it make a difference?","<p>Several years ago I purchased an Exped down filled inflatable sleeping pad. It is a more comfortable pad than Thermarest pads I've used in the past, so I would still recommend it. That being said, when I purchased the pad I remember Exped making a big deal about how their pads are filled with down as if this was a major improvement in terms of warmth (and possibly comfort) over other sleeping pads. At the time I bought this marketing pitch hook, line, and sinker.  </p>

<p>However I was laying in my tent during a recent camping trip and I started to think about what possible benefit down really offers inside of an inflatable sleeping pad. As far as I know down is warm because it does a good job of trapping air and it is light weight. How would trapping air be helpful in an inflatable sleeping pad? The air is already trapped or the pad would deflate. Down's other claim to fame is being light weight. I don't know how that applies to a sleeping pad since not filling it with down would be lighter than filling it with down. Also getting down wet is a known problem and so Exped recommends that I fill my sleeping pad using the pad's stuff sack as an air pump so the moisture from my breath doesn't foul the down inside the pad. That leads to a bulky, specialized stuff sack that I didn't need for other sleeping pads. Another mild annoyance is there are two valves on the\h pad so that down doesn't collect on one side of the pad. This makes deflating quicker but it doubles the chance a valve will fail thus ruining my pad. <strong>The more I thought about it the more convinced I became that the increased warmth and comfort of my Exped pad was due to its substantially increased thickness vs Thermarest pads.</strong></p>

<p>Does filling a sleeping pad offer any real benefit or is it just a marketing gimmick that exploits foolish people like myself who blindly accept down makes everything better?</p>

"How to deal with changing clothing which was used while cooking as not to attract a bears?","<p>It is said you not only need to keep food at least 30-100 meters away from the tent, which is easy do to, but you also can't sleep in the same clothing which was worn while eating, which can be very problematic or impossible to follow if you make a mistake.</p>

What if I only have 2 pairs and mix them up, forget to change in the morning and eat breakfast in the sleeping clothing, and suddenly I am left with no spare clothing which I haven't eaten in, so I must sleep nude or become bears breakfast myself?</p>

<p>What if I have underwear, does that need to be changed too and keep cooking and non-cooking underpants?</p>

<p>It's so easy to mess this separate clothing thing up, I can never tell used clothing from clean, always mix them up and forget to keep clean in the clean bag and dirty in the dirty bag, never can manage to keep them apart.

"How can we be the most respectful to a moose when photographing it up close?","<p>We've often heard that moose are most active in the early morning or late in the day, around dusk, and are usually near a natural water source. </p>

<p>Every year, we travel a few hours away to areas that are known for significant moose populations. We choose the “right” time, and “best” spots. We stay on a road or trail and wait, but have very rarely caught a glimpse of one in its natural habitat, and when we do, there are often trees between us and the moose. </p>

<p>We've always wanted clear pictures of moose, and I'm jealous of people who get them! I also study animals online, and use videos and pictures to learn. We'll never be able to protect animals if we don't understand them, so we need documentation. </p>

<p>There was a very sad story recently about a group of people at the edge of a lake watching a moose swimming toward them. After he got out of the water, they gathered to take close-up photos and videos. They scared him, and he went back into the water, became exhausted and eventually drowned. </p>

<p>People talk a lot about the real need to protect ourselves from moose and other wild animals, but it goes the other way too, meaning we need to protect them from us. This incident made me think there must be many times we scare an animal, even to death, but it's not so obvious, so we don't realize it. </p>

"Which mid-line knot is best suited for a trucker's hitch?","<p>I've been using a trucker's hitch knot for a very long time (camping, strapping stuff down, line length adjustment, pulley system)
I've always switched my mid-line loop when I've come to not trust them for numerous reasons (not secure, impossible to untie after loaded, rope damage, take too long, etc...).</p>

<p>Here is an example <a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.animatedknots.com/truckers/</a><br>
This one is tied using a directional fig 8 as the mid-line knot.</p>

<p>I've used the following knots for periods of time, switching between them as I feel uncertain:</p>

<ul>
<li>slip knot (quick, not reliable)</li>
<li>alpine butterfly (quick, reliable, seizes up)</li>
<li>directional figure 8 (quick, reliable, seizes up)</li>
<li>sliding prusik (doesn't seize,  not quick if not already on rope,
sometimes not reliable)</li>
<li>bowline on a bight (reliable, doesn't seize, not quick)</li>
<li>span loop  (reliable, quick, seizes up)</li>
<li>""half"" sheep shank with a half hitch to secure also called a bell
ringer's knot (quick, doesn't seize, reliable?)</li>
</ul>

<p>They all have their uses and advantages but I'm looking for that 'bomb proof' setup where I can load it to the max that the rope can handle and still be able to hold while not making this mid-line knot impossible to remove and doesn't permanently damage the rope. Speed is important as well because I will often pull out my cordage and tie down a trailer full of stuff while my Father/Father In Law will be fiddling with straps that have a tendency to become a nightmare of a mess.</p>

<p>My go to was a directional figure 8 for the longest time but it started to get very difficult to untie when using heavy loads (I'm heavy and like to use hammocks while camping :) some of my cordage has these in there permanently). I then switched to using the span loop for a long time but that also locks up. I've now settled on a bell ringer's with a half hitch lock.</p>

<p>This has worked well for me when tied properly but it 'feels' like it is not secure. I've never had it fail (even on 6 hours trips being used to tied down kitchen appliances on a trailer) but it just doesn't seem like a very stable setup. </p>

<p>I've never made one before, but I imagine it involves sand to filter out the grits, and probably charcoal to absorb the nastiness, as well as a couple other layers for reasons; like herbs that may be effective in killing microbials or some other form of alchemy that will make it safer to drink.</p>

"When to know it's worth to start with agriculture?","<p>Based on survival series, films etc. most of the people stranded on a lonely island (not necessarily restricted to this situation of course) over a long period start with agriculture at some point.

<p>When do I know that the benefits outweigh the ""waste"" of resource (my daily routine is that stable, that it can handle the additional expense), so that I should start with agriculture? Which precedence does it have (like ""Don't start with agriculture before you haven't ..."")?</p>

"Mountain guide leading towards a thunderstorm - does his explanation make sense?","<p>I just got back from a guided walking trip to high mountains. There was one day when we encountered a thunderstorm - and the guide advised we are OK to proceed with the day's walking, instead of turning round. He gave an explanation, and I wonder if you think it is reasonable?</p>

<p>The situation was as follows: the forecast said 'possibility of thunderstorms', for just-about all the foreseeable future. We set off from our overnight stay up the valley, heading for a high mountain pass. We then heard the thunderstorm coming, staying about 1.5-3 km (1-2 miles) away from us, as deduced from timing between lightning and thunder.</p>

<p>Now, the guide said he is happy to proceed up the valley and up to the col, because </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>he was monitoring the pressure (with a gauge in his GPS), and it was stable - indicating that the storm was going remain where it was, and not migrate / descend towards us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>More generally, the advice I have been given was that if you hear a thunderstorm, you unconditionally turn around and seek solid shelter (mountain hut etc.). Is that too conservative, and if so, what are the mitigating circumstances? I understand you are never 100% safe from lightning outside solid buildings.</p>

<p>For example: a driving license in Germany needs at least (made up numbers) 7 hours of night-driving, 5 hours of rural driving, 5 hours in the city, 12 theoretical classes with an hour each and finally the exams consuming 2 hours. That makes a consumption of 31 hours. </p>

<li>V3 – 'more strength'?</li>

<p>This question is, in a sense, the 'inverse' of that other question. But I'm not a route setter, nor am I devising my own pitches or problems.

<p>But some techniques, e.g. bicycling; or certain types of problems, e.g. roofs, overhangs of greater than 30 degrees; just don't seem to reasonably be expected at lower grade problems. I dispute, for instance, that a problem with a 60 degree overhang, for more than one or two moves, could reasonably be graded a V1. That absolutely contradicts my (limited) experience and I can't imagine that anyone would expect climbers at a V1 grade level to be able to climb such features consistently.</p>

  <p>One little thing that I understand differently: Sport climbing did not

<p>I understand that lava flows from a volcano, and affects any type of terrain in its path, including where it lands on the ground, which can be quite a distance from the site of the eruption. </p>

<p>How does lava create a tube-type formation with space inside? Is it hard enough to become something permanent, or is it a temporary structure that caves in at some point?</p>

<p>Is there any place in the United States where we could go to see one? I'm hoping we might find some bats inside. </p>

<p><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Since people have been kind enough to teach me about the lava tubes, I've learned that not all of them have bats. When planning a trip, it's best to look up each cave individually to see if they are home to bats. Interestingly, even if they aren't in the caves, there are often bats living in the immediate vicinity, so on a trip you can frequently see both. (It's also worth researching the area before a trip, because some caves are closed at various times to protect the maternity colonies. For instance, at the time of this writing, 7 caves in the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/labe/planyourvisit/caving.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lava Bed National Monument</a> in California will be closed for the summer while the bats give birth and care for the young.)</p>

<p>Robins are around all year in the summer, spring, etc. and have a red breast, etc (except juveniles) all year. <a href=""https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/r/robin/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RSBP web site confirms this</a>:</p>

  <p>The UK's favourite bird - with its bright red breast it is familiar
  throughout the year and especially at Christmas! Males and females
  look identical, and young birds have no red breast and are spotted
  with golden brown. Robins sing nearly all year round and despite their

<ol>
<li><p>Is it dangerous to repeat this trip? </p>

<ul>
<li>a. The max high on this trail is 1980 meters and we got it.</li>
<li>b. The next thing was to go by ridge on 1900-1500m. Is it avalanche risk when snow 1m deep melts?</li>
<li>c. Thing after this is canyon/ravine on 800m. I know there are dangerous signs ""sudden rise in water level""</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If it's not deadly dangerous what tools would you recommend us(like ice axe)/courses or to take professional mountaineers with us? </p></li>

"Are chiggers moving north, and if so, how do I protect myself against them?","<p>I thought I knew every pest in our woods and on the trail to Great Falls National Park, and had been bitten by all of them, but I have never encountered <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/chigger-bites"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chiggers</a>. Not in our woods, not on hikes to and in Great Falls National Park, not in Shenandoah.  I have always thought of them as denizens of the deeper South. </p>

<p>However, today the arborist who is taking down a large dead tree in our woods said he been badly bitten by chiggers yesterday.  He said it was worse than the worst case of poison ivy.</p>

<p>I looked up chiggers, and saw that they are in Northern Virginia.  See <a href=""https://www.chiggaway.com/ChiggerCountry.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chigger Map of the United States</a>.  If so, they have been keeping a low profile in Great Falls.  </p>

<p><strong>Are chiggers having a good year here because we have had enormous amounts of rain this spring and summer?  Or are they more numerous because they are moving north?</strong> </p>

<p>If masses of chiggers have moved permanently into the northern Virginia woods, <strong>how can I protect myself against them?</strong>  I always wear long pants and long sleeves anyway; do I need to do more?</p>

"Suvival: logs/wood, split or not to split?","<p>Given we are in a non-life-threatening situation, splitting logs is often beneficial.  However, I feel things get murkier in a survival situation. I have brainstormed about this for a while, here is the best I got:</p>

<p><strong>Survival: Wood Splitting Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>increase surface area exposed, especially useful if wood is scarce in the current environment</li>
<li>better burn since its drier</li>
<li>less smoke would not give away your position as easily as an unsplit, wetter round (assuming goal is evasion)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Survival: Wood Splitting Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>a lot of effort for a questionable benefit, maybe the person is better off just sliding a large unsplit round into the fire little by little</p></li>
<li><p>potential for injury, (probably not a big risk factor, but it's another moving part nonetheless)</p></li>
<li><p>minimal smoke could be a disadvantage in terms of visibility to rescuers (assuming we want to be seen)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is it worth the effort to split logs in a survival situation? Ideally, I would like to have a clear-cut (excuse the pun) answer, but if it depends, maybe we can walk through some basic conditions. Also, let me know if my logic was on-par in my lists above; maybe there are other considerations I didn't think of.</p>

<p><strong>Further Clarifications</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Survival time-frame: uncertain</li>
<li>Is help coming?: uncertain</li>
<li>friendly/unfriendly territory: friendly, not evasion</li>
<li>other concerns: availability of wood, and other concerns will be optional. These may be important in some situations, but in the interest of simplicity I will allow the answerers to stipulate their own assumptions on things like this.</li>

"Is there a difference between a hiking trail and a backpacking trail, including if it's the same piece of land?","<p>I saw an article about the <a href=""https://www.greenmountainclub.org/the-long-trail/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Long Trail</a>, a 272-mile trail through the Green Mountain range in Vermont, USA. 
It's famous for being the oldest hiking trail in the United States, having been built between 1910 and 1930. </p>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://www.greenmountainclub.org/the-long-trail/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Green Mountain Club</a>, which is referred to as the organization which has protected and maintained it since the beginning: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Long Trail follows the main ridge of the Green Mountains from the Massachusetts-Vermont line to the Canadian border as it crosses Vermont’s highest peaks. It was the inspiration for the Appalachian Trail, which coincides with the Long Trail for 100 miles in the southern third of the state. </p>
  
  <p>Built by the Green Mountain Club between 1910 and 1930, the Long Trail is the oldest long-distance <em>hiking trail</em> in the United States. (Emphasis mine.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://www.backpacker.com/trips/long-trails/long-trail"" rel=""noreferrer"">A different souce</a> lists it as the same number of miles, and the same area. However, it calls it a ""<em>hiking path</em>"" in Vermont, then the oldest long-distance ""<em>backpacking trail</em>"" in the United States. (Emphasis mine.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Long Trail is a 272-mile long-distance <em>hiking path</em> in Vermont, which runs the length of the state. It is the oldest long-distance <em>backpacking trail</em> in the United States, finished in 1930 by the Green Mountain Club.  (Emphasis mine.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since that source made a distinction between types of trails, I'm curious what that means. </p>

<p>Unless I'm mistaken, <em>hiking path</em> and <em>hiking trail</em> are pretty much the same. What interests me is why one source would also call it a <em>backpacking trail</em> . </p>

<p>In this instance, does <em>backpacking trail</em> mean something different from <em>hiking trail?</em> If so, what's the difference? </p>

"Why are long-distance hiking trails in the USA so much more famous than in Europe?","<p>There are several famous long distance hiking trails in the USA, connecting the Mexican border to the Canadian border.  The most famous ones are the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pacific Crest Trail</a> (PCT) at 4,279 km and the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Continental Divide Trail</a> (CDT) at 4,989 km.  </p>

<p>Europe has some well known trails such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_du_Mont_Blanc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tour de Mont Blanc</a> (170 km) or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kungsleden"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kungsleden</a> (440 km), but those are much shorter and easy to complete in a single vacation.  Europes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_long-distance_paths"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">network</a> of long-distance trails is mostly through much more populated areas (in particular as the 40% of Europe within Russia is excluded), but does include long, wild stretches in the north.  </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.norwayendtoend.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Norge på langs</a> (<em>Norway end to end</em>) is 2,700 km, the <a href=""https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/turistforeningen/files/6df56f7315c200764d8f8098113b0f58d97bd2c0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">E1 in Norway</a> is 2,105 km, and the <a href=""https://www.traildino.com/trace/continents-Europe/countries-Norway/trails-Grenses%C3%B8mmen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grensesømmen</a> trail is 1,619 km, all including large stretches that are very wild with up to weeks between road crossings.  Although shorter than <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PCT</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CDT</a>, completing any of those in a single season is certainly no easy task (some do it on skis, which allows for a longer season) and requires substantial preparations.  Yet for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me, the long-distance routes in Northern Europe are far less known than the ones in the USA.  Although I haven't hiked stretches of either <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PCT</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CDT</a>, I've hiked parts of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E1_European_long_distance_path"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">E1</a> and <a href=""https://www.traildino.com/trace/continents-Europe/countries-Norway/trails-Grenses%C3%B8mmen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grensesømmen</a> where I would meet no other hikers for several days in a row, and I'm not sure that would happen anywhere on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PCT</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Divide_Trail"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CDT</a>.</p>

<p>Why is it that the long-distance hiking routes/trails in the USA are so much more famous than the ones in northern Europe?

"When does a geocached area become ""saturated""?","<p>The 161m (0.1mile) rule in Geocaching is a pretty infamous one. However, the rules also state this:</p>

  <p>Please don't hide a cache every 600 feet just because you can.

Groundspeak may further restrict cache listings in areas where cache saturation becomes a concern. </p>

"How are backcountry campground reservations enforced?","<p>It seems that in the backcountry of Canadian parks, one may only camp on campgrounds, and reservations are required.  For example, in Jasper National Park, one <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/5551/566"">must camp on campgrounds to be reserved in advance</a>, and from the Algonquin Provincial Park regulations, point 6 states that <em>you</em> <strong>must not</strong> <em>camp at other lakes (...) not specified in your permit</em> (emphasis theirs).  Even the very remote <a href=""http://www.env.gov.yk.ca/camping-parks/camping_tombstone_park.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tombstone Territorial Park</a> requires early reservations.  It amazes me that this is the case in a country as vast as Canada, but it seems this rule is universal in (popular) Canadian parks.</p>

<p>I understand the rationale behind the rules, but I don't understand how it can possibly work.  Maybe I can somewhat plan where I sleep on a one-night 40 km trip in Algonquin, but if I'm going to hike for 200 km in Jasper National Park, I don't see how it's possible to know where I will sleep 12 days in advance, as this strongly depends on weather and trail conditions, that vary day to day.  If the weather is very bad for a day I might be a day behind, and I would be violating this rule <em>every single day</em>.</p>

<p>What are the consequences of doing so?  Of course, campgrounds may be full, and those who are there on the specified day are going to be annoyed.  But it will surely work out in practice (perhaps by illegally camping outside the campground).  The question is: how do rangers handle the situation?  Are they flexible in enforcing the rules, or may I end up with high fines and be blacklisted for any more backpacking permits in Canada?</p>

<p>(Perhaps the easiest solution is to avoid parks on backpacking trips, but that means avoiding the most scenic areas that have developed trails!)</p>

Not to mention the health impact of spray (I swear some bug sprays include ingredients causing feelings of paranoia - more notable when used indoors)</p>

<p>I could use DEET products - except that I have had allergic reactions to anything other than mild doses (so I mainly apply to hairs rather than the skin these days). that and their effect doesn't quite cut it for keeping them away.</p>

<p>To make things more complicated, I simultaneously cannot stomach use of swatters.</p>

<p>Considering how easy it is to repel mosquitoes, is there no way to keep the flies at bay?</p>

<p>Failing this, is there perhaps a health-friendly way to exterminate the buggers from a distance?</p>

"Swimming across a strong current","<p>Recently I had been to a hike where I had to cross quite a large stream. And I am not so good at swimming either. So after judging the possible depth, I could figure out that I can get across swimming through it. For safety reasons considering a not-so-good kind of guy with me, I picked the shallowest part of the stream. The disadvantage was: The currents were stronger at shallow waters.</p>

<p>So, we had struggle a bit to cross it at first place, and then had to further make our way through slippery rocks of the gorge as we moved ahead with current than we first had anticipated.</p>

"How can I keep outdoor critters outdoors?","<p>After 27 years of having indoor-outdoor cats, the last one died in May 2015.  (We now have only an indoor cat.)  During those 27 years, we never had a problem with mice. </p>

<p>During Snowzilla (Jan 2016), the storm that dropped over 29 inches on our area, we sprinkled bird seed under the eaves of our house, in addition to shoveling a space on our patio and stomping snow-shoe trails to the bird-feeders.  At least two mice came in through a space created by the installation of a new heat pump.</p>

<p>Sixteen trapped (and released) mice later, and with the entry space stopped up, we thought the problem solved.  A few months later -- more mice -- twelve trapped, plus one eaten by the indoor cat.  Now, another two months later, more mice.</p>

"Is linen a good or bad choice for underwear when (hitch)hiking in hot and/or tropical weather?","<p>I've recently learned that linen underwear is great against fungal infections that can be contracted in hot sweaty conditions.</p>

<p>But elsewhere I had read that the best fabrics against sweaty or tropical conditions were synthetic fabrics that provide wicking thus preventing excess moisture build up.</p>

<p>I just arrived in Taiwan where it's 34°C/93°F and plan to hitchhike around Asia for a year, as I've done before.</p>

<p>Previously my biggest problem had been chafing. I've managed to find some synthetic short and trousers, so it should be better this year. But I'm also concerned about fungal infection. I get <em>tinea pedis</em> frequently when wearing shoes and I've had <em>tinea cruris</em> before and think that could be a showstopper for long distance walking in hot/tropical climates.</p>

"Will a laser pointer work for pointing at whitewater?","<p>I have been doing whitewater kayaking for some time now, and still have a great deal to learn. For difficult places, it is normal for me to stand outside and talk about which lines are good and which places to avoid. More experienced people can simply point out salient features to each other, ""Go right after you have boofed over that ridge, with enough time to steer clear of the undercut rock"". I am still at the stage where I have to learn how to recognize a barely visible ridge, to know where I will need to boof, to spot which one of the dozens of rocks is undercut. </p>

<p>As pointing with a finger only gets us so far, I thought of using a laser pointer. I even found a model which is waterproof (meant for divers). But I am reluctant to try it, as it is expensive enough to hurt if it turns out to be useless. </p>

<ul>
<li>if I get a laser pointer, will I be able to see the dot on the water surface? </li>
<li>assuming that it works, what would be the minimal strength required to see the dot in direct sunlight? </li>
<li>Again assuming that it works, which colors will work? I was surprised to read some diver mentioning that underwater, green is better than red, but have no idea if this will hold for the surface. </li>
<li>The water surface reflects more like a mirror than like a random solid surface - will this be as damaging for the eyesight as having the pointer itself pointed directly at the eyes? Yes, the water is probably somewhat foamy, but it tends to have still places too. </li>
<li>are there other potential problems with my idea? </li>
<li>are there easier solutions to the same problem? </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Update</em> I am specifically asking about good methods for pointing, not for finding the line in other ways. I am more concerned with learning to read the water than with finding the perfect line. To those who don't know what it looks like, the following picture is a good example. The important thing in the picture are not the stones, but the shape and behavior of the water in the different (small) places between them.  </p>

"Where to sleep while bike-touring southern Ontario? [x-post from bicycling]","<p>I've been on-and-off planning a (reasonably) short bike tour from the Kitchener area (about 100km west of Toronto, in Canada) to Ottawa/Montreal, followed by a train ride home. I know most of what I need, but the one thing I haven't got figured out is where to stay. I don't have a ton of money and am an experienced camper, which means I'll lean very heavily towards a tent over a motel/hotel where possible.</p>

<p>I know, however, that my route of choice (east along Lake Ontario from Toronto to Kingston, then northwards to Ottawa, and paralleling the Ottawa River to Montreal) is heavily developed and urbanized with nothing but farmland between the cities, which makes camping (even stealth camping) problematic at best. Canada, rather unfortunately, don't have anything like the freedom to roam, which means that, unless I secure specific permission from a landowner, I'm trespassing.</p>

<p>I'm planning about 2 weeks end-to-end, with a couple of days' stop in both Ottawa and Montreal for sightseeing. That works out to about 100km/day, which is achievable for me (especially given the prevailing winds). The general plan is to go a little further on the first day, to get me past Toronto, and to find myself in Belleville by day 3. Day 4 would put me in Kingston, day 5 in Smiths Falls, and day 6 in Ottawa itself. Another day's ride would put me halfway to Montreal, hugging the north side of the river, and the final day would leave me at the journey's end. In both Ottawa and Montreal I'd be staying in hotels, because I don't want to have to worry about my gear while I'm out seeing the sights.</p>

<p>Has anyone here been touring in similar circumstances? What are my best options for a (mostly) stress-free night's sleep in areas like this?</p>

<p>As an addendum, what advice is there for staying in decent (i.e. non-fleabag) hotels with a bike? Is it generally permitted in a room, or do I have to to have it valet-parked?</p>

"Should you occasionally use locking biners on pieces of protection when using alpine draws?","<p>Since I mostly climb trad style, I don't use quickdraws for leading outside of the gym. I use alpine quick draws (two biners joined by dyneema slings) which offer benefits of adjustable length, reduced rope drag, and most importantly reduced movement (which reduces the chance a piece of protection wanders out).</p>

<p>There are some downsides to this, however: two of them being that gates of biners on alpine draws are more likely to open (at least with non-wiregate biners), and without the stabilizers found on ordinary quickdraws, the biners are more likely to move around (meaning the gate gets reversed or, even worse, ends up horizontal and a fall will load the gate—the reason I don't use wiregates for alpine draws).</p>

<p>I've heard before that, because of the above, it makes sense to place a draw with a locking biner every so often when you're at a place where you have an extra second to do so (easy spot, maybe a ledge). </p>

<p>Is there a formula where <code>8c+ + 8c + 8b = 9b</code>?</p>

<p>In bouldering too, I heard things like ""it's an 8B that goes into an 8A+, so the overall grade is 8B+"".</p>

<p>If there is no formula, what is the difference between a short 9a route and a long one? Like a long 9a is just an 8c that is really long? </p>

<p>I also heard that you could explain sport climbing routes using bouldering grades, for example a route that contains a 7A boulder problem is ~8a (that is, you add +1 to the boulder grade to get the sport climbing grade).</p>

"Eye safety when starting a fire with a magnifying glass","<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>What are some reasonable (ie: <strong>safe, portable, reusable</strong>) ways to start a fire with a magnifying glass <strong>without damaging my eyes from staring at the focused sunlight</strong>?</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I recently started practicing some different fire starting techniques than I usually use, including starting a fire with a magnifying glass. When starting a fire with a magnifying glass, you focus the sun's light into a small but super-bright spot on a material to heat it up.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWlpP.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWlpP.jpg"" alt=""magnifying-glass-focused-rays-burn-hole-in-paper""></a>
Image Source: <a href=""https://www.scienceabc.com/eyeopeners/archimedes-really-destroy-ships-focusing-sunlight-mirrors-death-ray-myth-plausibility.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Burning with a lens"">ScienceABC</a></p>

<hr>

<p>My biggest problem when trying to light my kindling with a magnifying glass is keeping track of the <em>blindingly bright</em> spot that is necessarily part of this process. It is difficult for me to keep track of what I am doing since I try not to stare at the bright spot too much. <strong>Looking straight at the spot for an extended time is dangerous to your eyesight.</strong></p>

<p>The last two times I tried this I have burned spots into my vision. One of the times I gave myself temporary color blindness for a while.</p>

<p>Per comment by fgysin, I will try to find something more than my anecdotal evidence for the danger of this.</p>

<h2>Criteria</h2>

<p>Now <strong>I'm worried about this and want to make sure I stay safe</strong>. Fire safety factors aside for this question; I am asking strictly about <strong>eye safety</strong>, and strictly about over-exposure to sunlight when concentrating said sunlight with a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>Some criteria to make a good answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Must allow user to <em>look at the focused spot</em> without damaging eyes</li>
<li>Must allow user to look at the focused spot <em>long enough to start a fire</em> with it (One minute is probably more than enough once I get better; less is needed in optimal conditions)</li>
<li>Must be <em>reusable</em> a lot of times. If the method requires something to be continually replaced, like batteries, then I might as well just bring matches and keep replacing them</li>
<li>Should be <em>portable</em> for recreational use such as while camping or hiking; the more portable the better since I would like to take it in a long-duration hiking pack.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please keep other reasonable factors in mind, even if I have neglected to mention them.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Some ideas I had which I don't think will work</h3>

<p>These ideas can form a baseline by demonstrating what I think is almost reasonable but not quite good enough. If you think I am wrong about any of the following, then please do make an answer refuting my worry.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sunglasses</li>
<li>Welding mask</li>
<li>Mirror</li>
<li>Phone camera (or other digital camera) for indirect viewing</li>
</ul>

<p>The sunglasses I assume are not strong enough, and after my previous two attempts I'm too scared to try it.</p>

<p>A welding mask would technically work but it is big and bulky and would serve no other purpose.</p>

<p>My welding mask does allow me to remove the small viewing ""window"" from it, essentially allowing me to hold up a small (approximately 2-or-3 inch by 3-or-4 inch) light-blocking lens. This is <em>almost</em> an answer, but my welding mask requires batteries to operate. </p>

<p>Likewise, other bulky eclipse-viewing devices should be considered out of scope if they are not easily portable.</p>

<p>A mirror just redirects the problem, I think, but maybe there is a clever way to use a small hand mirror to safely redirect the image that I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>I have read that some cameras can be damaged by imaging the sun if I use it a lot combined with the magnifying glass, I'm afraid it will be ruined and therefore not be a good solution. </p>

<p><strong>So, does anyone have any ideas for how to do this without going blind after a few camping trips?</strong></p>

<p>Experience from people who do start their camp fires with magnifying glasses is obviously great but not necessary, so please don't hesitate to pitch in with ideas you think could work. If they sound safe, I'll try to attempt them.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>All the answers here have provided great tools (+1 all) for the magnifier-lit fire, and you should add all of them to your fire-lighting skill set. I have found that a combination of them works best.</p>

<p>Since getting the advice from you guys nearly 2 years ago, I have started many, many fires with magnifying glasses. It has even become one of my primary fire starting methods as long as the sun cooperates.</p>

<p>All of the answers were great, but since I can only accept 1 I accepted the one which was closest to what I actually prefer doing now, and which also is the most direct answer to the question the way I asked it.</p>

<p>Now that I've honed the skill, <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/22524/14074"">I have even added an answer of my own</a>, and I have also included in that answer my commentary on the other answers, combining them all together and discussing some of their synergies.</p>

"How do people camp on ice?","<p>When walking on Hofsjökull glacier in Iceland, I wondered: how do people camp on multi-day trekking trips across icecaps, such as when crossing Greenland?  My primary choice of tightening a tent is to put pins into the soil; this doesn't work on ice.  My second choice is to use rocks to fasten my guy lines; this doesn't work either on an ice cap.  How would I fasten my tent?  And not to forget, it can be very windy on those ice caps and glaciers, as there are no obstacles.</p>

"What exactly constitutes a ""road"" in Iceland?","<p>In Iceland, off-roading is strictly prohibited.  Unfortunately, it still happens and one can find tracks of off-roading all over the central highlands.  On the other hand, in the landscape, some roads that are mapped on Atlaskort do not look like much more than some tracks in the landscape either, and may have neither an F-number nor a sign where they depart from larger roads.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, how would I tell a road from a place where several cars have illegally off-roaded before?  Must a road have an F-number to be permissible for driving?  If I have a (possibly old) map that shows a road somewhere, and I subsequently see that road in the landscape, does that mean driving there is fine, or is there some more official source stating what exactly are the roads that are officially recognised?</p>

"What kind of baby carrier is best for use walking and climbing in the hills?","<p>I'm going to be a Dad for the first time early next year. My wife and I are very active outdoorsy kind of people.

"Can a click-up belay tool cause rope wear?","<p>I am regularly using the Click-Up belay device from Climbing Technologies together with a 40-meters rope from Edelrid I bought recently.</p>

<p>Now, after using the two only about 10 times together (always indoors) I noticed that there is abnormally strong wear on the rope but only on the second half, i.e. the part of the rope that is needed when lowering the climber.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am wondering if anybody else has observed something like this? Or whether it might be related to edges highlighted in the picture below? 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YGBHq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YGBHq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The edges don't seem to be extremely sharp but the only thing I can imagine that could cause this problem, in particular because when lowering the other climber and pushing the rope over to the left (so that it's running over the dark gray plastic part), I see pilling (from the rope) is collecting there.</p>

<p>Some additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The rope is 9.8 mm in diameter (it's the Edelrid Freedom), so within the recommended range given by the manufacturer (8.6 - 10.5 mm).</li>
<li>There is some wear on the caribiner but it doesn't really have sharp edges.</li>
<li>My (very subjective) definition of ""abnormally strong wear"" is based on other people being surprised by the wear of my rope in comparison to theirs (made by different manufacturers and used with different belay devices), and on my feeling that after 10 times (some 30-40 hours) a rope shouldn't look like one long toothbrush...</li>
<li>We both are rather lightweight (~ 65 kg).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's some photos to illustrate what I mean:</p>

<li>Part of the rope that shows strong wear

"Why is there a cock vane/feather?","<p>Last weekend I went to the range with a youngster. Naturally he was very curious and asked me a lot of question. One of them was, why there even was a cock feather which needs to be pointed away from the bow.</p>

<p>Well, I had to admit that I don't really know the exact reason for it. So why do we need the cock feather concept? </p>

<hr>

<p>Clarification for lay people:</p>

<p>Every arrow has a so called cock feather. It's basically just the same as the others but in a different color (not necessary but is a common practice). This feather indicates how the arrow needs to be positioned on the bow. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UggCT.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UggCT.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Often the cock feather points to the left on traditional bows. On compound bows it's either up or down (can't remember and I'm not a compound shooter). </p>

<p>This is just something you get told when doing a course. ""The cock feather needs to point to the left."" But why is this the case? </p>

"The outdoors, solitude and dealing with loneliness","<p>I have been out camping a few times, once with a group, the other times with my girlfriend. Although I enjoyed those times very much, I often wondered what would it feel like to enjoy the complete solitude of nature on my own. But every time i think of it, the combination of solitude and nightfall together seem to freak me out. I just cannot handle it. Last night around 11 I went for a bike ride and as soon as I left the last houses and malls, and saw the big open sky and the lake, I got spooked and turned back. What a shame!</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do you deal with loneliness and solitude on a a solo camping trip?</li>
<li>Does loneliness make the trip more or less enjoyable?</li>
<li>Does dealing with solitude in wilderness make you feel like a stronger person when you return?</li>

"Under which conditions are weather forecasts reliable?","<p>All outdoors activities precautions include taking note of the weather forecasts for the day.</p>

<p>However, I have seen those forecasts be terribly wrong in many places, even for a two-hours ahead prediction.</p>

<p>So, what are the conditions that make weather forecasts reliable? Up to what duration?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Example:</em></p>

<p>In the French riviera, near the Alps (Nice backcountry), where both the sea and high (~1200m) mountains are within 10 km, the weather forecasts are totally unreliable, from one day on the next one, but even from 8 AM (storms announced, rain visible) to 11 AM (storms announced, bright sun visible).</p>

<p>Inversely, in central France (Burgundy), in a much more continental weather,  predictions are reliable up to 2 days ahead with good confidence, both for temperatures and rain. 1 hour-ahead to-the-minute rain predictions are correct 90% of the time.</p>

<p>Based on that limited experience, I would tend to say that sea and mountains are reasons for unreliability. But up to which distance? What about oceans? From which heights to mountains impact? Are certain seasons more error-prone than others? etc etc</p>

"Wood versus plastic trail signs?","<p>My town (Groton MA, USA) has 110 miles of trails open to the public, but virtually no signs helping people navigate at intersections in the woods.  I am on the Trails Committee, and I'm pushing hard to address this.</p>

<p>Initially I figured we'd just do whatever other organizations do that have been at this for a long time.  Just about all backwoods trail signs I've ever seen have been simple routed wood.  It seems the US forest service has been using this type of sign for many decades, perhaps a century.  For example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIa09.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This happens to be from the Tonto National Forest in AZ.  It's about as typical a trail sign as there is in the US.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMuzS.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This one is on the top of Mt Lafayette in the White Mountain National Forest of NH.  Again, it's basically the same design.  The sign at top was recently replaced, and I'm not sure if it is more yellow due to being newer and not weathered yet (this location is above treeline open to the sky all year), or whether it's the new ""composite"" material that is plastic and wood.</p>

<p>Presumably the Forest Service has looked into this and converged on something that works and has low lifetime cost.  If it's good enough for the US Forest Service, it's good enough for me.</p>

<p>However, we have had several people pushing us to use newer plastic material that is claimed to last longer than wood, although its also much more expensive.  The main body of the plastic is white, but the front has a layer of dark green on it.  Routing lines into it cuts thru the front layer to expose the back, so you get white letters on dark green.  I've seen these signs and they are quite readable.</p>

<p>The question is, do you know of any experience with different materials for trail signs?  Are most wood because that's all that's been available until now?  Are there organizations that are using newer materials where they would have used wood signs in the past?  If so, is there any longevity data, lifetime cost data, etc?</p>

<p>Also, any opinions on the esthetics?  If you were hiking the back woods of a small town in New England and came accross non-traditional trail signs, would you think <i>Yuk, this high-tech stuff doesn't belong in the woods</i>, or <i>Cool, these guys are keeping up with the times</i>, or something else?</p>

<h2>Added about plastic signs</h2>

<p>I didn't have a picture of the type of plastic sign I described, so I took one yesterday afternoon:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kK9YR.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This sign is by the side of a road, so is larger than what would be in the woods.  However, this is the material I was mentioning.  Apparently it is also available in brown.  I have been told that this material will last much longer than wood, and is supposed to be able to stand up to long term UV exposure.</p>

<p>I have meanwhile heard back from one sign maker with some good arguments against pressure treated wood.  That and Karen's point about not knowing what volunteer resources might be available in the future to replace worn signs has me leaning towards a format like the wood signs shown above, but using the plastic material shown here.</p>

"Camping with a dog for the first time","<p>In a few months my fiance and I will be joining two friends camping. My friends chocolate labrador will be joining us for the weekend. My fiance and I, whilst both dog lovers, have no experience camping with a dog. </p>

<p>We have a decent four man tent with a large living area, which you can easily stand upright in and a bucket ground sheet. So there should be plenty of room for the four of us and the dog.</p>

<p>The dog is well trained but as a chocolate lab is rather excitable at times and has a tendency to want to play with wild animals (especially squirrels!). </p>

<p>What would be a good way to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep her entertained in the tent whilst we are not hiking?</p></li>
<li><p>Keep her free to move at night but not allow her to escape and run amok?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: Just to say this is regular camping (not wild) but would likely be on farmland in North Wales.</p>

<p>Second edit: Also predominantly on the first night we won't have hiked at all and we would have driven for a few hours so she will likely be excitable then, as stated by both answers and comments I understand she will be knackered after our main days hiking.</p>

<p><em>Just an addition</em> as I made some assumptions which lead to some confusion (I'll know better next time I ask a question), firstly that it would be understood a bucket groundsheet is separated from the main tent - this assumption is due to the bi-annual tent show we go to never having a connected groundsheet for 4 man or larger tents so my apologies there! And also for the confusion about where the dog would have to sleep as leaving her outside the tent in the UK is not an option (despite the high chance for rain, we wouldn't want a kind soul calling the RSPCA on us for neglect, or risk her running off, or the slim chance she would be stolen...) so apologies for that confusion also.</p>

"Kayaking in the UK","<p>My husband and I are both avid walkers / hikers but for a long time have been wanting to get into kayaking. Both of us have kayaked in the past. Separately we did it on school trips - many years ago - at adventure/team building week locations (for Americans, think of a summer camp that lasts a week and you do a bit of everything once or twice). I've kayaked on both a lake and the sea, he has just kayaked on the sea. Both of us did capsizing as well. Together we've probably totalled a weeks worth of experience kayaking, enough to know we both enjoy it.</p>

<p>We're in the UK, and likely our options for locations are either the local canal (Bucks grand union arm), local rivers (the Thame/Thames), travelling to the Lakes (Lake District) or travelling to the coast and kayaking on the sea. It is unlikely we will do any rapids or white water currently. We will be more likely to be on lakes/canals than the sea but the sea is an option for weeks/weekends away.</p>

<p>We know we will need licenses in the UK to kayak on any body of water, life jackets, paddles, etc. Just to note we'd also prefer two singles rather than a tandem.</p>

<p>A few things I would like to know before getting started:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After a few hours scouring the internet and getting overloaded with information, could someone provide a reliable UK book / website with kayaking information?</p></li>
<li><p>If we got a sea touring kayak, would that be acceptable on canals/lakes or would it be better to have a light touring kayak instead (or as well as)?</p></li>
<li><p>What would be the minimum requirements for a repair kit?</p></li>
<li><p>Does anyone know of a location in the UK where you don't need a license?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Due to licenses we'd obviously like to keep equipment costs down, but is it possible to go too cheap - and if so could someone give me a reasonable minimum spend on a kayak? (for the UK so in pound sterling, if in dollars can you take into account most things in the UK are more expensive than the US?)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> We ended up talking to a nice guy over at Canoe England who confirmed their licences for us. We've purchased our kayaks - after much discussion with the kayak company we went for sit-on-tops - from a Cornish company and are now waiting for them to arrive.

On some multipitch trad climbs, I don't expect to have to rappel off, but I might have to in an emergency. Many people carry a special-purpose 6 mm rope for this purpose, referred to as a ""tag line"" or ""pull cord."" They can then do a full 60 m single-strand rappel and use the thin rope to pull down the climbing rope after them after each rap.</p>

<p>It seems as though there is probably not a single rule as to what to bring: no tag line, a tag line, or a second climbing rope that you could lead on. There should be some decision-making process based on knowledge of the route. I'm not very experienced at multipitch.</p>

<p>Folks who are more experienced, <strong>what factors would you look at?</strong> For example, if there are three pitches, each more than 30 m, do you say something like this to yourself? -- ""If I split each pitch in half and rap off with a single rope, then that means leaving gear behind in six places, and I would run out of gear before I get to the bottom.""</p>

<p>I guess the argument for bringing a second real climbing rope would be that otherwise if you pull on the tag line and it gets stuck, you're in real trouble. However, canyoneers do this regularly.</p>

<p>You can get 6 mm spectra rope, which is lighter than nylon but expensive and just as bulky. <a href=""http://www.espritropes.com/water.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Polypropylene ropes</a> are almost as light as spectra, but I haven't been able to find a dealer and don't know how the cost compares with spectra.</p>

"US vs central European bear advice","<p>I was just reading through a couple of posts here on outdoors.SE and saw some advice which was a lot more strict than I am used to. For example, in the country where I hike (central europe, brown bears, but that's it) you wouldn't worry about the tent or shirt you sleep in smelling after food from 6 months ago (something I saw in a couple of answers here). And there are tens of other answers that also contain far stricter advice than I grew up with (no toothpaste in tents, bear bells, food canisters, etc.). </p>

<p>So what my main question is is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are those things related to bears in the US actually acting
differently or is this just a difference in mentality?</li>
<li>And if this is an actual difference in behaviour, are there parts of
Europe where bears act similarly to the US?</li>

"Is any subspecies of black bear more -- or less -- aggressive than another?","<p>There are 16 subspecies of Ursus americanus, the black bear.  The Wikipedia article describes their different physical characteristics and geographical distributions, but not differences in temperament.</p>

<p>The article discusses attacks on humans, and attributes the majority to habituation to people and easy access to food.  When access to food was made more difficult, bear attacks dropped off sharply. </p>

<p>Is there any analysis or evidence -- even informed anecdotal -- that suggests that any subspecies is more aggressive or more easily provoked to aggression than another?  Can any differences be attributed to the frequency and nature of exposure to people?  I read one article a long time ago in connection with an attack on several male teenagers that said that eastern black bears were more aggressive than western; this is all I remember about it.   </p>

"How to deal with unethical campers?","<p>Earlier last month I witnessed someone fell a tree in the Eagles Nest Wilderness while I was on a backpack trip.

"Protein-intake on extended minimal-weight treks","<p>I enjoy doing quite extended treks in the backcountry that rely on us (mostly 2-4 people) being independent from any kind of civilization for up to two weeks.</p>

<p>For me the foremost problem in these kinds of treks is the <strong>weight of the food</strong>: I've been on treks where we easily started out with 15kg of food per person, which is obviously a big strain for everyone carrying it.</p>

<p>I have already spent quite a lot of thought and time optimizing our trail food to reduce weight:</p>

<ul>
<li>We only bring food with very high calories-to-weight ratio.</li>
<li>We bring food that require as little fuel to prepare as possible (reduces overall fuel weight needed).</li>
<li>All the food is repackaged into the most light-weight packaging possible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Example:</em> Instant Pasta, Couscous, Chocolate, Peanuts (best
  calorie-to-weight ratio out there), dehydrated instant soups and
  sauces for pasta, porridge, powdered milk, energy bars...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So... we're set on carbohydrates, sugar and fat, but I'm guessing what we're still struggling with is <strong>protein intake</strong>: many protein-rich foods are either fairly heavy (dried meat, hard cheese) or spoil quickly. The few I know that are both light weight and durable (like beans and lentils) take forever to cook, meaning that we'd have to bring a lot of extra fuel.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do you have a suggestion on how we could improve our protein-intake on extended hikes?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What kinds of <em>protein-rich</em> trail food with low weight exists out there? (bonus points if it is tasty)</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> We use light-weight trangia camping stoves, as they are quite efficient and their fuel can be bought almost anywhere. I'd rather not rely on open fires as this will limit our treks to routes that go through territory where open fires are allowed <em>and</em> where there is plenty of firewood.</p>

<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> Somebody is bound to bring this up, so I'll just say here: <em>fishing/hunting</em> is not an option for me. Both require a lot of time (and often permits/licenses) and are simply not reliable enough: I can't stake the meals of our group on getting a lucky catch.</p>

<p>I'm not really fond of mountain goats... They're big <em>(up to +300lbs/140kg!)</em>, they're muscular, they can scramble up cliff faces faster than I can fall down them, and they have sharp pointy horns that hook just enough to rip your bowels out after they gore you. Also, in my experience, despite what I'm told about goats, they aren't really afraid of humans. I'm not very fond of any animal in the woods that isn't afraid of humans. Last time we came out of these caves there was a goat just around the arrete from the exit <em>(image at bottom)</em>. He seemed to challenge us, and kept moving closer instead of bolting like most hoofed animals do in the rockies. </p>

<p>There are eight goats in the picture, we came up behind some of them on our final approach to the cave, and they scrambled back over to the entrance to meet up with the others as the five of us approached (with me shouting at them to move along). The ninth goat was a big billy that had the high ground directly above us before we even knew he was there (no picture). I've had this happen a couple times; where we've run into a goat high up above the treeline, and it doesn't run away, instead it gets the high ground directly above you.</p>

<p>What I want to know is what that billy was planning on doing. There were a fews kids in the herd, no doubt his offspring, and I've seen videos of ibex and rams diving off rocks horns-first at each other. Would a mountain goat attack a human?

"What sort of glue (if any) to use to fix replacement tips onto carbon fibre trekking poles?","<p>I have a pair of quite old Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork Flicklock trekking poles.  After much use and abuse the tip on one of them has finally gotten bashed in (the carbide tip has either broken or been pushed back completely inside the plastic mount and although still usable the pole is now nowhere near as secure when in contact with rock).</p>

<p>I managed to remove the busted tip by following the instructions <a href=""https://andrewskurka.com/2016/trekking-pole-replacement-tips-buyers-guide-instructions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> which suggest dipping it in boiling water then wrenching it off with pliers.  It did actually come off surprisingly easily once heated (but before that I couldn't budge it at all).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To secure the new tips, tap them on a hard surface like concrete a
  half-dozen times. Do not use glue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but I'm dubious about this: I can easily imagine the new tip disappearing into the next sucking Scottish quagmire it encounters if not firmly fixed to the pole.

<p>Since I fish to eat, I am interested in total weight, so I don't really care if it is a single 20 pound fish or 20 single-pound fish. If that information is not available, then whatever info is available is acceptable as long as it is useful for me to make estimates to set my expectations.</p>

In these cases, is the subjective taste adequate to warn me when water has become too salty to drink safely?  Is there another means?</p>

<p>I find the following answer regarding the danger of drinking seawater to be compelling: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/9924/12619"">here</a> I would like to know at what point these issues become decisive and the water should be avoided.</p>

"Why is (almost) no one climbing hard routes on Half Dome?","<p>I follow the international rock climbing scene, and we constantly hear of repetitions of hard routes on El Capitan. </p>

<p>On Youtube, it is possible to find many videos of strong climbers from all over the world climbing (sometimes free) routes such as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VapbvTq8GOE&amp;t=483s"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Nose</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccPYyF-plQY&amp;t=9s"" rel=""noreferrer"">Golden Gate</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f13cti8iLsw&amp;t=157s"" rel=""noreferrer"">Zodiac</a>, <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/features/athletes/alex-honnold/most-dangerous-free-solo-climb-yosemite-national-park-el-capitan/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Freerider</a> and Salathé Wall. </p>

<p>But if you look for videos of people climbing Half Dome, or articles about ascents on Half Dome, you find almost nothing.</p>

<p>At first I thought that it is because most of the routes there are aid climbing routes, and aid climbing is not very fashionable right now. However, most of the routes on El Capitan are also aid routes, and many of them have been free climbed, so this explanation is not very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Is it because of the difficulty, i.e. is it much harder to free climb Half Dome (apart from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_Northwest_Face_of_Half_Dome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Regular Northwest Face</a>), or are other factors involved?</p>

<p>That rock is just so iconic, and it seems very strange that no strong climber is interested in it.</p>

<p><em>(I am looking from the factors that could explain why Half Dome is much less frequented than El Cap, possibly with facts to back up the answer, like interviews to climbers or statistics.)</em></p>

"What to do if someone gets impaled in the stomach?","<p><strong>Background:</strong>  This question is motivated by an accident that happened to my sister in a very rural area. She was on a fence and fell onto a t-post which basically impaled her, but which fell out by the time she hit the ground. (Details are gruesome.)  We padded the injury with some shirts and then basically panicked until we saw a helicopter. We signaled the helicopter, which landed; we put her on a tarp and transferred her to the copter, which flew her to a hospital 15 miles away.</p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong> We were lucky.  I've thought about this incident and wondered how a <em>similar</em> (not identical) incident could be handled far from help.</p>

<p>Assume you are in the wilderness. Phones are dead, you don't have a PLB, and if you walked out, help could not arrive in less than three days. You have a first aid kit and some other equipment that might be helpful, including but not necessarily limited to, gauze, hydrogen peroxide, pliers, scissors, fishing line, iodine, tape, and rope  You have a well set-up campsite and plenty of easily accessible food and water.</p>

<p>Your hiking partner gets stabbed through the stomach with a tree branch. The branch is still all the way in and is small enough so your partner can be moved. Your only options are to attempt to treat them or watch them die. What can you do?  What should you not do? What aid can you give before hiking out for help?</p>

<p>One commenter asked if the branch had splinters. Branches often do, but an answer that does not account for splinters could still be useful.  I chose <em>branch</em> instead of <em>generic object</em>, which seemed vague, and because my own experience, which was a t-post, would make the question too narrow.</p>

<p>It looks as foam from a chemical product or something similar. But there was A LOT of spots during long time in the whole sea, as far as I could see and during the whole travel.

"Possible snowy owl seen in the trees","<p>I was out hunting last weekend (end of October) near Yellow Pine, Idaho. While walking up a hill during the late morning with moderate timber coverage (thin enough to ski comfortably but thick enough to prevent grass from growing) I spotted a large owl sitting on a branch about 20 feet above the ground. It was really fun to see the owl. The owl was large (roughly 18 to 24 inches tall) with a white face. The feathers appeared to be white with light brown tips giving the bird a banded look. It had a large wingspan too at approximately 4 to 5 feet wide. We tried to take a picture of the owl with my father's cellphone but the picture didn't turn out because the bird was in the shadows.</p>

<p>This morning I turned to the internet for help identifying the owl. In this <a href=""https://idfg.idaho.gov/old-web/docs/wildlife/nongame/leafletOwls.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Owls of Idaho</a> resource the only owl that looks close is the Snowy Owl. The owl we saw seemed to have a wider/bulky body, and more dense brown banding. When I did a photo search on snowy owls I found a <a href=""https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/kids/photos/animals/Birds/Q-Z/photoark-snowyowl.ngsversion.1466006497813.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">National Geographic Kids</a> picture that looks much closer to what we saw. The owl in the NatGeo picture looks smaller than the bird I saw but that could just be a trick of the camera.</p>

<p>Normally I'd be comfortable declaring I saw a Snowy Owl since that NatGeo picture looked reasonably close to what I saw. My only lingering doubt is because we saw the bird in a moderately dense pine forest. All the resources I've seen on the internet state that snowy owls prefer open terrain. Here is a quote from the Owls of Idaho resource:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When snowy owls come south, they may be found on open ground (such as marshes, meadows or prairies)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/snowy-owl/#photoark-snowyowl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NatGeo article</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These large owls mainly live in the Arctic in open, treeless areas called tundra. Snowy owls perch on the ground or on short posts. From there they patiently watch for prey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like the terrain that I spotted the owl in doesn't fit with these descriptions of the snowy owl's preferred territory. Are there any other owls that can be found in Idaho that I might be confusing for a snowy owl? Alternatively are snowy owls known to frequent moderately timbered hill sides in Idaho instead of more open terrain?</p>

However, one of the more expensive climbing helmets, the <a href=""http://www.petzl.com/en/outdoor/mountaineering-and-climbing-helmets/meteor-iii"">Petzl Meteor III</a>, appears to have the same construction of a thin plastic shell over foam as the bicycle helmet.</p>

"What is the ultimate car camping bed solution -- for two people?","<p>I've been camping since I was a teenager in the scouts, and I've never really had a very comfortable night out.  As an adult with a girlfriend, 20 years later, I'd like to just throw some money at the issue and be done with it and have ourselves a comfortable bed for car camping.  (""Car camping"" meaning we will have the car next to the campsite and don't care about weight or size much.)</p>

<p>This Memorial Day weekend, we went out with a few other couples, and I don't think a single person had a successful sleep.  We brought a feather bed as an experiment and it was pretty terrible, feeling only slightly better than the ground (warm though).  Other people spent 30-60 minutes fussing with getting their air beds inflated, and then they leaked or went flat by the morning.

"Reacting to tornado warnings while camping with no buildings nearby","<p>This afternoon there was a tornado warning - TAKE SHELTER IN A PERMANENT BUILDING IMMEDIATELY - for the west half of Algonquin Park issued through the usual channels including <a href=""https://twitter.com/OntarioHazards/status/483663009412562945"">Twitter</a>. I believe by ""permanent building"" they meant ""not a tent, not a camping trailer, not an RV"". What we would normally call a building, but I guess they wanted to emphasize that whatever you're camping in does not count.</p>

<p>Algonquin Park is not what you'd call rich in actual buildings and it's trivially easy to get yourself hours of travel away from one. Just head off away from an access point and however far you've travelled, that's how far you are from the nearest building. Cell phone service is spotty inside, but let's say you have coverage and you're at a campsite, and you get this warning. Or perhaps you have no electronic help but you see a large dark rotating cloud like in <a href=""https://twitter.com/JeremyGlobalTV/status/483665010468474880"">this tweet</a>. Everyone says ""go inside"" but if the nearest inside is two days travel away, then what?</p>

<p>What do you do? There is no building to get into. Are you safer out on the water? Are you best off just going in the tent to keep dry (figuring that only a tiny stripe will actually get tornadoed, while the whole park will be rained on and have stuff blown around, and while the tent can't protect you from the latter, it can from the former) or is being outside able to see and run of any value? Should you at least pick up your emergency kit (I have a small belt pack I wear both ways on portages with a whistle, a little first aid, a flashlight, some matches etc and usually some food) so that you'll have it with you if everything else blows away? Should you move your canoe? Tidy the campsite? Try to put all your heavy stuff together and maybe tie packs to each other? Take the tent poles out to make the tent less likely to be picked up by wind? </p>

<p>What if you're in transit, on a lake or at a portage? Same set of questions I suppose but with less options. </p>

<p>Typical Algonquin geography: lots of large coniferous trees, rocky or sandy shores, lakes of various sizes, paths and trails generally leading back at least 50-100 feet from a shore, small clearings and open beaches for campsites, some small islands.</p>

<p>Things to keep in mind: if you're in your house and the house next door is destroyed by a tornado, you were very lucky. You have a roof, you possibly have power and water, and you have all the possessions that were inside at the time of the storm. Maybe you have a broken window. But if everything you owned was on the lawn at the time, and has blown away, you have no food, no shelter, no dry clothes etc. And if my canoe has blown away too, I have no way to leave my current location and have to wait for rescue. The severe thunderstorm itself could be as big a problem as an actual tornado. Since more of the park will get the severe storm, high winds, lashing rain, I would feel saving my ""stuff"" was a matter of life and death. Yet I don't actually know how to save my stuff. And I don't know if saving my stuff works against possibly saving myself. I'm beginning to think saving myself is impossible if an actual car-throwing, roof-ripping, house smashing tornado comes through my campsite, in which case battening down the hatches against merely high winds and stuff-ruination becomes a better use of my time. For example, I can't get more than 20 feet away from a tree unless I go out on the water, which is the worst place to go in a lightning storm. Cliffs, caves, overhangs etc are close to nonexistent in Algonquin.</p>

"What format should I use to report my location to emergency responders?","<p>Suppose I am out in the wilderness and an emergency arises.  I have an accurate fix on my location (from GPS, map and compass, astronomical observation, etc...).  I manage to get in touch with emergency services and need to tell them where I am.</p>

<p>But there are many different formats I could use to report my position.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Latitude and longitude in degrees / minutes / seconds</p></li>
<li><p>Latitude and longitude in decimal degrees</p></li>
<li><p>Latitude and longitude in degrees and decimal minutes</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system"">UTM</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>(And with any of these systems there is the finer question of which <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid#Historical_Earth_ellipsoids"">Earth ellipsoid</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_%28geodesy%29"">datum</a> my map or GPS is based on, which could make a difference of a few tens or hundreds of meters in the position; in dense forest this could make it considerably harder for rescuers to find me.)</p>

<p>Obviously I want to avoid any confusion; if I give my position in (say) degrees / minutes / seconds, and a helicopter pilot blindly types it in their GPS which is set to decimal degrees, they'll go to the wrong place (perhaps many kilometers away).  UTM is less ambiguous, but will they even know what that is?  I may be speaking to a dispatcher in an urban office, perhaps over a noisy and unreliable phone or radio connection, and that's hardly the time for a technical discussion of the fine points of geodesy.</p>

<p>So in short:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there a particular position format that's preferred by emergency responders?</p></li>
<li><p>Are dispatchers and responders sufficiently trained to understand the difference between these positions, so that I can use any format if I tell them which one it is?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there other general ""best practices"" for this situation?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose the answers may differ between different countries or regions (I'm in the US) or between land and sea emergencies (I'm usually on land).</p>

"Why shouldn't I buy an ultra light tent?","<p>I have a workhorse of a tent, an Alpine Meadows, (<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/5285/163"">described in this answer</a>) that I really like. We bought it 30 years ago, and at first we just had way more stuff than we should, and eventually we had two small children (and their stuff) in the tent with us. There were times when I read stories to five children at a time in that tent. But now, it has more space than we need. And it's 30 years old, and tent technology has really changed. So we're thinking of replacing it with a tent that weighs less and takes up less room in the pack. (We canoe camp primarily, and create extra bedrooms at a cottage every few years.) I understand I will have to give up something I really like about the Alpine Meadows: I can stand up in it, which makes dressing much easier. I accept that modern 2 and 3 person tents are all generally shorter inside, and I'll take that in exchange for the weight and the pack room.</p>

<p>Step 1: go to a 2 or 3 person tent instead of a 4. No problem. Step 2: enjoy the lighter materials even ordinary tents come in (<a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5027-673/mec-nunatak-3-tent/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>). No problem. Step 3: what about an ultralight (<a href=""http://www.mec.ca/product/5035-509/big-agnes-copper-spur-ul3-tent/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>)? Wow, one-third the weight of a regular tent! That's amazing. I'm ready to buy one but hang on, why do they still make regular tents? <strong>What's the downside here?</strong></p>

<p>I'm comparing floor area, peak height, and so on and don't see significant differences. I have several hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
<li>a tiny difference is huge. You can endure 1.2m peak height but not 1.12.</li>
<li>fabric thickness and material affects durability and I need to pay attention to the numbers and whatnot in that area</li>
<li>ultralights can't be 4 season (don't care: I never winter camp.)</li>
<li>there is some other important difference that isn't included in specs that keeps many people away from ultralights</li>
<li>the only difference is the price</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm really hoping it's that last one. At 30 years per tent, $600 doesn't seem like a big deal. But I worry that it's actually something else and I just don't know about it.</p>

<p>Here is what a tent is for on my trips:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep the rain off us while we sleep and provide a rain free refuge where it's possible to move around a little while reading, or to play cards etc</li>
<li>if it is cold (for a summer definition of cold) keep us warm. We have sleeping bags and clothes of course, and the very coldest we've ever camped was a morning we woke up to -1C. That is nowhere near the norm. The norm is 18C nights.</li>
<li>keep the bugs off us while we sleep, and provide a bug free refuge once in a while</li>
<li>guaranteed shade when I want it (I sunburn incredibly easily)</li>
<li>keep our stuff from blowing away when we are away from camp</li>
<li>provide a little privacy when traveling with others, whether to change clothes, or just to be alone for a while</li>
</ul>

<p>I would never consider a tarp-only or tarp-and-hammock setup. A tent to me is a place to put stuff and a place to hang out if the weather is bad, not just a place to sleep or a way to keep rain off me. There will be two adults in this tent. Also, we camp during high bug season - blackflies, mosquitos, horseflies, you name it. We never cook in the vestibule - we set up a kitchen tarp across the campsite. We keep lifejackets, empty packs, shoes, and coats in there. It's also a place to put your shoes on while you're exiting the tent, and to take them off while you're entering.</p>

<p>We're quite capable of carrying our current tent, but I won't deny looking forward to carrying 8 pounds less on every portage.</p>

"Selecting a rotary hammer for bolting climbs","<p>Setting up a (sport) climb, requires a good cordless rotary hammer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_bit_shank#SDS_shank"" rel=""nofollow"">SDS shank</a> compatible).  Besides the price-tag, things to consider, for selecting such a tool, are its <em>weight</em>, its <em>shape</em> and the <em>handling experience</em>.  Besides these, which make life easier while hanging on the wall, <strong>Which are the important technical specifications of rotary hammer machines?</strong></p>

<p>For example, <strong>how</strong> important and <strong>why</strong> are each of the following characteristics, for a drilling machine suitable for bolting climbing routes? </p>

<ul>
<li>Battery Voltage?</li>
<li>BPM</li>
<li>Rated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_per_minute"" rel=""nofollow"">RPM</a> (vs. actual RPM?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there scientifically sound references that explain their significance?</p>

<p>Last, but not least, are there important health and safety specifications that should not be overlooked? For example,</p>

<ul>
<li>Noise level</li>
<li>Vibrations on Acceleration</li>

"Compare running fitness to hiking","<p>I'm currently in the US for an internship and the idea of climbing Mt. Whitney appeals to me. 
I know you need a permit, but there is a good chance on getting one spontaneously. I know about proper equipment and I have hiking experience from the Swiss and French Alps, up to 13,000ft, but this is 2 years back.</p>

<p>However, I find it hard to estimate if I'm physically fit enough. The trip would be about 22 miles (in 2 days) and 12,000 ft. of elevation gain and loss, not to forget the thin air.</p>

<p>I regularly go running and do weight training. </p>

<p>Is it possible to compare stats from this to what is required to be able to do this hike? Say like running 15 miles in a certain time?</p>

"Water filters - why sand and rocks?","<p>Saw <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaAblon69sI"">a video on youtube</a> where some guy made a water filter out of a bottle, charcoal, sand and little rocks. He commented that since the charcoal is very porous it's great for filtering. Then, after constructing the filter he continued to filter some dirty water and commented that the first little bit is going to be nasty since its getting the dirt off the sand and rocks in the filter. </p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me, if the charcoal is so great, and all that the rocks and sand bring to the party is dirt, why not just fill the bottle with all charcoal? Not to mention that charcoal is much easier to come by than various grains of sand in a forest or a jungle or whatever.</p>

<li>If so, for which tours/organizations is it standard procedure to check your tour book first?</li>

"Can I preserve a freshly caught fish with a soft bag cooler?","<p>I am currently in Denmark without access to a car. During the weekend I use the bus to go to some remote coastal place in order to fish. It takes 1 hour to reach that place. I carry one rod with me and some food/tackle inside a backpack.</p>

<p>Because coolers are really heavy to carry by hand, when I catch a fish, I release it. However, sea trout is really tasty here in Denmark, so I would like to be able to bring one with me back home.</p>

<p>From what I read online, the best way to preserve a fish is to gut it immediately and throw it in a cooler packed with ice. Another option is to keep it alive as long as possible, but the fish will have to die before I leave, which means it would have to be dead inside my backpack for at least an hour that I need to reach home.</p>

<p>To me it sounds that I need to buy a cooler no matter what. The weather these days is 15C/59F. I usually spend 5-6 hours fishing. Could I preserve my fish fresh by buying one of these bag coolers they sell online, for example <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00314DM6Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>?</p>

<p>Has anyone tried these types of bag coolers before? How was your experience? What other options do I have?</p>

"Which altitude profile and height is optimal for Everesting by hiking?","<p><a href=""https://everesting.cc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Everesting</a> is an activity where the goal is altitude gain of 8848 m or more by repeatedly going up and down a selected route.</p>

<p>This is most often attempted by biking; however, hiking/running is practiced too. The whole process takes 20-30 hours; however, the time seems to be less important than the feat itself.</p>

<p>I would like to understand how to choose a route which makes this possible.</p>

<p>The rules (described on the <a href=""https://everesting.cc/run-rules/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">site</a>, but I added a few of my own) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Total elevation gain, 8848 m</li>
<li>Only natural scenery: no roads or stairs</li>
<li>No bicycles, chairlifts, buses, etc; no abseiling</li>
<li>Must travel the same route back and forth repeatedly</li>
<li>No sleeping</li>
<li>Resting, eating and drinking are allowed; no restrictions on resupplying along the way</li>
<li>The spirit of the challenge implies that your route should be mostly altitude gain, followed by descent on the way back - not a ""10 m up, 10 m down"" type of trail</li>
</ul>

<p>So I wonder, first of all, which elevation gain is best for one leg of the challenge (assuming I can find any route I want, within reason)? I imagine that 3 times 3000 m would be inconvenient because of temperature differences, and 89 times 100 m would be a burden for the brain. What other factors should I take into account?</p>

<p>Also, which altitude profile should I use? Make it too shallow and you should travel a big distance; make it too steep and it becomes hard to go down. Should the angle be uniform, or is it better to have flatter sections along the steep ascent?</p>
"
"Etiquette of playing musical instruments on popular hikes","<p>I enjoy hiking, but I'm not very well-versed with the general expectations other people have about noise, especially serious hikers. I generally do trails that take between 3-6 hours, usually up hills/mountains (depending on your definition) on the Appalachian Trail. Often those trails are popular enough that if it's a nice day, I'll see another group every 10 minutes or so, and if there's an overlook at the top there may be a good 8-15 people up there at any point, usually a mix of casual hikers like me and others just passing through on their way up/down the Appalachian Trail.</p>

<p>Some of the groups I've gone with enjoy singing while hiking, or while resting at the top, and a couple of times I've brought an instrument (clarinet) along, to play both during the hike and at the summit. I do enjoy playing like that, but I don't want to bother people unnecessarily; I don't really have a good understanding for how far the sounds carries, or how other hikers, especially serious ones, feel about the music. </p>

<p>Let's assume that the instrument is being reasonably well-played (i.e. gentle tone, not squeaking/squealing, with not so many missed notes as to be distracting), because otherwise I'm sure the answer can't be anything besides ""Please stop"".</p>

<hr>

<p>Is there any general etiquette or expectations about playing/making music on hiking trails?</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm also linking <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4633"">this</a> tangentially-related question on whether playing musical instruments while hiking is sufficient to keep away animals.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Well, this was more contentious than I was expecting; answers range from ""Hearing music on the trail can be enjoyable"" to ""Don't even make a sound"". I appreciate the feedback from the people of the latter opinion, and I am not ignoring their statements.</p>

<p>Surely, though, there must be a balance, between allowing people who don't want to hear anything that would betray the presence of humankind in the area to enjoy themselves, and allowing people who like music (or especially, in my case, the feeling of playing gentle music in nature) to enjoy themselves as well. At the least, if I play again, I will endeavor to remove myself or my group from other people, to ask anyone nearby if they mind, and in any case to not play for long.</p>

<p>Regardless: if anyone (in the last year) hiked past someone playing snippets from hymns, Disney, and Broadway on a clarinet in the Shenandoah Nat'l park, and found it annoying, I apologize.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT 2, in response to close-votes:</p>

<p>The question was about etiquette - a set of arbitrary, (at least originally) opinion-based, rules that are followed by a majority of people. It's inseparable from people's opinions, but surely it's a useful thing for new hikers to learn. </p>

<p>""Does mild vinegar taste good?"" is hardly a useful question for a stackexchange. ""Do most people enjoy drinking vinegar?"" is an important question for a new chef to know the answer to.</p>

"What is this black and yellow-striped caterpillar with four toothbrush-looking tufts of hair along the top?","<p>A friend found this caterpillar while hiking in the woods on <a href=""https://www.wachusett.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wachusett Mountain</a>, in Central Massachusetts, United States, in the first week of September. It was on a fallen log under the leaves of a deciduous tree, but she didn't know the exact name of the tree. She only saw one. It appeared to be just over an inch long. It was close enough to touch, but she didn't want to in case it would sting or cause skin problems.</p>

<p>I've never seen anything like it! </p>

<p>The most unusual feature is a row of four white fur-looking tufts growing out of its back not too far from the head. I used ""tufts"" for lack of a better word since I don't know the real term. They look like toothbrushes to me! </p>

<p>The body has black and yellow stripes. It has some small yellow circular areas on the black stripes. </p>

<p>The head is bright red with tiny black eyes. There are also a few bright red spots on the back toward the tail. The two antennae are black, and the tail is brown. </p>

<p>Pretty much the entire caterpillar is covered with white furry-looking spikes, including some in the front of the head that look like whiskers. There are black spikes dispersed along the body. These are longer and there are fewer of them than the white ones. There are no spikes coming out of the tufts.</p>

"How safe is a chest harness when used without a sit harness?","<p>How safe is it to use a chest harness without a sit harness? I ask this question because of an experience I had while on holiday.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago I was in China and hiked/climbed HuaShan (see this <a href=""http://www.chinanomads.com/deadly-hike-huashan/"">link</a> for some info/pictures). This is basically a hike but with some very steep sections protected by chains. The most dangerous (but optional) sections are cordoned off and, to access them, you are provided with what seemed like a chest harness by staff - I found a photo of one <a href=""http://www.tripchinaguide.com/public/upload/photo/mount-hua/img_707_d20140521102200.jpg"">here</a>. Would a harness of this kind be effective in the event of a slip/fall? I'm not sure; naively I'd have thought that a fall could leave you in an awkward position from which self-rescue would be impossible, or you could even slip out of the harness??</p>

<p>EDIT: thanks for the responses. Some more info about the specific situation at Hua Shan...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Until a few years ago there was no safety equipment whatsoever, despite the fact that this is an extremely busy route with access seemingly regulated by the authorities. I guess that China is not well known for its high standards of health and safety. </p></li>
<li><p>The harness photo doesn't tell the whole story; there are also some very steep (almost vertical) sections - the first link contains some photos which hint at these sections.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not 'real' climbing - it is, however, a spectacular example of a situation where the use of wooden planks and pieces of iron has allowed access to terrain which would otherwise be considered a very highly graded and exposed rock climb.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people would probably be happy to follow this route without any protection. However, I think that many people would prefer to have some level of protection on the route. I'm just concerned that the protection provided may offer only a false sense of security.</p></li>

"Safety in re-slinging old trad gear","<p>I have read some posts here regarding the expiration dates of climbing material, especially trad gear. Friends and nuts (as all climbing equipment) have a lifespan of 10 years according to all manufacturers, but I believe the expiration dates of some pieces are longer than our own lives. This is the case with friends, nuts and hexes: there are no parts that should change a lot in time, and even less if you're climbing in mild environments (away from salt water, ice that has a very low pH, etc). Regarding friends, the only part that should be substituted is the sling, and many manufacturers ask you to send old equipment to them so that they can re-sling it for you.</p>

<p>The point here is that climbing is a major (since last week, olympic) sport now, but 60 years ago it was an unorganised niche of potential suicides. There were no companies that would do that for you: people would build hexes and nuts out of old bathroom plumbing, and would sling them with chords and cordelettes. Modern climbing material still teaches how to re-sling old trad gear or build belay cordelettes, which means tying mainly the water knot or the double (ot triple, etc) fisherman's knot, presented below. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xX203.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xX203.jpg"" alt=""The water knot""></a></p>

<p>Now, keeping in mind people have used both of those knots in climbing for the last century, it's hard for me to believe they aren't safe. I've read that the impact of a hard fall would be enough to ""melt"" something and then bla bla, but I didn't find any evidence of that on the web. In fact, I think it might be possible to prove that this sentence cannot be true. I have some gear that I have re-slinged with the water knot and it has been catching me every day (this doesn't mean it works, I just might have been lucky 200 times in a row).</p>

<p>Now, does anyone have any evidence of re-slinged material or any of those knots failing?</p>

There's also a type of flock, exhibited breathtakingly by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling"" rel=""noreferrer"">starlings</a>, which is called a <a href=""https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/s/starling/roosting.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">murmuration</a>. It's a group of literally thousands of birds flying in magnificent and unique patterns.</p>

<p>I took the picture below over a lake in Rhode Island, United States, recently. The geese had just taken off and were flying in some side-by-side V-shaped groups. As they got farther away they gathered into smaller, tighter, individual V-shaped groups. Of course I've seen this behavior before, but on that particular evening, as I watched these geese leave the area, I began to ponder it more deeply. </p>

<p>Why do some birds fly in a V-formation? Is it just a random pattern or is there a reason for it?</p>

"Camping on top of a mountain","<p>I have experience in backpacking but have no climbing experience. I am trying to learn how to camp on top of mountains after class 2 or 3 climbing. My motive is to take sunrise and sunset photos. After tons of research, camping on top seems to be the only way to avoid climbing at dark. I know there are many other things I need to learn. So I am looking for some help. I want to use Mt. Agassiz as an example, as it is the first one I am going to attempt.</p>

<p>My biggest concern is lightning and thunderstorm. How do you guys minimize the risk? I know thunderstorm is common in summer afternoons. Should I absolutely avoid camping on top in summer? For the tent, I have Hilleburg Nallo 2 and Big Agnas Copper Spur 2, for my wife and me. Are they suitable for this kind of camping? I know it is hard to find a flat space on the rocks and talus. I am open to buy something new if it is necessary. From weight standpoint, I do not see that bivy has much benefit as two bivys weight might be close to my Copper Spur. Also should I expect high wind at night?</p>

At the moment I am getting a bit obsessive about getting them out of the plastic bags as soon as we arrive at a new hotel. If there's a deck or balcony, I put them out there. It is helping a little.

<p>Next to the path was a group of mature trees, the largest of which was a maple, with various sizes of smaller tree trunks intertwined among them.  In some of the groupings, the narrower trunks are wrapped around the wider sections. Their barks vary, and none have leaves.  One has fur, but only at higher elevations. Our picture of that is at least 8 feet up a maple tree. I didn't get too close to the bases, but as the pictures show, some appear to be growing sideways directly out of the ground. Although the area is draped in vines, we couldn't find leaves attached to any of the trunks, with the exception of the large maples. They have lots of healthy foliage, but only above the area where the intertwining ones end.</p>

"Using a Girth Hitch in Alpine Draws","<p>I've recently started making my alpine (or ""trad"") draws by girth hitching one end of a sling to the gear side carabiner and then clipping and passing the rope side through as usual. The girth hitch makes it easy to lengthen the draw one handed as all you need to do is unclip the two loose loops from the gear side carabiner and the sling will lengthen automagically. </p>

<p>Its a technique I learned from a german mountain/climbing guide friend of mine. Personally I think it's a lot easier to lengthen the sling than the standard way of making alpine draws. The knot reduced the runner rating in half, but since there are two strands , its back to the UIAA standard of 22KN, well above any forces seen in lead falls on intermediate pro (not to mention the ratings on the pro itself). </p>

<p>On a recent trip a climbing partner pointed out that the girth hitch can induce horizontal forces on the carabiner, and if the hitch slips ""up"" the carbiner it can even load the gate and slide off.  Which got me to reexamine my alpine draw technique.</p>

<p>Just to demonstrate, (not my image), the way a girth hitch looks on the biner. The two loops have a slight tendency to slide up the two sides of the biner if the knot isn't loaded/tightened (I make sure to give it a yank when placing).</p>

<p>I'm asking from the perspective of the person who wants to plan such a camp and the menu on it.

Garlic stimulates the immune system, which in such situation is very important.</p>

"Drinking water while standing vs seated","<p>I have heard people suggesting to drink water when you are seated after a tiresome activity. They usually ask to avoid drinking water while standing upright.</p>

<p>Does that have an actual scientific reasoning, or is just baseless advice?</p>

<p>You could slam me for it being easy to google, and I have googled for it. But when we talk about trekking, climbing, swimming, cycling, etc... its a different situation. As a trekker or cyclist I'd be mad at me sitting periodically to get a sip of water.</p>

"What are directional, height, and distance guidelines for marking trails?","<p>Generally, I'm more used to methods described <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_blazing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for the US.</p>

<p>Our task this past weekend was to use dots to remark a trail, but the method of placement was opposite to what I'm used to: the dots were placed inward toward the path - only one dot.</p>

<p>I questioned the wisdom of such placement, but the ranger was adamant: one dot placed facing the trail in a perpendicular fashion.  He affixed the first marker to be sure his point was made.</p>

<p>So he seemed to be following advice more or less offered <a href=""https://survivallife.com/mark-trails-like-pro/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Is there ever a good reason to place markers facing the trail, rather than facing the direction of walk?</p>

<p>What about height and distance - how far apart should blazes be posted?</p>

"At what angle should an ice screw be screwed into the ice?","<p>Recently we were climbing up a glacier with the ice at an angle of around 80°. We were placing the ice screws angling slightly upwards with respect to the slope of the ice wall. </p>

<p>However, one from our team, who stays in Norway said that the screws should always be angled downwards such that the weight is taken completely by the threads of the screw and not by the ice patch surrounding the ice screw. Apparently, this is how he was taught by a guide while climbing up a frozen waterfall.</p>

<p>For us, it felt natural to angle up the ice screws so that in case of a fall, the screw held on to the ice (similar to angling the pegs of a tent away from the tent). The claim that the weight of a fall should be taken completely by the ice screw and its threads seems a bit risky to me.</p>

<p>So is the claim correct? What's the general practice? Does the practice vary for a waterfall climb (as damaging the ice there could potentially lead to a whole slab of the waterfall falling off?)?</p>

"What is the energy difference between green and seasoned fire wood?","<p>I know from personal experience that greenwood (freshly cut) does not provide as much heat energy as seasoned wood (has been down for 6-12 months).

<p>Is this normal, and something that wouldn't happen if I jumped to standing position as I caught the board - you're not supposed to surf these boards lying down after all - or does it indicate some other issue with what I'm trying to do?

"How can I clear spiderwebs in my path while hiking?","<p>I went hiking this weekend in a national forest on trails that see little use. In parts there were many spiderwebs crossing the trail - sometimes full webs (which I could usually, but not always, clear before passing) and sometimes just a few strands of silk between trees, which were nearly impossible to see depending on lighting conditions.</p>

<p>After a couple times getting spiderweb to the face, I started waving a stick in a figure-8 pattern around eye level every so often and when I suspected there may be a web (for instance, foliage sticking in on either side of the trail). This helped mostly on the full webs I found, but I still kept running into random strands, which made for a very unpleasant hike.</p>

"Camping stove with plane allowed fuel","<p>Is there a camping stove that works with fuel you are allowed to take on a plane?</p>

<p>Often I fly somewhere without possibility to buy any fuel for my stove after landing. In those cases I take an Esbit stove with me. The Esbit tablets are not allowed on a plane, but don't stand out when going through the scanner so they almost always pass without a problem.</p>

<p>However, illegal is illegal and I would feel better having an option that will not get confiscated when detected. Does such an option exist?</p>

<p>I realise that there is a very bad fit between the words ""flammable"" and ""airplane"", but hoped that someone knows an option that I didn't think about. </p>

<p>Border condition: regular commercial flights where you have to go trough a security check at an international airport. Liquid fuels and camping gas are usually mentioned in the pictograms with forbidden objects. The time that my Esbit tablets were caught the discussion was over when the flammable icon on the package was spotted.</p>

<p>Problems that I've encountered with gas/diesel:</p>

<ul>
<li>I usually depend on public transportation. A pump is often not exactly within walking distance of the airport. Especially troublesome if you have a limited connection time to get the bus or train.</li>
<li>Pumps often don't like filling my small bottle. They want a minimum amount (usually solved if you pay for that minimum amount) and I've had cases where filling a metal container was not allowed. I've solved that by buying a bottle of some drink, drinking it, filling the bottle and pouring from drinking bottle to fuel bottle.</li>
<li>Messy to get rid of the remainder when flying back. The best way to do that would be another question.</li>
</ul>

<p>By taking my fuel with me I basically want to eliminate a factor that is largely out of my control, not always predictable and a potential time sink. I often fly somewhere for 2-4 days and then you don't want to burn that time running errands.</p>

"Machine Washable Sleeping Cot","<p>I am looking for a machine washable sleeping cot (metal/aluminum frame off the ground). I have seen that most cots are made out of a water resistant material (nylon/polyester/canvas) 600D. I have seen that most cots are not listed as specifically machine washable; there are a few but they do not meet other requirements (price, size, color, height). If it matters, I am looking for an XXL. Most of my searches for ""machine washable sleeping cot"" return results for dog mats. To be clear, I am not talking about a washable ""sleeping pad"" that can go on top of the canvas.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does water resistance affect machine washability? I guess I've washed plenty of water resistant synthetic material before, but these may not be the same.</li>
<li>If it does not say machine washable, are there coatings or other reasons why Nylon/Polyester/Canvas 600D base material cannot be machine washed?</li>
<li>Is it more likely that a cot not listed as machine washable will be designed such that it might be too  difficult to quickly remove the nylon material from the frame? Or do they know people will possibly want to wash them?</li>
<li>Are there any modular options, wherein the nylon portion is not dependent on the frame, and can be purchased seperately depending in needs, mixed and matched, etc.</li>
<li>What has been you experience machine washing these types of products?</li>

<p>*Not sure if people are allowed to suggest products or manufacturers. The most promising appears to be the Teton Sports Outfitter XXL, but it is not listed as machine washable. Yes, I can contact the company myself.</p>

"Recommended ascents for the improving mountaineer","<p>Considering a high level of fitness, but limited mountaineering skills (some indoor climbing, a few via ferratas and high altitude hikes), what hikes would you recommend as training (and perhaps some acclimatization) for the ascent of Mont Blanc? Ideally they would be in easy/affordable reach from London (via Geneva, Venice, Zurich) and would provide similar technical challenges but perhaps at a lower altitude.
The last high altitude hike was painful between 3500 and 5000 meters. After that the diamox kicked in :)</p>

<p>The question was aimed at suitable routes that will provide the training to build the necessary experience. The area where I lack the experience is the use of crampons/glacier hikes. The tour would be guided.</p>

<p>Edit: the comments have proven that this question was misworded, so let me try again. What short trips would you recommend for the novice/improving mountaineer in order to build up the necessary skills to tackle more challenging peaks? The focus is on safely acquiring the technique, rather than physical training. Shorter (1-3 days) treks would be preferred, and so would the travel accessibility.

"Restoring water repellency in leather hiking boots","<p>I have a pair of leather boots that are a couple of years old. They were fairly expensive and I'm not a big fan of discarding and replacing things so I'm hoping they can still be of use to me. The problem is that the boots leak through the leather.</p>

<p>The sole seems well sealed and I recently had a cobbler apply a new layer of glue at the sole to ensure this wasn't the issue. I believe the problem is the leather because my feet become wet after an hour or so of hiking in wet conditions and there is little to no beading of water droplets on the surface - the rain just soaks in.</p>

  looked at the country far below us … we nibbled Kendal Mint
  Cake.'[this quote needs a citation] </p>
  
  <p>A member of the successful Everest expedition wrote – 'It was easily
  the most popular item on our high altitude ration – our only criticism

  <p>Mint cake was provided for the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of

<p>And goes on to identify those countries, of which Germany and it's neighbor Czech Republic are both listed. (<em>presumably this is consistent across all of Europe, not just these two Countries</em>)</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> if you look at the individual countries on the CDC site such as Germany or the Czech Republic it says,</p>

A crossbow arrow <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow_bolt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(<em>quarrel or bolt</em>)</a> is supported by the barrel of the crossbow so can made lighter just by making it shorter. Different materials and options (i.e. arrow tips) can also result in lighter weights.</p>

<p>What is the lightest arrow/bolt practical for target practice?  </p>

<p>If I am not worried about penetration (killing power) is there any arrow weight that is to low? i.e. is overly susceptible to cross winds or travels so fast that it creates safety issue?</p>

"What do surf report terms like ""fading WNW swell"" mean?","<p>I'm confused about whether these headings refer to the direction of the source of the wind/swell, or the the direction they are blowing into. My understanding is that they are talking about the source.</p>

<p>For example, this morning's Surfline report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fading WNW offers up head
  high-overhead surf to good exposures... Winds are steady N-NNE now, adding a bit of texture
  to unsheltered breaks...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My interpretation of this is that there is a swell COMING FROM the WNW (so it's actually heading towards ESE?) and that wind is coming from N-NNE,(so the wind is actually blowing TOWARDS S-SSW?) Is my understanding correct?</p>

<p>Also, on the left column in Surfline, it describes the following, along with a logo of an arrow. The arrow is POINTING at the direction that the wind is blowing TOWARDS right? Whereas the text (NE 42) is specifying the direction the wind CAME from right?</p>

"How to get started with packrafts?","<p>I love hiking and I'm starting to love longer cycling trips too. I've done combined cycling/hiking trips (cycling to the trailhead of a hike). Last summer I met someone who carried an inflatable raft on his bicycle, as well as hiking equipment. Ever since, I've been thinking of the unprecedented possibilities of such a combination. However, I've never done any packrafting (nor other kinds of water-navigating, though I can swim well).</p>

<p>How much skill and experience does it take to use a packraft (with or without a bicycle)? My intention would be to use it on lakes and sheltered fjords, not on wild streams. However, it can be windy on lakes, and the lakes in question are quite cold (usually 4°C), so it's not without danger. Is it fine to get started by simply reading info from books, websites etc. and get on the raft, or should one really start with a proper course in safety?</p>

"When do I need a permit to go into nature?","<p>When on holiday, I want to get as far as possible from civilisation — the furthest I've come is seeing only a single cairn during a full day. In Scandinavia, hiking and camping is permitted unless explicitly forbidden (the <em>right to roam</em> or <em>allemansrätten</em> in Swedish). In most of western Europe hiking is allowed, camping by default is not (but may be tolerated under circumstances).

"Is it normal for a double skin popup tent to leak in slight rain?","<p>About a year ago I was given a three person dual skin popup tent. Almost new but possibly a factory second.</p>

<p>(It's made by ""Vango"" and I think it could be a ""reject"" because one of the four guy ropes is not attached to the tent and looks like it didn't get ripped off but was never attached.)</p>

<p>Anyway it's a great tent and I have used it on a grassy area, properly pegged, in reasonably solid rain with 3 people and luggage with minimal wetness.</p>

<p>But now I'm camping wild at the beach and water has made it into the tent twice, always from one of the corners.</p>

<p>When I first set it up on the beach instead of trying to use the pegs I weighed it down with rocks inside between the inner and outer skins. (The standard pegs are not heavy duty enough for dry sand and windy conditions and I was too lazy to use sand-filled plastic bottles instead of pegs.)</p>

<p>Another factor is the sand was on a bit of a slope so I dug down a bit at the back and used that sand to build up the front, thus making the area flat but the rear is a bit like a trench and also it's not a perfect fit for the tent. Some corners are a bit outside the flat part and the rocks between the skins could slide down a bit, especially when there's some rain, wind, or both.</p>

<p>When I added the tent pegs and guy ropes after the first storm, because they weren't very deep, I dug down a little so the pegs would hold better, put a rock on top to weigh them down, and covered them with a pile of packed sand. In some places I may have heaped a bit of sand over the lower edge of the tent wall too.</p>

<ul>
<li>Were the rocks between the skins the cause of rain getting in at the corners?</li>
<li>Or possibly the imperfect fit in my dug out slope?</li>
<li>Or possibly having some sand piled on the tend walls? (not much)</li>

<p>I already checked the packs in stores, breathability is an expansive feature. Somehow this seems to be very similar to the Hardshell jackets market. You get very cheap rain- and windproof stuff but when you want breathability it gets expensive. When you additionally want a durable item, it gets high-end. </p>

So I need it as a rescue item for mountaineering/alpine tours and I am thinking of using it for planned overnight-stays. You are right though, I won't start right away to do this in winter.

"Using Gri Gri 2's Carabiner with Another Belay Device?","<p>I've been using an AustriAlpin autolock carabiner with my Gri Gri 2 for around 9 months, a few times a week (1 to 3 times). It's a very solid, robust and big carabiner, which means that's not too smooth in Gri Gri's hole, but IMHO, it's way far from being retired. I had been told that if a carabiner is used with a Gri Gri, it should never ever be used with any other device. I do understand the concerns, but I've been googling this, and checking Petzl's site as well, but I don't see any evidence on that.</p>

<p>Now my issue is that I have just bought a Mammut Smart Alpine and a Grivel auto-locking carabiner. I love this Grivel, and I like the Mammut Smart as well, because it's smoother for lead belaying, yet has some assisted braking in it.
However, there are two issues with this set: </p>

<ol>
<li>Grivel biner [despite being labeled as <em>red</em>] is pinkish purple with a gold gate, where Mammut Smart is gray and red. The color isn't matching and I'm a bit annoyed at this!</li>
<li>It's somewhat curved on the wide end which means that Smart can't fully sit in it. I haven't tried them yet, but I feel like the Austriaplin biner fits Smart better, and then I won't have the color mismatching problem!! (though the set will be heavy again (I don't mind it for indoor use, but I still do like to use this Grivel!)).</li>
</ol>

<p>Any clues on this? Shall any biner used with a special belay device, marry it and stay with it forever?</p>

"A method to retrieve a carabiner","<p><strong>I saw this a few times, years ago</strong></p>

<p>I met some guys who were top roping next to us in Jackson Falls, IL 25 years ago who showed us a method of retrieving your top carabiner(s) when you were done top roping.</p>

<p>They attached the rope to the 'biner in a strange way AND I seem to remember some para-cord being used to pull on and the 'biner would just 'unsnap' from the anchor and come down, on the rope maybe?</p>

<p>Does someone recognize what I'm describing?</p>

"Using Gri Gri 2 as a Self Belaying Device","<p>The other day I was so desperate to go climbing, but I couldn't find a partner, so I ended up self belaying after googling and watching <a href=""http://youtu.be/8AnpN3gSho8"" rel=""noreferrer"">this video</a>. I did check Petzl's site to learn that modifying Gri Gri and self belaying using it is prohibited. </p>

<p>I'm not a crazy, careless climber and when it comes to safety, I try to be as cautious as possible. I searched and read several threads on the topic, but yet, I'm not convinced why this isn't allowed. </p>

<p>Now a bit more detail on what I did: similar to the video, I tied myself in, and then attached the other end with Gri Gri to the belay loop. I only climbed a few really easy routs, so that I could be certain I can hold myself up while taking the slack, and did make knots in several points as I ascended. </p>

<p>I understand that Gri Gri is not an automatic device, but I have also never seen it failing (at least with the 9.8mm&lt; ropes), and I also try a few small falls and they were fine, too. </p>

<p>I wouldn't make this a habit to practice all the time, but I'm wondering what the issue is with it, with the added knots on the way up? If it fails (no!), the knot will stop it, right?</p>

<p>P. S. I would not dare to do this outdoors, but only indoors on easier route on that I badly want to climb and there's no one around!</p>

"Why would fatigue cause fever?","<p>I've already experienced this twice.</p>

<p>The first time was a year ago, on a hiking camp: on the first day I recklessly went out with one of the best groups there, and while I didn't lag behind, this was very exhausting. On the second day I had to stay in guesthouse due to moderate fever and vomiting. On the third and subsequent days, however, I was fine and could resume hiking, however I was choosing less advanced groups.</p>

<p>The second time was yesterday. I went out by foot to visit two neighboring towns, after spending a year with hardly any physical activity. This took nine hours of walking, still I succeeded. In the evening I again had moderate fever.</p>

"Hiking uphill, two choices of trails: how to deal with each one?","<p>There are two trails leading to a beautiful spot in a nearby park. One of them has a steady climb all the way (trail A) while the other has some sharp climbs followed by relative level segments (trail B). Start an end points are the same. Sunlight and wind exposure are also the same.</p>

<p>The distance on the map for both is around 2mi and differ by only a few yards (A is longer). I've walked both several times and to me it seems that I always end the hike more tired after going through trail A.</p>

<p>So, a few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it common for the steady climb trail to be more tiresome than the sharp climb with level segments one?</li>
<li>How should I deal with each type of trail in order to lessen the exaustion? What techniques can I use?</li>

"How much flotation does a canoe need?","<p>Yesterday for the first time I turned my canoe over, then I <strong>tried</strong> to get back in it.  I have been thinking about adding a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9362/outrigger-and-or-leeboard-when-sailing-a-canoe"">sail to my canoe</a> and now that I know a bit about sailing, I know I need to plan on being able to right the sailing canoe and get back in it.  So I took the canoe to the lake to practice self recovery (solo) with just an empty canoe.</p>

<p>I have a 17 foot two person plastic canoe <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9256/how-to-tow-a-canoe-with-a-bicycle"">as seen in my answers to this question</a> it has built in flotation at both ends. With the canoe empty, just me in a life jacket and a wood paddle.  It turns out will float the canoe <em>just barely</em> if the canoe is full of water it floats until I get in. The flotation will not support me and the canoe, I was sitting in the canoe floating by my life jacket with the canoe 2 feet under the surface.  When I get out  it surfaces with the sides just breaking the surface.  </p>

<p>There is a cool video of a guy doing solo recovery <a href=""http://www.solwaydory.co.uk/videos/19"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">at Solway Dory</a>, but he is in a smaller lighter canoe, I think he is wearing a dry suit, and he has added side flotation. I watched that video before going to the lake to try it myself.</p>

<p>Real life me and my canoe (big &amp; heavy). I can't throw it and have it land empty! (no surprise) Best I can do is turn it over slowly which results in it being half full of water when right side up.  I was not able to get back in without filling it the rest of the way with water. </p>

<p>Later I took the canoe to shore emptied it and a couple of attempts to get back in the canoe when it did not have water in it.  By this point I was tired, and could not make it happen.  I know it is possible, but it is difficult, if I could not do it in warm water while a bit tired, I don't want to bet my life on it in other scenarios. In sailing class I was easy able to get in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunfish_(sailboat)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sunfish</a> without difficult, but that is a very different boat. </p>

<p>When people take canoes white water rafting they add <strong>A LOT</strong> of flotation (image below), essentially the canoe is all flotation except room for one person.  At that point you might as well get a kayak, what is the point of the canoe? All it holds is you and flotation. </p>

<p>So I want to add some flotation, at least enough so that I can get in over the side as long as I have enough strength to turn it back over.  Optimally enough so if I am caring <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/6948/how-to-carry-a-bicycle-in-a-canoe/9255#9255"">my normal load</a> or if I have a sail I can get it upright and get in. I don't want to fill it with float bags.  The point of a canoe is that you can put a lot in it.</p>

<p>How do I decide out how much flotation I need, and where it needs to be? </p>

"Is rope-soloing inherently dangerous, and if so, why?","<p>I've never tried rope-soloing and don't have a very detailed idea of how it's done. But reading the 2015 edition of Accidents in North American Mountaineering, I was struck by how many accidents happened to people who were rope-soloing. My impression is that only a very small percentage of climbing is done using this technique, so the number of accidents would be disproportionate, suggesting that it's either an inherently dangerous activity or maybe one that a lot of people do incorrectly. On the other hand, it seems like a technique that could be useful for self-rescue, for example if your partner gets hurt.</p>

<p>How should I go about my first week long trip in terms of distance, each day?</p>

<p><strong>My draft plan:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Wake up and do my morning routine</li>
<li>Hike from 7-noon (5hrs = ~20km with my ~40lb (18 kg) pack big pack)</li>
<li>Take an hour or two break for a main meal</li>
<li>Hike until 5pm or so (~4 hours = ~10-15km)</li>
<li>Set up camp, small nightly meal for energy and soak in the sunset.</li>

"Has a person ever got rabies from a marine mammal?","<p>I just saw this 2009 article <a href=""https://www.popsci.com/science/article/2009-12/can-whale-get-rabies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Can a Whale Get Rabies?</a> which includes this statement,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although there is absolutely no record of a rabid whale, and only one documented case of rabies in a seal—a ringed seal caught in 1980 in Svalbard, an archipelago off Norway—the scenario may soon be of greater concern. ""Starting 10 years ago, coyotes began to prey on harp seals here on Cape Cod,"" Moore says. ""Because of that, I like for my staff to get vaccinated. There's a very small chance that a seal will have rabies.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem that there is a vector for rabies to cross oceans and potentially infect land mammals, slight but plausible...  It has been nearly 10 years since the article.  </p>

<p>Is there any documentation of a person getting rabies from a marine mammal? </p>

"Use normal urban jacket for skiing/snowboard","<p>I am new to snowboard. I am not yet prepared to spend a lot of money on it. I know a special jacket for skiing is better but won't it suffice to just use normal urban jacket for skiing in the beginning? </p>

<p>Is a normal cheap non-specialized jacket that bad for this activity?</p>

<p>I'm going to a ski resort at about 1,600 meters.  Last time I was there, it was unnaturally warm in Winter with about -1C temp. But I can't predict weather next time.</p>

<p>To answer one of the comments, I was going to go for a snowboard rather than ski, but itsn't there no difference? I have never heard of jackets made for ski or snowboard specifically.</p>

"How should I walk or hike barefoot?","<p>I've been some months reading as much as possible about walking biomechanics, and unfortunately I haven't found too much information or usually contradictory information. Usually everything is focused on running biomechanics.</p>

<p>This is the information I've gathered from different resources:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Head should look forward, ear over the shoulders, even though in some resources they say you should lean forward a little bit to let gravity move you forward.</p></li>
<li><p>There should be counter rotation movement from the arms, but it should come from the upper thoracic cage, not from the shoulders or arms. Some resources say the arms should move at all.</p></li>
<li><p>The abs should be slightly activated keeping the lower back still, always in the same position. </p></li>
<li><p>The motion should be initiated with the gluts, which should push forward. Each side of the hips moves to allow a bigger stride while the gluts are holding the weight.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QS4ph.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QS4ph.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ol start=""5"">
<li><p>The knees should land with the knee straightened but not locked. Some resources say you should land with them bent.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not important how you land with your feet, you should let that the foot adapts to the terrain. </p></li>
<li><p>The external side of the foot should should be parallel to the other side, making the toes point forward. But some resources say it's ok to have them pointing outward. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some things I've realized by walking barefoot from 2min to 2h a day during one month after a metatarsal fracture:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think that the heel should stay longer in the floor than what I used to do. Having a shortened calf doesn't allow the whole range of motion of the leg to have a stride long enough, that makes me put too much weight in the ball of the feet too soon. I think, as opposed to running, we should keep always some weight in each foot, and before rolling into the forefoot is important to already have some weight in the other foot.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't know and can't find what's the utility of the 4 little toes. I used to have some kind of metatarsalgia between the second and third metarsal and I realized that I was  griping the floor a lot while walking causing hammer or claw toes. After a while trying to relax them and training myself to stay on one leg without using the toes that pain stopped. I don't know if I was using them to get stability in the foot instead of using other muscles in the foot or leg. I'm aware of the big toe windlass mechanism, but I'm not sure it is also applied to walking. </p></li>
<li><p>Should we extend (dorsiflex) the toes before landing?</p></li>
<li><p>How much width should there be between our stride, I've seen in some website that we should walk with our bigtoes touching the same lines, but in some other running resources I've seen that there should be a bigger gap, between 10 to 20cm.</p></li>

<p>What do you think about this points? Which one are ""correct"" and which one are ""wrong""?. Any other important aspect? I know this depends a lot on how the terrain is and a lot of things, but let's say I would like to know about the biomechanics walking in a flat hard surfaces with some backpack (under 10% body-weight) and the priority is to walk a long distance minimizing the risk of injury, and I don't want to rely on any kind of shoes as shock absorber.</p>

"Are there any natural materials that can work for a ""fire roll"" friction fire?","<p>I have seen a few videos of people using an interesting friction-fire technique, and a couple of them called it a ""fire roll."" To do this, they fluffed up a cotton ball, put something in it such as ashes, rolled it up in their hands into a worm-like strand, then they very vigorously rolled it back and forth between two wood boards. It did not take long at all, looked fairly easy, and they got a fire started. </p>

<p>While this is cool, it was done with household items (2x4, cotton balls). Is it possible to transfer this technique to wild foraged resources? Obviously, use split wood that you collect instead of 2x4s, and use the smoothest wood you can split so it doesn't catch. But what about a cotton ball substitute? And the ashes that were put into the cotton ball to provide increased friction? </p>

<p>Yes, ashes we can grab from a previous fire if we have had one, but it would be nice if we can find a substitute for that too in case you have not had a previous fire.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any natural resources that can be foraged that can be used in a ""fire roll"" friction-fire technique?</strong></p>

<p>The cotton ball replacement is the most important part of this question. And yes, I know that cotton comes from a plant, but I am not sure if this will work with raw cotton, and cotton does not grow in the north. Also, it would be preferable, though not necessary, if we could get an affirmative answer that lists a general way to process many plants to do this.</p>

"Is a Tanto or Utility knife best to carry when mountaineering?","<p>I have been mountaineering for about four years now and one of the things I have learned is how important a good knife really is.

<p>My real questions is: for mountaineering which is mostly kitchen work, cutting rope, plants, other small objects, and in a survival situation killing and skinning an animal would a Tanto or Utility knife be a better option?  </p>

"How to inspect climbing bolts?","<p>I am most interested in setting up a top rope anchor on 2 bolts side by side.

<p>Are there any non-obvious things to look for when inspecting a climbing bolt? </p>

<p>If a bolt is placed very close to the edge of a corner of rock, what proximity is considered safe? I am thinking of some climbs where the bolts are literally only a foot from the top of the cliff - could the combination of the bolts shear off a piece of the rock?</p>

<p>At this point I don't know what animal it is, but presumably it can be either a brown bear or a wild boar. Maybe a wolf. Not sure if its possible to differentiate between them without seeing it, just by the sounds of walking, broken branches.</p>

<p>I also don't know exactly how close is the animal to the tent, and if its thinking about charging the tent or not.</p>

<p>The main question is: do I stay in the tent, or go out to investigate / pepper spray, try to scare the animal off? If staying in the tent is preferred, keep quiet, or make noise? </p>

<p>Obviously if I am to go out, I would make noise, but if I stay, should I keep quiet, hoping to make the animal think that the tent is just an uninteresting, inanimate object? I have no food in the tent and changed my outer clothing after cooking, so I have no reason to believe the animal will find my smell interesting. Unless un-brushed teeth after eating meat some hours earlier may be a problem (no meat residue in the teeth).</p>

<p>Assuming the only things I have are: pepper spray (260 gram / 9 oz can, Sabre or UDAP) and a flashlight. No guns or anything like that.</p>

<p>The territory I am asking about is Europe, where there are brown bear only (no black bears), but they are not Grizzly, just European brown bears. This is for example about Scandinavia or Carpathian Mountains.</p>

<p>This is NOT about Russia and super-hungry bears in Siberia, this is a territory with relatively available sources of food, like fruits on trees around, so the animal would not be so desperate for food to seek humans as prey.</p>

"How do you take field notes at below 0 °C, without freezing fingers?","<p>I'm taking inventory on my tree farm. The temperature today is -7 °C with a light breeze. Windchill of -10&nbsp;°C.</p>

<p>I figure that there are lots of people who have this problem. Writing a journal, describing observations, and so on.</p>

<p>How do people who work in the outdoors take field notes, or write things down?</p>

<h3>Additional information.</h3>

<p>The problem is NOT the writing implement -- at least so far.</p>

<p>The problem is fingers being too cold to function.</p>

<p>Here's what I've done so far:</p>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong>  Partial protection for writing hand. I've found I can wear a fleece mitt liner and still write.</p>

<p><strong>Issues</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fingers still get cold, but I have about 15 minutes per session between times I have to thaw out fingers. This is the current solution. It's between 1/3 and 1/2 the normal speed of taking inventory, plus more frequent breaks and job shifts.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong>  Clipboard and pencil</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>While I can wear a mitt on the clipboard hand, bare fingers quickly go numb writing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong> Used my iPhone with dictation enabled.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Only will record 30 seconds at a time, then you have to touch the mic button again.</li>
<li>Transcription is ragged: Count becomes account, 4 becomes for 2
becomes 2. But not consistently.</li>
<li>The phone shuts down when the battery gets cold. (About 20 minutes at -7&nbsp;°C)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong> Just make an audio recording.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hard to review.</li>
<li>Phone still has cold problem.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach</strong> Keep moving to stay warm.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I do this. But it's more of changing jobs to warm up. Go mulch trees with gloves on while fingers thaw, scout for firewood, play with the dog, and go for coffee.</li>
<li>The plot is about 8 acres (3 hectares) — 400 feet (120&nbsp;m) wide by 800 feet  (240&nbsp;m) long. I have 20,000 trees in that space more or less, ranging in size from 3 inches (8&nbsp;cm) to 15 feet (5&nbsp;m). Counting is a lot of 'museum pace' strolling, combined with standing. (The step counter on my phone says I do between 8,000 and 15000 steps a day. Inventory days are on the low end of this.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Approach</strong>  Write the message out in snow, then take a picture. (<em>added in response to one answer</em>)</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cold temperatures don't always occur with snow cover.</li>
<li>Snow cover is cluttered with tractor, sled, deer, and dog tracks.</li>
<li>On an overcast day, contrast between letters and snow is limited.</li>
<li><p>Amount of text for each block is a bit much for a medium such as snow. Go outside and write with your gloved hand:</p>

<p>HGE17 AshMtnCard 216  7'-9'  T15 80%</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That's my abbreviation for Block Haida Gwai East, lot 17, Cardinal columnar mountain ash, count of trees present, height range of 7 to 9 feet (2 to 2.5&nbsp;m), pot size of nursery trade 15 gallon (60&nbsp;l), and fraction salable. The information is dense. You will note in the pix below that even a day after the snow, it's not a blank canvas.</p>

<p><strong>Approach:</strong> Take a series of photographs, then work at the house with the pictures.</p>

<p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Counting is difficult.</li>
<li>Height estimate is difficult.</li>
<li>Species identification in a broad picture is difficult between some pairs.  E.g. white spruce and balsam fir, high bush cranberry, and amur maple.</li>
<li>If taking multiple pictures of a row, identifying the overlap point is tricky.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a popular question, and there are good answers here for people with various similar problems.</p>

<p>Normally inventory takes about three afternoon sessions of 3-4 hours. During that time I move a few feet between blocks for a block estimate, or walk the length of a block once for each species for a mixed block, or walk a block twice stopping at each tree for a tallied block.</p>

<p>Here are samples of what I'm inventorying.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YeLrf.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YeLrf.jpg"" alt=""Block of 720 mixed spruce, pine, larch, fir, maple""></a></p>

<p>I grow in mixed blocks. This decreases pest problems, and often allows pots to be spaced closer. This block is a mix of spruce, larch, birch at this point.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wNtU.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wNtU.jpg"" alt=""Amur maple, balsam fir, high bush cranberry""></a></p>

<p>Further up the block, both birch and fir are still present, but the other two species are amur maple and high bush cranberry. Can you tell me the heights of each?</p>

"Designing a sustainable and portable high-energy diet","<p>I need some help designing a diet for extended multi-day treks which is <strong>sustainable</strong>, provides <strong>high-energy</strong> but still remains somehow <strong>portable</strong>. For some reason my efforts so far were not very successful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example: I recently did a part of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR_20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GR-20</a> in Corsica. Admittedly, it is a rather hard alpine trek including a lot of ascends and descends (easily 1600m a day) - and we did our route completely independent of resupplies, meaning 20kg packs. But in just 5 days me and my friend lost 2kg weight each, even with a diet <em>of more than 4000 calories a day!</em> This is clearly not very sustainable (however great it might be to lose weight in some situations).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We brought:</p>

<ul>
<li>porridge with lots of sugar for breakfast,</li>
<li>pastas with pesto/olive oil/mayonnaise for lunch,</li>
<li>pasta for dinner (various sauces)</li>
<li>chocolate, peanuts and sunflower seeds as snacks</li>
</ul>

<p>The obvious thing to do seems to be to just cram in even more calories per day. But there is really a limit on how much you can eat and still be able to do a fairly exhausting activity afterwards...</p>

<ul>
<li>Even eating 'just' 4000 calories a day requires you to stuff your face with sugar, starch and fat at almost every possible moment. (Ever tried eating 1kg of pasta in one day? :P)</li>
<li>Food makes for the largest share of the pack weight by far. Unless one starts living of fat alone 4000 calories mean 1kg of pasta <em>per day</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I'd appreciate your advice as to how I can design a diet which allows for a sustainable trek over longer periods of time.</strong></p>

"Is using ultralight gear possible without sacrificing safety, comfort, or skills?","<p>I recently came back from a 17-day backcountry hike.  At the start of the hike, my backpack was 28 kg.  At the end of the hike it was around half of that or a little bit more.  I'm fine hiking with 20 kg, but 28 kg is rather heavy.</p>

<p>The first couple of days of my hike I was wondering: is it possible to significantly reduce the mass for a backpack for a long hike, without compromising on safety or comfort, or requiring substantially more skills?</p>

<p>I have a big backpack, a strong tent that is light but not superlight, a solid stove…  The details are really distracting from my point.  I'm not looking for advice on my gear specifically, but more asking in general: hikers who migrated from “traditional” light but-not-ultralight backpacking gear to ultralight, minimalist gear: do you find that it is in any way less safe, less comfortable, or requiring more skills?</p>

<p><sup>
Some examples of my gear, along with alternatives:<br>
I've tried an ultralight tent in the past (Big Agnes) and it felt far less weather-proof than <a href=""http://gb.hilleberg.com/EN/tent/red-label-tents/akto/"" rel=""noreferrer"">my Hilleberg</a>.  When I got stuck in an <a href=""http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/overnight-storm-dumps-10-cm-of-snow-on-calgary-leaving-30000-without-power"" rel=""noreferrer"">unseasonal winter storm</a> in the Canadian Rockies in 2014, I was very happy that I had a tent I trusted.  Apparently, some people use single-roofed tents or even no tent at all, but I've never seen either in the wild.  I spend most nights in treeless areas.<br>
A sleeping bag with less mass than my Haglöfs Goga Pro is inevitably going to be less warm, so it would compromise both safety and comfort.<br>
My <a href=""http://www.haglofs.com/de/en/Backpacks-and-Bags/LEX-110/p/240000.2C5"" rel=""noreferrer"">backpack</a> is 110 litre and was full at the start of my hike, so with a smaller backpack I'd have to attach stuff to the outside.<br>
All my food is freeze- or air-dried and if I eat any less, I lose even more weight than I already do.<br>
Any alternative to my <a href=""http://trangia.se/stormkok-trangiakok/stormkok-serie-25/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Trangia stormcooker</a> is going to be harder to operate in bad weather.  I've often seen people struggling even in moderate 10 m/s winds, whereas I've never failed to light my stove.  Of course, I would survive without hot food.<br>
I bring a GPS receiver, camera (optional), headlight, and satellite phone.  Apart from the camera they all improve safety.  I enjoy my GPS receiver and camera.<br>
I hike in areas where I'm never more than 10 minutes walk from drinking water, and have no need to carry more than 0.5 L of water at a time.<br>
I use a dedicated <a href=""http://www.fishersdirect.com/vision-folding-wading-staff-3086-p.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">wading staff</a>.  I don't use trekking poles, but wouldn't trust them for wading.  I ford on average 1–2 streams/rivers per day, usually knee-deep.<br>
I do use some ultralight gear, such as my <a href=""http://www.qiwiz.net/trowels.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">trowel</a>.

"What breed is this very large, black, turtle/tortoise found in the Northeast United States?","<p>My husband found this very large turtle (or tortoise) crossing a road from an industrial park towards a wooded area. It was in June, in Massachusetts, USA, at 8:00 in the evening. He didn't touch it, just walked alongside to make sure it crossed safely.</p>

<p>The prominent features are as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>Very hard shell, primarily black, with some dark brown areas</li>
<li>Approximately 18 in, (45 cm) long, and 15 in (38 cm) wide, not including head or tail</li>
<li>Tail at least 8 in (20 cm) long </li>
<li>Very wide feet with long toenails</li>
<li>Head sticking out only a few inches</li>
<li>Pointed upper part of mouth</li>
<li>Low rounded shell</li>
<li>Serrated edges, especially on back of shell</li>
<li>All body parts wrinkled and bumpy </li>
</ul>

<p>I've heard that one difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that turtles fully immerse themselves in water, whereas tortoises spend most of their time on land, and drink at the edge without swimming. I'm not sure if that's true. My husband hasn't gone into those woods, so he doesn't know whether or not there's a pond or other body of water nearby.</p>

<p>What is the breed of this gorgeous creature? Is it a turtle or a tortoise? I'd also like to know some other things, such as approximate age; preferred diet; nesting habits; best place and time of year to see them; conservation status (some turtles in Massachusetts are protected or endangered); and any other interesting characteristics.</p>

"What's this knot called?","<p>I came up with this variation of the flat overhand knot <em>(also known as the Euro Death Knot)</em> for pulling ropes on a rappel.

"How do I calculate how much lift an outrigger needs?","<p>I have been thinking of putting a sail on my canoe with will probably require the use of an outrigger. <em>(related: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9362"">Outrigger and/or leeboard when sailing a canoe?</a>)</em>  I was thinking about using a section of PVC pipe as an outrigger, <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/pipe-water-content-volume-weight-d_1734.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this reference</a> indicates a 4 inch pipe will hold 0.653 gallons of water per foot weighing 5.44 pounds, a 5 inch pipe will hold 1.02 gallons at 8.50 pounds. Every pound of water displaced is a pound of lift. The farther out you place the outrigger the more leverage is applied, but at the same time it applies more strain to the arm that connects the outrigger to your vessel </p>

<p>The first image below could be considered two outriggers with a sail between them. At this point my mind spirals out of control with all the variables. If the base was wide enough they would not tip, but then it would require stronger cross bars, which would add more weight...</p>

<p>Many of the off the shelf out riggers for canoes, only have a couple feet long arms with volume of a couple of gallons, but if you see professional sea going outriggers they have much larger volumes with much longer arms (second image).  </p>

<p>What are the basic things I need to consider and how do I calculate how much lift I need from an outrigger?  I am planning on inland water (river, lake) sailing, so will not be at the extremes in the images, but I want to understand the principles required to keep the canoe from tipping over, and keep away from putting to much pressure on the outrigger. </p>

<li>Should one use Aspirin in high altitudes? </li>

<p>I heard that the decreasing oxygen level in the blood will cause the body to produce more (and bigger) red blood cells if you acclimate properly. This thickens the blood, to get it thinner a drug like Aspirin could be used. But also drinking a lot helps. Still, disguising headache and therefore the major sign of acute mountain sickness (AMS) might be a drawback.</p>

<li>minor woodworking (firewood, skewers, replacement tent pegs/pole) </li>

"Grigri+ vs grigri 2","<p>I just got a sample of Petzl's new assisted braking device, the Grigri+. I must admit I look at it with a lot of disdain, mostly because</p>

<ol>
<li>It's bulkier than the Grigri 2;</li>
<li>It's heavier than the Grigri 2;</li>
<li>The possibility to choose between lead and top rope modes adds a new mechanical component, which should pretty much weaken the system;</li>
<li>It has almost no ear to grab when using Petzl's recommended belay technique;</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, the device has very clear advantages over its predecessor:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stainless steel reinforcements to high friction areas;</li>
<li>Added anti-panic handle;</li>
<li>Internal components made of a different, higher friction material - this makes it possible to build a larger chamber, which should (in principle) decrease the friction when paying out slack;</li>
<li>Casing improved in order to cover the whole interior of the brake - this should keep dirt out;</li>
<li>Petzl finally addressed a <strong>very</strong> serious problem with Grigri2: the stupid, sharp, wrongly placed casing's tail;</li>
</ol>

<p>I need to decide whether or not to sell the device without using it, otherwise the price will fall down - and I'm the first among my friends to have one of these, which means I can't just borrow one and test it. I've read multiple reviews, but everyone's just praising the device and the criticism is mostly expressed as ""this brake is made to  help beginners, and its functions should make the life of someone who just started to climb much easier"". The thing is that an anti-panic handle, lead and top rope modes and stainless steel reinforcements mean pretty much nothing to me. What would really make me choose to keep this device are advantages 3 and 5: if it's really much easier to pay slack with this thing, and if it wears the rope less, then I'll keep it. All disadvantages are really important to me, specially 3 and 4.</p>

<p>Check the picture below. Notice how the back of Grigri2's casing (right) was smartly substituted by a new chamber design on the Grigri+ (left)... But notice also how the area to place your finger has disappeared in the Grigri+ (you can't see it in this picture, but the small orange button to place your finger is flat and not very anatomical).</p>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>I find it simply hard to believe that if I never got frostbite at -25 Celsius, that 5-10 degrees more would be enough to cause it</li>
<li>Is -25 some kind of biological threshold or something ?</li>
<li>For longer walks(>1 hour), I usually start using gloves&amp;hat below -12-15 and a lambskin fur coat (below -18 C), though front half of face is obviously uncovered.
But that's the part of body which is 'trained' for cold the most, no ? </li>
<li>Doesn't the face's frostbite threshold move further, because that part of skin is frequently exposed to cold ? Or it doesn't really work that way ?</li>
<li>Perhaps there's a difference between ""1. Real -35 C"" and ""2. Windchill -35 C"" that's making this confusing?</li>
<li>Not sure if important to this, but there's a larger river right next to our village (hence the ""lake effect"")</li>
</ul>

<p>Around 3am tonight (at least according to weather.com interpolations) the windchill should be around -30 F, which is about -35 C. I'm gonna stay up and walk my Husky (who, btw, isn't really bothered by these temperatures) then to see for myself.</p>

<p>I would appreciate your input to either of the questions, thanks!</p>

<p>EDIT1: It's 3.30 am, but the -30F is now moved to 9am, so no luck...</p>

<p>EDIT2: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are my [non-scientific] observational findings/opinions from the
  experiment of spending 45 minutes at -33 C (-27 F) Windchill at 9.30am
  yesterday:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The thermal face-slap when walking out of building was strong, but definitely far from the worst ones in past (like that blizzard), which to me confirms you also really need a proper base air temperature (air  was only -15F (-26 C) after all). It did provide a proper ""lung bite"" though as breathing was a notch more painful</li>
<li>My current gloves/hat combo cost $15 at a local HW store, so it should be obvious how well it [does not] protect against cold compared to the pro gear</li>
<li>The gloves are, however, very good at gauging the temperature, as the time when my hands get cold inside is , empirically, linear to the temperature</li>
<li>At -33 C, my hands got really cold inside under 5 minutes</li>
<li>After 15 minutes I did a bit of exposure - 12 minutes of no gloves and taking picture of the very interesting [NatGeo-worthy] river fog phenomenon. It was pretty painful the whole time</li>
<li>fingers got totally white within few minutes</li>
<li>After 12 minutes I put on gloves and walked for another 20 minutes</li>
<li>I also noticed there's a surprisingly huge difference in perceived cold between walking right on the river bank and walking, say, 10 minutes away from it, between the houses. That [very] local river humidity in the air, that beautifully frosts all the twigs and branches on the trees by the river, makes quite a strong difference at -33 C, though. Much, much stronger than under -25 C</li>
<li>When I got back home after 45 minutes, it took about another 15 very painful minutes for my fingers to regain the full dexterity so I could work on computer. Right hand took slightly longer as I got carpal tunnel there (it's also much more sensitive to cold than the left hand)</li>
<li>Face was alright (other than the slight pain) - I was periodically touching it with gloves to check (as per the recommendations I received here below) - like I said, I don't really care if I freeze to death, but sure as hell don't want to walk around face-disfigured (with stage-3 necro chunks of skin)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it turns out after all, that those 5-10 degrees more [base point being at -25 C], are indeed just that : few degrees more and not really a big deal for a short exposure. 
Of course, on a mountain or on a multi-day tent hike, it'd be a whole different story...</p>

<p><em>Moral of the story</em> : <strong>Ignore the [triple-facepalm-worthy] bombastic local weather alerts</strong> filled with overly dramatic TV tone (""OMG ! SNOWMAGEDDON !"") and really - just use common sense. If it's 5-10 degrees more, it really is just 5-10 degrees more, duh !!!</p>

<p>For much of the video, especially the beginning, the bird doesn't seem to be moving its head, but the body is moving back and forth on the reed. Even when it moves its head a bit, the body still appears almost independent, and its feet don't move from their original position.  </p>

<p>I initially thought it was fake, that the picture of the head had been manipulated to stay still while the body moved, at least for parts of it. It's obviously real, though, but I still don't understand the mechanism.</p>

<p>How does a Kingfisher literally sit on that tiny moving reed without moving its head, and why? Is it asleep? </p>

"Down is escaping my jacket, especially over a wool sweater","<p>I recently bought a down jacket and noticed that some down is leaking, especially if I am wearing a wool sweater underneath.</p>

<p>Everytime I wear my jacket with my (dark, which makes the down very visible) wool sweater, I notice anywhere between 20 and 50 filaments stuck on my sweater. I assume this is because of static.</p>

<p>The jacket is not 1 month old yet. Is it normal that I still notice some leakage from now and then (even when not wearing wool underneath)? Do people not usually wear wool with down jackets?</p>

"How should I dress for sweat inducing activities in cold weather?","<p>I never seem to find the perfect way to dress for sweat inducing activities in cold weather. By sweat inducing activities I mean mostly activities in the mountains, especially hiking uphill or ski touring. By cold weather I mean weather that would normally require a jacket, or at least a thick jumper. If that is too wide of a description, let's say I mean between 0°C (32°) and 10°C (50°F).</p>

<p>What I normally do is choose materials that breathe well. So no hard shell or puffy jacket, but instead some sort of warm fleece hoodie or a windstopper. Naturally, I avoid anything made of cotton, and use (technical) synthetic clothing instead. I make sure to cover my neck, as I am much too prone to getting throat colds and similar problems. I also make sure to bring warmer clothes for later, and a change of t-shirt/long-sleeved shirt that I wear as a base layer.</p>

<p>All this effort seems to work just partly: I am still sweating more than I would e.g. in summer. At the same time I am still getting cold when a cold gust of wind catches me. </p>

<p>Is there anything else I could be doing/doing differently? Are there some magical technical clothes that I am missing?  </p>

"What should I consider when planning my first multiple-day hiking trip on hills?","<p>I just relocated from north Germany into the south of Germany.</p>

<p>Last weekend I went hiking for the first time and visited the top of a hill close to Heidelberg. It was spontaneous and I was fascinated, and surprised by the time it took me (mostly because all was so new and exciting, but still).</p>

<p>From the highway driving with my car I can see that the hill I just hiked on is connected in a chain with other hills. Since I really enjoyed my first hiking trip, seeing the hill chain made the idea arise to hike along that chain for a multiple day trip. </p>

<p>I'm used to walking for longer distances a few times, even up to like 30KM on kinda even areas, but I've never done a multiple day trip in a hilly area. </p>

<p>My problem is, I never did something like this before and don't know anyone who did a trip like this before (or at least no one I am aware of having done it). All I could figure out myself so far that I would absolutely need to take with me would be warm clothing, a tent, a sleeping bag and of course provisions.</p>

<p>I am planning to start on a Friday morning/noon and be back in Heidelberg in the afternoon/evening of Sunday.</p>

<p>Now I feel quite sure that what I considered so far will be too little preparation for a 3 day trip, and probably cause me to abort my trip earlier.</p>

<p>Also I feel like there might be dangerous situations I could be facing that I'm not aware of, and have no idea how to prepare for them yet.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Doing such a trip alone, as described above, what are the mandatory items I should have with me to be able to finish my hiking trip? And what are the situations I should definitely be prepared enough to face, either because they happen often enough that it is good to know about it, or situations that are dangerous enough that it would be careless to not be prepared for it?</p>

"Best practices for physical and inventory management of a ready pack/bug out bag","<p>Hopefully this is acceptable. I figure this could be relevant as my bug out bag is essentially what I would bring on a camping trip (first aid, fire starters, some food, shelter materials, mess kit, survival knife, cordage, etc.) but my 'camping bag' is more of a stand-by for emergencies. So you can use substitute ""bug out bag"" with ""camping pack"" if you feel so inclined.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>

<ul>
<li>How do you manage larger survival bags?

<ul>
<li>Since I don't use it every day and don't really have time to drill with it or whatever people do, I have an Excel spreadsheet so I can remember exactly what I have and where it is (not to be used in an actual emergency)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also looking for improvements to current design (I know what works for some, may not work for others)</li>
<li>Noticeable flaws with my design? (aside from complexity)</li>
<li>Is it generally better to have a modular system (such as mine) or multiple packs for different purposes? Money is a factor else I'd have seperate bags (24 hr, 72 hour, camping, urban get home, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>It's supposed to be a general bag, mainly a 72-hr SHTF pack but can also double for camping. </p>

<p>In my spreadsheet, I have info such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Categories and subcategories (e.g. Water: Purification or Water: Storage)  </li>
<li>Brands/Models/Description/Features/Directions (e.g. Snugpak Jungle blanket, 24""x36"" rated to 36 deg F, polyester, compressed to 6""x6"")  </li>
<li>Item weight (in 0.00lbs) so I can track the overall net weight of the bag (using a postal scale)  </li>
<li>Expiration dates if applicable and a field that tells if item should be replaced soon (I have set to 90 days), plus another sheet that notifies if items expire within &lt;1 year, &lt;6 months, and &lt;90 days which I aim to compress to one spreadsheet</li>
<li>Item $ cost (for personal reason)</li>
<li>Location within bag (I'm reworking this but maybe have a picture of the bag with each compartment labeled by a number, maybe with a color and buy the colored dots used for yard sales to I know where each item goes)</li>
<li>Retailer (with link if applicable) where I purchased said item (for replacement or additional feature descriptions</li>
</ul>

<p>A bit overkill but so far works. Does anyone else do something like this? Aside from not doing it, and I know most people don't do this, I'm looking for improvements/alternatives to make it easier.</p>

<p>My Current Setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm using two bags: A 5.11 Tactical RUSH 24 main bag with the RUSH tier system attaching a 5.11 MOAB 10</li>
<li>Bags are attachable to each other to create one large pack</li>
<li>One bag is more of a 24-hr pack, the other is a compliment to make it into a 72-hr pack</li>
</ul>

"How to tie nylon straps to trees of unknown diameter","<p>When outdoors with my hammock, I prefer to set everything up with a pair of nylon tree straps. It gives things a more secure feeling and I've heard it's better for the trees too since the cordage won't be biting into the bark.</p>

<p>The trouble is I am at times confronted with trees that have a diameter that does not match the length of the nylon straps. That is to say, after I finish wrapping around the tree my end loops are spaced apart a lengthy, cumbrous distance from each other. And if I ratchet-back a wrap, the end loops are closer of course, but the straps dangle down too much. That makes the subsequent hammock setup process more difficult than it needs to be. No matter what knot/fold voodoo I try to invoke on the nylon straps, nothing seems to help. It's supposed to look something like this (note that the end loops are very close to each other, this is ideal):</p>

"When should I avoid geotagging?","<p>I did not use to think of geotagging photos as a leave-no-trace issue.  In fact, one slogan says <em>leave only footprints, take only photos</em>.  Yet the <a href=""https://lnt.org/blog/new-social-media-guidance"" rel=""noreferrer"">Leave No Trace</a> Social Media Guidance states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tag thoughtfully</strong> – avoid tagging (or geotagging) specific locations. Instead, tag a general location such as a state or region, if any at all. While tagging can seem innocent, it can also lead to significant impacts to particular places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This to avoid visitors loving nature to death (see <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/20/national-parks-america-overcrowding-crisis-tourism-visitation-solutions"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Crisis in our national parks: how tourists are loving nature to death</em></a>, The Guardian, 20 November 2018)</p>

<p>I tend to quite successfully choose to visit places that get very low visitation, yet are quite spectacular.  In 2017 I hiked for 2 weeks on Iceland and met only one other hiker.  In 2018 I hiked for 10 days in central Norway/northern Sweden and met no other hikers.  Also in 2018, I hiked all day along the Grand Canyon North Rim with canyon and river views, yet I met no other hikers.</p>

<p>In all cases, I have uploaded geotagged photos on the internet without giving much thought about what the potential impact my geotagging may have.  I tend to quietly assume that places that are quiet now will be quiet later.  Am I inadvertently threatening the solitude of the beautiful and quiet places I have visited, such as Lónsöræfi, Þjórsárver, Kinnarodden, Fajana de Franceses, Ljusfjällskåtan, Glenthorne Beach, or Tuweap?  Or are they likely to remain quiet in any case, with visitors flocking in ever greater numbers to more famous places in the area instead?</p>

<p>Some places are already so busy, that I can't think that my geotagging will add any visitors (such as Lofoten or anything within a 10 minute walk from the road in a popular U.S. National Park or Monument).  Other places are so remote and quiet, that I can't imagine they'll ever be busy (remote corners of Laponia WHS come to mind).  Yet other places have strict visitor limits in place already, so an increase in popularity will only lead to more disappointed tourists (I've experienced that only in the USA and Canada, but it's being discussed in parts of Iceland, although not in any place in Iceland I've hiked).  But perhaps there are also places where I should be more careful in advertising their beauty?</p>

<p><strong>What criteria should I consider in whether or not to geotag photos online?</strong></p>

"Does the male or female Emperor penguin incubate their egg, and for how long?","<p>I've been told that the only place Emperor penguins live is Antarctica.

"Is it practical to tap a tree for syrup on an overnight stop?","<p>We have a couple of questions about the legality of and how to tap trees to get sap.  Tree sap is the source of sugary syrups like Maple or Sycamore.  The sap can then be evaporated over a fire to leave a high sugar syrup (i.e. Maple Syrup).</p>

<p>While the process is not complex, it takes a lot of time and a lot of sap.  If you want a cup (<em>8 fluid ounces, 0.25 liters</em>) you would need 40+ cups of sap (<em>2.5 US gallons, 10 Liters</em>).  Additionally for Maple and maybe other trees as well, the sap is best for making syrup during certain times of the year, where particular weather patterns are occurring.  </p>

<p>Assuming you have packed all the required implements with you, if you stop to camp for the night, could you tap a tree (<em>or three</em>) as you are setting up camp, and produce syrup for breakfast, before hitting the trail again? </p>

"Tactical Folder vs traditional knife patterns for EDC","<p>A lot of knife owners who have carried pocket knives for 30+ years talk very fondly of the traditional patterns, like Barlow, stockman, etc. However when it comes to explaining exactly why they carry their old knives over newer styles, it usually comes out something like ""sometimes you just want a plain old fashioned knife,"" or ""they don't make 'em like they used to.""</p>

<p>I'm trying to come up with a reason why they keep saying that (and there must be a reason right?), but here are the only advantages I can see of an old fashioned pocket knife:
1. Build quality/finish
2. Availability of carbon steel blades, if that's your thing. </p>

<p>Whereas a modern ""tactical folder"" design like the one I currently carry (which at 2.5"" blade is decidedly non-tactical in reality) has several advantages:
1. Pocket clip
2. 1-hand opening with thumb stud etc. 
3. Easy cleaning inside the open frame
4. 1-hand closing with liner lock and other blade locks not found on traditional knives
5. Screw assembly allows for easy disassembly if required, or re-tension of the joint if the blade gets loose</p>

<p>In order for me to switch to a traditional knife pattern I would have to find somewhere to carry it, in a belt sheath or at the bottom of a pocket that's already full (I carry a leatherman and flashlight as well), and getting the knife out and opening it would take 2 hands. I love the classic looks of the wooden scales and shiny bolsters, but my knife is a practical tool, and utility comes first. I'm not trying to start an argument, but there has to be something about old folders that I'm missing. Can someone clue me in?</p>

<p>And lastly, let me be clear: this is for everyday use around the home and office, opening packages, cutting threads, paper, food (I once at an entire steak with nothing but my EDC knife because that's what I had on hand and nobody thought to bring knives/forks), etc. I'm not planning on skinning game or surviving in the wilderness with my EDC knife. </p>

"Is clipping directly onto a dyneema sling safe?","<p>I was recently doing a scramble route in North Wales. We needed to get past a large rock spike, though easy climbing, it was quite exposed and not a good place to take a fall. As a safety backup I attached a long dyneema sling over a large spike and clipped this directly onto my harness. This was more confidence protection than anything as the move was straight forward. </p>

<p>We did this for speed, we did have a rope but didn't want to spend the time getting it out, etc. just to pass a relatively small section.</p>

<p>It occurred to me afterwards though that maybe this wasn't such a great idea. There was nothing in the system to really absorb any impact. The fall onto the sling would have been minimal (maybe 1m).</p>

<p>Are there any problems with attaching a sling directly onto your harness like this? We didn't use a crows foot or any other knot. Just a sling and one carabiner.</p>

"What to do if the second seems stuck and absolutely no communication is possible?","<h2>Backstory:</h2>

<p>A few months ago, I experienced the following situation: We (two people) were climbing the last pitch of a multi-pitch route. Near the end, there was a cave-like chimney. Basically a chimney where the opening was narrower than the chimney itself, and the whole thing getting narrower towards the top.</p>

<p>When I lead that pitch, I had no problem going up, noticing that I had to leave the chimney because the top opening was too narrow for my helmet, downclimbing a meter and continuing on the outside. When I was belaying the second, she got stuck inside the ""cave"" because of her backpack with no way of going up, down or out. The whole situation looked a bit like this (left: side view, right: front view):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wecd0.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wecd0.png"" alt=""Situation""></a></p>

<p>Our problem in that situation was that we absolutely couldn't communicate (cave roof between us, open sea to the back, so no echo), and I had no way of knowing what was happening down there. She finally solved the situation by letting go, falling for at most half a meter and then (with great difficulty) wiggling out of the cave. If I had known that she needed to be lowered like 1-2&nbsp;m, the whole situation would have been solved in a minute, but like this, it took like 15. </p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>While it worked out fine in our situation, what is the generally recommended way of handling a situation where the second seems stuck and absolutely no communication is possible? Also, what would have been the appropriate reaction of she hadn't been able to move?</p>

<p>This is mainly about how to handle such a situation if you haven't prepared specifically. However, recommendations about preparing for the case of such a situation are also welcome, if this doesn't make my question too broad!</p>

"Is it normal that a down sleeping bag loses its loft after ~5 years ~150 nights?","<p>I have a 5 year old Haglöfs Para M5.  I've used it for on average 30 nights per year, perhaps 150 nights in total, with one long trip and some 8 short trips per year.

"Tent Fly Coloured Reflective Tape","<p>I have an MSR Elixir 2 tent with footprint that is great for my spring/summer/fall rock trips and is made of quite durable fabric.  It has worked quite well at very cold temps and has very effectively kept rain out.  I am hoping to use this tent for weekend ice climbing trips during the winter months.  The only issue is that the fly is silver/white! I have reflective guy lines but am wondering:</p>

<p>Is there a bright coloured tape, preferably orange, that I can apply to a portion of the fly so it is more visible in snow during daylight and also has some reflective properties so it is visible at night?</p>

<li>Wether the canyon is open/closed</li>
<li>The entrance of the canyon and the exit of the canyon</li>
<li>The sensitivity to weatherconditions</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>A fine example is given by <a href=""http://www.descente-canyon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">the French canyonsite</a>. There you can search the name of your canyon at the right of the site. For example if I look at the canyon ""Barranco del Furco"" (in Spain) i find the following <a href=""http://www.descente-canyon.com/canyoning/canyon/21051"" rel=""nofollow"">technical sheet</a>. It gives the necessary information (mentioned above) together with some pictures of the canyons and the state of the water in the canyon. This site mainly deals with French canyons but it also knows a lot of other canyons. Once you have enough reputation on this site, you are free to add other canyons.</p>

<p>Now I've also discovered an <a href=""http://www.canyonguides.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">English canyonsite</a>. They put the different canyons they know on a <a href=""http://www.canyonguides.org/guide-book/canyon-locations-map/"" rel=""nofollow"">Canyon Locations Map</a>.

"How to arrange 2 Prusiks when ascending a rope?","<p>If I want to ascend a rope with minimal equipment, I use 2 Prusiks: one tied to my harness, and the second one for my foot.</p>

<p>However, there are two ways to arrange the Prusiks on the rope - the foot below the chest, and the opposite way. The first arrangement is most intuitive and described and in all places on the Internet I looked, e.g. <a href=""http://www.chockstone.org/TechTips/AscendRope.htm"">here</a>. Also, <a href=""http://www.climbing.com/skill/save-yourself-a-guide-to-self-rescue/"">this site</a> tells that it's the right arrangement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notice that the waist Prusik (E) is above the foot Prusik (F)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but doesn't explain why.</p>

<p>When we practiced crevasse self-rescue, I noticed that my friend used the second ""counter-intuitive"" way; he said that he always used it, while I always used the ""normal"" arrangement. I tried the ""opposite"" arrangement, and it worked marginally better: I could ascend a bit higher each time I extended my leg (this might have been by luck). One difference I noticed is that you have to choose the length of the Prusiks carefully (use a long one for the foot) in order to avoid getting stuck. Otherwise, the arrangements seemed pretty similar.</p>

<p>Is there any reason to choose one arrangement or the other? Should my choice be different in different situations? (assuming I have Prusiks of any length)</p>

<p>P.S. I am not talking specifically about crevasse rescue.</p>

"What are good items to leave in a geocache?","<p>I started geocaching roughly a month ago and it's really fun activity to get into.</p>

<p>I had a few questions (though one was answered already here > <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/1845/3313"">What should be carried in a standard Geocaching bag?</a>) but my main question is typically for the UK due to people nature here, though all ideas are welcome.</p>

<p>So far we've a small geocaching kit consisting of pens, extra paper and lunch bag style plastic bags to help protect damp logbooks (of which thus far we have found many). Sometimes we pick up a few small items that we add in - so far we haven't taken any items out of a cache - these were mostly small toys, coins, etc. This is commonly what we find in caches as well.</p>

<p><em>Most caches we find currently are small (excluding micro) with the odd regular. And per item we would look to pay £3 or less, as we can find 6-7 caches per day out, but price does not necessarily constitute value to an outdoorsman. I would reserve pricier items for harder caches (4-5) but we are currently only finding 1-3 rated caches.</em></p>

<p>I am loathe to leave things like matches or fire starters or other useful outdoor tools such as that due to <em>idiots</em> who might abuse them. Though once or twice I've seen a compass in the caches and think these are a good idea. Caches should be, I believe, <strong>useful outdoors items</strong>, but to avoid caches being filled with toys and money, and wanting to overall improve the quality of my local caches:</p>

<p>As far as I know, commercially available climbing ropes are max. 80 m (260 ft) long; however, to descend from a 80 m long route, you would need a 160 m long rope! Maybe something less if the route is overhanging, but still much longer that what -as far as i know- is commercially available. </p>

<p>So what kind of ropes are used for these ""super-routes""? Some kind of ""custom"" ropes?</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>I know perfectly well (as I've done it myself many times, only on shorter lengths) that it is possible to climb an 80 m route with two 80m ropes (half ropes or twin ropes), then join them together and rappel down for all the 80m. But <strong>from the linked videos it is clear that a single rope is being used</strong> (see for example <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASvUhPsuLJE&amp;t=752s&amp;ab_channel=MENDOZACLIMB"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ondra on Chilam Balam</a>). This makes perfect sense, because we are talking about cutting-edge routes, at the limit of modern sport climbing, and carrying two ropes, even if thin half ropes, with all the added weight would probably decrease the performance. </p>

The route actually tops out on a plateau, as it is clear from Ethan Pringle's video, so you can probably walk down from it. However, what if he couldn't finish the climb and had to get down? I don't think that anyone would climb an 80 m long 9b knowing that the only way out is to finish the route...</p></li>

They point out that Jumbo Love should have one or two intermediate anchors that would allow you to rappel down. But in Ethan Pringle's video you can clearly see that <em>he is carrying no gear at all</em>, so either he was sure he would have topped out (but what if he got hurt?), or the rope was long enough to allow him to descend.

"Shooting into tree","<p>A few weeks ago, I strapped a target onto a tree that was about 1.5-2' in diameter to sight my muzzleloader on private property. I fired about a dozen .50 cal bullets into the tree. </p>

<p>In addition to liking firearms and hunting, I also happen to be a so called ""treehugger"". Shooting a tree ain't exactly hugging so my question is, how bad is firing bullets into it? For example, how much damage did I inflict on the tree in the example above? Will the tree die? Will it recover? How many rounds can an average tree take?</p>

"From the perspective of someone engaging in an outdoor sport, is there any fur that confers an advantage over all synthetic materials?","<p>In the largely indoor sport of oneupswomanship, real fur, especially mink, sable or chinchilla, offers a great advantage; no one wearing a synthetic fabric, however stylish the coat or jacket, is in the running.  This extends to the partially outdoor sports of après-ski and outdoor dining at fashionable ski-resort restaurants.</p>

<p>However, from the purely utilitarian perspective of keeping warm and dry while actively engaged outdoors, is there a fur that outperforms any synthetic material or combination of synthetic materials (i.e., layering) on the market, and if so, which fur and for what sport or activity?  (Ignore considerations of cost; any synthetic on the market will be cheaper than almost any natural fur.)</p>

<p>I remember reading that reindeer hairs are shaped in a way that cause them to trap air extraordinarily well; a garment of reindeer skin is thus an outstanding insulator.  (Anyone: feel free to expand on this in an answer.)  </p>

<p>Thus, while I dislike the use of fur merely for display or to signify wealth or status, I am open to information that fur outperform synthetics for prolonged activity (or inactivity such as waiting at a seal hole) in extreme conditions.  Weight and flexibility should be considered as factors as well as insulating properties and water repellancy. Whether modern synthetics and design match fur even in extreme conditions is also of interest; relevant would be what Himalayan climbers and modern Antarctic explorers use.</p>

<p>This question is prompted by an article in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2018/01/11/trump-administration-is-taking-steps-to-remove-a-threatened-lynx-from-the-endangered-species-list/?utm_term=.3f7d2937d024"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Washington Post on the Canada Lynx</a>.  </p>

"How do you protect yourself against crocodiles when you have no option but to camp on the banks of a croc-infested river?","<p>I am reading <a href=""https://books.google.com/books/about/Escape_Routes.html?id=8aK50swPDqAC"" rel=""noreferrer"">Escape Routes</a> by David Roberts.  This is a collection of 20 articles ranging from a winter ascent in Iceland to the first descent of a river in Ethiopia, the Tekeze, a major tributary of the Blue Nile.</p>

<p>There are a lot of crocodiles on the Tekese, which runs through a deep canyon, 7,000 feet at its deepest.  Roberts and his companions (founders of Mountain Travel Sobek) had to hike down 1,100 feet to get to the place where they could put in their rafts. So it doesn't seem like they could get far away from the river, particularly since they had 8,000 pounds of equipment.  They were making a film for Mungo Park, an online adventure magazine funded by Bill Gates in the mid-1990s.</p>

<p>Roberts talks a good deal about the crocodiles in the river, for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On other Ethiopian streams, the guides had had boats bitten by crocs. 
  Sure enough, by our fifth day, the occasional croc was charging a boat.  Our
  response was to throw baseball-sized rocks (which we loaded up every
  morning) at the beasts. A week down the river, Bart Henderson drily
  mentioned that his boat had just dealt with our first ""four rock
  croc"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But every evening, they had to camp by the river, and they also pulled into the river bank at other times for photography.  <strong>Roberts says nothing -- nothing at all -- about how they protected their camp and themselves from the crocs while ashore or getting ashore.</strong> </p>

<p>They noticed that there were no habitations along the river, although people lived high up the surrounding cliffs and came down to cultivate the river banks because of lack of rain. </p>

<p>An inhabitant explained that the lack of dwellings beside the river was because of ""the shaking sickness"" -- malaria.  He said his people could live with the crocodiles.</p>

<p>The last few sentences of the article kill the possibility that crocs cannot move fast on land:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The boat floats past a big croc on shore, who looks asleep. Suddenly
  the reptile spots the boat and charges towards the camera, running
  like a tailback across the stones, plunging into the water and
  swimming hard for Steve's offending lens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is:  <strong>How does one deal with crocodiles when there is no option but to camp on the shores of a croc infested river?</strong>  The article does not give even a hint.</p>

"Where can I find good UVI forecasts?","<p>I normally use weather.gov and/or weather.com for weather forecasts. Neither provides UVI (or at least I can't find it). Also, I rarely go outdoors, so I don't have an intuitive sense of when I get get away without sunscreen. I hate both sunburns and sunscreen, so I have a dilemma when I do need to go outside for extended periods.</p>

<p>Googling finds a few resources, but they mostly provide a UV max, i.e. at noon. Doesn't help if I'm going out for an extended period in the morning/afternoon.</p>

"Tent in the rain","<p>I have an MSR Elixir 2 tent bought 5 years ago and used three nights since (a shame I know). In any case, it was used for 4 nights camping in Spain in dry conditions and was an amazing tent.</p>

<p>A few months ago went camping and it started raining. We set up the tent but stayed in a shelter next to our tent until it was time to hit the sack. After I opened the tent, there was quite some water all over our gear. It wasn't a pool but it wasn't something where we would want to spend the night.</p>

<p>The tent is a double wall tent, been stored in dry conditions for the last 4 years of non use.</p>

<p>In any case, my questions are as follows, if someone has any experience with this:</p>

<p>1) <strong><em>Is it possible that this can be caused because of condensation?</em></strong> No one was in the tent since we pitched it until we went back into the tent so somehow it feels odd that the condensation would form in such an amount.</p>

<p>2) <strong><em>The fabric seems to be leaking when I put it under water at home. Is this normal?</em></strong> I live in an apartment and don't have the opportunity to do the hose test, but I took the rain fly into the shower and opened the shower. After a while the fabric started being most on the inside and forming tiny bubbles of water.</p>

<p>3) <strong><em>During the testing I did to the tent, it seems that when I'm pouring water over the tent and the rain fly is touching the pole of the tent, water seems to go through at these spots in large quantities.</em></strong> Is this normal for a tent? </p>

<p>I only owned canvas tents before so unfortunately I have nothing to compare to, but would like to know how you handle these conditions as now I'm afraid to take the tent for my next hike. I emailed the manufacturer but haven't received a reply since August</p>

<p>EDIT: 1st of December 2018</p>

<p>I managed to find a place to set it up on the roof of my building. I watered it with a watering can and used 10 of those. There was still water in the tent (a bit less than the last time but last time it was exposed in the rain) but it seems that all the water comes from the mid column (the tent has 2 main poles and a smaller pole across that holds the rainfly). All the water seemed to have come in one location and was in the middle of the tent. The rest of the tent was perfectly dry. </p>

<p>What could cause this? Could it be that there is something structural to the tent or is it worth just to give it up? I mean, I haven't had a tent like this before and don't know if this is normal to happen in other tents as well.</p>

"What easy 6,500m peaks would serve as easy qualifiers for Everest?","<p>So there's been talk of this for a while, but it seems like the Nepalese government is finally committing and closing Everest to inexperienced climbers. So from now on, as a safety measure, if you want to climb Everest, you will be required to prove you have summitted at least one mountain higher than 6,500m in elevation. This is meant to alleviate much of the traffic on the mountain, particularly the bucket-listers who have money, but no climbing experience and pay some guiding outfit to basically hold their hand all the way up to the top, if not carry them up.</p>

<p>My first thought after reading this news was, ""So which mountain is going to turn into the <em>qualifier</em> mountain that people climb first so they can go ahead and do Everest anyways?"" </p>

<p>Which mountain is the most likely candidate for guiding companies to use as and easy qualifier for their clients to summit so that the Nepalese government will let them climb Everest? Are they likely to just pick a mountain close to Everest? Or are we going to see an spike in mountain tourism to South America?</p>

"Applications of a slip knot in climbing?","<p>I'm joining a rock climbing club that requires an evaluation test in order to become a member. (I think this is a great idea.) They have a detailed handout listing exactly what you need to know for the test, including a bunch of knots. Most of them I was familiar with, but one knot they listed was the slip knot, which I've never used for climbing. Googling turns up <a href=""http://www.chockstone.org/TechTips/SlipKnot.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a>, which says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might use it to sling a horn (""chicken head"") of rock for example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What would be the right way to do this? After you tie the knot, pulling on one strand (call it strand 1) tends to tighten the loop, but the other strand (2) won't support tension. Presumably you need to do something else to make it safe. Do you tie a stopper knot in strand 1? Tie the two strands into a butterfly? I'm assuming that in this application you wouldn't have tension on either strand yet, and you may only have access to one end.</p>

<p>Is the slip knot the best knot for this purpose? Are there other rock-climbing applications of the slip knot?</p>

"Dealing with large runouts during sport climbing","<p>I was doing a sport climb recently where there was a pretty good distance between bolts, resulting in long rope runouts. Falling before the next bolt could easily cause a person to deck on a ledge. Luckily, no one fell at this point, but it was very precarious. </p>

<p>My question is: What are some techniques, as a belayer or climber, can you do to minimize risk of injury in a fall during long runouts? For example, if the  belayer sees the climber falling, should they run back to take up slack quickly? I've also heard of the belayer standing on high ground so they could drop at the same time as the climber to take up slack.</p>

<p>Assume this is a sport (not mixed) route and no additional protection can be placed. </p>

"What foods are unsafe to cook over an open fire?","<p>My friends and I went camping this weekend and I bought a package of <a href=""http://www.johnsonville.com/lines/brats.html"">Johnsonville brats</a> to cook over the fire. Many a person said that one should 'never bring raw brats to cook over a campfire', their rationale being that raw brats are dangerous to eat because of the possibility of bacteria and/or undercooked meat, but <em>moreso than other types of raw meat</em>.</p>

<p>Specifically, if the brats are fully cooked (I checked, they were!), is there inherently more danger in brats vs other raw meats? Is it a 'pork thing'?</p>

<p>But more generally: assume that no external factors would make the food in question unsafe to eat (such as hot dogs being left out of a cooler - becoming a haven for bacteria, or woods that put off toxic smoke) - are there any foods that are simply <em>not a good idea</em> to cook over an open fire?</p>

"Is Paradoxical Undressing a stage beyond Hypothermia?","<p>We all have discussed and read Hypothermia quite a lot of times and are aware of general concepts about it. What made me wonder the most was an incident about a mountaineer on Mt. Everest.
With the sort of wisdom I have, I still can't see why he is still alive (No offense, that is a great thing and I am awestruck as well as very happy for him) and how he made it.</p>

<p>That guy was stranded, it was a team of two if I got the whole documentary right. And they did summit and this fellow here, got stranded and had a Bivouac between Camp III and Camp IV. Later in the morning he was found undressing himself and standing at a cliff which seems like he is totally out of his mind. He was later rescued by a team who gave up on the summit attempt and chose to bring him down.</p>

<p>Looking at the situation, He should have died of the Hypothermia.
Is Paradoxical Undressing a later stage of Hypothermia? Because the actions/symptoms speak absolutely otherwise.</p>

<p>Have anybody more study or information about this stuff? Yes, I can simply browse for it, but there is too much sci-stuff and physiology stuff said about it, and that didn't help much.</p>

<p>How can it be treated? Does the same treatment as Hypothermia helps to treat this thing?</p>

<li>In fact assume any battery I bring will be fully (solar) charged prior to the trip and will (hopefully) only need a partial trickle charge during the sunlit hours.</li>
<li>An electric blanket adds insulation on its own even without supplying power.</li>
<li>An electric blanket has an automatic shut off after 30 min, and moreover will only be used intermittently during the night. I don't intend to draw 8 solid hours of power for this blanket each night.</li>

The trails were perfectly signposted and everything. My beautiful experience was a little bit disturbed by the sheer amount of stone piles everywhere.

<p>Don't get me wrong, even if the answer is rather emotional it is a welcome response. So answers like ""they do it just for fun"" or ""they do it for Cthulhu"" are perfectly valid. </p>

<p>Edit for clarification:</p>

<p>I know that people often use stone-piles instead of wooden signposts etc. to mark the trail and that's not a problem at all. However, signpost-stone-piles are pretty rare. They appear here and there where you have to turn or take a specific direction. You barely see one per km. That's not what my question is about! Check out the picture. The sheer amount of them is ridiculous! In this mass they obviously don't serve the purpose to just mark the right way to go. You see <em>at least</em> 30 of them per km.</p>

<p>After several months, they got worse and they started crawling/flying on and around my face getting into my eyes.

"Under what conditions can a guide be highly confident of protecting clients against brown bears without using firearms?","<p>A friend travelled to Alaska last summer, and took several guided trips in areas with large <strong>brown bear populations</strong>.  In each case, according to his report, the guides were armed <strong>only</strong> with bear spray.  On one of the trips, to <a href=""https://www.travelalaska.com/Destinations/Parks%20and%20Public%20Lands/Admiralty%20Island%20National%20Monument.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Admiralty Island</a>, my friend said that the guides were rangers. (He did not say about the other trips.)</p>

<p>The guiding companies or, in the case of Admiralty Island, the Park Service, must be confident that they can protect their clients  with bear spray alone.  A client mauled by a brown bear on a guided trip under the explicit protection of the company or the Park Service would make for very bad publicity.  Tourism is important to the economy of Southeast Alaska.  See <a href=""https://www.ktoo.org/2015/08/05/report-shows-economic-impact-tourism-southeast/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">KTOO Public Media</a>, <em>Report shows economic impact of tourism in Southeast</em>.</p>

<p><strong>What are the reasons for their confidence?</strong> I can think of several possible reasons or combinations of reasons:</p>

<p>(1) The tourists are taken to places where brown bears have become acclimated to people. This doesn't mean that the bears are tame; they are still wild and dangerous. However, they see people as a normal, harmless part of their environment.</p>

<p>(2) Bears are much more wary about a group of people -- say 4 to 8 people -- than one or two hikers, and the guides keep the people together.</p>

<p>(3) People don't smell yummy. They smell somewhere between <em>yecch</em> and <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meh</a></p>

<p>(4) The tourists are taken to places where the bears have an abundance of food.</p>

<p>(5) The bears do not associate people with food. </p>

<p><strong>In other words, are the guides relying on managing the pre-encounter situations to prevent encounters ?</strong></p>

<p>Another possibility:</p>

<p>(1) There is a backup guide/ranger with a gun out of sight of the tourists.</p>

<p>An answer specific to protecting tourists on guided tours in Alaska would be ideal.  A more general answer about protecting clients who are on a guided tour against brown bears would also be useful.    </p>

"Are coasteering routes graded, or does one have to rely on a qualitative description of the difficulties of a route?","<p>What, you may ask, is coasteering?  Does saying it is similar to kloofing help? Thought not.  Many sites describe coasteering; here is a brief description exerpted from <a href=""https://www.outsideonline.com/1785421/what-coasteering-and-where-can-i-do-it"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">outsideonline.com</a>, <em>What Is Coasteering, and Where Can I Do It?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coasteering is a combination of rock climbing, swimming, and optional
  cliff jumping. As you’ve probably guessed from the term, this sport,
  which got its start in Wales, takes place on a coastline. It has
  allure for those looking for an adrenaline rush—and some exercise—in a
  beautiful environment. </p>
  
  <p>One of the greatest things about coasteering is that almost everybody
  can do it. Andy Middleton, founder of the TYF Group, which facilitates
  outdoor adventures in southwest Wales, says that “anyone who’s capable
  of walking the coast would be OK to coasteer. We introduced our kids
  to it not long after they’d learned to walk.” His organization has
  hosted coasteering excursions for people well into their seventies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sounds thrilling, but a coasteering experience that would be fine for a child soon after it has learned to walk, or a person in their seventies, however athletic and proficient, probably doesn't offer much of a challenge to an experienced coasteerer (if this is a word) in her prime.  And vice versa: a route that would challenge an experienced coasteerer is probably no place for a beginner. </p>

<p>I have searched <em>Are there grades in coasteering</em>, and the few hits I got were about training coasteering guides, such as <a href=""https://newquaywatersportscentre.co.uk/training/coasteering-guide-training/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Hence my question: <strong>Is there a grading system, even an embryonic grading system, for this sport, similar (but perhaps more complicated) to the grading system for climbing?</strong>  Or not, for reasons of the newness of the sport or the nature of the sport?  Or would someone thinking about trying a route have to rely on a qualitative description of the route?</p>

"How many tea light candles are needed to equal the heat output of a person?","<p>A <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13772/what-should-you-do-if-your-sleeping-bag-gets-soaking-wet-at-night/18344#18344"">recent answer</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an emergency a tea light candle carefully set on/in a disposable pie tin can heat a 4 season tent enough to aid the drying process - just be sure to isolate, ventalate, and insulate the flame properly! -- (tent model, size, wind, temp, and humidity will all change effectiveness)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A tea light does not have a lot of fuel, and if you consider food that a person eats as fuel, it would seem that a person burns a lot more fuel then a tea light. By extension if you have a person and tea light in the same enclosed area it would seem that the majority of heat being generated would come from the person. Keep in mind that both the person and the candle are combing (burning) Carbon and Oxygen, both include a supply of Carbon, but require Oxygen to be replenished from the environment.  </p>

<p>I googled around a bit, and did not find an authoritative answer, but it seems like most hits are listing a resting human body as 100 watts of energy and tea light as 30 watts of energy. I have personally used a 60 watt incandescent light bulb as a heat source, and in a small area it is significant. It does not require ventilation, but is a fire hazard. </p>

<p>To answer the question: <strong>Can a tea light candle safely generate useful amounts of heat?</strong> I think there are couple of points that need to be addressed.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the heat/energy output of a person?</li>
<li>What is the heat/energy output of a tea light?</li>
<li>Do both consume similar amounts of Oxygen for the amount of heat/energy given?</li>
<li>If we assume a two person tent provides sufficient gas exchange for two people, can an equivalent number of tea light candles provide the same heat/energy without additional ventilation? </li>

"What features to look for in a small snowshoe for getting up and down a long driveway and around the yard during what may be a snowy winter?","<p>I have old snowshoes which were fine for hiking in TGO when I was younger, but they are too large now for comfortable walking in TLO (The Little Outdoors), by which I mean walking up and down an unplowed 300 foot driveway and stomping down snow to make a firm surface for birdseed to supplement the birdfeeders. We expect a snowy winter here, which means a lot of trips down to my car at the bottom of the driveway and up with mail, groceries and other stuff.  I also want the snowshoes to be very easy to put on and take off. </p>

<p><strong>What features should I look for in a snowshoe that is adequate for the tasks described above?</strong>  I am 5'9"", weigh 135 pounds and am unusually strong for my age, which I am not going to tell you. However, I am not strong enough to enjoy postholing down a long driveway or to stomp down the driveway comfortably in my old 30 inch long Sherpa snowshoes, which are a pain to put on.  </p>

<p>The logical question is ""why not get the driveway plowed?""  It may come to that, but I would prefer not to, mainly because I do not want to drive down and up a steep, narrow, icy driveway with a 15 foot drop on one side and because, well, because.  Also, a plow really messes up a gravel driveway.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum to make Q more TGO-ish:</strong>  Such a snowshoe would be useful for hiking on snowy trails for people who do not want to manipulate (pedipulate?)  large snowshoes.  I'd probably use them to take short hikes in Great Falls National Park or on the trails at Scott's Run and Difficult Run. </p>

"When should I report a potentially injured-looking animal to authorities in a large, monitored, wildlife area?","<p>We prefer watching animals from a distance, to try and cause them the least disruption. Every so often I've seen an animal in a distant part of a large area that doesn't appear to feel right. For instance, it may be limping a little bit, or missing an area of fur, which could indicate injury. Some animals that fight with each other, especially during mating season, can cause great harm, which is often obvious. Other times the damage is less obvious. Many times it's just natural changes that are part of being a wild animal.  </p>

<p>Of course if we saw something drastic, like bleeding, crying, having trouble standing or running, or being picked on by other animals, I'd immediately report it. </p>

<p>I'm more confused if I feel that something doesn't seem right but am not sure. I'm particularly sensitive to animals, and can worry more than necessary. I've left places wishing I'd spoken up, but have just assumed that the rangers will see what I saw as they tend to their inhabitants. </p>

<p>If I don't have real evidence that an animal's in trouble, should I just leave it alone and assume the park rangers will handle it? Is it more helpful to at least report it, even if I might be over-reacting? </p>

<p>For this question, I'll focus on animals that permanently reside in an area which is fully-staffed with people who closely monitor them. There are many of those places world-wide. If that's too broad, I could use an example such as <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">America's National Park System</a>, where a  standardized strict animal care system is in place. </p>

"When using a compass, why not follow a degree mark without rotation?","<p>Instead of taking a bearing the ""official"" way, why not just see what degree mark corresponds to on the direction I want to go (in real life or on a map), and follow that degree mark? That is, why do I need to go through aligning edge of compass, rotating the bezel to align the meridian lines, rotating body so compass needle aligns with orienteering arrow?</p>

<p>Clarification: Assume point B is exactly NW of point A. If I want to go from point A to point B on a map, I'd be tempted to do as follows: Orient map so magnetic north on map corresponds to north on compass (needle), then see where point B is in relation to point A (at compass bearing 315). Then, I'd pick a landmark in that direction, head to it, and then repeat. My point is at no point in this process did I need a compass with a baseplate or travel arrow and I never needed to rotate my bezel to align to meridian lines, etc. So I'm stumped about why I need to go through all of those steps. I do fully understand that those may be good skills to have for other more complex needs down the road... just wondering if I'm missing something in my simple approach to issue at hand.</p>

"Different woods and how they burn/what if we are unsure of the wood?","<p>I'm keen on learning more about different woods and how they burn in particular in the context of bushcraft. There is a lot of existing literature on all the different woods out there. I started to read up on the subject and quickly found that it's rather daunting. What I was able to gather was: <strong>There are <em>so</em> many wood types and there is a lot of variability in how they burn.</strong></p>

<p>(for example: Hazel burns well, but Alder tends not to burn so well, and it just goes on and on)</p>

<p>In good time, perhaps I will make sense of it all. In the mean time, I hope that I can find some other general rules to follow until I have the proper experience to know for myself. I'm familiar with the hardwood/softwood dichotomy, but I'm hoping there is more to it.</p>

"Questions about specifics of black bear encounter with mother and yearling cub","<p>I hope the bear experts on the site can shed light on several aspects of a black bear encounter my husband and I had some years ago in the Sierra.</p>

<p>It was mid-May, about 9500 feet, well above timber line, and the ground was almost completely covered with snow, except for a few bare patches.  I concluded: ""No bear in his right mind would be here.""  So we did not bury our food in a snowbank.  <strong>Mistake.</strong> <strong>Big Mistake.</strong></p>

<p>Shortly after we fell asleep, we were wakened by banging pots.  A bear walked across the campsite, grabbed my pack, which contained all our freeze-dried food, in <strong>her</strong> teeth and disappeared into the darkness.  My husband tracked her by flashlight and moonlight -- the dragging pack left a clear path.  Soon I heard snarls and growls, and went off to rescue my husband.</p>

<p>I came upon my husband, a bear and her yearling cub.  Here is where I would like your input.  It seemed to us both, and I can't tell you why, body language, I suppose, plus something in the snarling, that the cub was saying ""Let me at him!"" and the mother was saying ""Be quiet! I'll handle this!""  We froze.  After what seemed like a long time, the mother and cub turned and went off.  <strong>Q1:  Is this interpretation plausible, or are we just anthropomorphizing?</strong>  </p>

<p>The two bears had ripped open my pack, pulled out stuff, zeroed in on the freeze-dried food, eviscerated five packages of freeze-dried food and had eaten it all.  <strong>Q2: When the food reconstituted in their stomachs, did they get stomach aches, or are their stomachs large enough so the expanding food was no problem?</strong> </p>

<p>The bears stopped at a layer of very dirty clothes near the bottom of my pack, and so missed the last package of freeze-dried food, which was a reserve.  <strong>Q3: Is it plausible that dirty, smelly clothes repelled the bears?</strong>  It could have been that my husband interrupted them, but I'd like to think the smelly clothes stopped them. </p>

<p>We hiked out for two days on one pkg of FD food and tea.  The sugar and all the fresh food were gone. A great experience!</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong>  There were no established bear boxes -- we were far off trail.  This was before the era of portable bear canisters -- or at least before it was common to use them; in any case, they aren't practical for a 14 day trip, which this was.  We <strong>should</strong> have buried our food in a snow-bank; it was a big mistake not to. We have used the snow bank strategy successfully many times; once we saw bear paw-prints going right over our snow-covered cache. For Sierra black bears, the snow bank trick works.  We have no experience with brown bears.     </p>

"Case example on Altitude Mountain Sickness: How to detect and react properly?","<p>I know the theory behind effects of high altitudes on the human body is not entirely understood and because of cross-influence it is a difficult topic. It's not an exact science.</p>

<p>Having said that I will give an example case which happened to myself this year. I try to give all relevant information. And I am asking myself for quite a while (and therefore I am asking you now) what exactly occurred in my body in high altitude and how I could react better the next time.</p>

<p>My background is:</p>

<ul>
<li>quite a few alpine tours under 4000m (13.000')</li>
<li>good fitness level but no fitness enthusiast (I am able to do tours with 10 hour walking and/or 2000m elevation gain without big problems in a proper speed)</li>
<li>mild lung problems (no 100% capacity, maybe 80-90%)</li>
</ul>

<p>So we did a trip to South-America, started doing proper acclimatization tours where we always slept around 3000m (10.000') and climbed 4 mountains with increasing height between 4200m (13.800') and 5100m (16.700'). On that tours I had no problems at all and seemed to be very fit. We also had days to rest.</p>

<p>Then we tried to climb a mountain of 5900m (19.300') height. We were supposed to sleep from 5pm to 10pm which I wasn't really able to. I slept maybe 15 minutes which of course is not the best preparation for a long day. Still I was motivated, ate and drunk as much as possible before we start. We were driving by car until 4800m (15.700') I think. There we start climbing. From 5000m (16.400') on I got problems with the stomach. I felt bad and this got worse. As a consequence I wasn't able to eat and I even stopped drinking properly. Later on I was starting to feel weaker and weaker. I had no lung problems or problems breathing but I felt so extremely exhausted. I had <strong>no headache</strong> at all. Finally at 5500m (18.000') I made the decision to turn around. Even descending I had to stop and even sit down each few minutes because of the exhaustion. I never felt like this before.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know it's normal to fatigue when you are not sleeping/eating/drinking enough. But the body has reserves. Because I had no headache I asked myself over and over again if I got AMS (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_sickness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki</a>) and how serious my situation is and when I have to stop ascending. This is the main question here, <strong>how to decide and react properly</strong> in such a borderline situation.</p>

<p>There was a lot written about AMS and I knew the symptoms before my trip. <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9652/how-do-you-diagnose-severe-altitude-illness"">This question</a> covers the general ideas of diagnosing severe altitude illness. I doubt my question is a duplicate, it is just a very special case (a case example) which shows how difficult correct judging about the necessity to turn around is.</p>

<p>Like the linked <a href=""http://www.treksafe.com.au/medical/documents/LakeLouisescore_000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lake Louise Score</a> states, it is always headache plus symptom X and maybe others. Because of the missing headache I was really unsure of my situation and how far to proceed. The mountain guides climbing with me are not able to assume the responsibility.</p>

<p>While descending under 5000m (16.400') I started feeling stronger. That's the main reason I assume afterwards that I got altitude sickness. But I (and also the mountain guides) was not able to judge correctly on the way up.</p>

<p>How would you judge? How would you react? What to do better next time preparing a high altitude climb?</p>

"Canadian Law with respect to knives","<p>I keep seeing slightly different answers for some of these questions.</p>

<p>In summary of what I know already, please tell me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>You can own any knife of any length, with the following general exceptions: </p>

<ol>
<li>It is stereotypically related to gang violence (like the auto/easy opening variety).  </li>
<li>It is designed to be concealed. (I do not really care about the specifics, as I personally am not interested in any knives like either of these)</li>
</ol>

<p>You can carry around anything that is legal to own, but there is a length restriction for concealed knives? Do you need a lawful reason to carry it, in either situation?</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Self defense is not a lawful reason to carry a knife. Does this mean that if I end up defending myself (from an animal or a human) that it is unlawful to use a knife? Do they just not want you carrying one around just for this reason since pepper-spray would be better?  </p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> I am rather leery of this ""lawful reason clause"". Is just general survival/cutting of things a good enough excuse?<br>
It just does not really make sense to me. A knife is designed to cut things, and I carry one around to cut things with.  </p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> So it is lawful to carry around, in full view, any length of blade? What is the restriction for concealed knives (I have heard numbers from 4"" to 6"")?  </p>

<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What is classified as ""carrying"", exactly? Does that mean that I cannot transport a big knife in a backpack or bag? What is required for transporting big knives so that police will not call it concealing?  </p>

<p>Specific situation: I really want to get a big-medium sized Kukri as a general survival knife that works well as a replacement hatchet. It is 100% a tool, but it looks like an intimidating sword. So this Kukri is not something that can really ever be carried around in plain view in public; it would attract too much attention. It is specifically related to the ""how do I transport a large knife in public"" Question 4.</p>

<p>But I also like a smallish utility knife. I am thinking of getting a small Bowie within that range (4""-6""). So the exact length requirement is important.</p>

"Is it dangerous to sleep in a tent alone in a forest in -20°C?","<p>Can I spend the night alone in a tent in a forest outside Stockholm in -20°C without risking my life?</p>

<hr>

<h2>The backstory</h2>

<p>From the end of January, I'm starting my studies in a suburb of Stockholm. I've decided to, if it turns out plausible, not rent an apartment, but live in a tent. (This is not out of frugality, but out of a will to try something new.)</p>

<p>I do have friends who I could visit once a week or so to prepare food and wash my clothes, so I think I can solve the practical problems, or at least those that I've come to think of. I'd camp in one of the forests, maybe 1 km from ""civilisation"". I'd have access to showers etc at university every day.</p>

<p>However: I don't want to freeze to death in my sleep! That's very important to me. I've read that the nights can get as cold as -20°C (-4°F). With the proper preparations, would this be a plausible way of living, at least for a month or so?</p>

<p>I do have camping experience, and have been hiking for three weeks, but only in summer.</p>

"Should I bring my dog with us to a Cabin","<p>Recently my girlfriend and I were invited to go camping with our friends at a cabin in Flagstaff, Arizona. My buddies have already left and we're supposed to  leave tomorrow to go and meet them up there. Everything has worked out great so far... except for one thing.... I want to bring my dog.
Now I'm sure your wondering what the issue is, and well my friends have already left and took their dog with them. Now both theirs and mine know each other very well for they have played together during SEVERAL bbq's, so thats not going to be a problem. The problem we are currently facing is apparently if my dog goes, according to my girlfriend, that my friends will have to tie up their dog while ours is there where as if I just leave her home their dog can ""run free"" so to speak. Now I can honnestly see their point in the sense of the two dogs playing and getting carried away and taking off twoard another cabin. But outside of that? I don't personally see a problem and I seriously doubt they would do it, but you never know...
This is the first time I have gone camping in YEARS and its most certanally the first time since I've had my dog... I don't think its fair to just leave her home like my girl seems to think so.... We do live in an apartment where she doesn't get out as much as she should, but she DOES get out. We can't take her to the dog park because of her breed, despite the fact she is friendly. She gets to go for walks and about once a week to once every two weeks she gets to go and run free on a 2 acre property until lays down in a heap of happy tails and belly rubs. She does really well as far as listening goes when on this property, but thorw in another dog and she doesnkt listen as well as she should, to be honnest sometimes I have to call her multiple times. sometimes I don't. just depends. So please, I'm asking for your advice, should I bring her or should I leave her?</p>

<p>My Dog:
Breed: Pitbull Boxer Mix
Age: 3 Years.
Sex: Female
Personality: Loving, Sweet Adhd Hyper, protective will probably run circles around the cabin for at LEAST 30 minuets when we get there.</p>

<p>Their Dog:
Breed: Brindle lab mix
Age: 4 years?
Sex: Male
Personality: Loving, sweet, protective, at times adhd hyper and will probably run circles around the cabin with my dog once/if she gets there.</p>

<p>How many people total there:
4 adults.
3 kids (6, 7, and 9)
and 1 dog for sure.</p>

<p>How many days:
For my friends: a week
For us: Two Nights and two and a quarter days.</p>

<p>EDIT: I would just like to add that if we leave the dog, the dog will NOT be neglected. I have a cat as well who needs to be fed and given attention to. We have someone who is going to be stopping by the house to spend time with the cat/make it seem like someone is home. The main reasons why my girl does not want to take the dog are because we recently have gotten knew neighbors within the last week, we're pretty sure the people beside us do drugs and we don't want to risk our things stolen and in her mind the dog would scare intruders away (yes i have pointed out that if they REALLY want in, they could kill or harm her) and the last reason, she doesn't want to have to worry about said dog doing something she's not supposed to. I'm confident in her, but my fiance is not with another dog around.</p>

<p>More specifically: When I started climbing I mostly focused on the hands. After some months, I advanced in the grades, but I started to fail in certain climbs because I slipped from the foot holes. During the time I realized the first time that I had bad footwork - so I started to train it.</p>

<p>The months passed, impossible climbs became easy and I thought: well, my footwork should be good now. In the next grade I struggled again, slipped away or could not hold my body at the overhanging wall. So, footwork training again...

"Do mountaineers use dynamic climbing when traversing rock/ice?","<p>I have recently taken up bouldering/rock climbing to learn some rock climbing techniques and learn rope skills.  In my research, I have come across two types of climbing: static and dynamic.  Although dynamic climbing seems to very fun, how often is it actually used by mountaineers (I realize that it is actually quite common for rock climbing)?</p>

<p>It seems like jumping from one hold to reach the next hold would have many disadvantages, especially when wearing a pack, in cold conditions, and when there is ice or snow.   </p>

<p>I realize that dynamic movement can be very broad but I am specifically referring to jumping from hold to hold or swinging, etc.  Is this a skill a mountaineer should use? Or is static climbing more the way to go when in the mountains? </p>

"In a boat repair, what would cause Gelcoat not to harden?","<p>Gelcoat is available in 2 formulas, <a href=""http://www.totalboat.com/product/gelcoat/"" rel=""noreferrer"">one has wax (finishing), one does not (layering)</a>. Both need to be mixed with an agent to cause it to harden. Gelcoat that is exposed to the air stays tacky, this allows for a chemical bond to form between layers.  When using gelcoat for the finishing coat of a boat repair, the common method is to use the formula with wax. As the gelcoat sets, the wax floats to the surface and forms the barrier that allows it to fully harden.</p>

<p>While shopping for a product at a popular web seller, I found this review for a verified purchase of <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00Q53C3NS"" rel=""noreferrer"">TotalBoat White Gelcoat</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Was happy at the time of application on how it was ..., October 20, 2016</p>
  
  <p>I had called the company to make sure I understood how to apply product and mix contents. Got the boat ready and applied the gelcoat. Was happy at the time of application on how it was going to work, but when came back next day there were spots that had not hardened and still have not. I do not understand what went wrong and will be calling the company back on what possibly went wrong. I mixed hardener the same, the surface was all prepared the same. Will have to redo the boat and not going back with this product.<a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/review/R1JBZSMXFR8T69?ref_=glimp_1rv_cl"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the information on the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00Q53C3NS"" rel=""noreferrer"">product page</a>, this gelcoat was made with wax. I searched the site where I found the review, but couldn't locate a wax-free product. I ended up going to another source to get a wax-free product for my first layer.  </p>

<p>Obviously I don't know for sure, but the description of ""spots that had not hardened"" makes me wonder if maybe they used soap and water (acetone is recommended by some) to clean the boat prior to applying the gelcoat. If so, and some soap residue remained, it may have potentially risen through the gelcoat, repelling the wax in ""spots"". </p>

<p><strong>Assuming the person mixed the gelcoat and hardener well</strong>, what could have caused some areas not to harden? </p>

"How much gelcoat should I remove before redoing the entire hull?","<p>I have a 1972ish sunfish I am planning to re-gelcoat the entire bottom of the hull.  I made one fiber glass repair where there was a crack through the hull, I took that area down to bare fiberglass before repairing. In another area cracks in the gecoat turned out to be related to a thick layer (3/4 of an inch, 2 cm) of bondo over an old repair.  I sanded that area to the fiberglass, unsure if I am going to add more fiberglass, but not replacing the bondo that thickly. </p>

<p>Where there are scratches or spider crackes I sanded until they were gone, mostly there is still a layer of gelcoat, in few place there is a little fiberglass showing.  For the most part 95% of the hull has a layer of gelcoat sanded with 60 grit.  </p>

<p>I have purchased two quarts of white exposy gelcoat, one laminating and one waxed for the final coat.</p>

<p>Some research I have done suggest the thick gelcoat is part of the reason for spider cracks (when the fiberglass flexes the gelcoat cracks).</p>

<p>My plan at the moment is, a coat of laminating gelcoat on bare fiberglass, a second coat of laminating on the entire hull, a third coat of waxed/final gelcoat on the entire hull, sand with 400-600 grit and put the trim back on. All gelcoat will be applied with a brush. </p>

<p>Should I sand the entire hull until the gelcoat is mostly gone? If I consider existing gelcoat as one layer, what the is the maximum number of coats that should be applied over any area of the hull?  </p>

<p>Is there any way to repair this piece with off the shelf parts?

"Train climbing with additional weight?","<p>What is your opinion: Does it make sense to train rock climbing wearying a weight vest or a small backpack carrying a small amount of weight (let's say 1-3kg or 2-6.5lb) to mimic the actual weight you carry with you outdoors?</p>

<p>Why am I asking this question: Depending on what you are doing outdoors, you carry a substantial additional amount of weight, in particular for trad and alpine climbing, e.g. </p>

<ul>
<li>10 quickdraws do weight ca. 1kg</li>
<li>a set of cams with additional gates easily more than that</li>
<li>additional layers of clothes</li>
<li>etc...</li>

<p>In my experience, it makes a huge differences to carry an additional 2kg or 4.5lb of weight with me, in particular in overhanging terrain or if powerful moves are required. My prior therefore would be, yes it makes definitely sense to take this into account during your training. 
But I wonder because I seldom see climbers actually practicing with additional weight. </p>

<p>I think I remember Adam Ondra saying that most people should not do weighted bouldering etc. because you will get used to climber slower (and there is a higher risk of injury). But does this this also apply to a small (realistic) amount of weight you will face while performing?</p>

<p>This has happened to me on a number of occasions and my solutions have included moving my pack to block it (only viable in low wind), dropping the windward side of the tarp to the ground(cramped) and re-pitching in the middle of the night (naked, cold wind, unpleasant).</p>

<p>I've read Jardine's tarp book and he suggests tarp doors, but this starts to over-complicate what is a wonderfully simple bit of gear.</p>

<p>So what are my options for handing switches in wind?</p>

<p><em>Note: I'm not asking how to pitch in very high winds. I would take a tent if I was camping above the tree-line. I'm talking about general pitching where there is enough wind to strip the heat from you but not enough to blow you off a cliff.</em></p>

"Climbing: fear/panic on boulder wall","<p>I am wondering if anyone else has experienced fear/panic that gets in the way of bouldering, and what their tips are for dealing with this. (There is a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7003/how-to-overcome-the-fear-of-falling-in-lead-climbing?rq=1"">prior question on fear in lead climbing</a>, but my issue is specific to bouldering. I climb indoors.)</p>

<p>Basically, I am a relatively new (1.5yrs) climber with a mental hang-up about bouldering. I am specifically scared of taking a fall off a boulder problem and hurting my foot. The essence of the problem is the fear of an uncontrolled fall. When a move at any height feels anything less than 100% sure to stick, I panic. The higher I am, the more certain I have to be the next move is completely safe. The top two moves or so of <em>any</em> problem are always really challenging because I panic even if they are straight up jugs. When this happens I get tunnel vision, rapid breathing, intense feelings of fear etc, and have to downclimb and/or take a controlled jump. The problem has just been getting worse and worse lately. Because of this issue, I have not just stopped advancing, I have actually regressed in bouldering ability. It has become bad enough that I just don't want to boulder anymore - I get anxiety just thinking about going on the wall, and would much rather spend all my time top roping (I don't lead climb yet).</p>

<p>I know where this originates: just a few months into climbing, I hurt my ankle when taking a fall off a simple boulder problem at an unfortunate angle. It didn't completely heal on its own, so after a few months I saw a physical therapist, with whom I worked for another few months. Now it has been over a year since the fall, and the ankle is finally getting up above 90% of what it used to be (though I still can't go running). I am completely mentally hung up on this happening again. I love going on top-rope walls, because even if I fall, I am not worried about landing wrong. I can top-rope 5.9s but the same moves feel impossible on a boulder wall. Lately, I have been unable to even top out v0 (on good days, when the panic doesn't visit, I can top v2). Even on good days, this issue prevents me from actually improving as a climber on the boulder wall. It's not clear to me why the fear is getting more intense as more time passes from the injury.</p>

<p>Things that don't work (for me): pushing through the panic (trying to defy it just seems like adding fuel to the fire). And taking more controlled falls has not been super helpful: the real issue is getting myself to take a risk at an uncontrolled fall, and it's like my body refuses to even attempt those moves.</p>

<p>Anyone had similar issues? What did you do? </p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Also, any general ideas on what I could try to overcome this?</p>

A recent answer to the question <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/9760/what-is-a-sling-belay"">What is a “sling belay?”</a> mentioned that such belays are considered ""aid"" in big-walling and makes an ascent non-free.

<p>What specific rules like the one mentioned are there, that make an ascent non-free?<br>
As this is often not uniform in area and time, any elaboration on where and when certain rules apply are appreciated.</p>

<p>This is not really relevant to a casual climber (as long as I do not put any force on the belay chain, for me I am free), but records and first ascent play an important role in professional climbing. Especially nowadays with more and more sponsorship involved, ""regulation"" and comparability are needed and I would like to understand the current ""state of the art"" of free climbing.</p>

"Toprope webbing anchor with figure 8 knots","<p>I recently made a toprope anchor extending from a tree about 15' over the edge of the cliff using 1"" webbing. The webbing was looped around the tree using a figure 8 follow-through, with sufficient tail and a simple stopper knot as well. A figure-8 on a bight was tied at the master point (opp opposed lockers), where the anchor joined a sling from the single good bolt (the other was loose), the rest of the webbing simply coiled up at the top of the cliff.

<p><strong>Amendment:</strong> If I don't break my wrist it feels like I'm ""hacking"" with too light of a tool.  Blade speed is much lower, and so much less work is done with each stroke.  If I were to not break my wrist I could use a much heavier tool: A much longer blade, or a blade at the end of a long handle, which would give the same blade speed and power per stroke without having to break my wrist.  But what am I describing?  A pike?  (And then there's the question of what to do when I have to pack the tool into the wilderness....)</p>

<p><strong>Second Amendment:</strong> I also realized that if I don't break my wrist I can't reach a lot of brush: If I keep the blade at a right angle to my arm then I have to bend to hit anything lower than 3 feet off the ground, and I have to wade further into the brush to reach more central branches, which is an often thorny proposition!</p>

"What is the difference between a cascade and a waterfall?","<p>I thought about asking this question on English Language and Usage, but decided not to because I want answers from people who are familiar with cascades and waterfalls in reality, not just in the abstract.  Moreover, the definitions aren't very helpful.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/28381?rskey=BcBgeg&amp;result=1#eid"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Oxford English Dictionary</a>, a cascade is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, a small waterfall; esp. one of a series of small falls,
  formed by water in its descent over rocks, or in the artificial works
  of the kind introduced in landscape gardening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from the <a href=""http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/226176?rskey=rxCETm&amp;result=1#eid"" rel=""noreferrer"">OED</a>, a waterfall is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A cascade of water falling from a height, formed when a river or
  stream flows over a precipice or ledge; (also) a garden water feature
  resembling this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much of my hiking has been done in the Sierra, especially Yosemite, where waterfalls and cascades of every size abound.  I have always thought of a waterfall as water that flows over a lip and then falls freely.  And a cascade as water that may flow quite steeply downhill but remains in contact with the underlying rock or streambed.  I would never describe Nevada Falls, for example as a cascade, nor would I describe the cascades that flow over the bare granite at roughly the 8,000 foot level of Yosemite Creek as waterfalls.</p>

<p>Is there a difference between the two in TGO in other parts of the world, or have I made up a distinction that is not commonly used in TGO?   </p>

Here’s how,"" It mostly discusses ""human fueling"" (calories) but later says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That means starting out with a sled weighing 375 pounds (Worsley’s, in contrast, weighed 330 pounds). Unlike Worsley, he’s not bringing cigars or a bottle of Royal Brackla Scotch whiskey to toast his progress. In fact, he admitted, “I’m not bringing a second pair of underwear.” That ruthlessly pragmatic approach contrasts with the swashbuckling tradition of polar exploration pioneered by the British—but this particular challenge, O’Brady believes, simply doesn’t allow any margin for whimsy. The starting load of food was about 245 pounds, <strong>with another 55 pounds of fuel, which is needed to melt the necessary five liters of water daily</strong>, and 75 pounds of equipment and clothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Antarctic hikers mentioned below looked at using photovoltaic cells to convert solar power to electricity and store it in batteries (or thermally) for melting water and charging electronic gear.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How did O’Brady charge his electronic gear? Solar? Conversion of thermal power from burning fuel to electricity somehow?</p>

"Is there proof that it's good for animals in captivity to do activities such as painting?","<p>Last spring, we went to the <a href=""http://www.mysticaquarium.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mystic Aquarium</a> in Connecticut, United States. </p>

<p>We don't like places with captive animals, unless they're work is essential for the survival of life on the planet. We may visit some that are caring for rescued or injured animals until they can go back to the wild; and some that are providing life-long loving care for animals who can never be released. The facilities must be governed by organizations with strict rules. They must have a global conservation and education mission.  </p>

<p>The Aquarium seemed to meet our criteria, until we came to an exhibit that disturbed us. They were selling ""paintings"" by animals, each with a profile of the ""artist."" The penguin made multiple colored footprints. A beluga whale made one with long brushstrokes. Apparently they hold the paintbrush in their mouth, but I'm not sure of the procedure.</p>

<p>We worry that the paint is toxic in the long run, even if doesn't seem to be at the moment. We worry that the whole activity is unnatural to the animal, might be frightening or otherwise disruptive, especially if they go back to the wild. Penguins do walk in their natural habitat, but they don't use paint and are not forced to walk on a piece of paper. I doubt whales do anything remotely related to putting a brush in their mouths and creating ""art"" in the ocean!</p>

<p>We had an uneasy feeling that the animals were just being used as entertainment without enough attention paid to their care. We expressed our concern about the the painting activity to an employee, who told us that creating this ""art"" is not only safe, but actually beneficial to the animals. </p>

<p>Is that a proven fact? If so, what are the benefits? Are there also dangers such as those I mentioned, or others? </p>

She's attending a summer camp, and I'm wondering if, with proper planning (and probably a mountain of release forms), it would be possible for her to join in on rappelling?

"Need help identifying a vintage George Hine Production Co Rod","<p>My mother gave me an old rod that I think she just found and I need help identifying it. There are some pictures below. The whole group of pictures is  <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/kXeqhqW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Its only identifying marks is a sticker that seems to read</p>

<pre><code>George Hine Production Co,

Santa Monica, California

The Harnell
</code></pre>

<p>It's a two piece rod, 9'2"" when assembled. It seems to be a baitcasting rod since the eyelets are close to the body unlike the eyelets on spinning reels. The handle measures 23"" from the the top where the handle meets the rod blank to the butt of the cork. The reel seat area is about 4"" and screws down, maximum open area for a reel to slide in there is about 2-3/4""</p>

<p>What type of rod is this? I only own a single rod (i'm only a casual fisherman) which is the Fenwick HMG with a Daiwa BG2500.</p>

<p>I'm hoping this rod would be good for Salmon fishing on the American River and maybe surf fishing (or is it too short for surf?)?</p>

<p>What reel should I get to go with this? I am thinking something with the round baitcaster form factor to match the vintage feel.</p>

<p>Also it needs a new tip, can I just use any tip from a tip repair kit? I measured the rod blank to be 7/64"" at the tip.</p>

<p>Lastly it seems there is at least one eye missing (the biggest one) and needs a new eyelet and winding. What can I use as a replacement eye and where do I learn to wind like this?</p>

<li>With there being a strap around each leg, it wouldn't seem to be a snowboard leash (from the video, I didn't see any competitors remove a leash when taking off their board). </li>
<li>My best guess is some sort of electronic transmitters. If so, to what end? Providing analytics to broadcasters for the ""Maximum / Average Amplitude"" graphics? Data for judges to confirm number of rotations? Data for the athletes/coaches to analyze later?</li>
</ul>

<p>While currently watching the Men's Halfpipe Final, these straps can also be spotted on several competitors (but, perhaps notably, not America's Shaun White). As not every competitor seems to be wearing these, it wouldn't seem to be something mandated by the IOC and thus presumably useful to the snowboarding world in general.

"How to counter bindings getting loose on MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes?","<p>This weekend I was out for the third time on my MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes. I'm pretty happy with them, particularly the traction on ice or heavy crust. However, the bindings are driving me crazy! The bindings are rubber straps with eyelets. They wrap over your foot, and around a hook with a post that catches in the eyelet. The straps are stretchy, and the tension from the stretch holds the strap in place on the post. The excess strap folds back over, and is tucked into a small clip attached loosely to the root end of the strap.</p>

<p>My complaint about the binding is two fold. First, I really have to torque on the straps to hook an eyelet with enough tension to hold it securely on the post. The problem is particularly bad with the heel straps. Second, the excess strap invariably pops out of the tidying clip, and they all end up waving in the air. I then invariably catch the loose strap on something, the strap pops off the post, and I have to stop and re-secure the strap.</p>

<p>Has anybody had a similar experience with these bindings, or am I doing something horribly wrong? What can I do to keep the straps fastened securely?</p>

I've never seen anything like it in Europe; in popular areas, there are simply many campsites and one meets hundreds of people per day (in extreme cases hundreds per hour) on the hiking trails, whereas in remote regions, there are no campsites and one meets nobody (in fact, one usually meets less than 10 people/day once more than two hours from the parking place). It's supply and demand. I haven't seen a full camp-site since 1994, and I've been camping every year.</p>

<p>North America has a lot of sparsely populated areas, probably more than Europe. This makes me wonder — <strong>how crowded do those hiking trails get</strong>? For example, suppose that one has obtained a permit for hiking + camping in the wild in Yosemite National Park. Since this is subject to a quota (correct me if I'm wrong), the total number of people hiking at a given moment should be pretty easy to know. How many people should one expect to meet under such circumstances, order of magnitude? 1 per day? 10? 100? Are quota set so that every hiker can have the opportunity to feel alone in the world, or so that hikers won't completely overrun the national park and destroy it?</p>

<p>Where does the difference between Europe and North America come from? Is nature in North America more sensitive than in Europe, is the demand for hiking much higher, or do hikers in North America concentrate even more in a few small areas than in Europe? </p>

"Primitive fire starting in northeastern Brazil","<p>I live on the coast of the northeastern part of Brazil (Rio Grande do Norte). As you go inland, the terrain becomes very arid. There are cactus and a lot of xerophilic plants that remind me a lot of those from southern California or Arizona. Since the sun is almost always shining here, starting a fire with a magnifying glass isn't very difficult, but if you had to do so with the bow or drill method, what Brazilian plants would work best? Fire-starting methods often involve a spindle and a hearth. What plants or woods would be most suitable for that in the interior regions of northeastern Brazil?</p>

"Where in Europe is wilderness meeting the U.S. wilderness definition?","<p>In <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/3512/566"">this excellent answer</a>, LBell quotes the U.S. definition of wilderness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(1) generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable; (2) has outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation; (3) has at least five thousand acres of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition; and (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any place in Europe that meets these requirements?</p>

<ul>
<li>The far north of Europe, e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1pmi_%28area%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lapland</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_of_the_North"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nordkalotten</a>, is quite sparsely populated and large. It certainly has solitude and in the land pictures below, one can hike for weeks without meeting humans. However, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_people"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sami people</a> have done reindeer husbandry for centuries, in the modern time using snowmobiles and helicopters. Most visitors won't notice the effects on vegetation (but biologists certainly do). Other effects are a lack of predators. The most visible and annoying effect are probably the tracks from the quads the Sami use in their reindeer herding:</li>
</ul>

<p><sup>Tundra with quad-tracks in the far north of Sweden, in Torneträsk-Soppero Fjällurskog Naturreservat</sup></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Scotland, the forests have been cut centuries ago.  Same in most of the rest of Britain, most notably the uplands, where the National Trust in some cases actively combats reforestation.</p></li>
<li><p>In many European countries, protected nature areas appear to be mainly where men has previously <em>tried but failed</em> to exploit the land. The Swedish <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muddus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Muddus national park</a> is an example of that, as is the Dutch nature reserve <a href=""http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naardermeer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Naardermeer</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Polish-Belarusian <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa_Forest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Białowieża Forest</a> is a remnant of a previously vast primeval forest, but has <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bia%C5%82owie%C5%BCa_Forest#History"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an eventful history</a>, and I'm not sure if it would fit the aforementioned definition.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think, if there is wilderness anywhere in Europe (not counting Arctic islands such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Svalbard</a>), it's likely to be in far north--eastern Europe, where there exist vast areas with very few people. For example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komi_Republic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Komi</a> is 415,900 km², roughly the size of California or Sweden, with less than a million people concentrated in a handful of cities. That's probably a wilderness area. Are there any others that are less peripheral?</p>

"What are some good gluten-free foods for backpacking?","<p>I have quite unfortunately found out several months ago that I'm <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten_sensitivity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gluten sensitive</a>. Nearly all my meals I've planned and eaten on the trail have included wheat, and thus gluten, in some fashion.

"Rifugio (Mountain Hut) trek in Austria","<p>I'm interested in combining a three to five day <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_hut"" rel=""nofollow"">""rifugio""</a> based trek in southern Austria with a visit to Vienna.</p>

<p>In other words, I'd like to be able to fly in to somewhere nearby - Vienna, Salzburg, even Munich - and be able to conveniently drive/take public transport to the trail head. If I didn't fly in through Vienna I would want to fly out through it, thus combining a stay there with some hiking, in a place where cooking and a tent are not essential.</p>

<p>For an idea of the kind of place I'm looking for, I'll give two examples of places I've been to (that I liked). In Spain I flew to Barcelona, and took a bus to the Pyrenees and hiked in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aig%C3%BCestortes_i_Estany_de_Sant_Maurici_National_Park#Trekking"" rel=""nofollow"">St.Maurici region</a>. In Italy I flew to Milan and drove to the Dolomites and hiked in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosengarten_group"" rel=""nofollow"">Rosengarten</a>.</p>

<p>My prime ""candidate"" area is <a href=""http://www.nationalpark.co.at/en/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">Gesäuse National Park</a>, based on the answers below. Can anyone confirm that this is a good choice? Or offer a different suggestion? </p>

<p>(English) resources for finding/planning such a trip are of course also welcome. The German sites are difficult to use, even with the automatic translations.</p>

<p>Another thing that would be useful- in mid-July, is it necessary/advised to reserve your place in the rifugios in advance? There are some places where this is essential; in others there's no need even in high season. Obviously, if this is necessary it means a lot more planning is required; if not, I can just decide which way to go after I arrive in the park.</p>

"Sleeping in twos in one hammock","<p>My girlfriend and I both like sleeping in hammocks in the outdoors. We now sleep in two separate hammocks. However, I've seen many hammocks that are designed, or at least make it possible to sleep with two people in it. Most notably these two:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLENEST.html"">ENO DoubleNest Hammock</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLE-DELUXE.html"">ENO DoubleNest Deluxe Hammock</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible advantages</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Warmth</strong>: two people sleeping together is warmer (an advantage in colder environments)</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong>: one hammock is lighter than two hammocks and two tarps</li>
<li><strong>Romantic</strong>: sleeping in two separate hammocks isn't really romantic, after all :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible disadvantages</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Warmth</strong>: two people sleeping together is warmer (a disadvantage in warmer environments)</li>
<li><strong>Space</strong>: it seems to me that you would just keep rolling into each other and won't actually be able to fall asleep; not necessarily from the lack of space, but rather from the natural effect of rolling to the middle of the hammock</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is: has anyone tried <strong>sleeping</strong> (not just relaxing or sitting in it) with two in one of these hammocks? Is it doable? Would you recommend it? </p>

<p>To be honest, I'm fairly skeptical myself, but I wanted to ask this question anyway because of the potential advantages. We also can't try sleeping in it for ourselves, since we both have single hammocks and we don't know anyone who owns a double hammock (and I don't think any store is going to let us try for one night). </p>

<p><em><strong>Please don't just say: that seems/doesn't seem to be a good idea.</strong> I'm looking for people who have actually tried it. I have heard a lot of opinions based on gut feelings already; that is <strong>not</strong> what I'm looking for.</em></p>

"Is a type of walking trailer a good alternative to a heavy backpack in off-road conditions?","<p>Heavy backpacks can spoil the pleasures of being in the outdoors. There are two ways to resolve this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Carry less</li>
<li>Find an alternative to the backpack</li>
</ol>

<p>While the first option is usually the best one, it's not always possible to carry less. If you head into a cold environment where you have few if any opportunities to resupply, you just have to take a lot of food, clothing, etc. and it will make your backpack heavier. </p>

<p>I've been looking into other options. I've stumbled upon the walking trailer. To give a specific example: the <a href=""https://www.radicaldesign.nl/en/products/walking-trailers/wheelie/wheelie-iii-trekking"">Radical Design Wheelie III</a> (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AUuf39RgWc"">video demonstration</a>).</p>

<p>A couple of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has anyone here tried one of these?</li>
<li>How do they behave on off-road terrain? I'm obviously not going to climb a mountain with one of these, but they should be able to handle mild off-road conditions.</li>
<li>Can they handle a bit of (ab)use? I don't want a wheel breaking off in the middle of nowhere.</li>
<li>Is there a cheaper alternative? The Wheelie III costs €550 (about $735): that's quite a lot of money for a bag on wheels.</li>

<li>Is it disturbing or even unsafe to combine the two? Might things start to slide out of position?</li>
<li>Should I be looking for a backpack with no proper padding if I wear a protector?</li>

"Acquiring a Camp Site at the Everest Base Camp","<p>I was just going through the details about processes and dependencies, and associated tough-nuts with planning and executing a trek to Everest Base Camp from Nepal side.
In the same context, I had previously asked a question about travelling and itinerary to reach <em>Namache Bazzaar</em>.</p>

<p>Whilst, I have most of the necessary information about the route and day-viz plan along with the accommodation en-route, I was recently informed by a fellow (who spends a quite a lot of time in and around Himalayas) that with the kind of a season I am looking forward to, I'm <em>most likely</em> gonna find the trek pretty much crowded. As per my current plan, I can somehow put extra efforts and make a way-back trip to EBC instead of staying there, but I'd certainly like to have a stay for a day or two at the EBC and have a look at the level of preparation the summit aspirants have.</p>

<p>Having said this, I also heard a people mentioning that the base camp settlers often mark their sites with spray paints for their clients and all sorts of things, that sounds weird. And as we all know you don't wanna have to bivouac there with extreme weather and amount of littering the expeditions cause. The area around EBC is painted yellow with human waste. Marking a site to acquire it is not a new trend as I see, since Rob Hall had a huge area marked as his campsite by spray paints on and around  boulders saying ""NZ"" which meant ""New Zealand"". With all due respect, that is quite annoyingly stupid. Though it doesn't seem like his direct order, it was his settlers who might have done that.</p>

Should they turn away from the wind (because modern yachts are constructed so that weather helm occurs in stronger wind and th skipper wants to prevent the boat from going into the wind and because the true wind accelerates, so the angle of apparent wind changes and moves more to the back, making the yacht sail more downwind tah before) or turn towards the source of wind (because the closer they get to the no-go zone, the slower will the yacht sail and on the edge of no-go zone yacht sail almost upwards, without the lean)?</p>

"How real is the danger of suffocation in an Igloo?","<p>Last weekend I spent a night in an igloo. The event was organised by professionals (it was a company retreat) and during the night there was always one of the guides awake making rounds and checking on the people in the igloos. They also made sure that the entrances stayed clear (there was some heavy snowfall).</p>

<p>For oxygen, the method the guides used was to put a small candle inside every igloo: their reasoning being that should the candle go out, the people in the igloo would have to be evacuated because the oxygen was getting low (so that was what they were checking on regularly).</p>

<p>I was wondering:</p>

<ul>
<li>How real is the danger of suffocating in an igloo with an open entrance, but without air holes in the cupola?</li>
<li>How real is the danger of suffocating should the entrance (and any potential air holes) be covered by heavy snow fall in the night?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd be interested in an estimate of how much time can pass before you should start to be worried...</p>

<p>And maybe as a follow up:</p>

<ul>
<li>How often would one have to check for clear entrance / air holes in case where there is no person staying up all night?</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's assume an igloo for 3 people (maybe 2m diameter), built with a 'siphon' style entrance of maybe 50cm diameter (i.e. the entrance makes a bend that is the lowest point of the igloo, thus trapping the warm air inside).</p>

<p>I am in Ontario Canada, where hills as small as 75 meters can be referred to as ""mountains"". I'm a relatively experienced cross country skier, but I like the idea of being able to clip in and use alpine turns on steep downhills (even short ones).

"Are liner mittens significantly warmer than liner gloves?","<p>Under a windproof shell mitten, is an insulating liner mitten significantly warmer than an insulating liner glove made of the same material and thickness?</p>

<p>This is a different question from ""<a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/7116/are-mittens-warmer-than-gloves"">Are mittens warmer than gloves?</a>"" because that question is about mittens vs. gloves that <em>aren't</em> inside a windproof shell mitten.</p>

<p>Some facts (I think):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When exposed to the atmosphere, mittens are warmer than gloves because a mitten has less surface area to conduct heat or release water vapor.</p></li>
<li><p>Wind strips away the layer of warm moist air from next to the skin, speeding up conduction and evaporative cooling.</p></li>
<li><p>Insulation works by trapping air (a very slow conductor) close to the skin and slowing down convection within that layer of air -- that's why the walls of buildings are lined with fiberglass batts instead of left empty.</p></li>
<li><p>Wind makes insulation less effective by forcing air through the gaps, causing convection.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Speculation based on that:</p>

<p>Liner mittens and gloves equally do the job of trapping air next to the skin and limiting convection. Inside the windproof shell mitten, either one works at maximal effectiveness. Because there's no material between the liner and the shell to prevent convection, and because the shell doesn't prevent conduction, we can assume the air inside the shell is about the same temperature as the air outside. But the shell <em>does</em> minimize evaporative cooling by minimizing the surface area that's exposed to the wind.</p>

<p>It seems the only difference between the liner mitten and the liner glove is that the glove has more surface area for conduction with the air inside the shell mitten. But is that conduction even significant? It's a confined environment inside the mitten, and the fingers of the liner glove are usually in contact.</p>

"What is the best way to cross a wide river in winter?","<p>Conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>I live near a wide <em>(~1000ft or 300m)</em> and fairly deep river across from the area where I work.</li>
<li>This area is slightly earthquake prone -- near a fault line that has had multiple magnitude 7+ earthquakes.</li>
<li>While there is a bridge nearby, if that bridge were to collapse, the next bridge is another 14 miles (23 km) away... the one after that is another 30 miles (48 km).</li>
<li>The area is a major city region, often with clogged highways even in good weather, and no disasters.</li>
<li>There are probably close to 100,000 people who commute over this river.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a large earthquake were to hit again, it could take out my local bridge.  Assuming that I am escaping on foot, reaching the next bridge is a significant trek.  I live less than 2 miles from this river, so it's the shortest way home (by far).  There are no ferries in this area, either.</p>

<p>In the scenario where I have to rush home to my family after a disaster, what is the best way to cross the river in winter (note: the river rarely freezes, but it is often around 32 F / 0 C in the winter)?  Is the risk too great to try to cross the river (i.e. risk hypothermia from full submersion)?</p>

<p>Something I considered is that if I travelled far enough outside of the city, I could probably hitch a ride, but the traffic might be terrible, or the bridges (if still standing) might be closed due to damage or rubble, thus rerouting traffic very far around (and ultimately away from my home and family).</p>

<p>The river flows at an average surface rate of 2.5 mph (4 kph) -- a little slower than walking speed.  The gage height varies greatly.  As low as 7 ft (2.2 m) and as high as over 30 ft (9.2 m) during heavy periods of rain. The yearly average appears to be around 17 ft (5.2 m).  Temperature data puts it between 10 C and 1 C during the winter months (occasionally with surface freezing).</p>

<p>I don't <em>need</em> to enter the river.  I need to overcome the river in a very rare emergency situation, ONLY.  How do I reduce my risk and minimize the time to get to the other side of the river?  I assume that nearly all solutions will require ""hours"", but I want to avoid ""days"" (i.e. waiting for the national guard to setup travel routes and clear the roads).</p>

"At what wind speed is hiking considered unsafe","<p>I have enough experience with mountain hiking, but in the area where I live (the Alps), the wind rarelly gets extremelly strong, so I have no idea about judging when it is actually unsafe to hike because of high wind speeds. </p>

<p>This winter I was in Tenerife, where I have attempted to climb Mount Teide. Due to public transport limitations I have decided to divide my climb into two days, and spend the night in the hut. On the first day, the wind was already very strong, but being sheltered by the side of the mountain, I had no problems reaching the hut. The people coming back from the peak, however, were all talking about how much trouble they had on the more exposed parts of the mountain. </p>

<p>I was hoping the conditions would get better on the following day. But in the morning the wind picked up even more. It was constantly between 90 and 100 km/h. Since there also was a thick fog, and I would have seen absolutelly nothing from the top of the mountain, I have decided to give up, and head down instead. </p>

<p>Ever since I have been wondering: had I decided to push on to the top, would it have been dangerous? What wind speed is too high for mountain hiking?</p>

<p><strong>Edit as an answer to comments:</strong></p>

<p>There was no snow or ice, so avalanche or slipping dangers were not an issue. The path itself was not technically challenging on its own (in good weather conditions tourists do the last bit after taking a gondola). The climb was super exposed though: no vegetation or shelter at that altitude, and Tenerife being an island, the winds come directly from the ocean. As I haven't been to the top, I am not able to tell how risky a potential fall would have been, but let's assume that like in most places in the mountains, there were at least some spots where the path was passing close to cliffs. </p>

<p>Actually, I do not want to make the question too tailored to this specific situation, because I prefer the answer to be usable in future situations I (or somebody else) will have in the mountains. All I want to know, if there is a specific estimate, how strong should a wind be, to be able to blow an average adult person off a cliff. I do understand that in specific situations where balancing is important (ridge crossing, scrambling or other technical climbing, etc) the safe wind speeds are surelly much lower. </p>

"What is the purpose of being close-hauled when sailing upwind?","<p>When referring to a sailing boats course relative to the wind there are some clearly defined terms like ""beam-reach"", which is exactly perpendicular to the wind. A broader range like ""close-reach"" is defined as between ""beam-reach"" and ""close-hauled"". The latter is what I am not so sure about. Wikipedia defines it as</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the craft's course is as close to the wind as allows the sail(s) to generate maximum lift.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems to make sense in terms of optimizing speed: If you go more leeward the boat with the tightly trimmed sails will capsize and if you go farther windward you'll get slower.<br>
All texts I read mention ""close-hauled"" as the ""normal"" direction when sailing upwind (not explicitly, it's just always the term used). However if your final goal is directly upwind, speed when sailing ""close-hauled"" competes with a direction closer to your final goal when pointing more windward.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once settled on the new tack the Loire’s natural advantages asserted themselves once more. She showed her extra speed and extra weatherliness; she drew up again from Hotspur’s quarter to her beam; then she could luff up briefly and gain a little more to windward on the Hotspur. The minutes passed like seconds, an hour like a minute, as the Hotspur plunged along, with every man braced on the heeling deck and the wind shrieking.</p>
  
  <p>“Time to go about again, sir?” asked Bush, tentatively and greatly daring, but the <strong>theoretically correct moment was passing.</strong></p>

  <p>The French captain was no fool, evidently. <strong>He had observed the Hotspur delaying past the best moment for tacking</strong>, he had seen the squall engulfing her, and had anticipated her action. He must have tacked at the very same moment. In consequence he had lost little while tacking, and that little had been regained by the time the two ships were in sight of each other once more.</p>

<ol>
<li>Grab the carabiner of the cam with my hand and unclip from my harness.</li>
<li>Bite the stem of the cam.</li>
<li>Slide my hand to the cam trigger.</li>
<li>Place cam and clip rope.</li>

"Best method of carrying fruits over a period of 3 days while on a trek","<p>While trekking, I prefer having fruits in the <em>real</em> form, not dried ones and no pulp or juices.</p>

<p>When carried without being squished fruits like apple, litchi and strawberries don't rot in a couple of days. But thats not the case for say citrus fruits like Orange, Sweet Lemon, Lemon or others like Grapes, Sapodilla, etc. </p>

<p><strong>How would you carry these fruits that can rot over a period of two days?</strong> </p>

<p>One can ask a question <em>why carry them?</em> I do understand that you don't want to carry something that can rot. I am more keen about specifically Citrus fruits if not all of them are suitable, since the region I trek in, Oranges and Sweet Lemon are best suited fruits.</p>

<p>This question would typically limit to weather which isn't too extreme. (I agree, <em>extremity</em> differ heavily as we speak about various parts of the world, so I've simply added an ambient temperature range)</p>

<p>Temperature ranges: Maximum of 35 <sup>o</sup>C (95 <sup>o</sup>F) during the daylight, Minimum of 20 <sup>o</sup>C (68 <sup>o</sup>F) during early hours of the day and an hour before sunset.
7 to 10 <sup>o</sup>C (45 to 50 <sup>o</sup>F) during the night.</p>

"Terminology and cues for reading river water when fly fishing","<p>When reading or watching videos on about reading water for fishing in English, I often come across terms like riffle, run, pool, seam, among others. However, when I get o the river ready to float that dry dropper over the riffle, I'm not so sure if I'm targeting the right area. I'm not even sure I perfectly understand what these terms mean.</p>

<p>Can someone help me to make sense of these terms and of which cues should I look for when reading the water.</p>

<p>Specifically: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I often read that seams are where two currents meet each other, but what should I look for? Pictures from the internet don't always look like what I see at the river. I can see that there are different currents when I have my line across more than one, but is that the only way to find seams? What are the general visual cues?</p></li>
<li><p>Pool and run (also beat) are somewhat confusing for me. They seem to refer to the same thing: a stretch of fishable river water. Yet, how do I know where the pool/run/beat starts or ends? I know that this should be at the head/tail of the pool, but what should I look for to find these?</p></li>
<li><p>I learn that riffles are faster shallow parts of the river, and I usually look for white foamy water. What is the difference between that and a rapid? Is it just a matter of semantics?</p></li>

"How much sea water can I safely drink?","<p>Anyone who has played in the ocean knows getting a little sea water in your mouth and swallowing it will not kill you.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seawater contains salt. When humans drink seawater, their cells are thus taking in water and salt. While humans can safely ingest small amounts of salt, the salt content in seawater is much higher than what can be processed by the human body. Additionally, when we consume salt as part of our daily diets, we also drink liquids, which help to dilute the salt and keep it at a healthy level. Living cells do depend on sodium chloride (salt) to maintain the body’s chemical balances and reactions; however, too much sodium can be deadly.</p>
  
  <p>Human kidneys can only make urine that is less salty than salt water. Therefore, to get rid of all the excess salt taken in by drinking seawater, you have to urinate more water than you drank. Eventually, you die of dehydration even as you become thirstier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/drinksw.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Source NOAA</a></p>

<p>If I am thirsty and I drink sea water, it will make things worse. During normal activities if you have taken in some sea water, you will naturally consume enough fresh water (or fluids) to flush excessive salt out.</p>

<p>Maybe the real question is; if you drink sea water, how much fresh water do you need to drink to off set the sea water you drank?  For every 1 unit of sea water, how many units of fresh water do I need to act as an antidote? </p>

<p>As pointed out in answers to the question <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4929"">How safe is drinking distilled water?</a> it takes a lot of energy to make fresh water from sea water. Assume you are in a survival situation, with only sea water available, one of your companions has consumed a quantity (1 unit) of sea water.</p>

"Went fishing on the river for full day, caught one fish; normal?","<p>My dad, brothers and I grew up fishing. However, the vast majority of our fishing has been <code>set it and forget it</code> fishing for catfish, mostly at night.</p>

<p>My dad and father-in-law are in town for Thanksgiving, and so today I decided to take them on a fishing trip. We rented a pontoon, and drove up and down a nearby river fishing for the better part of 7 hours. </p>

<p>We caught one fish.
We had <em>maybe</em> three bites total.</p>

<p>Is this normal? Here are the specifics of what we tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>We're located in central Florida</li>
<li>Mostly trying to not just ""set it and forget it"" but rather attempt to catch something more active (e.g., bass)</li>
<li>We used live minnows, night crawlers, synthetic grubs, and a couple spinner lures.</li>
<li>The majority of the fishing was with live minnows (my dad) and a spinner lure (me)</li>
<li>We would drift along the bank, which would transition from trees to lillypads, and back. Large sections of lillys at a time.</li>
<li>My dad would cast near as he could to the bank, and start a slow draw</li>
<li>I would cast my spinner about 20 ft. into the lillys, and ""hop"" it over them</li>
<li>We would try each spot for about 30-60 minutes before moving on</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure how to fish with a spinner lure. Maybe that was my problem? I would ""hop"" it over the lillys, and then I guess just maintain a steady 'not slow but slow enough' draw until it was back to the boat.</p>

<p>We caught one fish all day. On a rod that we'd cast and set aside while working on something else. A catfish.</p>

<p>Keep doing what you're good at I guess?  :)</p>

<p>Any advice? Any more details I can provide to help with giving me advice?</p>

"Managing the garbage over a lengthy trek at higher altitudes","<p>Following the thread about Everest Base Camp related questions, its almost a globally known fact that the Everest Base Camp is very much crowded and consequently very much into garbage disposal problems.
Various sources talk about the issue:  </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.salon.com/2014/03/04/mount_everests_massive_trash_problem_nepal_cracks_down_on_littering_tourists/"" rel=""nofollow"">(Source 1)</a><br>
<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/03/mount-everest-litter-nepal-climbers"" rel=""nofollow"">(Source 2)</a>  </p>

<p>I guess the kind of people visit the place are not entirely responsible to the garbage, or are they?<br>
These expeditions are lengthy and exhaustive, and they consume a lot of your energy and funds. Most of the visitors prefer to have porters. With such people you can't expect them to pack their own non-biodegradable waste to be brought along to the civilized areas where the waste can be disposed in a proper way. They should do the very best effort to do so, but its practically not possible for everyone to follow the protocol. 
This garbage dump at the Everest Base Camp is really a potential threat to hygiene and can jeopardize an expedition for such a stupid cause.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it the crowd, (or should I say mob) sole reason for it getting that bad with Garbage issue?</li>
<li>I always believe managing own garbage is the way to go in nature, and should be made mandatory by means of well-drafted rules and regulations. But considering the geography, How one should really go about managing <em>own</em> garbage at higher altitudes and camps set at higher altitudes?</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a solid solution to prevent this problem? This would really sound like a very broad issue, and I do not expect an answer here at the forum, this is organizational stuff, but this question has to be raised and talked about.</p>

<p>Narrowing the scope, I'd like to say that as I am planning to go there in near future, not for a summit but for a Base Camp trek, I'd like to receive any suggestions and ideas using which I wouldn't add more to the issue, and can manage my own trash. I always do, but this is going to be a trek of nearly 2 weeks, from Kathmandu, to Kathmandu and that make it a challenge to carry own stuff that too including the garbage.
I am not sure about the garbage disposal infrastructure at Lukla, if there is any. </p>

"How to keep contact lenses from freezing during backpacking in cold temps?","<p>My fiance and I are planning our first backpacking trip together. I am an experienced backpacker, so I can handle most questions he has and I already have most of the gear that we'll need. However, he wears contacts and is worried about losing contacts and keeping his contacts from freezing. He is very near sighted and has astigmatism. I have never worn contacts or glasses so I'm not sure how to deal with this. </p>

<p>Issues: </p>

<p>+Our backpacking trip must occur in spring or fall due to his job, and will probably occur in places where snow and cold temps are possible if not likely. I read that contact solution freezes at 28 °F (-2°C).  I have been out spring backpacking in single-digit temps °F (-18–-12°C).</p>

<p>+His glasses no longer fit his prescription. </p>

<p>+We're a little broke, so buying new glasses ($400! per pair!) or a different type of contact lens is not really doable for us. </p>

<p>+Leaving contacts in overnight is something he will not do. </p>

<p>To handle the losing contacts issue, I am planning on having him bring at least 2 spare pairs of contact lenses (and if he loses 2 contacts, we'll bail). To handle cleanliness issues, I have ordered hand wipes and we'll bring at least two travel bottles of contact solution. So my question is how to keep contacts in the contact case from freezing in cold temps? (Also, any contact-wearing backpackers have any additional tips for backpacking with contacts?)</p>

"Flat bottom boat trolling motor power","<p>I am wondering how to estimate the needed motor power for boating upstream on big rivers like, for example, Danube. (mean the bottom to middle part, i.e. where the Danube is wide and ""slow""?).</p>

<p>To be more exact, let say having an 12' (3.6m) long <em>jon boat</em>, fully loaded with lets say 800lb - how much thrust is needed for going upstream (even with slow speed - but upstream) i.e. having enough power to ""beat"" the river's current).</p>

<p>The practical merit of the question is: will it be enough to use some electric (12V) trolling motor e.g. with 30lb or 55lb thrust?</p>

<p>Do not need some rocket-science based calculations, enough some rule-of-thumb based estimates.</p>

<h1>EDIT</h1>

<p>Because of the comments trying be more precise:</p>

<ul>
<li>I haven't any motor</li>
<li>and I haven't any boat (yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I can't <strong>try</strong> it. (What, of course, would be the obvious solution if I had any boat.) :)</p>

<p>Moreover, I haven't defined any exact river. This question is in the idea-gathering phase - when trying to do <strong>first</strong> and <strong>rough</strong> estimates of the needed gears and or possible solutions.</p>

<p>Everything what I currently know (more or less precise) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I need to move against the current of some rivers (more different rivers, not only specific one). Mostly only for straight river-crossing, but not limited.</li>
<li>I will never use the boat on high-velocity rivers - only on slow &amp; calm waters. e.g. <strong>let say, the max. velocity of the current where I will use the boat is 4 km/hour</strong> (aka approx: 1.11m/s or 2.16 knots)</li>
<li>also, if the wind against will be too strong - will not use the boat. (I'm not sure about this, how to define it more precisely as <em>calm wind</em>).</li>
<li>My (custom made, riveted) boat dimensions will be: max. 3.0 up to 3.6m long and the beam will be approx. max. 0.8 to 1m wide (it is not defined exactly yet).</li>
<li>It will be (sure) flat bottom &amp; straight nose boat - aka like an common <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_small_jon_boat_(johnboat)_in_a_red_pickup_truck.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jon boat</a></li>
<li>The total weight of the boat+motor+batteries+persons+other will be approx. 250 (max.300) kg only. The above 800lb was only for safety. :)</li>
<li>For some reasons (smallest as possible, lightweight motor) I must to use electric motor. (trolling motor)</li>
<li>I will have enough batteries (and also 2Kw electric generator) already onboard...</li>

"how shelf stable is pocket (portable) soup?","<p>This video for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fE5KzvOZRk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Portable Soup</a> (aka Pocket Soup) from James Townsend popped up in my feed.  If you don't know (like I hadn't until I saw the video) Pocket Soup is basically a shelf-stable ultra-reduced stock.  It pretty much looks like leather, stores in a tin, but dissolves into boiling water in minutes.  In this video on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU8Tw8L3-2Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spring soup</a>, James cooks all of his dry goods and foraged greens and only adds the Pocket Soup at the very end.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued enough that I'm now halfway through the process; if it works half-way as well as Townsend suggests in the soup video, I think this will be a really nice addition to camping menus.  Using an electric crock-pot, it's dead easy to make.  Mostly, I've been letting it cook or steam while I've done nothing.  (I haven't started the drying process yet, so I may yet change my mind on exactly how easy it is.)</p>

<p>Sadly, I didn't get the right cut of meat, so I cheated and added gelatin packets.  I don't think that will affect things for the worse.  (In fact, maybe purified gelatin will make it more shelf stable?)</p>

<p>According to my not-so-rigorous research (i.e. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_soup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the wikipedia article</a>), it seems to have been stable even in fairly hot climates.  But, given that the wiki article seems to be based on historical documents (and I have no idea how faithful to the original recipe James's version is), and it doesn't sound like there is any contemporary examinations of shelf-life of the gelled stock / leather, I am curious about how shelf stable the Pocket Soup will be.  In particular, I wonder about temperature and melting the leather chunks into a blob.  The wiki article mentioned that one cook rolled the pieces in flour; I'll probably try corn flour.  I imagine this will help with any sticking, but not any melting.</p>

<p>One of the things that has me worried is that there is no salt added.  When I think of long-term, shelf-stable foods, I usually assume that they have been cured or salted.  James's recipe uses no salt in making the leather. </p>

<p><strong>If you have experience with making / using Pocket or Portable Soup, have you noticed any shelf-life problems or temperature problems?</strong>  </p>

Even in the level I climb at the moment there are many holds I cannot use which my peers climbing at a similar level utilize without any problems.

"Do Eastern grey squirrels pretend to bury nuts in the ground?","<p>I recently heard that <a href=""http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Sciurus_carolinensis/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eastern grey squirrels</a> sometimes dig holes, pretend to bury nuts, or other food, and then cover the empty holes. I was told that they use all the same motions and effort as they would if actually burying a nut for future consumption. Sometimes they even have a nut in their mouth, and at some point during the process, they store it deep into their cheek, so squirrels watching them assume their mouth is empty. </p>

<p>The purpose is to deceive those onlooking squirrels, or to lead squirrels who arrive later on a <a href=""https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/wild-goose-chase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wild goose chase</a>, searching for stashed food to steal where there isn't any.  </p>

"Protecting climbing skins without a protective mesh","<p>During my recent ski touring trip I have forgotten the protective mesh of my climbing skins in the car. I have noticed my mistake when on the top of the mountain, but by then it was way too late. Not having a better idea, I have stuck the two skins together, and hoped for the best. This was not a good idea. Once at home, I had big problems taking the two skins apart. I am afraid I might have even damaged the skins somewhat. And the edges of the skins that were not alighned properly got some fluff on the glue anyway. </p>

<p>Was there any way to protect my skins better? I thought about just rolling them up, but then I would have gotten fluff from the back of the skins all over the glue? Maybe I should have stuck them on my backpack? But it was not exactly clean.. Should I have tried to get some garbage bags or some paper? But that could have gotten stuck and break when taking it off? The best idea I came up with, albeit too late, was to stick as much snow as possible on the skins, and then put them together. Would that have worked?</p>

(March 06, 2018):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have you recently spotted people toting trash bags while jogging? Or
  their hands filled with old plastic bottles? You might soon.</p>
  
  <p>Sweden’s latest fitness craze — plogging — is making its way to U.S.
  shores. The term is a mash-up of jogging and the Swedish “plocka upp,”
  meaning pick up. In this case, litter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further on in the article, it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Think squats while jogging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Several times a year, I walk and pick up trash, using a grabber which means I don't squat much and don't have to touch the stuff I pick up.  <strong>I am trying to envision what, exactly, I would do if I were jogging instead of walking.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Let's dispose of the safety concerns.</strong>  Assume a straight road with little traffic, wide shoulders and wide verges (the unpaved strip adjacent to the shoulders), and no poison ivy in the verges, none of which apply to my road.  I have to be on full alert while .... plalking (?).</p>

<p>Does one squat and pick up on the fly, without slowing down?  That seems difficult.  Does one jog one way and concentrate on picking up on the return trip?  </p>

<p>How does one avoid getting imbalanced after picking up a lot of stuff, or does one carry two bags, one in each hand?  A U.S. plogger who plogs along the Alexandria, VA waterfront says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are an alarming number of full diapers...They turn my stomach
  the most.</p>

<p>Here is a new outdoor sport, with great benefits to the individual practicing it and to the great outdoors.  <strong>What is the most efficient and effective way to plog?</strong> </p>

<p>Addendum in response to a comment:  People pick up other people's litter on hiking trails, in the backcountry, and on beaches too, and good for them, but this question is about the mechanics of doing this while jogging, as opposed to walking. </p>

<p>To clarify: I'm not talking necessarily talking about going up mountains and being in the snow here, snow in that sense can be warm, and easy to brush off. I'm talking about camping out in the open, it's wet from rain or sleet or dew and that water has then turned to frost or ice overnight.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.wildlifeincrisis.com/guidelines/fawns.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Wildlife in Crisis</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not touch the fawn! This could cause the mother to reject it.</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.nativeanimalrescue.org/understanding-deer/"" rel=""nofollow"">Native Animal Rescue</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fawns are born scent-free and have white camouflage spots which
  protect them from predators. The doe continues to keep her babies
  scent free by consuming her fawns urine and droppings. This is yet
  another reason why humans should never touch a fawn. Leaving human
  scent on their body will attract predators to the fawn.</p>

<p>Here's a German reference which I want to share: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Typisch für junge Kitze ist ein Geruch nach saurer Milch und Harn. Die
  Milch gelangt auf das Fell der Kitze, wenn sie sich nach dem Saugen

"Leader injured during multipitch trad climb, what to do?","<p>I've been working on improving my self-rescue skills, but the skills I've learned so far seem to pertain mostly to single-pitch climbing. For example, a lot of people emphasize knowing how to escape a belay, which is fine, but that seems to be mostly applicable to the situation where you're giving someone a belay from below on a single-pitch climb, you can't just lower them (maybe because they'd end up on a ledge), and you need to run and get help.</p>

<p>If you're in the middle of a multi-pitch climb, it seems like it escaping the belay may not be relevant, or may at best be only part of the solution.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many different possible self-rescue situations that could come up in multipitch trad. But one likely-seeming situation I can come up with is that I'm giving someone a lead belay, he gets injured too badly to be able to up- or downclimb, and we have more than half the rope out, so I can't just lower him all the way.</p>

<p>What do you do in this situation? My best guess would be to lower him down to the lowest piece of protection I can get him to, escape the belay, ascend the rope, improve that piece of pro to a solid anchor, secure him to the anchor, and free the rope from the gear higher up (either by climbing and cleaning, or by untying and pulling the rope through). Then maybe clip him in to the rope with a locking biner, lower him to the belay station, have him unclip, and then rap down to the belay station myself (possibly leaving a lot of gear). Wow, this seems complicated and difficult, especially if I can't see the situation clearly from the belay station.</p>

<p>I think a solution to this problem would also pretty much apply to single-pitch climbing in an area where it's not possible to run and get help, e.g., because you're in a remote area.</p>

<p>Question: what would be some general strategies for dealing with this type of situation?</p>

"How to get the best results when applying gelcoat with a brush?","<p>I just finished applying gelcoat to my boat. Results were less than wonderful.</p>

<p>I have some experience, with bondo, fiberglass and painting, so it did not seem like it should be to difficult to get reasonably good results.  Still I did a lot of research online before choosing a product and beginning the operation.  I choose 'TotalBoat White Gelcoat' as the most promising product, I found the most negative review of the product and researched what the best methods for not repeating their experience (see: <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14297/in-a-boat-repair-what-would-cause-gelcoat-not-to-harden"">In a boat repair, what would cause Gelcoat not to harden?</a>)</p>

<p>I prepped the boat, sanding, patching cracks (fiberglass), filling (bondao), sanding and finishing up with a acetone wash, before starting to apply the gelcoat in a heated, vented, humidity controlled garage.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ii43F.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ii43F.jpg"" alt=""Nearly ready for gelcoat""></a></p>

<p>Doing the math it came out that one quart of gelcoat would be a bit more then one coat on my 14 foot sunfish hull. Experience with rolling paint and quick setup time once harder is added, drove me to choose a brush.  I was worried about the amount of product the roller would absorb combined with curing quicker then I could full apply one coat.  I choose to use a brush mixing and applying gelcoat in 4 ounce batches. While the product did not give directions for mixing less then quart size batches, multiple online reference indicated 7 to 12 drops per ounce at 70 degrees F gave good results. </p>

<p>I purchased two quarts of TotalBoat White Gelcoat, one without wax for the first coat(s) and one with wax for the top coat. I mixed and applied a first coat just to the areas where I had sanded to bare fiberglass, I used paint strokes fore to aft.  Because I had purchased relatively cheap brushes, there was some issue with loosing bristles in the gelcoat and having to pluck them out (<strong>Next time buy better brushes!</strong>) About 8 hours later it had dried nicely with a light tack as unwaxed gelcoat should.  I mixed and applied a second coat to the entire hull (6 small batches), using port to starboard strokes. I let it cure overnight and the next morning it was perfect.  </p>

<p>First thing in the morning, I began mixing and applying the waxed gelcoat as the final coat, fore to aft stokes. At 7 drops to the ounce I had only used about half of the catalyst from the first quart, so I continued using the same catalyst with the second quart. Really Really need to spend more then a dollar per brush next time! You throw them away at the end, but all those loose bristles are a major pain. </p>

<p>4 hours after fishing the final coat about 50% of the bottom (upside) hull was shinning over as the wax helped the final coat set completely, the gelcoat on the sides did not appear to have cured at all, it was still wet to the touch. 8 hours after finishing the final coat and there was not much change. Having done my research, I knew part of the solution was waxed paper so I covered the entire hull of the boat with waxed paper.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYS1n.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYS1n.jpg"" alt=""waxed paper on boat""></a></p>

<p>A new box of wax paper with 75 square feet is almost enough, had to run to the store for a second box.  I left the wax paper in place until the following evening (30ish hours after final coat) when I removed it, the gelcoat was mostly cured.  It was difficult to apply smoothly, some areas had wrinkles, if there was air in the wrinkle it was still tacky.  The sides were still kind of wet (sticks to your finger when you touch it, as opposed to a clean finger tacky feel with the first two coats).  I pulled off the wax paper, mostly it removed nicely.  In the places where the gelcoat was still wet it was messy.  I used the same wax paper just turned it over and reapplied to the areas that were not completely cured. Another 24 hours later the gelcoat had completely set. But is is not smooth.  I had anticipated some sanding because I used a brush, but this is far from just some brush marks.  Applying the wax paper to such a larger area (<em>with a liberal application of profanity</em>) resulted in a very uneven final surface.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4w4IX.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4w4IX.jpg"" alt=""Bottom after wax paper""></a></p>

<p>It is winter now, and the boat is going outside, so the car can come in, it will be spring before I begin sanding the hull and considering the application of another layer of gelcoat to make up what I am going to have to remove to make it smooth.</p>

<p>What can I do next time to get a better cure, and smoother final coat in this DIY project?</p>

"Is there an easy way to tell if a bee in my yard is being raised in a hive (domestic), or if it's wild (feral)?","<p>I live in Massachusetts, in the Northeastern region of the United States. </p>

<p>As a lover of bees, I'd like to learn how to identify some varieties, including their behavior, and how they're raised. Major types of bee habitats include domestic, meaning hand-raised in hives by beekeepers, frequently in someone's yard; and wild (also called feral), being raised without human intervention, in the woods and other natural areas. </p>

<p>When I have bees eating in my yard, I'd like to know how to tell if they're being raised in a local hive, or if they live in the wild but are stopping by on their way someplace else? One reason I ask is, if they're being raised locally, I'd like to try to find the beekeeper! </p>

<p>This question was inspired by a different <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/13880/do-bees-at-the-hummingbird-feeders-keep-the-birds-away"">question</a> about the possible effect of bees on hummingbirds at the hummingbird feeders in my yard.  </p>

<p>A former beekeeper, 243DRob, posted a comment, in part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those are domesticated honey bees. They came from a local hive within 3 miles of your home. The bees will use your ""nectar"" to make honey. If their hive is owned by a beekeeper (most likely), then your ""nectar"" will end up in the honey they sell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was fascinated to learn that. Obviously, as a beekeeper, a quick look at a picture was all he needed to make the identification. As a layperson, can I learn to do it without much difficulty? </p>

<p>What obvious things should I look for? What about size; shape; color; how they interact with each other or birds; which flowers they like; which type of hummingbird nectar or feeder; the time of the day; the month or season; the presence or absence of other pollinators; or some other variable I haven't mentioned? </p>

"Why does the 528 thickness lines only appear on weather maps in the future?","<p>I've been learning about snow forecasting in the UK. I've learned an important feature is the atmosphere thickness, specifically the <strong>528 line</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pressure decreases with altitude, and thickness measures the
  difference in height between two standard pressure levels in the
  atmosphere. It is proportional to the mean temperature of this layer
  of air, so is a useful way of describing the temperature of an
  airmass.</p>
  
  <p>Weather charts commonly show contour lines of 1,000-500 hPa thickness,
  which represent the depth (in decametres, where 1 dam = 10 m) of the
  layer between the 1,000 hPa and 500 hPa pressure levels. Cold, polar
  air has low thickness, and values of <strong>528 dam or less frequently bring
  snow to the UK</strong>. Conversely, warm, tropical air has high thickness, and
  values in excess of 564 dam across the UK often indicate a heatwave.</p>

"What to do about slippery plastic soles of cross country ski boots","<p>I have a relatively new pair of NNN cross-country ski boots and noticed the plastic sole is much more slippery than previous boots I've owned (older SNS and SNS Profil).

I occasionally have to walk not ski wearing these boots, so I'm looking for a creative solution to deal with this--and I'm guessing others have dealt with and hopefully solved the problem already. </p>

<p>I assume sanding the soles wouldn't help, as the plastic is already relatively rough. Or perhaps I could slip something over the boot when I need to walk with it, like a rubber? Or perhaps there are new models of boots that don't have slippery soles. Back-country NNN/SNS boots look quite sturdy, maybe they have better soles (I know that would require new bindings, but I'm open to that too)? Or will the soles get less slippery with time?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/trekking-poles-hiking-staffs.html"">REI</a> has an interesting article on Trekking Poles, and in the article it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nordic walking poles are a modified version of trekking poles. REI does not currently carry poles designed for Nordic walking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it gives no actual details what the <em>modifications</em> are.</p>

<p>So: how is a nordic pole different than a trekking pole?  Can I at all realistically use one for both purposes, and what will I be trading off if I do?</p>

"Can body-to-body rewarming be used as a last resort treatment of hypothermia?","<p>All of the arguments I've heard against using this method assume that you have adequate supplies for alternate rewarming methods. If you literally didn't, and it appeared they were going to freeze to death anyway, would you have a whole lot to lose? Of course, if you felt yourself starting to get hypothermic as well, then I'd guess you should stop and reassess the situation, but should you at least try this method first?</p>

"no weapons Fighting large cat with bare hands","<p>Recently there was a news article about a <a href=""https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-02-06/denver-colorado-jogger-strangles-mountain-lion-in-trail-attack/10785108"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Colorado jogger who was attacked by a mountain lion</a> and killed the mountain lion with their hands (ie, no weapon).</p>

<p>What are the effective ways, with no weapons, to defend against a large cat?</p>

<p>Are there anatomical differences which create vulnerabilities for large cats?</p>

<p>Additional notes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The solo backpacking question does not address the specific questions I listed.</p></li>
<li><p>I talked with a friend who is a surgical vet, and he thought going for thumbs in eyes, and  then thumbs on the trachea would be a good first line strategy. This strategy will result in bites but if administered early in an attack, risk is somewhat mitigated.</p></li>
<li><p>Another friend, who was a special forces member, killed several dogs, but had weapons (in one case just a stick which was used to smash the skull).  He is intrigued and researching the matter.  </p></li>
<li><p>I was able to find an article which talked about the anatomical vulnerabilities of dogs, as well as their instincts.  But that didn't address cats.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am not looking for hiking advice, I am asking about killing predatory cats with bare hands.  In the instance mentioned, it has been released that the victim was able to suffocate the cat. There is no mention of blinding her.</p>

<p>I will probably edit this out later, but on my property I have had large cats, and seen them. One paced a neighbor out for his morning jog.  I have also had feral dogs, which I and others encountered, and I eliminated. </p>

"Why would a polar bear give away his kill?","<p>I am reading <em>Three Among the Wolves</em> by <a href=""https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&amp;objectid=11813393"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Helen Thayer</a>, who is best known for walking and skiing to the North Magnetic Pole accompanied only by her husky, Charlie. </p>

<p>In a subsequent trip, she and her husband spent nearly a year observing the behavior of three wolf packs in three different parts of Canada.  This question is about the pack observed <strong>on the ice</strong> of the Beaufort Sea, to the northwest of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuktoyaktuk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tuktoyaktuk</a>, <strong>in winter.</strong>  (In spring, the wolves move back to land.)  This pack of wolves scavenged off the kills of polar bears.  As Thayer says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Polar bears, the primary hunters, killed the prey [the seals] and then
  ate mostly the fat. Wolves and foxes then shared the meat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the National Geographic Society's article <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/scavenger/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Scavenger</em></a>, scavengers are the janitorial staff of the ecosystem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scavengers play an important role the food web. They keep an ecosystem
  free of the bodies of dead animals, or carrion. Scavengers break down
  this organic material and recycle it into the ecosystem as nutrients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even more startling than wolves as scavengers, was the incident Thayer describes -- wolves as recipients of the largesse of a polar bear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...The bear thrust his head into the seal hole...He hauled out a
  thrashing seal, crushed its head, and without stopping to eat, walked
  to the edge of the ice and stared into the water.  The three
  wolves....[rushed] to the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bear ate none of this kill.</p>

<p>On reading the first quote, I postulated that the bear ate only the blubber because it was more efficient to capture another seal, rich in blubber, than to pick at the meat; the wolves were simply filling a niche by scavenging the bear's leftovers, as were the arctic foxes who also followed the bears on the ice. </p>

<p>But it is harder to explain the bear's behavior in the second quote.  This seems like pure altruism on the part of the bear (which seems unlikely), or an isolated incident.  So, my question:</p>

<p><strong>Has this ""altruistic"" behavior been reported in other sources for polar bears -- or for any large predator with respect to scavengers -- and if so, what benefit does the polar bear (or other large predator) gain from it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Addendum:  Possibly pertinent fact</strong> prompted by comment by @Chris H: The pack of wolves on the sea ice numbered eleven, one of whom had an injured paw.  There were at least six polar bears nearby.  The wolves waited respectfully for the bears to leave their kills before darting in.  </p>

"How much experience is needed for crossing the Mendenhall Glacier?","<p>I'm planning a backpacking trip to Juneau with some friends next summer and was interested in taking the North Ridge route to Bullard Mountain (see: <a href=""https://www.summitpost.org/bullard-mountain/930372"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.summitpost.org/bullard-mountain/930372</a>). The route involves crossing the Mendenhall Glacier though, which I don't have any experience with. Based on the time of year (and the only way I'd consider crossing), the glacier would be dry.</p>

<p>I've been interested in learning mountaineering skills, so I've read enough on the subject to know that you shouldn't just go out without any experience or preparation. But, most of what I find is about the dangers of wet glaciers. When I read Glacier Mountaineering by Andy Tyson, he mentions that travel below the firn line is normally done unroped because you can see the dangers and can't do much to arrest a fall.</p>

<p>So is it smart to travel cautiously across a dry glacier, with the proper equipment, but without much practical experience? (Assuming one thoroughly studies features and danger signs beforehand) Or is this just as dangerous as crossing a wet glacier?</p>

<p>Or, is the Mendenhall glacier in particular a bad idea for someone like me to even think about approaching? Thanks!</p>

"Portable power generator ballpark fuel consumption","<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>
What is a likely value for fuel consumption for a small portable 4-stroke gasoline-powered inverter power generator in, say, litre / ( kilowatt * hour )?</p>

<p>At times I attend music festivals where you camp outside for a few days and go see bands perform in the afternoon and evenings. Some of them permit the use of power generators, and I got myself one as described above rated for max. 1000 watts continuous power draw. My group won't use that much, but that's what I got when I aimed for the smallest 4-stroke inverter model.</p>

<p>Among my questions is now how to estimate the amount of fuel to bring with me to a given event, and unfortunately the spec sheet and other resources shipped with the unit do not feature any fuel consumption figures/curves/tables.</p>

<p>I do have a rough estimate of the power draw and duration.</p>

<p>Typically the power generator will be run from the morning into the afternoon, let's say 08:00..14:00, which is when people hang out at the camp site killing time until the bands start. From afternoon on it's seeing the bands until late into the night, after which people come back exhausted and in various stages of inebriation and usually just drop into their tents – running a generator at that kind of time is a jerk move that is guaranteed to bring the rightful wrath of your camp neighbors upon you.</p>

<p>While the generator is being used you will run a fridge for the drinks, some music setup for nice tunes, and a bunch of small power supplies charging various devices such as smartphones and power banks. If you're fancy you might have a table fan for when it's really hot. So let's add these up:</p>

<ul>
<li>80 W - (small) fridge</li>
<li>50 W - music</li>
<li>5 * 10 W - smartphones etc. being charged</li>
<li>40 W - table fan</li>
</ul>

<p>That's 220 W of continuous power draw (the fridge will be running its compressor continuously because it starts out warm and is made extensive use of). Multiply that with the 6 hours of daily use and we get about 1300 Wh, and if the festival lasts for 4 days we're at about 5300 Wh, or 5.3 kWh, drawn at roughly a quarter of the generator's rated output.</p>

<p>So … how much gas does that <strong>roughly</strong> equate to?
I have been searching around for some ballpark figures, but I only seem to find various tables that are too specific and not readily applicable to my problem.</p>

"How to measure combined clothing and sunscreen?","<p>As I understand it, you can't combine multiple suncreens to combine their SPF values.  This makes sense as they all work on the same concepts and your skin can't simply ""hold more"" because it's two different brands.</p>

<p><em>But how do you measure combined sunscreen</em> and <em>clothing?</em>
Or for that matter, combined layers of clothing?</p>

<p>My instinct is that you would <em>multiply</em> them:</p>

<pre><code>Clothing:   UPF 3, passes 33% of UV.  C=0.33
Sunscreen:  SPF 5, passes 20% of UV.  S=0.20
Total = C * S = 0.066, or SPF 15
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone confirm this?</p>

<p>Bonus question:  <em>What about tan + sunscreen?  Would they add, multiply, or just be the maximum of the two?</em>  I'm guessing it's <em>not</em> the last because black skin with a natural SPF of around 13 still benefits significantly from an SPF 15 sunscreen.</p>

"How do squirrels find buried nuts?","<p>Squirrels bury nuts for future consumption, sometimes many months away.

I'd like to know what conditions and accommodations might be the most conducive to keeping those big birds here.  </p>

<li>houses, sheds or other structures</li>

"Crossing small corners of a glacier when hiking in summer","<p>I am planning to do a 3-day hike combined with multiple via ferratas this summer in the Brenta Dolomites in Italy. I haven't done the big research yet, but from looking at the (hiking) map I can see that I will need to cross a couple of (what looks like) very small corners of a glacier. I estimate the crossings to be no longer than a few hundred meters. How serious those glacier crossings could possibly be? Is it likely that there would be cracks big enough to fall in at the edge of a glacier? Can there be snow covered cracks in July/August at around 3000 meters?

<p>But what if you order a bare shaft (which comes without a nock) at full length. If they say 31"" does it mean that this shaft would be ca. 30,5"" or do they actually have 31"", so that my arrow would be 31"" + ~0,5""? </p>

<p>What happens if a shaft has a nock attached from scratch? Are they measured from the bottom of the groove to the end of the shaft? </p>

"How to prepare for a long rocky alpine route, which is unusual for me?","<p>I would like to prepare for a long route (700 m altitude gain, 12-16 hours, including descent, with alpine start), one like which I have never [successfully] climbed before. It involves many sections of roped climbing, mixed with longer sections of what should be unroped exposed scrambling. I have done longer easy routes (ones not requiring a rope), and shorter trad routes (roped climbing all the way up).</p>

<p>The problem for me there is the change from roped to unroped climbing and back. When I decide where I need to change, it's usually too late, and every such mistake costs time. For example, if we climb without a rope and get to a more technical place, it's usually very inconvenient (=wasting time) to unpack the rope. And the other way around: if we climb with rope and protection, and come to a section that doesn't require it, I have to realize that early (which I usually fail), so we can pack the rope and move more quickly.</p>

<p>So it's the mixture of ""roped"" and ""unroped"" that makes me waste a lot of time and abort the route (2 unsuccessful attempts so far on similar routes). I would like to do some training in that regard; however, here is my problem:</p>

<p>I don't have proper mountains where I live; ones that come close are 200-300 metres high and easier than needed; we also have 1-pitch routes of any difficulty but I guess this doesn't help at all.</p>

<p>So how can I prepare as good as I can for such a route? Should I climb the short sections I have access to, repeatedly (it gets boring, really fast)? In bad weather? With an oversized backpack?</p>

<p>P.S. I have inflated the expected time for the route; it's 8-12 hours officially but experience shows that I have to apply some factor to it.</p>

"What are ways to reduce swinging momentum when climbing?","<p>I'm working on a problem in bouldering where the swinging of my feet take the grip away from my fingers and throw me off.</p>

<p>Specifically, I am in a bat-hang, and need to reach an edge hold about 3.5 ft. away from my hand's current hold. I cannot reach this edge without my feet slipping off. But of course, when my feet do slip, even when I manage to grab the next edge, the swing of my legs inevitably throws me off from the other side.</p>

<p>I can include a photo to show what I'm doing, but I mean to ask a general question:</p>

<p><strong>What are some things I can do to minimize that swing?</strong></p>

<p>I saw several others doing the same problem, release one foot from the bat-hang and bring their knee to their chest, as if to compact. I see that this reduces mass at the outer radius of my body being accelerated by gravity.</p>

<p>Is there anything else I can do? I tried slowly slipping my last foot off the bat-hang, but that's only reducing the foot's fall by a few inches (while destroying the top of my shoes).</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Here are some photos of the specific problem I'm working on. But I've had the same question in other problems, anywhere where the feet come off while reaching for a hold.</p>

"Are nuts and cams less safe if the rock is wet?","<p>In (probably) most of northern Europe, it is somewhat cold and wet outside. Despite this fact, I'm trying to get as much outdoor climbing done as I can. </p>

<p>A backup plan for somewhat cold weather (i.e. around/slightly above 0°C) would be to try aid climbing, but we're wondering if this is a safe idea.
My question is, as the title says: </p>

Does this change if the temperature is around the freezing point?</strong> (Bonus points for references from official sources, e.g. manufacturers or climbing associations.)</p>

<p>This is not about heavy rain with water pouring down the rocks, but more about rock that hasn't completely dried from rainfall a few days past (or at most a light drizzle while climbing) where there might remain some really wet spots on the inside of some cracks or flakes. The temperature would be mostly above 0°C, but where one can't see beforehand with 100% certainty that there aren't any frozen spots in some of the cracks. </p>

<li>We had to remain that way for a couple of hours, later when we observed that the noise of bees had gone low, we thought we could move. I descended with the group, while I knew I had to return to assist the remaining half of the group.</li>

"Different kinds of Down: comparing insulation","<p>There's many different kinds of ""down"" filling:
""100% down"" must legally be only down, while ""down"" can be any mixture containing down.</p>

<p>Is there any quantitative data about just how much the thermal insulation ability VARIES from the ""worst"" down to the ""best"" down?  In other words, is it possible that spending 10X as much $$$ on high-end down can make a significant difference in insulation, or is it negligible? </p>

The trek took us around an altitude of 3500 meters(15000 ft). When we were there, our guide advised us not to cover up our ears. According to him, covering up the ears would increase the time required to acclimatize. At the same time, covering up one's ears keeps the body warm. So is there any validity in not covering up the ears at higher altitudes? 
Also, by not covering up the ears, is there a risk of exposing oneself to harmful cold weather?</p>

"How would you evaluate sailing lessons for adults?","<p>I am lucky enough to live within an hour of several cities (or large towns) on Lake Ontario, and near ""cottage country"" which is full of lakes. I'm considering a learn-to-sail program this summer. A quick search reveals a large array of possibilities, all requiring about an hour's drive each way. Some of the distinguishing features among them are:</p>

<ul>
<li>the size of the boat you're learning on. I think I would prefer dinghies (14 foot) to the 20+ and even 40+ foot options at some places. How different is the experience? Can you learn more easily on a big stable boat, then apply that to a dinghy, or vice versa?</li>
<li>the size of the lake - Lake Ontario behaves very differently than a small cottage lake, I'm sure, but I don't know precisely how they would differ</li>
<li>the likelihood that I would want to join the club or association that offers the lessons, and use their facilities after the lessons are over</li>
<li>the schedule. Once a week all summer, 6 consecutive evenings, 3 full days, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not looking for recommendations of specific clubs. I am looking for <strong>the relative importance of these factors</strong> to the overall experience of taking the lessons. I am reasonably hard to train - if I can't follow what's going on I get angry and stop wanting to participate, but if I feel I'm being patronized or the level is too introductory I tune out. Spending hundreds of dollars on a training course that I bail on partway through, or that is not fun at all, is something I want to avoid. Feeling stupid because I can't follow instructions everybody else can follow, or do something that a mere child can do, or that I should know how to do because I knew it when I was 12 (and could sail a dinghy alone) is the major reason I would resist doing this. The typical summer camp experience where the counselor talks for 5 minutes, then sticks everyone in boats and some of them are great at it and one person is stuck up against the bushes and can't seem to get turned around and is just melting down and has to be rescued but doesn't end up actually being able to work the boat - that's the situation I desparately want to avoid. If a particular size of boat or lake, or pace of training, or qualification of the offering organization, can contribute to the success of this project, I would like to know.</p>

<p>I have some experience as a child with very small boats and a little with a 26 footer. I don't like engines. I believe I might enjoy using a boat that is small enough to actually land somewhere, and there are plenty of lakes in Ontario, whether a small cottage lake that you can see across, or something bigger like Georgian Bay or the Thousand Islands, that we could sail on if we wanted to. We could also try renting a small sailboat (again, small enough that you don't anchor and row ashore in a dinghy, but you pull up on the beach or to a dock) in more far flung places like the South Pacific as part of a larger trip. A picnic on a deserted isle or a tootle around a lagoon would be lovely.</p>

"Is there really no way to rescue a climber from the death zone?","<p>I have watched many documentaries about accidents on Everest and what I learned is, that it is impossible to rescue anybody from the death zone. It is simply too hard for the sherpas, or anybody else to carry somebody. So, when a climber is unable to stand on his own feet, he is left there, basically to die. If other groups on the way up or down encounter the individual, they leave them there and continue upwards or downwards.</p>

<p>Now, I realize, that it is hard and dangerous enough to carry your own body weight up and down and attempting to carry someone would result in critical danger for the rescuer. </p>

<p>But are there, or have there been discussions of developing a method to somehow rescue people in these situations?</p>

<p>What I have in mind are the following, probably stupid ideas, sorted from least to most preposterous:</p>

<p>1) Abort ascents, organize a rescue group and bring the person more supplies: oxygen bottles and blankets, maybe even a tent or other way of keeping them warm, until they get better. Maybe even put them in a portable compression chamber. This should be theoretically doable.</p>

<p>2) Put the person on a sleigh or ski and let them take their chances riding down some of the way at least or have multiple people pull them, which should be less impossible, than carrying them.</p>

<p>3) Have the person paraglide down in tandem with a sherpa or alone (after a short instruction). Let's assume, the person is well enough to wait for someone to carry the chute up to them.</p>

<p>4) Put the person on a rebreather with full face mask on. This should be able to eliminate the oxygen starvation or at least give them more time.</p>

<p>5) If the groups is 10 people strong, attach the climber to a hammock or some rope contraption and divide the weight among the group.</p>

<p>6) Have a rope installed on one of the steeper, longer walls or slopes and let the person down, until he reaches a lower point, even if that lower point is not very easily accessible, just to kill some altitude.</p>

<p>What ideas so far have been explored by the community in order to solve this problem? What discussions are there or have there been?</p>

<p>I know that most of these are probably stupid, but somehow I can't believe, that the only option there can ever be is to leave people for dead there. There have been well-known climbers, who criticize the practice of leaving people for dead. However, as far as I know, those well-known climbers haven't provided practical solutions to the problem.</p>

"How can I tell if there's a camouflaged octopus in a coral reef, so I can keep from disturbing it?","<p>This question is based on my desire to avoid disturbing, injuring, or scaring away an octopus which is camouflaged to look like a coral reef. Since it's so difficult to see, I'd like to know how to tell where it is! Corals are sensitive animals and easily killed, so purposely touching them is not an option. </p>

<p>Octopus behaviors are similar across the species, so the question isn't just about the one I'm describing, and all answers are welcome! </p>

<p>One species of Caribbean reef octopus is mainly bright blue with a bit of brown on the head. (The blue glows in the dark!) Like other octopus they completely camouflage themselves to blend in with the coral in the reef. It's so vital to their survival that if they move to a different colored location, they change their colors to match. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Caribbean reef octopus is an absolute master of disguise and one of the most intelligent known invertebrates. Individuals of this species can completely change their color from one moment to the next using specialized color cells called chromatophores. In doing so, they often perfectly blend with their surroundings, even when settled on a surface with multiple colors. They also have such amazing control of their skin and muscles that they can match the texture of their surroundings as well. <strong>A camouflaged Caribbean reef octopus can be nearly impossible to see.</strong>  (Emphasis mine.)<br>
  <a href=""https://oceana.org/marine-life/cephalopods-crustaceans-other-shellfish/caribbean-reef-octopus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The life of a Caribbean reef ends with reproduction. The male dies shortly after mating. The camouflaged female burrows in and incubates up to 1,000 eggs without leaving them or eating. After they hatch and thrive on their own, she dies.  </p>

<p>I'm always concerned about protecting the octopus from people, but especially during incubation. Scaring the mom away risks eliminating the next generation. Scientists agree we can cause an octopus (either gender) to leave its burrow. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These animals present little danger to humans, and they will generally flee from a location if a human diver gets too close.

</blockquote>

<p>If I were to scuba dive responsibly near a coral reef, as a spectator or scientist, how would I tell if an octopus is in there? As I said, purposely touching the coral isn't an option. </p>

<p>Do they perhaps emit a smell? Can you tell by which fish are nearby, potentially for food? What about the depth or temperature of the water? Is it something else?</p>

"What does it take to become a wilderness skills guide as a business?","<p>I see lots of schools around different states and countries that teach wilderness skills and they seem to vary a lot in their basis (that is, what qualifies them to do what they do). Some are led by an organization with a handful or more paid staff, some are volunteer individuals, and everything in between. Some are qualified based on certifications, some are qualified based on 'I can do this well' and the latter often goes with X amount of time doing it as a qualification. </p>

<p>Looking at certifications, there are dozens of relevant courses that vary in time requirements, intensity, and geography. Some are just courses to certify you've learned certain skills, whereas others are geared toward pedagogy and not just learning skills but also teaching them. There are also separate certifications which make sense but aren't part of other 'wilderness skill instructor certifications', from wilderness first responder to forest therapy guiding. As a customer of a wilderness skills center, it wouldn't hurt for teachers to have those kinds of certifications, but certainly they aren't necessary.</p>

<p>Is there a standard or commonly accepted expectation in the wilderness skills community of what it takes to be an instructor? For example is it taboo to offer guided trips and courses on wilderness skills, having nothing but one's own experience as credentials? Is there a certain amount of years or specific skills that one is expected to have before teaching others in an organized and even for-money capacity? Or is it purely case by case, up to the opinion of customers whether an instructor is qualified enough or not?

"What in the forest is suitable as a foundation to primitive structures such as log cabins, in northeast USA?","<p>Cedar is a great example of a log that makes a good log cabin foundation. Solid and naturally rot resistant. Are there other species' logs suitable as foundations in northeast USA? Rocks can also be stacked though that is a much more permanent build than many primitive structures. What other logs or natural materials work well for primitive log cabin foundations?</p>

<p>By foundation I mean whatever connects the main structure with the ground and is contact with the ground surface. There's all kinds of different primitive structures, so maybe a rot resistant log is not always needed. For example, vertical log cabins might not need logs laying flat on the ground if I understand it correctly, and instead are supported with pillars (charred logs) buried in the ground with other logs nailed, lashed, or somehow joined to serve as the horizontal frame above the ground.</p>

"Is it warmer to sleep in a car or in a tent?","<p>Is it warmer to sleep in a car or in a tent?</p>

<p>Suppose that our old internal-combustion-engine car breaks down in a remote place at -30°C, -40°C, or -50°C, and the engine won't run at all.  Suppose we're travelling with a single car, but we did bring full camping gear, including winter sleeping bags and a good double walled dome tent that we can squeeze into together with all passengers.  We also have some candles to make heat.  It's getting dark and we will spend the night hoping for a passer-by tomorrow.</p>

"Tips for using a ""wag bag"" to pack out human waste","<p>I've been an avid lover of the outdoors for all of my life, camping in quite varied terrain, but so far in all these locations I've been able to use the usual LNT cat-hole methods to take care of human waste. This year however I'm planning to make several trips where I'll need to use a ""wag bag"" to pack out my waste.</p>

<li>Not making a mess (getting all of ""it"" in the bag...maybe not actually a problem?)</li>
<li>Keeping the bag from getting ripped/punctured once used</li>
<li>Controlling odors</li>
<li>Any way to minimize the weight?</li>
<li>Any problems with animals bothering the used bags?</li>
<li>Other helpful tips...</li>

"Should one deliberately eat more and put on weight before going on long treks?","<p>Recently I saw a podcast of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCf-KJOxKAU"" rel=""noreferrer"">Alex Honnold with Rich Roll</a> where Alex speaks about deliberately eating up and gaining weight before going on an Antarctic expedition (I'm assuming this is because of the climate as well as his lack of body fat as a climber). Made me wonder if this is a tactic used by trekkers as well. </p>

<p>In case I'm going on long hikes (10 days or more), is it advisable to eat up and deliberately put on more weight before the treks? I'm a fit male who has very less fat percentage. Eating more to put on might be a way to offset the loss of weight that'll happen over longer treks. </p>

<p>Note: This is not a hypothetical question. I'll be hiking for around 2 months in the Himalayas and it'll be a long strenuous two months. I am expecting to lose some weight for sure. I'm wondering if I can offset this with some weight gain before I head off.</p>

"Should one buy a higher shoe size while buying hiking shoes?","<p>I've heard this multiple times from different people that while buying a hiking shoe, always go for one size larger than what fits you perfectly. The most recent one being a local store where I went to check out some shoes. The logic seems to be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hiking shoes might be worn with multiple layers of socks in cold environment (personally have never tried this).</li>
<li>While walking on downhill trails, one's feet will slide a bit inside the shoe and there're chances of the toes touching the end of the shoes and thereby causing discomfort/injury (can attest to this).</li>
</ul>

<p>I have personally faced the second issue where the shoe fits perfectly and has great comfort on level/uphill trails but on a downhill trail, my toes would end up painful due to the slight shift of my feet inside the shoes (this is despite the shoe being tied properly and securely). </p>

<p>Is this a trend followed by all the hikers? Or is this a pure comfort based choice? Also, please add in any additional reason why one would go for a larger shoe size when it comes to hiking shoes.</p>

<p>Additional (interesting?) info:</p>

<p>Last time I bought my hiking shoes, the person there made me stand on an inclined plane and jump up a couple of times (so as to allow my feet to shift). The logic being, while on a trail you would often come across inclines and the backpack would force your weight down and shift your feet a bit inside your shoes. And after this small experiment, if my toes hit the front of the shoes, I had to go for the next size. That was the criteria the person used to judge the size of the shoes I had to buy. (The laces were tight all the time and there was absolutely no way you could just slide your feet inside the shoes unless you did the jumps)</p>

"How much would a base camp shower cost in the Himalayas?","<p>It's about -30°C this morning, and a couple random thoughts popped into my head while enjoying a nice hot shower. The first was how terrible would it be to get out of a shower at -30°C in a tent. The second was, how much does it cost to enjoy a shower in a tent at 17,000ft? There are no liquid water sources at that elevation, so you have to make water by melting snow or ice, which uses fuel, which also doesn't exist at 17,000ft (no wood above the treeline), so anything you burn has to be carried in. That means that by having a shower you are forfeiting precious, and expensively produced hot water that could have been used for cooking and drinking. </p>

<p>In order you have a shower at that high of an elevation you probably need at least the following carried in by a sherpa (for this question I'm making the assumption that you don't help doing any of the work):</p>

<ul>
<li>Fuel to melt snow or ice (kerosene, white gas, diesel)  </li>
<li>Snow and ice, likely carried from a clean area at the edge of basecamp/border of
the glacial debris you're camping on. </li>
<li>A shower tent - which includes:
<ul>
<li>A tent you can stand up in</li>
<li>Something to stand on (mat, pallet, maybe a tub)</li>
<li>A large basin that holds all of the water you're going to be using to shower with</li>
<li>An apparatus to hang said basin, or pump the water out of the basin</li>
<li>Plumbing (hose, shower head)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Towels - You've got to get dry after you shower, which requires dry towels, and to have dry towels you need a heated tent where they can dry before they freeze.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not even sure people take showers at such high elevations, or if people take baths in some nasty shared-bathwater tub, but supposing you wanted to have a shower at Everest Base Camp, about how much would one cost? I don't imagine that people would go a 1-2 month long expedition in the Himalayas and not bathe at some point.</p>

"Groups: What are proper occasions for a large, shared hole for waste?","<p>So of course the common standard for proper burying of solid human waste is burial in a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/q/4590/1908"">cat-hole</a>, and generally this means one hole per instance per person.

"Tips and tricks for backpacking with a guitar","<p>There are numerous compact and travel guitars that exist, some of which are designed specifically for outdoor pursuits like backpacking. <a href=""http://alpacaguitar.com/alpaca-carbon-fiber-travel-guitar/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This</a> is one I've been considering. </p>

<p>Being a musician, music is one of the things I miss most while in the wilderness, and I'm hoping to remedy that soon with a guitar that can be taken outdoors, at least on some of my trips. I have zero experience with taking a guitar on backpacking trips and don't know anyone that has. So...</p>

<li>What are some good ways to ensure the guitar stays in good shape while out on trips?</li>
<li>What is the best way to pack the guitar in a pack?</li>
<li>What other functions, if any, could it serve other than being an instrument?</li>
<li>How to deal with rain, other moisture?</li>
<li>Any considerations for wildlife being repelled/drawn by the sound?</li>
<li>Or issues I haven't thought of...?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Just to clarify, I'm not necessarily looking for recommendations on a travel guitar, but rather the issues associated with taking one (of any type) into the wilderness.

"What animal could strip all the bark off the lower 7 feet of this tree?","<p>I was out in the woods the other day and I came across a tree. It had all of the bark around the bottom removed, and a good layer of wood removed as well. I estimated the damage was a good 7-8 feet from roots to where the bark had not been removed. </p>

<p>I know deer will destroy trees in a similar fashion, but given the damage was so tall, I know it could not have been a deer. So my prime suspect is a black bear. This was out in the blue Ridge of Virginia.</p>

<p>Is this something a bear would do? If so, is there anyway to guesstimate the size of the bear?</p>

<p>I have another image closer up to the tree to see the damage. In it, you can see banding, as well as a bit of bark separation, and what looks to be a few holes that may have been cause by boring insects? (brown area of the under bark, near center top of picture).</p>

"How to pick a good camping airbed?","<p>I'll start with two examples of what I don't want.</p>

<p>Two years ago, we bought a double Kathmandu airbed in some camping shop in New Zealand. It wasn't cheap, and it was really good for a month of camping. But then ... this year, while camping, we were unpleasantly surprised with a <strong>big bulge</strong> in the middle of the bed (inside seams broke?). The bulge then expanded through pretty much whole bed.</p>

<p>We have another Intex airbed at home for a spare bed, which is slowly <strong>leaking air</strong>.</p>

"What are the risks when encounter a wild animal when camping?","<p>I'm new in Camping, and recently I have camped in France, in the Vosges region, in the locality called ""Le bonhomme"".</p>

<p>Well it's not the pure wilderness but it was very unusual for me, as it was nobody around and I was in the forest.</p>

<p>So I set up the camp, it was just for the night so I didn't make any fire pit, but just a tent.</p>

<p>When I was trying to sleep, I have eared some grunting, and some scratch on the ground. In this situation I was really stressed but well, I didn't close my eyes because there was those sounds during the whole night, and just near my tent. Sometimes something was scratching the tent canvas. I was very unconfortable with this. I took care to have nothing to eat for not drawing attention of any animals. But there was there anyway.</p>

<p>After this, I searched what was the wildlife in this region, and there was grey wolves, wild boars and some boreal lynx in this region.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that there was at one moment some wild boars (Loud noise, big branch cracking) and at another moment some stealthy animals like the grey wolves, maybe curious about the tent ? (Soft noise, something was sniffing the tent but really discreet).</p>

<li>Can I leave the tent in the middle of the night for seeing what's around without getting harmed?</li>

An answer raises three points: Altitude, Wildlife, and Weather.  The altitude and wildlife points clearly apply directly to me.  My question is specifically about wildlife.  Quoting <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/263/566"">from the answer</a>:</p>

"What is wrong with this belay setup?","<p>This is a follow on from my <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/21869/2766"">answer here</a>. I took this photo of my belay and shared it on Facebook, where I friend of mine (A qualified climbing instructor)  pulled me up on it as I'd made one or two <em>minor</em> mistakes. There is nothing ""dangerous"" here. It's just not 100% optimal from a safety point of view. </p>

<p>Probably worth noting this is UK trad ethics, I know other countries will often do this kind of set up differently. Hopefully the ""issue"" is global but I'm not an expert on non-uk belays so <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>So the question is, can anyone pull me up on this belay stance? What (if anything) is wrong with this set up?</p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<p>The white arrows indicate the gear placements position (Trad placements in rock). the Black arrow is the load from the climber. The bottom carabiner is passed though both rope loops and attached to the second using a belay plate. I will stand to one side when belaying lining up the load between the gear and the second. Gear is placed above me and there is space to sit away from the rope so I'm not under any loaded ropes should a fall happen. </p>

"Are wattle and daub primitive shelters suitable for the Adirondacks?","<p>Sometimes natural building techniques just aren't suited for a certain environment.

A couple answers there (including one of my own) discuss the definitions and features of the old roman-numeral-typed PFD (i.e. Type I through Type V).</p>

<p>However, it was hinted there regarding the fact that the U.S. Coast Guard had determined the boating public had a poor understanding of the meaning of these types, and was going to eliminate them.  This became official with a ruling issued September 22, 2014 (it's a little dry legalese, but you can read it <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/09/22/2014-22373/personal-flotation-devices-labeling-and-standards"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Along with this announcement, the Coast Guard also stated they anticipated a several year transition period to allow for, among other things, the states to update their boating laws for the new labeling rules, and for PFD manufactures to begin developing the new label system.</p>

<p>Well, here we are at the start of 2019, and the new labels are beginning to appear on store shelves and in training materials.  What are the new types, how do they compare to the old types, and how have the rules changed for what I need to carry on my boat?</p>

"Does newspaper (in shoes) kill Gore-Tex (breathability)?","<p>While reading <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4778/does-packing-boots-with-newspaper-make-them-dry-faster"">this question</a>, another one came to my mind:</p>

<p>Last summer on a mountain hut some guy told my packing newspaper in Gore-Tex (or any similar) shoes wouldn't be good for their breathability.</p>

<p>The explanation seemed to be plausible:
Because Gore-Tex is working like a funnel (cone) letting steam out, but no water in, there is a 'working direction'.</p>

<p>If you put newspaper in your shoes, the newspaper would suck the moisture. BUT from outside to inside. So obviously the opposite direction of the Gore-Tex 'working direction'. This guy said it's like pressing water from the wrong side through a funnel and this could (or would) harm the effect of the Gore-Tex.</p>

<p>But everywhere you go, people plug newspaper in there shoes to dry them faster.</p>

<p>So was this guy right or wrong? Does plugging boots with newspaper kill their Gore-Tex effect?</p>

<p>My first thougt was, maybe the newspaper is only sucking the moisture from inside the Gore-Tex layer?</p>

<p>Update as of April, 2017:
Four weeks ago a very pregnant chipmunk popped up out of a hole in the snow. We memorized her markings to the best of our ability. We saw her again a few days later. Since then, we've been feeding her near that hole every day. She dutifully gathers up the seeds and corn and pops back down. Since the babies stay in the nesting burrow for six to eight weeks, she'll probably keep feeding them until then. In the meantime, many other chipmunks are now very active in the yard. There's a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors, and there are holes everywhere. The only way we know about the female is that we saw her when she was pregnant. </p>

<p>The skunks are waking up from hibernation, and after smelling so many sprays, one can't help but wonder <em>(theoretically)</em> what would happen if skunks were to suddenly go extinct? While discussing this with an animal control officer, and the potential negative impacts of skunks being removed from the ecology, he mentioned that one thing skunks do is help control bird populations by eating eggs. </p>

<p>Skunks coming out of hibernation also happens to be the same season geese are returning from the south, and there are quite a few mating pairs looking for nesting spaces. I know of an island in a lake not far from here where geese lay tonnes of eggs every year, right on the ground. Such an island would be a feast for a loose skunk, but anyone who's crossed paths with a mad goose knows that they aren't a bird to be trifled with. I wondered: Would a goose be deterred by a slow, lumbering skunk? Or would it go full angry goose mode and try to attack it to save it's nest? If it did it would probably get sprayed. In which case, how would the goose come out of that situation? Could the spray from a skunk be enough to kill a goose or other animals?</p>

"How can I get a GPS location for this tree on a distant hillside?","<p>I want to hike to the base of this tree (circled in red in the photo). That's a hillside full of full grown trees beneath it, and it looks like over a full tree's height sticking up above the other trees. It's got to be enormous.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6i9G.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6i9G.png"" alt=""enormous tree circled in red""></a></p>

<p>So how do I get a GPS location of this thing on a hillside far away from me? I could probably hike to the tree, but as soon as I enter the forest, I'll lose all visibility of this specific tree. Are there apps that could help me with getting a GPS location for a distant object? Maybe some kind of surveyor app?</p>

<p>Any other ideas on how to get there, other than using a GPS location?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: Other information that helps to frame the problem</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This tree is near the edge of a rain forest reserve of approximately 500km² in Costa Rica. So getting to this spot through the forest will necessarily be winding and steep, if not altogether physically impossible (for me, at least).</li>
<li>The only available views of the object are from kilometers away with a residential area between.</li>
</ul>

<p>Noting the two factors above, moving in a straight line towards the tree along a bearing is not an option.</p>

"Storing hunting firearms and ammo in a safe not designed for them?","<p>I just got my first handgun and had previously bought a safe that we had used for other things. The safe is a made by first alert, and is the 2087F. It says in the manual, which I've thankfully kept, that the safe is not designed to store medication, firearms, ammo, etc. My question is, what does this warning actually mean? I know that fireproof and water proof safes don't actually stand up to major fires; everything in it will only last for about an hour before the internal temperature rises. This seems like even gun safes would have the same problem, and any ammo would eventually go off anyway.</p>

<p>So assuming that I did store my Glock in this safe, with a couple of hundred rounds of ammo, what is the worst that could actually happen? Would I wake up up at 3am to a few hundred rounds going off simply because of the airtight seal? Is that even possible?</p>

<p>Sorry if that's a lot of questions. I'm genuinely curious though, if there is any real danger at all.</p>

"Backpack for both ice tools and snow shoes","<p>Are there backpack types/systems that would allow to both conveniently carry snowshoes and ice tools? </p>

<p>I always find that packs with good ice tool attachment system simply have no place for snowshoes. In the scenario when you walk in crampons or micro-spikes, the only place for the snowshoes is on top of the pack blocking the access and also making your profile wide. When the rope is thrown into the mix, this makes for a logistics disaster.</p>

<p>This is not an uncommon scenario though and there must be a solution. Nevertheless ski-mountaineering packs for example have good attachment for skis/snowboard, but are usually too small, climbing packs have no room for snowshoes etc.. Perhaps there is a category of packs for the application or there are features that help to identify possible candidates?</p>

<p>More details about the pack requirements:  </p>

<p>Day-trips, not extended expeditions. Current pack Millet Axpel 42, a couple of Petzl ice tools + ice axe, MSR Lightning Ascent snowshoes, 50m Petzl rope, crampon bag, ice screws. Lots of things to be kept outside the pack. Winter conditions can be very cold and windy, so have to carry a serious down jacket.</p>

<p><strong>A PROPOSED ANSWER, LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK</strong> </p>

<p>I believe that in a climbing specific pack, the single most important <strong>extra feature</strong> that helps carrying snowshoes, ice tools, rope etc. as described above, is <strong>long compression straps with reversed buckles</strong>; see <a href=""https://www.travelerted.com/2015/direttissima-50-backpack-outdry-review/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">for example</a> or some <a href=""https://photos.app.goo.gl/t6RhDwFvn0RVlU8P2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">photos I made for this purpose</a>. When configured this way, the compression straps can be lengthened and wrapped around the pack to attach snowshoes, pickets and what not. To my knowledge at least two companies (Gregory and Mountain Hardwear) make packs with reversed buckles and many other do not. Not sure why and what the downside of reversed buckles is.</p>

<p>Other such features are having a side access to the pack (because the top is blocked by the rope) and two lid straps so that the lid buckle doesn't get blocked when the snowshoes are attached.</p>

"How to use a static rope as a tether at the anchor of a top rope climb?","<p>I just recently returned from a course where we utilized a static rope to construct a top-rope anchor from a top-accessed ledge: the system was like that <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/11382/15427"">described in this answer</a> - the resulting configuration of the rope being a ""V"" with an additional line running from one of the apexes turning the static configuration into an ""N"". </p>

<p>The actual anchor legs are accomplishable via a number of means; however, when establishing the instructor tether, I am unsure of what knot is acceptable when going over the ledge and transferring to the pre-setup rappel.</p>

<p>Typically, one leg is wrapped around a tree (I climb in the Southeast) and is secured with a Bowline (not enough for a tail). The length of the rope is run down to ledge and back to another anchor point (in this case a tree), creating the ""V"". </p>

<p>What I've typically done is used doubled cordellete around the tree (redundancy) with an Overhand on a Bight. A locking carabiner is put through that Bight and the final leg is tied to that using a clove <em>hitch</em>. </p>

<p>My current (admittedly somewhat dated) GPS receiver, even after having had plenty of time to download a full GPS almanac, with a clear view of the sky and half a dozen satellites to work with, often reports navigational accuracy to be in the range 10-20 meters. What's more, that number tends to vary quite wildly. That certainly is good enough to e.g. find one's way back to a known location such as getting back to the car or campsite, but as soon as you need more accuracy than that, it falls way short.</p>

<p>I will be using the receiver primarily within Scandinavia, and Sweden in particular, generally outside of cities and often in forested areas.</p>

<p>To clarify, it doesn't have to provide pin-point position <em>accuracy</em> (for that, 10-20 meters is very often quite sufficient), but <em>consistency</em> in readings in the same area is much more useful. As an example, if I lay down a track and then have the dog follow that track, I am very interested in how closely the dog actually follows the track but I am not particularly interested in the exact location of the track. So, if the readings are off by some reasonable distance that isn't a major concern (as has been pointed out, it's not like being 20 meters off means you are hopelessly lost; if it is, it's not like a GPS receiver is likely to help much); as long as that within a reasonably short time frame (more than minutes, less than hours) two readings taken in the same physical location match well in terms of the reported location, that's good enough for me.</p>

"5-hour loop hike near Boulder, Colorado","<p>I'll have the good part of a Saturday to enjoy in Boulder, Colorado on 18 May.  What is a suitable area for a day, loop hike close to the city?  My criterion for ""close"" is that the start of the trail can be reached with at most 30 minutes cycling or a short bus ride.  By a ""day hike"" I mean around 5–6 hours not counting breaks.  By ""loop"" I mean that it ends where it starts, not necessarily that no part of the trail is walked twice.</p>

"Toproping with two ropes joined by a double fisherman's","<p>The other day we were waiting in line for a popular 200 foot single pitch climb in the valley and the party in front of us was using two 70 meter ropes they had joined together with a double fisherman's as a top-rope. I had never seen or heard of this being done before and I can think of a couple of reasons why I wouldn't be comfortable doing this myself: </p>

<ul>
<li>Amount of rope stretch in 140 meters of dynamic rope</li>
<li>Amount of rope drag on less-than-vertical routs when using 140 meters of rope</li>
<li>The knot getting caught in a constriction or on a ledge</li>
<li>Increased rope-abrasion where the knot is tied, since the rope rubbs on the rock when the rope is weighed with a climber during lowering</li>
<li>Not being able to belay a climber all the way to the anchor, since the knot is going to interfere with the ATC if the climb is not exactly the length of the rope tied to the climber, potentially rendering the retrieval of the anchor dangerous, or endangering a novice climber who doesn't notice that the rope is not advancing any more as they make forward progress.</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>I can also think of a couple of reasons why there are certain situations where this minght be the smaller of two evils:</p>

<ul>
<li>An unexperienced climber does not have to rappel</li>
<li>In a situation where the weather is fickle, no-one has to belay from the top, expediting the process of getting everyone off the rock faster, at the expense fo leaving the anchor at the top</li>
<li>When climbing with several novice climbers, the most knowledgable climber can stay at the ground to help with tying in and crowd control at the base of the climb.</li>
<li>Reducing the wait on popular routes (This is more of a convenience...)</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone know if using two ropes as a top-rope is condoned or discouraged by professional guides? Also, has anyone heard of any accidents or close calls that have happened when using two ropes in this manner? Does anyone know of any testing that has been done on this technique? </p>

"Sighting in a Rifle without firing a shot","<p>I was wondering if there is a way to sight in a rifle scope without firing a shot. </p>

<p>There are some reasons why I think it would useful to be able to do this. One depending on the scope you may have to sight it in often especially if you are carrying it around daily. 2 To conserve ammo and 3 To do it silently</p>

<p>I have a scope that has the traditional bullseye crosshair and then has triangle markings for every 100 yards below the crosshair. I have a laser bore sight. </p>

<p>So my thought was I have a piece of paper with markings on it or some kind of pre marked target and put it a certain reasonable distance away say 10-25 yards.  I'm sure there is some kind of math that would allow you to extrapolate the bullet drop to match the crosshair and the 100 yard triangles and be able to put those marking on the target. </p>

<p>Basically you use the laser bore sight to sight in the rifle at 25 yards directly on the bullseye and then adjust it to where the 100 yard triangles and match the bullet drop marking on the target. </p>

<p>Does something like this exist? I know it wouldn't be perfect but maybe it would be good enough. </p>

<p>Maybe the above is a stupid question. </p>

"Help me interface these two nautical devices","<p>I'm crew on a boat (wooden 8.5m from 1973) which has a GPS and a tiller pilot that seem to work fine separately, but don't seem to want to talk to one-another. My captain is adamant this combination ""used to work, but is not working now""; I myself have never attempted to use the autopilot, nor seen it in use.</p>

<p>The GPS is a <strong>Garmin GPSMap 182C</strong> which talks NMEA 0183 v3.0; According to <a href=""https://www.manualslib.com/manual/56045/Garmin-182-182c.html?page=105#manual"" rel=""noreferrer"">its documentation</a>, it sends ""GPRMC, GPGGA, GPGSA, GPGSV, GPGLL, GPBOD, GPRTE, and GPWPL (as well as PGRME, PGRMZ, and PSLIB)"".</p>

<p>The pilot is a <strong>Tillerpilot TP32</strong> which also talks NMEA 0183. According to <a href=""https://www.manualslib.com/manual/735398/Simrad-Tp10.html?page=26#manual"" rel=""noreferrer"">its documentation</a>, it accepts ""APA, APB, RMA, RMB, RMC, BWR, BWC, VHW, XTE (as well as VWR and MWV)"".</p>

<p>As you'll notice, these abbreviations are helpfully incomparable, and I haven't become wiser by studying <a href=""http://freenmea.net/docs"" rel=""noreferrer"">references</a>.</p>

<p>The wiring connections I have all quadruple-checked; the only thing I cannot check is the actual data content of the NMEA signal data. I have also triple-checked that the NMEA settings are sane (GPS Port 1 out: NMEA v3, 4800 baud; GPS Port 2 out: None; and yes it's port 1 that's connected through to the tiller pilot's socket). I have been unable to determine the baud rate of the Tillerpilot, and the parity settings of both devices, but I must assume they are set to a common standard.</p>

Polymeric fibres are extremely strong along their <em>longitudinal</em> axis, however they have low flexural strength, meaning they are <strong>not</strong> strong along their <em>horizontal</em> axis, which is why ropes lose significant amounts of strength when tied<sup>[<a href=""http://www.sterlingrope.com/media/document/techmanual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>]</sup>. Knots create a stress concentration on a rope's horizontal axis, crushing the rope's core and causing it to fail under less force or weight than an unknotted rope. The tying of a double fisherman's knot will cause a measurable reduction (20-35%) in the tensile strength of a rope<sup>[<a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Outdoor-Knots-Book-Clyde-Soles/dp/0898869625"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a>]</sup>. Moreso than a single fisherman's knot (15-20%)<sup>[<a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=O_SNr4LPdUQC&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a>]</sup>. The <em>only</em> real advantage that a double fisherman's has over a single is that it is less likely to slip, especially on newer synthetic fibre ropes, which is why it has mostly replaced the single in mountaineering. </p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Single Fisherman's</h2>
  
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHa2z.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AHa2z.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
  <strong>PROS:</strong> Lower reduction in tensile breaking strength of Kernmantle rope (15-20%), easier to tie, easier to untie.<br/><strong>CONS:</strong> More likely to
  slip.</p>
  
  <h2>Double Fisherman's</h2>
  
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XrIfq.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XrIfq.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a><br>
  <strong>PROS:</strong> Less likely to slip.<br/><strong>CONS:</strong> Greater reduction in tensile breaking strength of Kernmantle rope (20-35%), more
  complicated to tie, hard to untie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's fair to note that a double fisherman's knot still reduces the tensile strength <em>less</em> than most other knots, and that a knot isn't really useful if it slips, but with certain types of rope it's unlikely that even a single fisherman's will slip, whereas on fancy lightweight ropes–like aramid ropes–a <em>triple</em> fisherman's is necessary to prevent your rope from slipping.</p>

<p><strong>If the rope or accessory cord that you are using will hold a single fisherman's knot without slipping, would it be better to use a single fisherman's knot (leaving really long tails) and take advantage of the higher tensile strength the knot provides over a double?</strong></p>

"What's the most remote place in the contiguous US?","<p>The United States is a very developed place. Sometimes this can prove to be challenging when trying to find a place to get away from everything, especially east of the Mississippi where I reside. I am pretty sure the answer is likely somewhere western (Montana maybe), but <strong>what is the most remote place in the contiguous US</strong>?</p>

<p>So let's define <em>remote</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Furthest distance from civilization or any signs of it including anything man-made like roads, forest service facilities, huts/shelters...</p></li>
<li><p>Furthest distance from medical care or rescue if something goes wrong; difficult terrain could trump the distance.</p></li>
<li><p>Number of visitors recorded? Or other USFS data...</p></li>
<li><p>Essentially, no visible traces of humans, or ""untouched"" if that's even possible these days.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Now, I know this could seem like an opinionated question to some folks, but I'm really looking for places that can be backed up and grounded with as much factual data as possible.</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q. Is it okay to use carabiners that have been dropped?</strong><br/> A.
  Unfortunately, the only way to know if “dropped” carabiners are fit
  for use is to test them to their breaking point. This doesn’t do you
  much good, now does it? It's best to inspect dropped gear for dings
  and significant trauma. If only light scratching is visible and gate
  action is still good, there is a good chance it is fit for usage.
  Remember, only you know what your gear has been through and if there
  is any doubt, it's best to retire the gear rather than take a risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This myth is certainly something you hear climbers talking about all the time, and there's a constant paranoia about gear that people have dropped onto rock or concrete floors at gyms.  </p>

<p>When did this myth start? Has there ever been a case where a piece of protection has failed because of micro-fractures?</p>

<p>Are there any online tools or websites that will keep track of the overall progress that one has made on the trail? </p>

<p>Lets say I do a section of the trail from Harper's Ferry (I'm located in MD) to South Mountain State Park early in 2015. Then do a Maine section later that summer. And then lets say I do more day trips here and there depending on where I'm going to be for that weekend.

"How do I judge what fabrics used to make ear warmers mean, in terms of their function?","<p>My husband recently lost a pair of ear warmers he got at North Face 15 years ago. North Face no longer sells them, so I'm looking for a high-quality replacement. I'm confused by the types of materials used in construction, what they mean, and how they should factor into my purchasing decision.  </p>

<p>He had 180's®, and that's what he wants again. I'm not sure if 180's® is a brand, or just a registered style name, but since the question's about materials used, it isn't meant to be a brand request.</p>

<p>After much online research, I've narrowed it down to three pairs that are comparably priced, and look similar to what he had. Each has these same important features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Patented behind-the-head design </li>
<li>Fits comfortably over the ears</li>
<li>Can be worn with other headwear, glasses and head protection</li>
<li>Adjustable click-to-fit frames guarantee an easy, comfortable fit</li>
<li>Collapsible for easy storage </li>

He uses them for outdoor activities like backyard bird-feeding, snow shoveling, sledding, skiing, snow-shoeing, hiking in the woods, walking to the parking lot and driving home from work at 2:30 am, among other things. He doesn't climb mountains or do extreme winter sports which keep him outside for long periods of time. </p>

<p>It might be a good idea to try on each and see how they feel, but I'm going to order them online so that's not an option. I imagine they're all comfortable enough, but even if they feel great, there's no way to tell if they'd be what he needs to get through the season. Even returnable pairs can't be worn for months first!</p>

When are the hunting seasons and what type of hunting has the highest risk of accident (I naively assume that I might be safer from bird hunters than deer hunters).

"Blisters on small of back","<p>I went hiking with a friend a few years ago who had adjusted his new 90 liter pack to sit pretty high up on him.</p>

<p>As a result he managed to create two very large blisters right above his buttocks.  They popped and looked extra-ordinarily painful.  He really suffered that weekend.</p>

<p>My question is, what can I do to ensure I never have that happen to me?</p>

<p>AND</p>

<p>If it did happen to me, what would my treatment plan be?  Abandonment of the trip would not be an option...I just like saying that.  I can't really think of anything I could do to create a situation where I continued to push forward but if there was something, especially with zombies chasing you, that could be done, I'd like to here thoughts on it.</p>

"In kayaking how would you escape an underwater whirlpool current if you were trapped in one?","<p>In kayaking I've heard a term called the 'washing machine'.  Apparently as a river is flowing over terrain it can create whirlpools and currents that swirl in all manner.  Occasionally a condition can arise where you can drop into one and get trapped in revolving current that's difficult to escape from. </p>

<p>Apparently people have been killed when they have become caught in one these anomalies of current.  </p>

<p>Is there some sort of strategy that can be employed to escape the current when you are being spun about and become more and more disoriented?  What are your first actions when you realize this has happened?  Does anyone take precautions and carry something with them that would assist in such an event?</p>

I understand the basic layering scheme applied to upper body apparel, does the same apply to the lower body?  Could I get away with a base layer and water resistant soft shell pants, or would a third waterproof layer be a must?

"How much does body fat actually insulate you against the cold?","<p>I'm not a big guy, but I can sit in a cold pool of still water for a long time if I stay still and control my breathing, my skin gets cold, but after you get past the cold shock I can sit there rather comfortably without any signs of my core temperature dropping (shivering, etc.). One of my favourite things to do is sit up to my neck in the cold spring pool (4°C) at Ainsworth Hot Springs for about a half hour at a time and watch the shocked expressions on peoples faces as they dip their toes in the water, or try to take a quick dip, then look at me in bewilderment as I sit there seemingly unfazed by the temperature. </p>

<p>When we were kids we used to tube down the Elk River in BC, which is fed by a glacier lake. I have one sibling who was quite a bit thicker than the rest, and while the rest of us tried our best to stay on top of our tubes and out of the cold water, they would just float in a life jacket with the current, without any signs of really getting cold aside from hands and feet.</p>

<p>I've been pondering this lately, wondering how much having a good layer of fat on you can help insulate against the cold. There are a plethora of animals in nature who rely on a thick layer of blubber for insulation; narwhals, beluga whales, walruses and many others for example who don't also have fur. Fat obviously won't protect you from frostbite, your skin can still freeze, but I wonder if it might help prevent advanced stages of frostbite (freezing down to the deep tissues like muscles, tendons and bone). Or how about hypothermia? Are obese people less likely to become hypothermic? One thing I was considering was in the case of severe exposure, where frostbite and freezing are a serious danger. Would a large person have better chances of survival if they were to submerge themselves in water? Liquid fresh water is typically always warmer than than zero in nature, if it was 20 or 30 degrees below zero, could a person with a thick adipose layer survive the cold and protect themselves against frostbite by sitting up to their neck in a pool of still water? Would their fatty layer help insulate their core like a layer of blubber? </p>

"Hypothermia Prevention - Post Ice Water Fall","<p><strong><em>I've read many of the posts that are related to this and believe it to be a be a snowflake of a question on the site.</em></strong></p>

<p>If you have fallen into icy water and the temperature is very challenging, what are the immediate steps to take to assist the victim?</p>

<p>I've read <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1221/falling-into-an-ice-cold-body-of-water"">this post</a> and it's more driven by how to rescue someone who has fallen in icy waters.  The obvious statements are made.  Get the person warm, etc.  <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/4314/recovering-from-hypothermia"">This post</a> seems to address the situation once the victim/patient is hypothermic.</p>

<p>My question is more driven by prevention.  </p>

<p>The general framework is get the wet off, get them warm...but how?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A fire in short order seems like a good idea.  If you have a group, a person can be assigned the task.  RIGHT NOW.</p></li>
<li><p>As in other posts, discarding wet clothes immediately doesn't seem to be a bad idea at all.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When I have been in the situation of assisting I stripped the person, pulled my sleeping bag, opened my jacket, pulled up my clothes and went skin on skin with the victim and had someone assist with getting us both into a sleeping bag ASAP.</p>

<p>I've been chided for this, not for the skin on skin, just the whole process.  Honestly, I had never considered an action plan before the moment it happened and I simply reacted.</p>

<p>I'd like to have a better action plan, especially if it were colder.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there something light that can be added to the plethora of gear we all might be lugging around out there?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a better methodology than the example provided?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the most immediate/primary concern?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've been told to focus on torso and head.  Get ANYTHING on the head to retain heat.  A baseball cap?  Use dirt, if available, to rub into hair and quickly dry the head?  Strip the victim naked and focus on torso due to capillaries constricting to force blood in the torso the torso should be the focus.</p>

<p>Any medical references and/or response frameworks are what I'm really looking for.  The victim is wet, it's very cold.  Now what?</p>

<p>As a side note, what if there's a base camp, everyone goes on a day hike with limited gear in smaller hydro packs and the incident occurs.  That would be an interesting problem to solve.</p>

<p>Apologies in advance for the rant.</p>

"Suggestions for a winter lifestyle","<p>This is my first winter in a really cold place. By cold I mean temperatures varying from -10 to -30 Celcius (yes, all temperatures I mention in this post are in metric). I come from a place which never usually goes below zero, so this is a significantly new and challenging experience for me. I have read and heard about getting accustomed to the cold rather than protecting from it, which has been argued as a better choice to beat the cold. That is the reason I normally decide to walk about a mile to my workplace even though the temperature is -13. However, there are a few things that I would like to ask / reconfirm / seek suggestion to have a better winter lifestyle.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mittens are argued as more heat preserving than gloves. I felt my fingers were very cold today while walking, and I was wearing gloves - I had to keep my hand out of my pocket since I was carrying a thing. I reached my destination quickly and then heated the fingers, but it will not be possible to walk that way longer. Any suggestions? Should I look for something specific while getting a new pair of gloves / mittens?</li>
<li>The weather here is very dry. So dry that even after using a thick moisturizer my skin looks chapped often. I have a humidifier at home, and I switch it on during sleep, but still the dryness reappears. It's more prominent while walking in the cold. Any remedies?</li>
<li>Reducing the heating, taking a cold(er) shower, eating more carbs / calories are certain things that has been suggested, and I'll be trying out soon. Are they really effective methods to beat the cold?</li>
<li>Finally, a little funny and amusing thing for me, and don't laugh - I see people on the street wearing much less winterwear and no cover for the head and seem to be absolutely fine even at temperatures 10 deg below zero and windy! How do they manage to do that?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> after a week (and a couple of medium to heavy snow showers) of following and improvising over the ideas suggested:</p>

<ol>
<li>Putting my thinner woollen gloves within a larger, waterproof glove really kept my hand warm. Now I completely realize the layering idea :-)</li>
<li>I tried all sorts of moisturizers and finally coconut oil as well. Coconut oil is good for half the day, since near the end of the day my skin becomes dry again. Then I improvised on it using a more viscous oil - and this is mustard oil - just before the shower applying on the skin and then take the shower - it was amazing till the end of the day. You can try and let me know how it went - don't put it too much since it may stick to clothes, and not after shower, you may put a light film of moisturizer if needed afterwards. It works!</li>
<li>Colder shower and trying to adjust to the cold helped me a lot. Now I feel much more comfortable walking in the -20 C (-4 F) than I was a week back.</li>

They tend to be far away from where most people hike.  I've never seen one occupied and browsing through guestbooks usually reveals an occupation of less than 20 nights per year.

"For fording cold rivers, is there any special clothing (as opposed to makeshift bags or tightly connected raintrousers) to stay dry and warm?","<p>On my treks, I often need to ford rivers — on my last trek (3½ day) I forded five, including four on a single day (not counting >100 smaller streams).  My current practice is to take off my boots and put sandals instead, but this is a dangerous practice that several books and agencies strongly recommend against.  Many rivers are glacier-fed and some are quite wide, so the risk for hypothermia is real.</p>

<p>The Swedish mountain associations recommend to tie raintrousers tightly at the boots, warning explicitly that crossing on sandals carries a real risk for hypothermia.  Although my boots and raintrousers are reasonably watertight and good enough to keep me dry when it rains (at least when it rains with a Swedish intensity), they won't hold standing in a (quickly) flowing river for a long time.  As an alternative, the Swedish language book <em>På fjälltur: Sarek</em> by Claes Grundsten recommends, and I quote (translation follows):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alternativt kan du använda vadarpåsar som träs over skodonen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>meaning</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Alternatively, you can use fording bags that are drawn over the shoes.</em></p>

I heard of someone's dog being eaten while the woman was walking her pet on a leash. She was allegedly walking in an area known to have wildlife but was on the trail frequented by humans.  Is this likely?  </p>

<p>The trail is fairly busy with people. There is a no dog policy, but I have a service animal and hiking the trail is really good for me.  My dog is small though and a coyote could legitimately see her as a little white rabbit on a leash. I'm not even sure the claim is true but rather safe than sorry with my baby!!</p>

"Are trades routes and/or mountain routes still used?","<p><strong>Some background:</strong></p>

<p>I live in the western part of state of Maharashtra, India. The city of Pune is located on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Plateau"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Deccan Plateau</a>.<br>
Deccan plateau itself is huge. The western section of the plateau has a vertical drops of ranging from about 900 to 1800 ft. for about 1600 km. This section is what known to world as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Western Ghats</a></p>

<p>So, there are trails from villages located on Deccan plateau to the lower  places, popularly called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konkan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kokan</a>. 
In Maharashtra there are 250+ such routes that are documented, and about 100+ which aren't documented. Before the development age, some of these were used for trade and commute.</p>

<p><strong>My observation:</strong>
What I have observed is due to lack of development in economy almost 75% of villagers still frequent these routes down the mountain, be it for trade, or be it for travelling. The road transport is there, but these foot-trails are still the shorter (and free, of course) way of commute. </p>

<p>The point is, these routes are not limited to trekking/hiking only!</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
Are there such routes in the part of the world where you live? I agree that those route may not be used for trade these days, but do people use these routes for commuting by foot? I don't want to consider such paths that are converted into motor-able highways/freeways/roads. </p>

"What is the use of the saw blade on a swiss knife?","<p>I've been using the Victorinox Swiss knife for a long time now. One thing that has baffled me is the saw blade on most of their multi-tools.

"What extra gear to take up a multipitch climb?","<p>When climbing single pitch routes, it makes sense to carry as little as possible while actually on the route, as almost every eventuality can be easily dealt with by simply lowering back to the ground and your pack. At the opposite end of the spectrum, alpine and mountaineering objectives almost mandate climbing with (or hauling) a backpack due to the extended nature of such routes and the vagaries of alpine environments. </p>

<p>In between these two extremes, we have multipitch rock (or ice) climbs, say 2-6 pitches in length, like many of those at Tahquitz, Devil's Tower, Red Rocks, Eldorado Canyon, and Yosemite. Such routes are short enough that taking everything up the route seems excessive, but long enough that having additional equipment along can be beneficial (e.g., food, water, extra layers, etc). </p>

<p>How do you decide what to bring along on such a route? What factors go into your decision? Once you've decided what to bring along, what are good strategies for carrying it?</p>

"Is this ""dry suit cutting wrists"" story realistic?","<p>I'm reading a very good novel, called ""Smilla's sense of snow"". A minor figure tells this story from the time he was a frogman with the marines: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Going down, I glide through a cold belt [...] I panic. I lose my safety rope. [...] They told me later that Føjl saw it. And took a lead belt in the hand and jumped into the water without bottles. Only a rope in the hand. Because he couldn't waste any time. He dives to me. He catches me at a depth of twelve meters. But he's diving in a dry suit. It means that the water pressure presses the rubber against the skin. Every ten meters, the pressure rises by one atmosphere. At ten meters, the rubber edge cuts at the joints and knuckles through the skin. All I remember are clouds of blood. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never dived, but I've worn a dry suit, and can't imagine this happening. Even if the construction used to be different - the story must be happening sometime in the 1970s - what would the use be of a suit which hurts you at 10 meters? Why would people dive in them? So the story sounds like an implausible melodramatic plot device. On the other hand, the book seems to be correct at its other plot devices (I hadn't heard of Guinea worms before, but they are as shocking as described in it), so maybe this story is possible after all. </p>

<p>It would be too subjective to speculate about the likelihood of somebody trying this heroic saving and succeeding. But the ""your suit cuts your wrists"" part should be easier to judge. So, is (or was) this a real danger? If yes, how do divers avoid it when diving under more controlled circumstances? </p>

<p><strong>The ice is on the <em>wrong</em> side of a rather wide creek.</strong> The nearest crossings are pretty far away, and the approach from either direction would not be easy (steep cut banks, cliffs and <em>thick</em> trees). The easiest route to the ice is across the creek.</p>

<p>I am not asking the question because of a specific planned tour in Himalaya.

Of course it would be the best preparation to stay in Himalaya for a long time and acclimate slowly. But it should make a considerable difference if I am acclimated to my home-town at 500m or to 3500m. The question is how big this difference will be.</p>

<p>I know climbing grade are affected by subjectivity. However is there a list of objective elements to take in account which have been agreed in the climbing community?</p>

<p>For example, here follows some ""disputable"" objective elements:</p>

<li>overhanging</li>
<li>relative distance between holds</li>
<li>how the route is bolted</li>

<p>Another disputable objective element in grading is the common rule that the actual grade of the route reflects the hardest passage in it. This means we can have a 30m route with a lot of 6a passages, and a 10m route with a single 6a passage, both graded 6a: in this case the first route I think would be much more difficult to send, even if it is graded the same as the second route.</p>

"Is the Park Service continuing its case to re-rename Yosemite Park's historic landmarks?","<p>I have often checked into the Ahwahnee in Yosemite Valley after emerging, filthy and undernourished, from the backcounty.  A hot shower in one of the cottages, an Ahwahnee Burger, a glass (or three) of wine and boysenberry pie a la mode delivered to the cottage patio -- bliss!  </p>

  “Yosemite National Park” T-shirts because of its predecessor’s claim

"Is there a Leave No Trace equivalent specifically for boaters?","<p><a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/8026/what-are-the-principles-of-leave-no-trace"">This question</a> lists the principles of Leave No Trace, taken from the <a href=""https://lnt.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Center for Outdoor Ethics</a> website.</p>

<p>While the general principals apply to many types of outdoor activities, this particular set seems geared toward land-related activities. </p>

<p>Of course all are true no matter who or where you are, or what you're doing, including boating. However, boats and those who use them also have some unique challenges in terms of leaving no trace. I'm thinking especially of things like water and air pollution; endangerment of water-related animal and plant life, sometimes permanently; human waste removal; making too much noise around other boaters or people on land; interfering with those who are using the waters for things such as swimming or fishing; and others I haven't named. With any challenges come responsibility, so I wondered if there's an equivalent organization or set of ethics provided for boaters to follow. </p>

<p>This would encompass things like</p>

<ul>
<li>boaters and their behavior in general</li>
<li>different kinds of boats and their purpose</li>
<li>various types of bodies of water </li>
<li>boats which are moving, moored, or docked  </li>
<li>geographical location, which might need to be named specifically if rules vary</li>
</ul>

<p>Does such an organization or set of principles exist? If so, how can I find the information? It might need to be more than one group in order to cover all the things that concern me. Perhaps it's under the umbrella of the Center for Outdoor Ethics, but if so, I didn't see it. </p>

"How many calories (aprox.) do we lose when washing in (very) cold water?","<p>This is a common problem during wild camping or survival activity, especially during colder seasons. You are tired, you have lost a lot of calories during day, and now you want to wash, but the only option you have is the cold water in the stream. And the temperature outside is also not very warm.</p>

<p>So, you want to be clean, but you don't want to lose another big portion of calories because of that, because your body is already driving on reserves.</p>

<p>But how much calories are lost when you, let's say, spend a 5 minutes naked and wet, with about 1 minute inside cold water (or pouring cold water on yourself, like in cold shower)? Of course, the exact answer depends on many factors, such as body mass, the fat/muscle factor, the exact temperature, etc., but I need only estimates, such as about 100 calories (which can vary from 50 to 200). Would it be about 100 calories, or 250, or 50? </p>

"How to harden feet for walking barefoot on harsh surfaces?","<p>In the past I was only occasionally walking barefoot, on relatively short distances, on the earthy surfaces.

"What are the components of a good climbing kit for recreational tree climbing?","<p>I've enjoyed climbing and cutting trees for many years.  I now want to go to higher levels, but safety is a primary concern, because I am afraid of heights. </p>

<p>I'm about to order gear for recreational climbing. (My long term goal is professional cutting.) Because mechanical ascenders (chest/hand/foot/knee) are not part of my life-support system, will generic ascenders be adequate?  I'm not planning to cruise a canopy or go to heights with such ascenders, but just practice with them. </p>

<p>If an ascender fails, will my climbing line/prusik catch me?  I'm unsure if I'd be ascending while on 2 points because I haven't been able to test this yet.</p>

<p>I want to be safe but as far as I can tell it looks like you could just foot-lock + prusik-slide your way up a rope w/o any mechanical devices at all, and that you and your rope (&amp; prusik) are all that matters as far as loads and safety. If I were ascending with a foot ascender that snapped on me wouldn't I just kinda spin-out on my rope?  </p>

<p><strong>Please critique my intended purchases below to see if they are adequate for climbing and for safety.</strong></p>

<p>o 150' of a 16-strand rope; unsure if it should be double-braided.  I am a very cheap person but for buying rope, I'd only consider name-brand stuff (Yale/etc) and would only buy from a place I knew I could trust which, so far, is only sheffield/bartlett's/wesspur.</p>

<p>o Prusik &amp; carabiner to attach myself to my rope (triple-lock/30-whatever-kN is the ansi for hardware) via my rock climbing saddle. I don't know the brand but it is ""diesel"" and certainly seems overkill/heavy but redundancy is fine with me here!</p>

<p>o a simple pulley (not for rigging or life-support), a figure 8 (not for life support), 1-2 extra carabiners (proper kN but not triple-lock.) </p>

<p>Am I right in thinking that, if I've got my rope and (sling/multi-function-lanyard/flipline/etc), and it's OK to un-hook myself from one setup while advancing the other, then I could climb as high as my line safely allowed? </p>

<p>I plan to use some sort of friction-saving device on any redirects but still want my rope to last, which is why I was thinking 16-strand. Are there any other options for my purposes?  I definitely don't want some super stiff or heavy line and I absolutely need to be able to tie knots in it.  I'm placing my first order with a 50/50 expectation something will be wrong and I'll need order #2 before I can even try anything out.</p>

  <p>The problem is that you are often stressed from work and other things
  and therefore you think about these things. However, as you hike and
  think you forget to experience the hike itself. You are just wandering

  often you find yourself in the car again and think: ""Damnit, what have

"Why did the wolf-pack withdraw from attacking me?","<p>While this has happened about 22 years ago, I never really stopped thinking about it and still regard it as unsolved mystery. While I asked plenty outdoormen, nobody had this experience. Having recently discovered this site, I'm hoping to get at least some answers.</p>

<p>I apologize for the long description, but I believe it is necessary to ascertain all the facts first, as any small detail may be important.</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<ul>
<li>Middle of January, around 1am at night (gets dark around 3.30pm over there, so it was as dark as it gets)</li>
<li>Quite warm temperature for the night (only around -20 Celsius, e.g. -5 Fahrenheit)</li>
<li>Weather was good, initially the wind wasn't very strong, but then started gradually picking up such that walking became much harder and problematic by the time I got back home (e.g. you have to focus and exert quite some energy so the wind does not actually bring you down)</li>
<li>Region has some steep hills, deep woods (and as an aside anecdote: a cold-war russian bunker) and small villages (think : couple hundred people, occasionally up to 800 - 1,000) scattered along the main road</li>
<li><p>Region is known to have few wolf packs. Attacks on humans are rare, but not out of question (around 1 each 10 years). You know those 'scary cry-wolf' kids stories ? Well, in our village, that story gets attached to concrete people and names.</p></li>
<li><p>I walked a short distance - maybe about 4-5 kms, mostly in total darkness (no headlamp or anything), directly over the main road, when I felt something was watching me, and indeed, at a place where road gets quite close to the woods (about 100 meters), I could see quite a few pairs of eyes.</p></li>
<li>It was at that time that I realized the howling (it's a common sound in winter, so we get used to it fast) I was hearing before, was of those wolves (obviously)</li>
<li>The alpha male then started running against me, but just him alone - the pack stayed at the boundary between woods and snowy field by the road</li>
<li>He however stopped quite far - about 5-7 meters from me</li>
<li>Over the course of next 30-40 minutes, he was gradually coming closer to me, step by step, but the closest he got was about 3 meters.</li>
<li>He was growling, teeth out, he definitely looked ready to take a bite, had that pose where whole body is lowered (as a cat), getting ready to jump</li>
<li>But he didn't. Despite the pack very loudly provoking him and aggressively howling</li>
<li>This encounter lasted about 30-40 minutes, at which point I reached the top of the hill (with my village), where there were finally some first houses and street lamps</li>
<li><p>He had me, for over half an hour, in total darkness, at a distance of 3-5 meters. Backed up with about 6 wolves (never exactly counted all those eyes, as I was busy with the alpha male, but know for sure there were more than 5)</p></li>
<li><p>At one point, I could clearly see the pack was very thin, mustn't have eaten for quite some time, so I would provide a welcome and nutritious fresh meal</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, why on earth did they not attack ?!?</p>

<p>Additional facts about me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Height : 190 cm</li>
<li>Weight : ~100 kg (but my 'build' is wider, so I was very far from being fat at that weight)</li>
</ul>

<p>I understand how they tracked me. Having just undergone a very strong argue with my brother, I was full of adrenaline, so I must have been reeking it for kilometers (especially in the wind) in that temperature.</p>

<p>It is this adrenaline that has kept me calm all the time, while I was walking with wolf for those 30-40 minutes. 
I was looking into his eyes all this time (walking straight up the steep hill, yet head turned right so I could see what he was doing), and could 'see' the hesitation to attack, yet there was clearly a very strong hunger (he was very, very thin, poor thing) and instinct to just jump and take a bite.</p>

<p>I only read it recently you are not supposed to engage the wolf like that (as it is regarded as provocation).</p>

<p>I believe that level of adrenalin is also why I did not get scared (as those pheromones, which I already knew at that time from painful experience when one dog bit me to my back couple years back, can enrage even a small dog, let alone a proper wolf).</p>

<p>My only semi-rational explanation is that the wolf must have been waiting for the fear pheromone signal, which didn't came. And my height/weight must have become obvious only from those 5 meters (not sure about their physiology of vision - how it works in wolves (perspective and such)), so he became hesitant whether to attack.</p>

<p>Any other ideas ?</p>

"Is a mountaineering tent necessary for backpacking Iceland?","<p>I need a tent that will work in snow, sand storms, lots of wind, rain and sun(UV).

"From the point of view of wildlife, what is the most dangerous component of roadside litter?","<p>As my other litter question stated, I live on a semi-rural road, and about twice a year pick up litter from the verge.  Others pick up litter too, but there are swathes of floodplain land, conservation land, as yet undeveloped land, two houses owned by very old people....The result is that I do most of the litter pick-up, both sides, for about 1.5 miles.  </p>

<p>It's a lot.  So far, I don't have to be selective about what I pick up, but if I do, what should my priorities be, from the point of view of the wildlife in the area?  </p>

<p>Number one priority in terms of wildlife is six-pack plastic webbing. After that, plastic bags which are number one in terms of unsightliness. And after these two items -- plastic bottles, glass bottles, broken glass, foam cups, some old styrofoam (it's being phased out in our area), plastic food containers, metal cans, occasional auto parts, cardboard, paper and occasional unidentified stuff.  That's it. Is there anything it would be better to leave?  For example, is the one old tire in the middle of brambles useful habitat for some critter? </p>

<p>Edit in Response to Comments: </p>

<p>(1) Restricting the list of litter:  I've given a complete list above. Aside from the one old tire I mentioned, there is nothing I cannot pick up easily with one hand.  </p>

"What determines whether the young of a cat is called a kitten or a cub?","<p>The young of cats are called kittens or cubs, depending partly on how large the cat is, and apparently partly on informal custom.  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitten"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia, kitten</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word ""kitten"" derives from the Middle English word kitoun, which
  in turn came from the Old French chitoun or cheton. Juvenile big
  cats are called ""cubs"" rather than kittens; either term may be used
  for the young of smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, caracals and
  lynx, but ""kitten"" is usually more common for these species.</p>

  <p>Cougars are the largest of the small cats. They are placed in the

"Why was I attacked by a bird (twice)?","<p>Last night, I had to climb a tower at work. When I reached the top platform (about 40 feet up), and turned my back to close the swinging gate behind me, I was whacked on the back of the head.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I was wearing a hard hat and was not knocked off my feet. It did hurt, though - without the hard hat it would have been worse.</p>

<p>What hit me? A bird. I saw it gliding away as I looked around to see ""what hit me"" (literally). It was probably an owl, as this was after dark. We also have seagulls in the area, and it's possible it was one of them, too. I wasn't being overly observant at the moment, obviously, as I don't know which one it was - it was a good-sized bird, though.</p>

<p>I realized then that the other time a similar occurrence transpired it had to be a bird, too - possibly the same feathered ""friend."" I had thought somebody had hit me with a rock or a dirt clod (but nobody was around; I looked at the ground below me, rather than outwards, where I would have no doubt seen a bird, as I did last night).</p>

<p>The platform is small and when the plant is in operation, very noisy and vibrates. I am almost 100% certain there is no nest up there.</p>

<p>So why did this bird attack me? Both times it/they whacked me on the back of my head, hitting my (plain white) hard hat. They were sharp blows that hurt, even with the hard hat protecting my noggin.</p>

<p>My question is: why would this/these bird[s] attack me? For fun? Because I was in their airspace? Or what? I have never molested them. I have shone a flashlight on them a couple of times as they sat in their tree. They have never swooped down on me as I was walking in the area, only when I'm about 40 feet above ground level.</p>

<p>This occurred in Marina, California, a quarter mile east of Monterey Bay (between the Bay and Highway 1).</p>

<p>Do owls (or seagulls) have something against white hard hats, or people climbing up on platforms?</p>

<li>Is this style of complicated looking height progression done nowadays too?</li>

<li>How did acclimatization strategies change over the last decades in general?</li>

  <p>Indicator plants are peculiar to a certain place. Though they aren’t necessarily rare, they don’t grow just anywhere. They tolerate only a narrow range of growing conditions, so their presence in a forest signals some distinctive aspect of that place. </p>

<p>Indicator plants can be used for a variety of reasons. They can tell us if we are the wetlands, an old field, a young woodlands, mature woodlands, human impacted sites or whether the soil is alkaline or acid and so on, as seen <a href=""http://www.espsciencetime.org/student_life.cfm?subpage=295615"">here

"How to Tell When Minimal Running Shoes Are Worn Out?","<p>How can I tell when my minimal running shoes go bad?</p>

<p><strong>Conventional Wisdom</strong></p>

<p>The conventional wisdom of marathon runners is that running shoes will eventually 'go bad'. That is, at some point the shoes will still work fine for walking around the house and working in the garden, but they have ""lost their bounce"". At some point (roughly 400 miles) your standard pair of, say, Nike running shoes will start to feel like the soles are made of concrete.</p>

<p>1 - Is doubling-up ropes, or hardware, ever acceptable in climbing?  IE, my 8mm prusik cord is acceptable despite being below ANSI strength, <em>because</em> I'm attached to two tails (so it becomes above 24kN), does this same logic apply in ways like me taking (2) lengths of my climb-rope (Blue Moon), knotting each's end to an O-ring, and making my own cambium saver/friction saver?  Or make a basal anchor by doubling-up in such a way?</p>

<p>2 - Is a figure-8 and your regular eye-in-eye hitch cord enough for a safe rappel?  I ordered a harness/rope/etc but I only got ascenders, for descent all I got was a figure-8....if that &amp; controlling the friction-hitch/eye-in-eye isn't sufficient for safe descent, what do I need?</p>

<p>Thanks a ton, am definitely going to be sure I never use anything not meeting ANSI but am planning on redundancies in some areas so wanna know these things, for instance if I set a canopy-anchor that my rope was running-through, but it wasn't a ring-in-ring but instead simply a carabiner tied to a lanyard, in such cases my instinct would be to just toss a 2nd carabiner there, even though the first one is ANSI-OK it seems to make sense both for peace-of-mind and just for rope-wear, heck I bought a handful of these steel thimbles to use in making loops on my rope, am already planning on using them in any&amp;every instance they're applicable to reduce rope-on-rope friction!</p>

"What overnight backpacking trails are clear of deep snow now (or likely to be in the next two weeks) in northwest Washington?","<p>I am looking for an overnight backpacking trip to do in the next few weeks somewhere in western Washington. But I am worried about deep snow remaining on the trails.  Based on last winter's snowpack, the rate of melting this spring, and on prior knowledge of the trails in that area, can anyone here suggest a trail or trails, or even a local area, that would have good hiking conditions and possibly, although not necessarily, a few places snow-free places to camp?

"Looking for information about the large circles free of snow that form in the spring around the trunks of large trees?","<p>We have often used the large snow free circles that form in the spring around the trunks of large trees as camping spots.  Even in an area blanketed with deep snow, there will be such bare, dry ground to camp on, although one may have a steep climb into or out of such a spot.  They are like dry wells.</p>

<p><strong>First, what are such bare-ground wells called?</strong>  </p>

<p>I assume that the dark tree trunk absorbs heat and then acts as a heater to speed up melting around the trunk.  Moreover, the snow was probably shallower around the trunk because of the tree branches.  We observed these circles under evergreens. </p>

<p><strong>Second, does this accelerated melting happen only when daytime temperatures go above freezing, or does it start earlier?</strong>     </p>

"Rappel: How do I start rappel from a ledge when using rappel extension","<p>I'm using a rappel extension similar to what is shown in this <a href=""https://vimeo.com/113362076"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> and that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmCNNsjDrVA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one</a>.  When the rappel start is a straight drop-off from a ledge and the anchor is low to the ground, I find it difficult to start the rappel as shown in FotH 9th ed. p.216 (description below) as my ATC (tube-type breaking device) often gets stuck above while I lower into position below the ledge and weigh the rope.  An obvious solution to this would be to forego the extended rappel and clip the ATC directly to the belay loop and clip the autoblock on the leg loop but I'm not a big fan of the leg-loop approach.  Is there a way to start straight drop-off rappels using an extension without getting my gear stuck above?</p>

<p>As to the technique described in FotH:<br>
Essentially the procedure it describes for steep ledges and/or low anchors is to 1- sit down on the ledge as though sitting in a chair; 2- start to rotate to your left until you're facing the rock (assumes right hand is brake hand). This works much better when you can find decent footing. They call the technique is called 'sit-and-spin'.</p>

<p>As to how the ATC gets stuck:<br>
It means that most of my body is over the ledge and the rope is weighted but my ATC, due to the extension, is still on top of the ledge. Given the rope is weighted, it is difficult to make the ATC pass the over the ledge.</p>

"Is it possible to 'live off the sea'","<p>I've recently become aware of the american 'survivalist' or 'prepper' phenomenon. </p>

<p>The general idea seems to be that 'something bad' (exactly what seems to vary) is going to happen, civilization will collapse and the survivalists will run to the hills and live off the land.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that the hills are likely to get over crowded fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Rather than living off the land, is it possible to live off the sea instead?</p>

<p>This isn't a question about the mechanics of living afloat (repairing your boat, fixing leaks, keeping the reverse osmosis plant working) it's more a question of can someone gather/hunt/farm all of the nutrients required to be healthy whilst never having to land again? Obviously fish would be a prime source of food, but would that provide everything a human body needs? Is plant matter essential for survival and if so are seaweeds adequate and can they be farmed? Or are their some essential nutrients that can only be gathered from the land?</p>

<p>you may very well find yourself hanging from some 4 to 5 feet of slack.</p>

<p>If you can't set up a static rope in the back of the ledge (say, off a tree or boulder) to lower yourself smoothly until the rappel device comes under tension, I only see two solutions to avoid downclimbing on a slack rappel setup with a possible nasty slip:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set up a static rope off one of the bolts (using one of the locking biners already in use for the main anchor), and use a grigri to lower yourself until the Prusik engages the ATC and makes the rappel device taut. This would entail connecting a dynamic system and the static rope to a single biner, which is probably not a good idea. </p></li>

"How do you reset your body 'thermostat' after hiking in snow?","<p>About 10 weeks ago, I did a 16-hour snow hike in Newfoundland (off-topic: insanely gorgeous country!).</p>

<p>The outside temperature was still very warm for November, with highs of -5ºC / 23ºF and lows of -10ºC / 14ºF.</p>

<p>I wore multiple layers, as I was prepared for remote possibility to stay the night on the mountain, should I become too tired. For great majority of the hike (10-12 hours) I had all 3 layers open, as it was simply too hot (just -5ºC / 23ºF) and I was sweating like a pig, especially the middle part of the ascent, before I reached the steep gully, where the wind picked up and I eventually zipped  all 3 layers (though only for the rest breaks). My best estimate is that the wind-chill before summit was around -13ºC / 8.5ºF, still far from cold, but at least more comfortable for hiking than the ""hot"" -5ºC / 23ºF.</p>

<p>The problem now is that my internal thermostat / cold resistance got somehow readjusted during the hike, by roughly 4-5 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>As an example, the default in-room 20ºC / 68ºF now feels hot. Not for 5 minutes; all the time. It's more than 20ºC / 68ºF everywhere I go indoors — office or home.
I've found out that the comfortable room temperature wearing T-shirt and shorts is now around 18.5ºC / 65ºF, which is insane for everybody else.</p>

<p>My best guess at this point is that my body 'thermostat' returned back to the winter values I was used to 20 years ago back in Europe, with highs of -15ºC / 5ºF and lows of -25ºC / -13ºF.</p>

<p><strong>But, it's been over 10 weeks since the hike. There must be a switch I can flip back!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Any ideas how to readjust it back? Or at least do things differently for next snow hike?</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps the water intake is to blame? I underestimated the hike (and I quite honestly did not expect excessive sweating at -5ºC / 23ºF) by ±6 hours, so those 6 litres of water (I need 1 litre per 2 hours in winter, much much more in summer — hence the preference for winter hikes) I was carrying up (though I left few additional bottles in car, and I drank half litre right before start of the hike), got consumed very fast (and I basically ended with 1 last litre for last 6 hours — though that was descent, so much less water was physically needed).</p>

That might allow you estimate, for example, that you could survive 5 hours with wool vs. 2 hours with cotton under certain temperature conditions.</p>

"Is it possible for birds to develop mental problems?","<p>A buzzard seen nearby has been continuously attacking people for over a year now. As far as I know this isn't normal behaviour, especially not outside breeding season. Please correct me if I'm wrong. While not 100% sure this is the same animal it surely looks like it because it is always in the same place (let's say plus/minus 100m), the style of attacks is always the same (from behind, usually just flying over a person's head but sometimes effectively scratching them, sometimes severely), and simply because according to biologists I talked to such attacks are fairly rare and it would be exceptional if a whole bunch of them behaved like that.</p>

<p>Another story: years ago we had a male common blackbird in the garden which without any obvious reason started to produce it's alarm sound from sunrise to sunset, almost non-stop, without any evidence whatsoever of any danger (no predators to be seen, no humans, not a single of the many other birds of all kinds of species sounding alarmed). This lasted for about 2 weeks then it stopped for unknown reasons - one possibility being the bird died. In any case, this again isn't exactly standard behaviour. I've been around blackbirds my entire life but never have witnessed something like that.</p>

<p>So just like people can develop mental problems, both cases always led me to think those birds had mental problems. Would that be a feasible explanation? Or is that not regarded as a proper diagnostic for bird whereas it is for humans? Are there other known cases, possibly studies? Could the cause of such behaviour be genetic, a virus, bactaria, parasite perhaps? Or just some disfunction with hard to track cause (again, like for some humans)?</p>

"Biking from Whitehorse to Vancouver","<p>I'm planning to travel along the Alaskan highway this summer (end of June until mid July). I'm not an extremely experienced camper and have only once spent a night outside of a camping ground so far. My greatest bike ride so far was from Zürich to Bern (145km/90m) which I managed in a single day, so I expect to be able to do around 80-100 km each day. So I think I should be able to make it to Vancouver in less than a month. I've read a handful of blogs from people who did it, so the idea isn't quite as outlandish as it first seemed. I'm mostly looking for information about camping spots, emergency situations, necessary equipment, further sources of information and just general tips and tricks. Here's what I've planned so far:</p>

<p>1 CHF = 0.98 USD</p>

<ul>
<li>Fly from Basel to Whitehorse and from Vancouver to Basel - totaling at around 1500CHF (including bike).</li>
<li>I plan to spend around 1000CHF for the entire trip (25k total).</li>
<li>I have a city/mountain bike hybrid that is made to be easy to fix.</li>
<li>I plan to carry around 3-4kg in a backpack and maybe 4-5 in saddlebags.</li>
<li>I think I'll only pack as much food as necessary and stock up along the way. </li>
<li>I should be able to reach some form of settlement every 2 days.</li>
<li>I speak fluent English and some French.</li>
<li>The Temperatures seam pretty bearable at 11° degrees in July.</li>
<li>I'm going to be alone.</li>
<li>I'm planning to sleep in a tent most of the times.</li>
<li>I'll probably stay as close to the road as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here're some of the stuff I am worried about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a better Forum for trips like this?</li>
<li>Wild animals (bears, buffaloes, elk), which precautions are necessary? Are they known to attack unprotected travelers? Do they keep off the road?</li>
<li>Are the prices somewhat reasonable? In Switzerland you get robbed along the highways.</li>
<li>Is the road kept in shape for bikers? Do I have to watch out for reckless drivers?</li>
<li>Is there a danger of highway robbery?</li>
<li>How quick do emergency services respond?</li>
<li>Is camping along the highway even legal? Alternatively, are there enough camping grounds? Online research has been inconclusive.</li>
<li>Is it even safe to travel alone, or should I look for a friend to join me?</li>
<li>Is there cellphone coverage up there? Is there a way to get Internet?</li>
<li>These are just some of the worries of the top of my head, I'm sure there are more.</li>
</ul>

<p>So are there people who have done similar things? I'd love to get in contact. Where should I look for more Information? I'm mainly looking for the exercise and some scenery. Canada seams to most suited for this, but if there are other places for a novice I'm open for suggestions.</p>

"Fish aren't biting, how to get more bites?","<p>I live in Miami, Florida. I have been attempting to catch fish in a canal near where I live with a light rod, 8lb test mono line, and size 6 and 8 hooks. I have primarily been using night crawlers as bait but have also tried several jigs and crankbaits. When fishing worms I use a float about 1.5 - 3 feet above the hook with enough split shot to make the float vertical in the water. </p>

<p>If I drop my line near the edge I can usually get baby Mayan Cichlids to bite. Other than that though I have not had any luck, not even bites no matter where I cast or what time of day I go. I have seen schools of fish swim right by my bait without even attempting a bite. Sometimes when I am bringing my line in as it drags across the surface of the water a baby Florida garr will chase it and attempt to eat my  worm but other than that I have not had any action.</p>

<p>One rare time I casted into the opening of a boat shed and almost as soon as the bait hit the water an adult Mayan Cichlid took it. This was a rare and singular event.</p>

<p>But all that to say, what am I doing wrong? Could my 8lb line be spooking fish or do some fish not have any interest in worms? Maybe using a float is not an effective way to target fish that hang out near the bottom? I know it is hard to say if you are not actually there to see it yourself but I am hoping for some general tips for this type of situation from seasoned anglers. I want to catch some fish that are bigger than the palm of my hands!</p>

"How to find new poles for old tent?","<p>I have a nice and small tent I really like that is around 30 years old.  It is from Sierra West, but I don't remember the model name.  Here is a picture so that you can see the size and general construction:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NYgij.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>This tent is held up with two bows of fiberglass rods that fit into each other.  A small bow of 4 rods makes the arch at the foot end, and 6 rods are used at the head end.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of the rods has just broken:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZW9I.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The rod is 14 inches long, the fiberglass part is 6.5 mm in diameter, and the outer diameter of the aluminum piece is 9.5 mm.</p>

<p>The fiberglass is cracked near the aluminum sleave, and it is rough with fibers sticking out at the right end where it fits into the aluminum sleave of the next piece.</p>

<p>The problem is, the company that made this tent seems to have vanished and I don't know how to get replacement rods.  I'd like to get a complete set of rods, since if this one went the others are probably not far behind.  There seem to be aluminum rods available with bungy cord in the middle, but finding a set that is exactly the length this tent requires seems to be impossible.</p>

<p>Anyone know how to get parts for this old tent, or have any other ideas?</p>

<h2>Added:</h2>

<p>Yes, it's easy to find generic replacement tent poles, but the ones I have seen are all quite different from what my tent uses.</p>

<p>This is a particularly small tent and the radius of curvature is significantly smaller than other tents.  This means the thicker poles that are easy to find would be stressed much more.  Mine are only 6.5 mm diameter, probably for a good reason.</p>

<p>The replacement poles are also much longer than mine.  I suppose the long poles could be cut down, but cutting fiberglass is tricky and can easily damage the material if the right tools aren't used, which I probably don't have since I don't know exactly what the right tool would be.  I am imagining just cutting with a saw would fray the fibers, which is basically cracking the fiberglass, which can't be a good thing.</p>

<p>Another issue is that the pole ends need to fit into the grommets on my tent.  I rather doubt there is such a thing as a standard grommet diameter.</p>

<p>This is not as easy as just Googling for ""tent pole replacement"".  Surely someone here has been thru this process before and has some words of wisdom?</p>

<h2>Added 2:</h2>

<p>This is in response to a comment asking for more details of the rods.<ol></p>

<p><li>The grommets that the end of the tent poles fit into are just circular metal disks with holes in them.  I don't have the tent here, but the inner diameter of these holes is a little larger than the diameter of the tent poles, which is 6.5 mm.  The picture shows a middle piece, but the end pieces have black plastic end caps, with the tips of those being about the same diameter as the fiberglass rod (6.5 mm).</p>

<p><li>The fiberglass rods are solid, so have no inner diameter.</p>

"Will using a sleeping bag stop the body from adapting to cold?","<p>The sleeping bag (at least as I've understood it) works in that way, that it uses the heat the body creates to create a layer of heat air between the body and the sleeping bag's border, therefore providing pleasurable feeling of warmth.</p>

<p>But after watching some videos about people such as Wim Hof and scientific research on their body's behaviour, I've found that something quite opposite is taking place there. Their skin is getting very cold, while the body core remains hot. So, there's no pleasurable feeling of warmth, there's no warm air layer, the skin is feeling trembling cold, and the body protects itself from cold isolating the skin from the body core, therefore using skin as isolating layer.</p>

<p>So, when using sleeping bag, the body is not trained to develop such mechanism, because the skin has always contact with warm air, am I getting it right? So, actually, isn't using sleeping bags stopping the body from real accommodation to cold conditions?</p>

"Chasing with mosquitoes","<p>Mosquitoes are the one of the most disliked <s>pets</s>pest, but they don't seem to take it to heart. </p>

<p>When I go fast through their territory, they seem to have problem with biting me (but if there are enough of them, they manage to do it), but they are circling around me and bite with joined force when I stop. Sometimes after I have to run a bit to get rid of them, but some are still chasing me. </p>

<p>I wonder if there are tests made, to check, what speed is necessary to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make it hard/impossible for mosquito to bite? Are the fast hand/leg movement more important factor than the core speed?</li>
<li>To leave mosquitoes behind, assuming they are willing to pursue you (if you go from shadows into full sun, they probably aren't)?</li>

"Will the benefit of an axe outweigh the drawbacks and win over a large knife?","<p>I've hiked some in my life, and gotten used to carrying a small axe for chopping wood for the fire. But after I bought my self a large fixed-blade bowie knife, I find myself relying less and less on the axe for chopping since the knife very much acts like a small axe.</p>

<p>So my pickle is, now that my axe is left in the dust by a more versatile tool(?), would it make sense to completly remove it from my pack list? Or are there more benefits to a small axe that I can't see?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is better to carry a small axe and a normal-sized fixed-blade knife instead of the pretty large bowie knife? </p>

"Fly fishing rig knots","<p>I have been fly fishing with my dad for a number of years but recently I went on my own and hit quite the stumbling block... I didn't know how to set the kit properly, normally I drive the boat while my dad sets up the rods, and as much as I try to watch what he is doing I also have to not crash the boat. The main issue I had was setting up the line. </p>

<p>I have a reel which has a loop on the end of the fly line (floating line) and I was unsure how to connect that to a leader, and the leader to the tippet. I already know how to attach the fly to the tippet (I use a tucked blood knot). </p>

<p><strong>What I would like to know is:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I attach a leader line to a fly line that has a looped end? (What knot do I use?) </p></li>
<li><p>How do I attach the leader line to the tippet line? (What knot do I use?)</p></li>
<li><p>How long should the leader and tippet lines be? </p></li>
<li><p>How strong should the tippet and leader lines be? </p></li>

<p>I am targeting 0.5-2 kilo brown trout in natural rivers &amp; lakes, trout have good sight &amp; the water is very clear in the Swedish mountains so I like to keep it as thin &amp; hard to see as possible. Likewise the knots should be neat and small, in my experience big lumpy knots will deter the fish &amp; make casting more problematic.</p>

"What is the longest time you can go, eating only freeze-dried food?","<p>As a former member of the Swedish home guard youth, I was told during a survival exercise that you could eat only freeze-dried food for about two weeks. Young and green as I was, I swallowed the statement without any further thought. </p>

<p>I have come to discover that this statement was not all truth. The recommendation is given by the Swedish military to make sure that soldiers don't go too long without varying their meals. Since the MREs (meals ready to eat) you are getting at the army is somewhat limited in variation, they also recommend that you try to eat plenty of fibre alongside your allotted food rations.</p>

<p>Deciding to test this out by myself I bought the approved MRE (aka. Grönpåsen) for full two weeks. After about a week of nothing but freeze-dried, I felt pretty normal in forms of physical strength and nothing stood out. Aside from the fact that I went to the bathroom about three times in that week, it didn't feel like anything was wrong.</p>

<p>After the full two weeks, I felt that nothing had changed, except the regularity of my bathroom visits (and the fact that I was getting pretty bored with the food). I should probably have ate something rich in fibre on the side to alleviate the lack of it in my diet. This I discovered when I returned to eating normal food, let's just say that I was struck by ""Montezuma's revenge"" a couple of hours after my first ""normal"" meal.</p>

<p>So my question is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>What is the maximum time one could live on freeze-dried food and keep a
healthy level of nutrients and minerals?
Also, how would this diet affect the digestion?

Part of me fears that these things are not safe for use AT ALL with rope, only with steel line, in which case they're deskweights for me....but they DO make rope-OK thimbles so I just don't know if these are OK to use and, if so, what knot I should be using)
And would there be any reason to use a different knot at the end-of-a-line where you're connecting a steel O-Ring?  I'll be cutting pieces of 11.7mm climbing rope to make things and the ends need to be strong so I got 1/2"" steel thimbles so I can have steel ""eyelets"" at the ends of these lines, the problem is that all I know is that I can't use cinch knots, past that I know any fixed-knot will work but what I need to know is which is the strongest, or at least one of the top couple strongest?

"Using roof rails to set up hammock","<p>Has anyone experience with attaching a hammock to roof rails of a regular car?</p>

<p>I just bought a hammock for my next camping trip. I will be traveling mostly by car and sleep in a tent but wanted something to relax in outside of the tent or car and also might try sleeping in the hammock. 
My question is: <strong>Is it possible (i.e. safe for both, me and the car) to attach one side of the hammock to the roof rails of the car?</strong> This might make a lot of places hammock-feasible, as I‘d only need one additional tree. </p>

"Blizzard Chaser: What to take on a 5-hour Blizzard Hike?","<p>Thank you for taking the time to read through this !</p>

<p>I just noticed there is a chance of Blizzard (Winter Storm Jonas) in our region (NY/NJ) and I would like to take this unique opportunity and go for a short (5 hours) fun winter hike.</p>

<p>While current predictions (as of Thursday night) only hint at a so-called Hot Blizzard (e.g. temperatures around -5 Celsius), the windchill has a way of sucking out the warmth, so I'd like to run the plan by the local experts here and get some critique.</p>

<p>Here's the <strong>plan</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bottom Layers: Based on experience with the Chicago blizzard, I will now take second pants (I only had one pants on me and after 2.5 hrs my legs were quite cold)</li>
<li>Boots: My new boots were proven in my 16-hour snow hike few months ago, so I take it they should be more than adequate for just 5 hours</li>
<li>Top Layers: Two regular T-shirts + long-sleeve thin shirt + long-sleeve thick shirt + wool sleeve-less vest (very warm with inner warm layer) + waterproof windbreaker jacket</li>
<li>2 Gloves + Scarf + Skiing Cap</li>
<li>Glasses (eyes tend to water a lot, the older I get)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what I want to <strong>have on me</strong> (in case I loose the backpack to wind):</p>

<ul>
<li>2 small vodka shots for the instant energy boost (practically zero weight, yet pack an incredible punch, proven to override fatigue and give you the 'kick' - even when you run out of adrenaline)</li>
<li>2 pairs of reserve gloves (it's very easy to loose them in the wind)</li>
<li>1 reserve cap</li>
<li>cell phone</li>
<li>compass</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what I want to <strong>put into backpack</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>6-8 liters of water : I love to walk against the blizzard, which takes a huge amount of energy, especially a lot of water - I'm pretty sure I'll have to consume over 1 liter per hour</li>
<li>reserve gloves/cap</li>
<li>survival kit</li>
</ul>

<p>I've hauled an enormous amount of food with me up the snowy mountain 10 weeks ago, but did not consume anything during the 16 hour hike. Not even the Snickers bar, let alone bananas or the sandwiches I had. So, I'm thinking I probably should not carry any food for 5 hours (as the hunger would be the least of my worries, should I get stranded), correct ?</p>

<p>While I'm not a complete beginner, there is always room to improve - here are <strong>my prior experiences with blizzards</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>few years ago I did a 2.5 hour hike in what was deemed 3rd worst blizzard in Chicago history, but it wasn't really that bad. I'd like to double that to 5 hours now.</li>
<li>my whole childhood, we never had a 'snow day' just because of blizzard, so we got used to walking to school in blizzard conditions since early age</li>
<li>I believe the coldest blizzard for me was -27 Celsius (only god knows the windchill), and I had to wait 1.5 hr for the bus (at that time I did not know I was actually slowly freezing on that bus stop :-) ) and then walk to school another hour against the wind (actually, it was painful, legs refusing to move).</li>
</ul>

<p>Would you recommend adjusting the layers or taking additional items with me ? </p>

"How do I get my fingers and toes warm before rock climbing at cold temperatures?","<p>I've had now a couple of days when going rock climbing while the temperatures are below the general comfort zone (meaning below 6 °C/ 43 °F). 
When starting to climb, my fingers got cold rather fast until the point when I only felt pain and lost the feeling completly. So I fell off the wall. Luckyly after that, warm blood came back to my fingers and they were warm enough to climb on for a long time. </p>

<p>But here comes the next problem: my climbing shoes are really tight and on my 2nd go with warm fingers I eventually start losing the feeling in my toes, because they are so cold until I eventually slid off. So I put off the shoes and warmed up my feet a little (with the hands) until also here the feeling returned (warm blood came back) and I could finally climb properly.</p>

<p>Has someone got any tips on how to get the warm blood in my fingers and toes before going in the 1st route? I hope there is a method of minimal pain ;-)</p>

<p>One thing I tried, was to circle my arm pretty fast so that blood is forced by centrifugal force in the fingers, but that didn't really do the job (worked only for a moment). A friend of mine told me this method is not useful since the body has to give the signal of sending warm blood itself, otherwise the effect won't last long enough, as I also experienced.
So should I do a warm-up exercises like sprinting around, doing push-ups etc.?</p>

<p>Does anyone know how the pros are doing it? When I see Adam Ondra or so on Youtube bouldering or climbing hard routes near or below zero degrees (0 °C), I always wonder how they warm up and avoid the mentioned problems?</p>

<p>When is it <strong>necessary</strong> to double up locking carabiners? Ever? Doubling up non-locking carabiners with opposite and opposing gates was, and still is a safe practice, but locking carabiners were an innovation invented to provide the same security, but eliminate the necessity of using <em>two</em> carabiners. Yet, there are people doubling up locking carabiners, as if they didn't have locks on them at all, and recommending it as best-practice. I support the notion that there is no such thing as overkill, but, if you're using a 25kN biner with a triple action gate, you are going to be plenty safe top-roping or using the biner to tie-in to your harness. So why are so many people strict on the practice of doubling up on lockers?</p>

"What are the advantages of a vapour barrier?","<p>I was recently reading an article on <a href=""http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=6903"">UKClimbing by Andy Kirkpatrick</a> about clothing in winter. It talks about vapour barriers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve played around with vapour barrier socks over many years, and
  think just having a cheap thin shopping bag next to your skin, then a
  good sock over the top, is a no brainer on any super cold, or extended
  routes.  Having it next to your skin means you don’t end up with
  stinking liner socks, and you also have a little more friction between
  the layers when front pointing.  You really get the advantages from a
  vapour barrier system when your day becomes extended, say that 12 hour
  winter route on the Tacul draws on to a 24 hour epic, where saturated
  socks suck the heat out of your feet with the combination of nighttime
  temperatures and fatigue.</p>

"How dangerous is it to rummage the ground in the mountains of Nevada desert with venomous creatures out there?","<p>I made plans to do some hiking in the mountains of Nevada this weekend.

<p>But now I'm really starting to wonder, how dangerous is this?</p>

  <p>In July 1973, Cowart, then a pilot in the Air Force reserve, and his father were visiting a tract of land that his father was thinking of purchasing. The land lay in a small valley and, unbeknownst to the Cowarts, a gas leak had caused the valley to become filled with propane gas. After surveying the land, the Cowarts returned to their car, and the sparking of the ignition set the gas on the floor of the valley ablaze, severely burning both men. According to Cowart, ""I was burned so severely and in so much pain that I did not want to live even in the early moments following the explosion. A man who heard my shouts for help came running down the road, I asked him for a gun."" He said, ""Why?"" I said, ""Can't you see I am a dead man? I am going to die anyway.

<blockquote>
  <p>One of my neighbors is terribly concerned that her resident chipmunks
  will harm her flower beds. They dig holes, and she finds the holes
  unsightly. She wants to trap them and relocate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond the unsightly holes, she is concerned that the chipmunks will harm her flowers.  I don't know what she is planting, because this comes from a neighborhood on-line site, and I don't know her personally.</p>

<p>We live in northern Virginia, 20 miles or so to the northwest of DC. According to the <a href=""https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/wildlife/information/common-eastern-chipmunk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries</a> the chipmunks in question are probably the common eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus striatus).  (I say probably, because animals are migrating.) </p>

<p>As I say, I don't know what style of garden she favors, formal or centered on naturally occurring species, nor whether she is at all inclined to change her plantings, so I will try to be more specific:</p>

<p>What are non-lethal, and non-harmful (to the chipmunks) tactics to encourage the chipmunks to move away from her front yard?  For example, are there candidates for a chipmunk very-friendly garden that she could plant out of sight?  Almost everyone here has at least an acre.</p>

<p>I'd like to suggest an alternative or three to the options she is considering: amateur and perhaps premature trapping, exterminators, stuffing mothballs into the burrow, and (don't know how serious this is) getting a cat to control the chipmunks.  </p>

<p>I have not bought a proper outdoor setup earlier, rather I carried what ever that was available. In fact, I did not care about the shoes, the bags or the warm clothes, but that had costed me and that was also when I was in my teens. </p>

<p>But now, I can invest in good outdoor gears and equipment that will be with me at-least for the next 10 years or more (with the exception of shoes, which I guess needs to be replaced every 6 months or according to the condition).</p>

I would like to hear about the basic gears, equipment that I should invest on and the total cost that I should keep on mind. (Say, within $300-$500? to begin with or can it be even cheaper?)</p>

<p>One can also tie an asymmetrical Prusik without access to the end of the rope using one of these cords.  As far as I know none of these are popular among rock climbers.</p>

<p>Some people do not carry any dedicated Prusik loops, relying only on runners, but I have seen enough climbers that do.  For those that <em>are</em> carrying Prusik loops why not a single or double eye hitch cord?</p>

<p>I find ascending a rope with a Purcell and a waist Prusik challenging enough.  If one of these arborist's hitches works just a bit better why not consider it?</p>

<p>I think it is valuable to know that one can tie a friction hitch using the end of the rope itself (Blake's) even if this wouldn't be a typical application; it's another tool in the toolbox.</p>

<p>Am I forgetting other critical uses for a Prusik loop that an eyed hitch cord cannot perform?  Are there other practical reasons to choose a closed Prusik loop over these hitches, or is just a matter of different culture and experience?  (Splicing eyes is not a typical climber skill from what I gather.)</p>

"Timing on building a small log cabin","<p>I'm interested in building a small Lincoln-log style cabin (more like a shed, &lt;200 square feet) in hardiness zone 4/5 of northeast USA. Available timbers are mostly red spruce, some eastern hemlock, a little bit of white and red pine, and precious little cedar. My question is about the timing of construction. Below I'll pose a few different questions, but they all amount to ""<strong>What are the timing considerations for construction of a Lincoln-log style cabin?</strong>""</p>

<p>When should logs be cut for the cabin? I know Spring is generally a bad time for logging due to mud and sapflow making it more likely that both felled and standing trees will be damaged more than necessary. Other than the details of logging, can trees be turned to logs at any time of year for use in a log cabin? In general the logging itself is something I'm comfortable with in terms of timing and all, but just about every part of the process after that is where I'm not sure about timing I should aim for.</p>

<p>How long should the logs be left to dry before they are hewn and fit together with notches? Can processing logs begin pretty much immediately upon them being cut, or (more likely I'd guess) do the logs need to sit (stacked or on the ground, in shade or sun) for some (2, 6, 12) months?</p>

<p>And what period can the processing take place over? For example can all the hewing, notching, fitting, etc. be finished over the course of a summer or even a year, or is there any particular time frame it should be done within? I imagine it's a work in progress for its entire lifetime, but maybe there's some critical timing with things like roof and floor completion.</p>

<p>Any info or resources I could look into for guidance would be appreciated. The standard of quality for this one is pretty low as it's an experiment (basically, sturdier than a tent), but I'd still like to try and do it right and learn the process correctly. </p>

"How do you create a sense of community on a backpacking trip?","<p>Having a sense of community on a backpacking trip can mean the difference between enjoyment and misery. It can also be the difference between backpacking as a team instead of as random group of people.</p>

"Could this year's unusual warmth harm turtles?","<p>I currently live about 25 miles northeast of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.  On February 20-21, 2015, a fairly significant snow and ice event struck the area.  On February 29-March 1, 2016, a smaller event occurred also bringing a thin coating of ice.  From February 20-24, 2017, it is sunny and approximately 60°F (16°C) or higher.  I mention this just to illustrate how unusual the weather has been at this time of year, during 2017.</p>

<p>My workplace overlooks a pond.  In past summers, I have gone so far as to break out binoculars and a guide book, and identified that we have at least one <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_map_turtle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">map turtle</a>, five <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_turtle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">painted turtles</a>, and maybe a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eared_slider"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">red-eared slider</a>.</p>

<p>Today (Feb 24, 2017) I went outside for a break and saw the map turtle and two of the painteds on one of the logs on the edge of the pond.</p>

<p>Considering that the long-term forecast does not preclude a return to more normal conditions (there is a blizzard not 200 miles away right now), is there any chance that this early emergence from their <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernaculum_(zoology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hibernacula</a> could ultimately be harmful to these guys?  Or could they just as easily return to the pond bottom and resume a state of <a href=""https://www.lllreptile.com/articles/126-reptilian-brumation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">brumation</a> for another month or two?</p>

<p>UPDATE 6 MARCH 2017 - Early last week there was some heavy rain that swelled the pond and turned it murky. Still, I may have seen one partially-submerged-turtle-shaped object drifting around. Then a few days later, it froze overnight and snowed until noon the next day. Now it has returned to the unseasonable warmth. A bit of a roller coaster from both human and reptile point of view. Anyway, today I saw two painteds on a log. Keeping an optimistic spirit here, until next update.</p>

<p>UPDATE 21 MARCH 2107 - We remain on the temperature roller coaster, though it seems to be starting to stabilize. Anyway, ever since the snow events a couple weeks ago, I have seen no more than two painteds at any one time, and so far no other species. Still too early to jump to conclusions, though. At the least, the fact that there are two definite survivors is good reason for optimism.</p>

<p>UPDATE 27 MARCH 2017 (FINAL) - Great news everyone! I just went out for a look during lunch, and saw a total of five turtles around the pond. One was the map, three were painteds, and one was either another painted or a slider. With the weather stabilizing toward definite spring conditions, it looks like our carapaced friends are in the clear. Yippee!</p>

"Mimosa Pudica (touch-me-not) medicinal uses and edibility","<p>I started reading about an interesting plant that is common around here called <em>Mimosa Pudica</em>, known as ""touch-me-not"" because of its leaves that close upon touching.</p>

<p>It seems to be a plant with valuable medicinal uses, amongst them antibacterial properties<sup>[1]</sup>, anti-anxiety/depression properties<sup>[2]</sup>, inhibiting effect of Naja snake poison<sup>*[3]</sup>, anti-arthritic properties<sup>[4]</sup>, list could go on (i.e.: use as laxative, inhibitor of tumor growth).</p>

<p>It’s also known that it contains toxic mimosine and parts of the plant contains calcium oxalate, but I haven’t found evidence of acute toxicity of the plant.</p>

<p>I'm interested in the use of the plant as a survival aid, both as a medicine and as an edible if possible, so my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is the <em>Mimosa Pudica</em> a safe plant to regularly drink teas from, despite the presence of mimosine and calcium oxalate? If not, what preparation steps should be taken to avoid intoxication, or what dosage should not be surpassed?</p></li>
<li><p>What about dermal application of ethanol/water extracts of the plant as a antibacterial/pain-relief herb for wounds? In this case, I don't think the calcium oxalate would be an issue, but I'm not sure about the mimosine.</p></li>
<li><p>Does the plant have some nutritional value besides the medicinal uses?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't mean to make the questions too scientific, they are just a guideline, what I'm looking for is information about how to use the plant for survival, so any information regarding this is really appreciated!</p>

<p><sub>Obs: If the community believes the question is more appropriate in Biology SE I can write it there. My choice of The Great Outdoors has to do with the survivalism/wild living approach. For example, there are laboratory studies of extracts of the plant, but I’m only interested in the ones that are practical enough for a survival situation.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p><sub>* The articles I found used the pre-incubation method, which exposes the venom to the extract before application. Probably it isn't as effective being applied/consumed after the bite, but in an emergency every effort to buy some time prior to medical treatment seems reasonable (as long as it doesn't cause issues with the latter).</sub></p>

"Tradeoffs between different stopper knots","<p>Because a number of accidents have occurred when a climber was lowered or rappelled off the end of a rope, it is wise to tie a stopper knot in the end(s) of the rope.  My question is what stopper knot do you prefer and why?</p>

<p>It seems to me that the desirable features of a stopper knot are that it should be secure as well as quick and easy to tie.  According to animatedknots.com, a figure eight can work free (though I would have thought that with sufficient tail, this would not be a problem).  </p>

<p>Though not strictly necessary, if you're aware of any empirical tests comparing the effectiveness of different stopper knots, that would be great.  I would also be interested in hearing about any accidents in which failure of a stopper knot (e.g. rolling off the end of the rope due to poor knot choice) was a factor.</p>

<p>I personally always use a barrel knot (triple overhand) with 12-18"" of tail but some of my climbing partners have different preferences so I am interested in knowing how much difference the choice of stopper knot makes.  In particular, are some stopper knots dangerous to use?  I would imagine that a single overhand could be a risky choice (particularly with a short tail).</p>

"Does a Mammut Smart Alpine belay device go well with a Black Diamond Gridlock carabiner? Any other recommendations?","<p>Has anybody ever tried to use a cross-load protecting Black Diamond Gridlock carabiner with a Smart Alpine belay device? </p>

<p>I do think the Smart Alpine does not go very well with the CRAG Smart HMS carabiner from Mammut. The Smart Alpine belay device sometimes gets caught in a corner since it is pretty broad and rather chunky. In a hectic situation this may cause danger to the climber. </p>

"Sleeping solutions when camping with dogs?","<p>My dog enjoys hiking. I haven't taken her on any overnight trips yet, but would like to try some summer/fall backcountry camping with her (i.e., what I think Europeans call wild camping -- not car camping). The wilderness areas near our home (Los Angeles) are mountainous, so it will be cold at night, even in the summer. I'd like her and me to get a pleasant night's sleep. I usually don't bring a tent (do sometimes bring a tarp) for summer/fall backpacking in California. She has fur, so I'm sure she could survive the overnight conditions just sleeping out in the open, but she'd probably be unhappy, and would whine and want to crawl into my sleeping bag, which would be uncomfortable for me.</p>

"How to cope with thorns when hiking barefoot?","<p>There are two main factors that cause me to get thorns in the feet when hiking barefoot:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Usually, the forest ground consists of many layers - grass, beneath it rotten leaves, beneath it grass roots, but still aerated. Thorny plants can be hidden beneath the grass and fully invisible.</p></li>
<li><p>One can't always look down where he is stepping, therefore encountering from time to time raspberries or blackberries.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When I hit a thorn, it usually hurts quite a lot in the first moments. However, my feet are dirty from walking and seeing the thorn is difficult. Furthermore, even if I locate it, it is usually embedded deep enough to make removal difficult.</p>

<p><em>How can I identify which thorns are dangerous in the long therm and should be removed promptly (instead of leaving it inside the foot)? How to determine if the painful thing that hit my foot is a plant's thorn, that will dissolve in the body in a few days, or is a tiny piece of stone/glass, that, if not removed, will embed there and hurt indefinitely long?</em> </p>

"How to safely train for and grip pockets?","<p>I was spurred to post this after reading <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/10858/which-fingers-to-use-in-a-2-finger-pocket-when-rock-climbing"">Which fingers to use in a 2 finger pocket when rock climbing?</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Last year I injured myself training on a shallow three finger pocket with an open hand grip and my pinky dropped.  While hanging with maximum effort I felt a popping sensation in the palm of my hand and heard a brief but audible ripping-paper sound.  Pain and swelling followed.</p>

<p>I never received a professional diagnosis, but seeing as I would not be climbing for a while I had time to read fairly extensively on the subject, and I concluded that in all likelihood I had suffered a partial tear of the fourth palmar lumbrical.  This is a small muscle that runs <em>between</em> the flexor tendons of the fourth and fifth digits, seen below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhNrJ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhNrJ.jpg"" alt=""palmar lumbricals""></a></p>

<p>When some of the digits are nearly fully extended and others maximally flexed a shearing force is created in the lumbricals, which can lead to a tear.  </p>

<p>Reference this illustration from <a href=""http://www.klatring.no/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=LG2ASlI1haM="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Lumbrical Tears in Rock Climbers</em> – A. SCHWEIZER [PDF]</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXoFi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXoFi.jpg"" alt=""lumbrical shear""></a></p>

<p>Since this injury I am shy to commit to any pockets.  I can baby the <em>fourth</em> lumbrical by avoiding splitting the fourth and fifth (ring and pinky) fingers, but that does not protect the <em>third</em> lumbrical from shear as shown in the illustration above.</p>

<p>As I have become more aware of the interconnection between digits I have noted that none of them are independent, not even the index and middle fingers which do not share a lumbrical.</p>

<p>For example if I:</p>

<ul>
<li>with my wrist extended or at least straight</li>
<li>hold the 3rd, 4th, &amp; 5th digits straight (in line with the palm) <em>using the other hand</em></li>
<li>and flex my index finger down toward my wrist as far as possible</li>
</ul>

<p>I feel a sharp and almost painful tension in my forearm.  I did not feel even this much discomfort in my palm before the tear so it seems probable that this is another source of potential injury.</p>

<p>It seems that not flexing the dropped fingers from the lowest joint (MCP) greatly reduces shearing stresses.  This works OK when I can prop the fingers against the face of the rock, e.g.:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/madZB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/madZB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However on protruding plastic gym holds or overhanging routes when I cannot prop my fingers I don't seem to be able to hold them back like that and still truly exert.  <em>Is this something I just need to practice?</em></p>

<p>Contrarily I see plenty of strong climbers bending the dropped fingers at the palm like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1CCl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1CCl.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Did I injure myself only because I was trying too hard?  It happened at near 100% exertion, and afterward someone told me to train at no more than 60-70% intensity.  If that is true (is it?) an injury could still happen on a hard route unless I intentionally limit myself, right?</p>

They spend months in our yard, eating seeds both on the ground and in the feeders. They also peck around in my flower garden, so I think they might be eating grubs and insects.

<p>I love their plaintive <a href=""http://www.learner.org/jnorth/sounds/Dove_Mourning.mp3"" rel=""noreferrer"">cooing sound</a>. It's hauntingly beautiful. I used to think it was an owl call but know better now. </p>

I've never seen a bird using their mouth in such a way as to think I was watching them speak. Even when they're in the tree branch above the feeders, as in my second picture, they look and seem silent. I know it's not because they're nocturnal, as I hear it all day, though sometimes louder towards dusk. I don't think I'm just missing it, as I frequently sit outside with them for hours.</p>

<p>There's a whooshing sound when they rise from the ground, but that comes from the flapping of their wings, and stops when they land.</p>

"Redundancy in rappel systems","<p>What is the simplest setup for rappelling that is <strong>fully</strong> redundant?</p>

<p>The most common system seems to be rappelling off of both strands of a rope passing through two rappel rings on separate anchors. While providing the option to recover the rope by pulling on one end, that setup still leaves the rope as a single point of failure.</p>

<p>Assuming the highest degree of redundancy is required, would it not be more safe to tie two figure-eight knots on two bights, connecting each to a separate anchor, and then rappelling off of those two strands? Thus if one of the anchors fail, or even if one part of the rope fails, the other strand is still fully intact.</p>

<p>Any specific reason this setup is not more common?</p>

"How to escape a cave in an emergency situation?","<p>I have been doing a lot of cave climbing recently. So I am not talking about your average tourist cave, I talk about real miles deep labyrinth like caves, where nature never thought of humans getting in. To rule-out trivial answers I'd like to sketch the current scenario:</p>

<p><em>You are with an experienced guide in a cave for about 2h, the guide loses consciousness after an accident and needs immediate medical attention. Since you relied on the guide's expertise, you are uncertain about the route back to an exit. You know that help may arrive in the next 48 hours or so since you may not return in time from your expedition. You have a light source, a compass and a map of the cave. Your light source will pose no immediate issue since you have power for at least the next two days. However, because the guide is in serious trouble and would possibly die in the next few hours (after performing first aid) you decide to try the escape anyway.</em> </p>

<p>What is a good strategy to escape the cave in order to get help for the guide in trouble? </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>
The question is less about the guide in danger, rather about possible strategies to navigate back. ""Stay where you are"" is a valid answer if you hope for rescue.</p>

<p>A second similar scenario is: 
<em>You were beamed by an evil villain into a cave unknown to you. You have a light source, a compass and a map of the cave. The cave has an exit. You want to get out.</em></p>

"Is it more likely for a viper to bite in a muddy weather?","<p>Today is / was one of the few days (vacations aside) when I’m completely free, so I really wanted to go out somewhere. Nothing serious – one day of walking in the European woods, with many villages around.</p>

<p>However, I reluctantly resigned having been warned against vipers. The argument was, we’ve been having showers since like three weeks, there’s going to be lots and lots and lots of mud. First, in a dry weather, I may see a viper and walk around it, but I may be completely unable to notice it in the mud. Even more importantly, in a dry weather my ankle boots may protect me from a bite, should I nevertheless happen to annoy the snake – but in the mud, my foot is likely to plunge pretty deep, allowing the venomous snake to reach above my boots, biting me through my trousers.</p>

"How can I identify Woolly Adelgid on a Hemlock tree?","<p><strong>Note</strong>: An update has been added to this post, and is found below the first set of pictures.</p>

<p>I live in Central Massachusetts, in the town of <a href=""https://www.mapquest.com/us/ma/holden-282925920"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Holden</a>. We're on the border of the large city of <a href=""https://www.mapquest.com/us/ma/worcester-282038981"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Worcester</a>. </p>

<p>In a <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/15470/do-american-mourning-doves-only-make-their-plaintive-cooing-sound-where-people-c"">previous question</a>, one of my photographs caught the eye of a user here in Massachusetts who is monitoring the <a href=""https://www.invasive.org/hwa/fhtet200103.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hemlock Woolly Adelgid</a>, an aphid-like tree killer.</p>

<p>This insect is decimating forests and home landscapes all over the country. The New England Area is so badly infested that hemlocks are under quarantine in both <a href=""https://www1.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/quarantine_information.html#hwa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maine</a> and <a href=""http://www.agriculture.nh.gov/publications-forms/documents/hwa-quarantine.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">New Hampshire</a>.</p>

<p>It seems the most significant research in New England has been taking place at <a href=""http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/other-tags/hemlock-woolly-adelgid-hwa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Harvard Forest</a>, the 3500 acre forest owned by Harvard University. It's located in Petersham, a town about 70 miles west of Boston. Senior Ecologist <a href=""http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/researchers/59"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">David Orwig</a> has spent decades studying and educating about what has been called the ""woolly bully"" at the forest and other regions. His research is getting widespread attention. In April of 2015, The National Geographic published an article entitled <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/04/150402-forest-die-off-climate-harvard-hemlocks-global-warming/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Are Harvard's Dying Hemlocks a Warning for Trees Everywhere?</a>  </p>

<p>Because this is such an important issue, I'm concerned not only about my own tree, but also about how to identify the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid while out walking, in order to report it to the proper authorities. I'm hoping other people here can be encouraged to do the same. </p>

<p>First, Is my tree infected?<br>
An excellent publication detailing the life-stages, with pictures, can be found <a href=""https://www.invasive.org/hwa/fhtet200103.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. My tree doesn't seem to have the large growths that are the hallmark of the mature adelgid, but I do have a lot of leaves with a white dusty coloring, which can be a sign of a young infestation.  I did find a woolly-looking thing with pinchers attached to a twig, and a few areas of white netting. There are a few round solid lumps, which I thought might be bird droppings, but the experts would know better about that. </p>

<p>All the pictures below were taken in the first week of March, 2017, except the one with the doves, which is from July of 2016. To save space, I've made all of them smaller. Please click on them to see larger, more close-up versions. Some are blurry, but I have others I'd be glad to post instead if need be. Don't hesitate to ask. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Shortly after posting this I had the tree  examined by a naturalist/ecological arborist who's been studying the adelgid for years and treating trees all over Massachusetts. He said it was very healthy, with good new growth and no evidence of adelgid. He was intrigued by the picture I had posted of the suspected infestation. As part of his research, he's been finding that something had happened, most likely a weather pattern, to cause the adelgids to die off without human intervention. Many previously-infested trees have made remarkable recoveries, most likely including mine. This correlates with information provided by Olin Lathrop's answer below.</p>

<p>He examined all of my trees and plants, and did find some Wooly Adelgid on a hemlock in a completely different area of my yard. </p>

<p>He explained that Wooly Adelgid is identified by the appearance of white, cotton-like masses at the junctions of the twigs and the needles. The wooly substance is a coating covering an adelgid with eggs. </p>

<p>He said my infestation was in a young stage, and didn't cover a large enough section of my tree to be doing major damage. He recommended removing the affected branches, which we did, and keeping an eye on the rest of the tree as we come into the spring and summer. If we see a lot more, and want to treat them, his approach to control begins with spraying the affected area with horticultural oils. The spray coats the adelgids and suffocates them, while not harming the rest of the tree or other plant or animal life. This is the least invasive treatment, and should always be the first choice when possible, especially for a homeowner with only a few trees. If the infestation gets out of control, the next step is to treat the entire tree with an insecticide. Imidacloprid has been used successfully for years, but permethrin seems to have some better qualities, and is becoming more popular. All trees are part of the delicate balance of the outdoor eco-system, and removing them shouldn't be the first course of action. </p>

<p>He agreed that the vicious adelgid is doing tremendous harm wherever it's found. The number of infested trees makes control very difficult, and sadly, especially in forest areas, the adelgids are still winning the war. </p>

<p>I appreciate and give full credit to Olin Lathrop for spotting the problem on the original tree, which precipitated this question. Without his keen eye, and generous help, I would never have had it examined. Then I wouldn't have known I had trouble lurking in a different tree, and probably would have lost it. </p>

<p>Below are pictures of our actual adelgids, taken in March of 2017. They're similar to Olin's, further confirming the correctness of his answer. </p>

"How do slow sand filters work and are there any alternatives?","<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Slight Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>A slow sand filter is a filter used to purify water. The original design is composed of a layer of gravel, then a layer of fine sand. Sometimes, however, there is an extra layer of bacteria on the top doing most of the purification.</p>

<p>This layer of bacteria is called the <strong>Schmutzdecke</strong> (German for dirt covering).</p>

<p>What are these and what are they used for? Is my assumption correct that they may be used for a cross horse jumping course? </p>

"Using Lanolin for Merino Clothes","<p>For our little baby's merino wool overtrousers-diapers we use Lanolin, which is absolutely recommendes by all producers of this kind of overtrousers. My question has two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have googled this now for a while and no outdoor producer of merino stuff (like woolpower, smartwool or others) even mention lanolin. Would there be any point not to wash my merino stuff with lanolin?</p></li>
<li><p>I have a <a href=""http://www.brynje-shop.com/en/sportswear~c244/brynje-antarctic-jacket-with-hood-and-shoulder-inlay-10511377-p24357"" rel=""noreferrer"">jacket</a> with different materials. In this case     </p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Outside: 70% Merino Wool / 30% Polyamid - 22,5 Micron
Lining: 100% Polypropylene-Mesh

</blockquote>

<p>Would there be any negative effects washing this jacket with lanolin?</p>

<p>Maybe the breathability is affected by a lanolin impregnation but if it is just as the natur is doing it (re-fatting or re-greasing, I am not sure about the vocabular here) it should be still breathable. </p>

"Sign in/Sign out sheets for dangerous passages while hiking!","<p>Many years ago, while hiking with a friend, we came across a particular point in the trail which was rather dangerous. If one slipped, the fall would surely be fatal.  What struck me most is the fact that there was a sign in/sign out sheets (which were in a green box with a plexiglass lid) at the beginning and end of this particular section of the trail. One was encouraged to print one's name, the date and time. The reason for the signing in and out was to know for a fact that hikers actually made it to the other end. If one did not sign in on the other side, Search and Rescue had a idea of where to look. </p>

<p>These sign in/sign out sheets were in mid trail and there were no sign in sign in sheets at the trailhead and no permits were required either.</p>

<p>The main thing that seems to be missing from the basic code outlined by <em>Freedom</em> is some clarification around the ""I'm fine"" response. ""I'm fine; keep going"" vs ""I'm fine; wait for me"". And from the group's perspective, telling the separated person to return vs continuing to forge their own path. Anyone know of or worked out a simple system for this sort of signal?</p>

I thought it was a wonderful idea, so I bought an extra, but now that it is getting close to spring, I am having second thoughts about installing it.</p>

<p>A bit a quick details, fresh water tank is located under bed in tow behind camp trailer.  The bed lifts to provide access to the tank and additional storage. The water tank is about 25 gallons, 12 inchs tall, and about 2 foot by 3 foot square.  I drain it before winter storage, and run RV anti freeze through the entire system.  The tank is semi transparent plastic.  I general travel with a full tank of fresh water, unless I know there is potable water at my destination. </p>

<p>I was planning to cut a hole in the top of the tank, just like <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/14600/screen-cover-for-boat-inspection-port"">for an inspection port</a>, this would allow me to reach in and scrub the inside of the tank, rinse it out, and flush the system with clean water. </p>

<p>The standard alternative is to fill the fresh water tank with bleach and water, drive around to try and slosh the water around, flush repeatedly, and sometimes use backing soda to get the bleach taste out of the water.  </p>

<p>Being able to reach in and clean will make it quicker, easier, and probably more effective to clean the inside of the fresh water tank. </p>

<p>The inspection port is designed to keep water out, so I think there is some risk that sloshing water, or overfilling could force the inspection port cover off. As I would not realize until I stopped, meaning several gallons of water could be sloshing around outside of the tank and inside the camper/trailer.</p>

<p>Now, following the other one to see how he tries to solve the riddles / deal with people is half of the fun. The objective of the game is solving the riddles to finally find the place where the other guy was hidden so following the player isn't possible. <strong>How can I track the movements of the player to allow me to ""participate"" in the game without him knowing where I am?</strong></p>

<p>Just asking him, ""How did you solve this? What did you say to people X?"" isn't very fun.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>The game is Max 2 hours long.</p>

"Post-hike Care and Pain Relief for Blisters and Hot Spots","<p>There are many, many articles and web sites that will tell you what to do if you develop a hot spot or blister while on the trail, and need to perform some field treatment to allow you to get back in your boots and finish your excursion.  There are many more that will help you prepare for your hike and take steps to prevent these from happening in the first place.  This includes handfuls of questions and answers here at TGO.SE.</p>

<p>However, what I have not been able to find is anything that discusses the long-term and after-care.  For that time when you've been back to home and work for a day or two, yet there remains this patch of red, angry skin on your heel or toe.  How can you help it heal?  How can you reduce the pain while it heals?</p>

<p>Although I would prefer a generalized answer that helps the entire community, I will describe my own case. I've just finished a week-long vacation with some light hiking at several stops going there and back.  Further, my hiking shoes were not 100% broken in yet.  The good news is that I never blistered, just formed hot spots on the bottom of both big toes.  The bad news is that those spots are still rather painful- as I unpack and clean up, I really notice it.  I've tried a moisturizing foot lotion, but it's been no help.  I'm not sure whether to try a warm water and epsom salt bath or not.</p>

<p>Confused, I looked for other uses of the term barrel knot and found this snippet on the Animated Knots page for a <strong><a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/barrel/#ScrollPoint"">barrel hitch</a></strong> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Barrel"" Confusion: Unfortunately, the name Barrel has been applied to various other knots. Ashley himself used it as an alternative name (ABOK # 1413, p 259) for the Blood Knot. Some have applied it to the Poacher's Knot, e.g., descriptions by IRATA and Access Techniques, and others to the <strong>Double Fisherman's</strong>, e.g., Cave Now. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_knots"">Wikipedia's list of knots</a> says a barrel knot's alternative name is the <strong><a href=""http://www.animatedknots.com/bloodknot#ScrollPoint"">blood knot</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barrel knot (blood knot) - joins sections of monofilament nylon line while maintaining much of the line's inherent strength</p>

<p>However, the blood knot and double fishermans/double overhand are definitely different knots.</p>

"Can you get burned by boiling water on everest?","<p>At sea level, pure water boils at 100°C. In my hometown, water boils at 97°C, and being at a higher elevation we always had to boil or cook our food longer than the recommended times given in recipes. </p>

<p>I recently learned that it was impossible to cook a hardboiled egg on Everest, because water boils at only ~70°C at the higher camps, so the egg whites can't get hot enough to cook and get solid. </p>

<p>My initial research seems to indicate that at 70°C, you could hold your hand in a pot of water for almost half a second before getting burned, so if you were to spill boiling water over yourself high on Everest, with the combination of elevation and cold air, would you still burn yourself?  </p>

<p><strong>Side Question:</strong>
Water boils at higher temperatures if it is <em>impure</em> or has minerals in it.

<li>Can they be close, or attached, to a window?</li>
<li>Can they be near each other, or should there be a distance between them? (I ask this because I was told that hummingbirds are territorial, and a male can guard a perimeter of up to 3 feet, making it important to keep their feeders at least that far apart.)</li>

<p>I'd like to set up a kind of treasure hunt (perhaps geocaching) for my friends. I was thinking that I could take pictures of places (signs, doors, corners of buildings, stuff like that) but from quite close so that you won't see the surroundings to make it a bit harder, and hide something (text, a hint) to where the picture was taken. </p>

<p>An example:
A picture of a graffiti from under a bridge (the picture shows only the graffiti). My friends, once they find out where the graffiti is, go to the bridge and find the next hint. </p>

"How should I vet belayers? What should I look for?","<p>The other night I went to the climbing gym, intending to look for a climbing partner once I got there. (My usual gym climbing partner isn't available to climb as often as I want to.) The gym provides a whiteboard where you can write your name if you're looking for a partner.</p>

<p>A woman came up to me and offered to climb. She said she was there with a friend, but the friend didn't know how to belay. This was my only real clue that she herself might be inexperienced as a belayer -- probably the two of them were mainly there to boulder. I checked that she had the card tied to her harness that the gym gives you if you've passed their belay test. I belayed her on a climb, and then she belayed me. The belay device was a grigri.</p>

<p>When I was ready to be lowered after finishing the climb, she initially dropped me about half-way down the wall at very high speed, then suddenly stopped me and lowered me much more slowly the rest of the way. When I got to the bottom, she was very embarrassed and apologetic. She apparently hadn't understood how to control the speed when lowering with the grigri, and had probably just pulled the lever back all the way and let go with her hand on the brake strand. She left immediately after this.</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions on how to screen potential belayers in a situation like this, and what to do if they seem inexperienced? The best thing I'm coming up with so far, other than checking for the belay card, is to ask explicitly how experienced they are. (A lot of people seem to ask, ""How long have you been climbing?,"" which is probably a nice neutral way of getting this kind of information.) Then if they say they're inexperienced, I can give them a quick mini-review.</p>

"How to get rid of illegal artificial paints on historical monuments?","<p>India is known for its historical monuments and Caves are essential part of them.

"How do choices in design of a paddle-craft influence its handling characteristics?","<p>If you imagine cutting a canoe or kayak along each axial plane, you get three shapes.  If you cut along the  waterline and look down from above, you get the plan.  Cut thwart-wise at the widest point and view from head-on, that's the cross-section.  The cross-section may or may not include tumblehome, a narrowing of the sides toward the gunwales.  Finally, cut lengthwise and view from the side, that's the rocker.  Designers have a variety of shapes to choose from for each of these, as the sketches below illustrate.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2EkC.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/A2EkC.gif"" alt=""set of images of various plan, cross, and rocker shapes""></a></p>

<p>(This discussion ignores things like external keels and tracking channels.)</p>

<p>As a paddler, you will need to learn how your craft handles, and will observe these characteristics:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stability - high resistance to capsizing</li>
<li>Speed - low resistance to moving forward through the water</li>
<li>Maneuverability - low resistance to changes in direction</li>
<li>Tracking - high resistance to wobble (aka jitterbug) while moving forward</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is how the various choices in plan, cross, and rocker translate into improvements or sacrifices in stability, speed, maneuverability, and tracking.  I already have some broad intuitive notions, as well as a sense that what improves one of these traits generally degrades another.  I am wondering if someone can help with the gritty details, possibly even get into the physics and mathematics of it (i.e. give us a primer on fluid dynamics as it relates to paddle sports.)</p>

<p>Just as an example, I have a kayak with a flat rocker, mid-range plan, and gently rounded cross-section with tumblehome.  This kayak is very stable, has good tracking, is reasonably maneuverable, although it is not fast.  If it were narrower, my guess is it would be faster but less stable.  If the cross-section was more round, it would be more maneuverable but at the expense of its good tracking.  Are these ideas correct?  Why exactly?</p>

"Getting into canoeing - UK","<p>It's been a beautiful Sunday here in the UK today and I went by the river (Thames) with my girlfriend to get some sunlight and fresh air. (We rarely do that, so that might be why I'm writing a question right now.)</p>

<p>We've seen quite a lot people canoeing on inflatable canoes on the river and we thought:<br>
<code>Hey! That actually seems fun! Could we do that?</code></p>

<p>So I looked up inflatable canoes on eBay and these seem rather cheap -
then I tried to look up how to approach ""getting-started"" but I'm a bit confused now.</p>

<p><strong>This leads to a question:</strong><br>
As a total water-newbie<br><em>(my experience with water ends on swimming in a pool back when I was a child)</em><br>what do I need to do to be able to legally and safely canoe on Thames?</p>

<p>Do I need any official training? Do I or my canoe need to have a licence?</p>

"Are Italian mountain huts accessible when unstaffed?

"Choosing a backpack size between small and medium, which is preferable?","<p>After reviewing many backpacks, both online and in person, Iv'e decided that I want the Osprey exos 48. Unfortunately, the only Osprey dealer in my area carries only the exos 58, and they had it only in the medium size, which I tried and felt great on my back, although the hip belt felt was a bit large (I'm slim fit). Since the 58 is too big for me, I'll be ordering the 48 online. My torso is of size 18"", which by the Osprey sizing chart (attached) means small or medium. I'm reasonably sure that the small would be an even better fit for me, but is it worth taking the chance?</p>

"Fact or Fiction: ""If you want to keep your feet warm, wear a hat."" (and the various explanations for it)","<p>Inspired by several <a href=""/q/9638/9109"">questions</a> and <a href=""/a/7146/9109"">answers</a> <a href=""/q/22855/9109"">here</a> and also one at <a href=""//biology.stackexchange.com/q/21033"">Biology SE</a>, I have been looking around to try to find out whether this idea I heard constantly as a youth has any merit, or it just folk-wisdom gone bonkers.  Usually expressed in the slogan given in the title- if you want to keep your feet warm (at night), wear a hat (to bed)- this counter-intuitive notion was repeated to me often by many I respected.  My relatives, Scout Leaders, and others all believed this notion.</p>

<p>The explanation falls into one of a handful of broad categories, but the most common is that things like hearts, brains, and guts are very important, while things like fingers and toes, not so much.  So when the body is in a situation where it needs to ration resources it might steal resources from the extremities in order to give a greater share to the vital organs.  It does this by constricting the blood vessels in the extremities, reducing blood flow to those areas, and keeping more of the warm, oxygenated, nutrient rich blood nearer the core.  This explanation seems to be confirmed in <a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320327.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Causes and remedies for cold feet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Another explanation I heard was that the majority of heat loss in the body is via the head.  Some would continue by saying that heat rises, and the head in on top.  I recall one grizzled old outdoorsman I encountered in college making all of us put our hands just over our heads and ""feel the heat.""  But it seems this claim may not be due to physics, but that people tend to cover the body rather thoroughly when outside in the cold, except the head.  So the heat simply has no where else to go.  In reality, given uniform insulation, the body loses heat proportional to surface area.  See, for example: <a href=""https://www.clickondetroit.com/health/fact-or-fiction-does-wearing-a-hat-keep-you-warmer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Fact or fiction: Does wearing a hat keep you warmer?</em></a> and the linked Biology question.</p>

<p>Of course, this may be exactly the source of my title's slogan in the case of sleeping - you are everywhere wrapped in an insulated sleeping bag, except your head.  So when you add socks and blankets around your feet while leaving your head exposed, you aren't really helping.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, it is difficult to separate cause and effect, science and myth, and determine what exactly goes on in a body out in the cold.  What, if anything, can one reliably conclude? </p>

"Systematic and random error of GPS or barometric altimeter. How to optimally use GPSMAP 66s?","<p>A barometric altimeter is supposed to be more accurate than a GPS altimeter in the relative sense (total ascent, total descent, during stable weather), but may have considerable error in the absolute sense (more than 100 metre error if pressure has changed a lot since last calibration).  The GPS altimeter may have an error of perhaps 3–4 times the horizontal error, which for positioning may be much better than the barometric altimeter; however, the GPS altimeter is noisy such that tracks are noisy and ""total ascent"" is a fiction.  See also <a href=""https://gis.stackexchange.com/q/333252/4904""><em>Random and systematic error of GPS or barometer based altitude measurements</em></a>.</p>

<p>I've personally found that for accurate <em>positioning</em>, the GPS altitude (on my GPSmap62 which has no barometric altimeter, or on the GPSMAP66c which does have one) is often more accurate than the barometric altimeter.  Is there a combination of settings that will improve the accuracy of the barometric altimeter?  Alternately, can I disable it in favour of GPS-measured altitude?</p>

<p>Some online sources about GPS altitude error agree with me:</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://geoawesomeness.com/accurate-altimeter-gps-watch/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">geoawesomeness</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The general rule of the thumb is that vertical error is three times the horizontal error. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.borgeltinstruments.com/GPSvsPressurealtitude.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">borgelt instruments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the GPS altitude is the GEOMETRIC altitude above  Mean Sea Level accurate to 10 to 20 meters* and explains from theory and practice that GPS altitude at 10 to 20 meters (35 to 70 feet) error  is superior to Pressure Altitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2010/05/understanding-sport-device-gps.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dcrainmaker.com</a> states (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Barometric altimeters</strong> from a sports standpoint <strong>tend to give you graphs that are ‘shaped’ correctly</strong> – meaning when you go up the graphs show an incline, and when you go down they show a decline.  The challenge though with barometric based devices is that* <strong>*the baseline altitude can sometimes be incorrect</strong>.  This is because normally barometric altimeters are calibrated off of a known barometric pressure reading.  In airplanes for example, this ‘calibration factor’ is constantly being tweaked as the pilot flies the plane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pressure changes can easily lead to barometric altitude error in excess of 100 meter.  My horizontal accuracy is usually around 5 metre, which is consistent with an elevation accuracy in the order of 15-20 metre.</p>

<p>Although I can access the GPS altitude via the satellite screen or frequently calibrate the barometric altitude by the GPS altitude, an automated low-battery solution would be preferable.  I've noticed there is an ""auto calibration"" option, but I don't understand what it really does.  What combination of settings can I use?</p>

"Is it worth it to switch from Osprey Atmos to Exos to save weight?","<p>My wife and I started hiking this season (we have been cycling for 10 years before that). We have pretty light and compact gear, except for the backpack. We carried Osprey Atmos 50 and Osprey Talon 22 on a week trip. Everything including food and water fit in nicely. Base weight of the 50 liter pack was around 7,5 kilograms and it was about 15 at the most with the food and 5 liters of water. Now I am considering to switch to Osprey Exos for the next season to save additional 500 grams.</p>

<p>My concern is the suspension system on the Exos which seems to be less comfortable than that on the Atmos. I already had some discomfort when carrying 15 kilograms in the Atmos. I am concerned the weight saving might not be worth it.</p>

<p>Is 500 gram weight saving significant? How noticeable is the difference in comfort from 500 gram weight saving?</p>

<p>I have another crazy idea - bring the Atmos to the local workshop which mades my bike bags and let them replace the heavy fabric on the Atmos by a lighter fabric. But I would prefer not to do that.</p>

<p>Update:
We hike in northern Europe, temperatures 10-20 degrees Celsius, 5 days without a resupply (at most), water has to be carried for at most one overnight stay. Winds up to 35 m/s, but rarely. No snow. We hike in trail runners and most of the gear is already reasonably light. Our combined base weight is about 14 kilograms (for two persons).</p>

We used to indoor top rope belay but that was years ago in boy Scouts so our rock climbing knowledge is incomplete and rusty. We've fished this area for years without needing rescue equipment but as everyone gets older and with the level of parkour required to fish this creek, I feel it's time to be more prepared.</p>

<p>Likely scenario: pair of fisherman radio for help with sprained/broken ankle. Unable to follow creek rest of the way to the exit point.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario: single fisherman misses 15 minute radio check-in. Assume unconscious.</p>

<p>Environment: single lane (shared w/ oncoming traffic) mountain road follows creek being fished. Approximately 5 miles between entry/exit points. Road can be as much as 50 feet above creek and incline can be as steep as sheer cliff face though it's usually a sharp incline with near unclimbable shifting gravel. 1 hour drive from cell service, another 1 hour drive to Gunnison hospital.</p>

<p>Rescue team: pickup truck with two adults. We'll drive up till we spot fisherman. Probably anchor to the truck or nearby pine trees, blocking the road for other campers/fisherman. Alternate route for them would be a 5 hour drive around so I believe blocked traffic will wait.</p>

"Can I use one helmet for both kayaking and skiing?","<p>I am doing little kayaking and just a bit more skiing (the seasons for both are very short where I live). Both of these need helmets, but I feel reluctant to buy 2 items, each of which will see little use.</p>

<p>So I wonder whether I can buy 1 helmet that will be sufficiently safe (but not necessarily convenient) for both activities.</p>

<p>My thoughts so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>A kayaking helmet must be sturdy enough and protect the ears and the back of the head. I see no contradiction with skiing.</li>
<li>A kayaking helmet must have holes. No problem for skiing.</li>
<li>A skiing helmet should protect from cold. However, I don't really need this - it's never too cold where I am skiing.</li>
<li>I am not proficient enough in all the details, so I am afraid to miss some important considerations.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, how can I choose a kayaking helmet that is also suitable for skiing? Or vice versa?</p>

"How do you lower a backpack over a cliff without damaging it?","<p>I was backpacking in Coyote Gulch, Utah this past week and ran into an issue with my 70 liter backpack. The entrance to the gulch through ""Crack in the Wall"" was a narrow ""slot"" entry, so the backpacks could not fit through. Hence we had to lower our packs down the canyon wall with rope while we climbed down separately. </p>

<p>The problem is that abrasion against the canyon wall caused a small rip in the front pocket. So that was annoying because now my bag has a tear in it. </p>

<p>I was wondering what the right way to lower a pack over a canyon wall is--or perhaps more generally, how to deal with reducing abrasion damage to a pack? Is there some sort of covering I should have used for the pack, or is there a certain way to thread the rope through the pack so that it goes down a certain way, etc?</p>

"Are the seagulls begging or contentedly sighing?","<p>For any Dr. Doolittles out there, when a seagull makes a ""cooing"" sound, is it more like the ""miaow"" of a cat, or the purring of a cat?</p>

"Preparing rice and mashed potatoes with warm instead of cooking water","<p>For a one week trip in a dry region I need to conserve water and weight. My idea is to bring precooked ""instant rice"" and pulverulent mashed potatoes. I´d warm a bit of water to about 40 - 50° C and mix it with the rice or mash. Would that resemble anything edible? (I'll try at home and post the results, but hope for some thoughts and input.)</p>

<p>The benefits:
I don´t need the power to cook a liter, warming a quarter will do. That`s 1/10 of enery and 1/4 of water for every meal. Instead of using a full fledged gas cooking device, I can bring some Esbit. For each 3 day-intervall of water self-suffiency, that saves 5 kg. <strong>What are possible downsides?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: I have been unclear about the pre-cooked rice. I mean the vacuum-packed, non-dehydrated rice they sell it in grocery stores. Usualy you´d just warm it up for 2 minutes in a microwave oven, and that´s it. But I am not sure if the warming up is for safety or taste reasons.</p>

"Why static rope rather than webbing for toprope anchors?","<p>I'm signed up for an AMGA single-pitch instructor course (to learn how to teach other people single-pitch climbing). One of the pieces of gear we're supposed to bring is a 30 meter static rope ""for setting up big 'v' anchors."" I don't own one, and the instructor says I can borrow one, so it's not a problem for me, but it makes me wonder why this would be considered such a fundamental piece of gear.</p>

<p>If I'm understanding the application correctly, the idea would be to extend the anchor so that a toprope doesn't have to go over the lip of a cliff, or allow the construction of anchors in which the pro is widely spaced. I would normally have used 1-inch webbing for this purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Why would one prefer a static rope rather than webbing for this purpose?</strong> It's more expensive, and a 30 m length would not be useful for other applications such as canyoneering. What are the pros and cons?</p>

"Does any Household Object Function as a Passable Fire Steel?","<p>Suppose I am trying to teach a class of 12 children how to build campfires. I would like each pupil to have a flint and steel for the lesson. As it turns out ferrocerium rods can be acquired cheaply for about a dollar each if I bulk-buy them.

"When clipping into quickdraws, is it dangerous to pass a finger through the gate?","<p>When learning to sport climb, I was taught not to pass any of my fingers through the gate of the carabiner when clipping into a quickdraw. Lest any of my fingers get stuck and degloved in the case of a fall while clipping. <strong>Has this ever happened? Is this a realistic concern?</strong></p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <h2>Pinch Clip Technique</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Starting from your tie-in knot at your harness, slide your hand down the rope to grab a length of rope.</li>
  <li>As you bring the rope up to the quickdraw, let it run over your pointer finger.</li>
  <li>Use your thumb on the spine of the rope-end carabiner to stabilize the carabiner.</li>
  <li><strong>Push the rope and your pointer finger into and through the gate of the carabiner to clip the rope.</strong></li>

"Long distance hikes with small children","<p>In recent years, my wife and I completed a few long distances hikes together, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kungsleden from Nikkaluokta to Abisko, 105 km (Sweden)</li>
<li>Landmannalaugar to Skogar via Laugavegur and Fimmvörðuháls, 78 km (Iceland)</li>
<li>Svartárkot-farm to Herðubreiðarlindir, „Askja Trail“, 93 km (Iceland)</li>
<li>Ammoudari to  Agia Roumeli through the White Mountains, 48 km (Crete, Greece)</li>
</ul>

<p>We carried everything we needed for the entire trip (food, tent etc.) on our backs and refilled our water supplies where possible. We slept in our tent and used other shelters only in case of emergency. Thus, we were as self-contained as possible and had no problems with the more remote parts of the trips. Also, we carried no unnecessary bits and pieces. </p>

<p>Two years ago our daughter was born. In the first year, we though that it would not be a good idea to take her on a prolonged trip like those above. However, in the meantime she enjoys being outdoors a lot and also likes to be carried around in one of those kid carrier backpacks. Therefore, we thought that generally it could be possible to take her with us on a muti-day hike. </p>

<p>However, the child on one back leaves only one back free for all the rest of the stuff we need. And obviously, the equipment now also includes some diapers, a selection of toys and books, more clothes than before, an extra sleeping bag etc. Summarizing, it seems impossible to carry everything with two adults only. </p>

<p>We did some research and then started out this year in June to complete the West Highland Way (WHW) in Scotland (154 km from Milngavie to Fort William) together with our daughter. We chose the WHW for these reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>You are near civilization on the entire trip, so if you need help, it is easy to find. Also if you want to abort the trip, buses and trains are within reach. </li>
<li>The total distance can easily be divided into stages which are not too long so that daily walking times and child-in-kid-carrier times are not too long. We had 9 days of walking and two rest days. We also took more breaks than we would have done walking without our daughter. We slept in the tent every night.</li>
<li>The path is well maintained and easy to walk without any major difficulties. </li>
<li>You can have your baggage transported along the whole way. We definitely made use of this option. This way, I carried our daughter (18 kg including herself, the carrier, clothes and shoes) and my wife carried water and food for the day. The rest was transported in two 80 L drybags by one of the baggage transfer companies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything worked out surprisingly well and we finished the WHW exactly as planned. Also we have the impression that our daughter also liked the experience. That was really great!</p>

<p>Therefore, now I am looking for other options for the future which might be feasible with a small child that cannot walk the distance itself (so it is carried at least for parts of the way). What I wonder is particularly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has anybody here made experiences with long distance hikes with a small child?</li>
<li>Which long distance hikes can you recommend with a small child?</li>
<li>Are you aware of other routes which offer baggage transfer services similar to the WHW?</li>
<li>Are there any other realistic options apart from baggage transfer?</li>
<li>Which things did you consider to make the trip enjoyable for the child?</li>
<li>Is there anything else to consider from your point of view?</li>
<li>What could you do with two or more children?</li>

"Does a backpack negatively influence my archery shooting?","<p>Last weekend I've shot with a backpack for the very first time. I ordered one which is able to hold my quiver and my bow to hike'n'archer :) </p>

<p>However, I suddenly shot like 250 points were I normally would do about 390. I thought I just had a bad day and so I didn't really care. The next day we went out shooting again and my unstable form continued. I told my mates about this and one said that I should get rid of the backpack. I did so and guess what, my shooting improved/was normal again!</p>

<p>So the question is, is it really a general thing that you can't shoot (or let's say ""shoot worse"") with a backpack? Or do I just have to get used to it?</p>

<p>Note: I'm shooting a traditional hunting-recurve instinctively. </p>

"How should I regulate hydration on long hikes in hot temprature?","<p>I hike in western ghats of Maharashtra India, where temperature in the afternoon varies from <strong>35 degree Celsius to 40 degree Celsius with high humidity (more than 50%)</strong>.</p>

<p>On my last hike I perspired a lot, even though my ascending speed was very slow during a steep ascend. </p>

<p><strong>How much water should I carry on such hikes</strong>, if I know I am not going to get near any source of water till evening?</p>

<p><strong>How should I regulate hydrating myself?</strong> I can just keep drinking water until I run out.</p>

<p><strong>Is there  a way to control perspiration</strong>, so that I lose less water?</p>

"Are crows more interested in identifying individual humans than vice versa, and if so, why?","<p>I live in Crow City, USA (AKA Monterey, California).</p>

<p>I can't tell one crow from another without their perching right next to me on a bust of Portola. They seem to all be clones of each other, as far as I can tell (and I'm sure that's true of most non-ornithologist humans). Yet crows can differentiate humans one from another.</p>

<p>This (presumably) does not prove that crows, clever as they are, are more intelligent than humans, but does it indicate that they are more interested in us than we are of them? If so, why? Or what is the reason for this gap in observation skills?</p>

<p>Some humans are birdwatchers, but it seems all crows are people watchers.</p>

"Buzzer / chironomid hook size for still water fly fishing","<p>I'm tying buzzer/chironomid flies to use when fishing under a slow retrieve in lakes. I thought that by chironomid we meant midges, and expected flies in sizes 18 to 26, but a lot of the patterns that I find out there in the internet use much bigger hooks. This <a href=""http://www.badger.rchomepage.com/chironomid_patterns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> lists flies all the way up to size 12, for example. Moreover, some patterns like <a href=""http://intheriffle.com/fishing-videos/fly-tying/taks-crystal-chironomid/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tak's Crystal Chironomid</a> (here tied in sizes 10 to 16) turn out to be very hard to tie in the midge sizes above 18. </p>

"Can you train wild deer to get ""used to"" your scent before the hunting season","<p>United States (and more, specifically, NY state -- though that <em>shouldn't</em> matter at all) here.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am brand new to hunting, and in a few weeks I will be going out into the woods and hunting public land for the first time. Just to be clear, I have taken the NYS Hunter's Safety course and have purchased my hunting license and I have my tags. <strong>I am doing everything by the book.</strong></p>

<p>I have read from several credible source now that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deer are very keen to the smells of different areas of the forest</li>
<li>Hence, unless you attempt to manage your scent (minding the wind direction as you stalk, experimenting with various scent blockers, etc.) once they smell you, they will realize that ""<em>something is wrong</em>"", meaning, they have detected a smell in that area of the woods that ordinarily is not there -- and they ""bump"" or run away</li>
</ul>

<p>So this gave me an idea, and I wanted to share it here in the form of a question to see if any experienced/skilled hunters think its a viable idea or sheer rubbish!</p>

<p>I should also say that this idea would also be used in <em>addition</em> to the common, popular forms of scent management (making sure I am downwind of them, using scent blocker, etc.).</p>

<h3>The idea</h3>

<p>What if I went into the woods to my ""spots"" (the general areas where I plan to hunt) and carefully placed a few old, dirty shirts with my scent on them down on the ground and left them there for the next 3 - 4 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> DEC states in their manual that it is unlawful to use public land as ""storage"" and that any hunting accessories such as stands, mineral blocks, trail cams or other hunting equipment must be removed within a certain number of days of the close of the season. I would absolutely remember where I put these shirts and remove them in keeping with state law at the end of the season. I am one of the <em>biggest</em> critics of litterbugs and would never be one myself!</p>

<p>So the thinking here is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Deer get used to my smell radiating through sections of the forest where I intend to hunt</li>
<li>If, while on a hunt, my scent management fails and my scent ""leaks"" into the air, I would think they might not spook as easily as if they would if they were totally foreign to that smell being there</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this a crazy idea or valid?</p>

<p>I'm thinking it's either a great idea and will work wonders, or, its the polar opposite and will instead drive all the deer out of my ""spots"" for the entirety of the season :-/</p>

<p>Any thoughts/comments/concerns/input here?</p>

"Why is there such a singular place for bird watching?","<p>There are a lot of interesting things in nature, but of all land vertebrates, birding has highly disproportionate attention. People (perhaps including birding enthusiasts) may note and appreciate mammals they see, and reptiles, but birding stands on its own as a hobby. </p>

<p>Why, about birds and about us, are we so interested in birding?</p>

<p>I can imagine a partial answer in that birds are more interestingly likely to fly in and out of an area one is observing, and that birds are often brightly colored, but this is a guess on my part, and I would give them only a guess's degree of probability.</p>

<p>Why emphasize birding?</p>

"How to prevent strap slippage through buckle?","<p>A strap running through a buckle is typically easy to loosen and tighten as desired. Usually, it stays in place. Sometimes, however, it slowly (or quickly) works its way loose, as though the thickness or smoothness of the webbing doesn't quite match the size or shape of the buckle. What can I do to make the strap more grippy?</p>

<p>The specific problem I have is with a new backpack (no wear and tear), and it happens in dry conditions (not wet and slippery). The straps even have cloth-elastic bands wrapped around, right next to the buckles. </p>

<p>One method could be to add a separate clasp, as per <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1448/how-can-i-improve-on-the-straps-on-my-travel-pack"">this question</a>. Also, I imagine I could intentionally soak it in sea water and then not rinse it, leaving the salt crystals to gum up the works (I know this happens to kayak gear and it's usually a nuisance). Other techniques? I consider replacing either the strap or the buckle to be too drastic a solution.</p>

"Synthetic insulated belay jacket vs thicker mid layers or down","<p>When it gets colder while walking, I'd add an extra fleece as a mid layer and when we stop to eat, I would put it on too, or I'd wear a down jacket if it's dry.</p>

<p>However when it's wet, it seems like taking off outer shell to add mid layer is troublesome. Isn't it better to get a synthetic down jacket that can be worn on top of my shell, even if it's a bit wet? This way I can just throw it on top. I've heard this can be referred to as belay jacket. </p>

<p>What are the pros and cons? What have been your experiences in, e.g. Scottish weather? </p>

<p>PS. My shell is actually Paramo, which in my experience will be more breathable than a membrane, so I don't believe I'd be getting wet from the inside. </p>
