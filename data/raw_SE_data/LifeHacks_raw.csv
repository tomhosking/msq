"Long-term storage of personal belongings?","<p>So I have a lot of stuff and a lot of space in my parent's house and and obviously, I want to move some of my stuff to them (mostly paperwork, some packaging, catalogues, etc. - typical ""hoarding"" items).</p>

<p>What are some practices / what should I do to ...</p>

<ul>
<li>prevent stuff from degrading and</li>
<li>prevent pests from spreading / catching on (moths, silverfish, ...)?</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought about putting everything inside cardboard boxes, but this is obiously too little to keep moths etc. out. Should I put everything in vacuum bags? Is this enough? Should I put my stuff in the freezer overnight just in case to kill anything and everything? Should I put my stuff in an airtight box (plastic? metal?)? Should I fill said box with a noble gas so that no chemical reactions happen?</p>

<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated. Also, please move my question to another board if this is not the right board; however, I couldn't find a better fit.</p>

"How to prevent or remove rust on the inside of a paint can?","<p>When I complete a painting project, I usually have some paint left over in the paint can that I store for later use. After much time has passed (often year(s)) I need to do some touch-ups, and when I remove the lid from the paint can there is often a bunch of rust around the mouth of the paint can, and possibly also the lid. This rust inevitably flakes off and falls into the paint.</p>

<p>Is there a way to prevent this rust from forming in the paint can? If not, is there a way to remove rust flakes from paint?</p>

"How to prevent creases and imprints while hanging clothing to dry to prevent ironing?","<p>Wet clothing has to dry. My only option to get it dry is to hang it. (no dryer)</p>

<p>There are a few options to do this, which both get the job done:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>hang the items of clothing on the line</strong> as they are</li>
<li>use <strong>pegs</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with these is that they introduce creases and/or imprints from the pegs that look awkward and make ironing the clothing necessary.</p>

<p>Note that for formal attire ironing can hardly be circumvented, which is perfectly fine. But I don't see the point in ironing the bulk of t-shirts that I wear every day, especially if it is mostly because of the creases introduced while drying.</p>

<p>Even if hanging a wet t-shirt perfectly without any creases, the line still produces a very distinguishable imprint. Sometimes that's still visible even after ironing.</p>

<p>At the moment, I concoct an experiment with a coat hanger. It's not an ideal one because it's made out of wood and not too thick. It's still thicker than a wire hanger though or the clothesline for that matter. I guess <strong>a plastic coat hanger with thicker shoulders</strong> would be ideal. If that means putting all t-shirts on coat hangers, so be it. That saves me from folding them.</p>

<p>Any ideas on that? The ideal solution would be to make ironing obsolete for these kinds of every day items of clothing like t-shirts. <strong>Is there any problem with that?</strong> Say for example, should clothing be ironed for some other reason than removing creases?</p>

<p><strong>What other solutions aside from coat hangers are there?</strong></p>

"How to tell a technical support call center worker that I am technically inclined?","<p>Sometimes I just want to scream at people ""I know what I'm talking about!"".

<ul>
<li>""I know what I'm talking about"" - is impolite, annoys them, doesn't work</li>

<p>Probably due to old age, the screen of my old Sony SDM M51 monitor flickers. The Sony representative advised that inside the lower left side (hereinafter abbreviated as LS) of the monitor (as depicted in red above), parts nearing the front of the screen have loosened from parts at the back. So  the only solution is to clench, grip, or squeeze the front and back of the red area (eg by hand), which has eliminated the flickers for the past years. Alas, the detachment worsened a few days ago, to the extent that my hands hurt and the LS now needs continual compression and grasp to stop flickering. </p>

<p>So what can I use to resolve this problem? I tried a large binder clip which only works when my hand clings to the clip; as soon as I stop holding onto the clip, it flings itself off because the LS is too thick.  </p>

"What is the perfect microwaving time for my food?","<p>Ever since I started working in this company I'm taking my lunch (leftovers of the dinner last night) to the office in a microwavable container, because we have a small kitchen including a microwave. I'm sure a lot of you also do this.</p>

<p>I figured out that microwaving for the exact same time results in different warmth of the food. I know that a microwave heats the food up with radio waves which are extremely efficient on liquids. That's why the plastic of microwavable containers / plates don't melt / get extremely hot and only the food is being heated. Ergo <em>soup heats up faster than rice</em> (without sauce of course), for instance. So I know <em>why</em> my food doesn't get equally hot every time.</p>

<p>But <strong>how can I estimate the time</strong> my microwave needs <strong>to heat up my food to an eatable warmth</strong>? Of course this is depending on the power of the microwave. The one I'm using has a wattage of about 700W (if I remember the manual correctly), so maybe a scale for time &amp; wattage would be helpful <em>(does double wattage result in half the heating-time?)</em>.</p>

<p>To get the hacky part into this: </p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a special hack when it comes to the food itself?
<ul>
<li>Does mixing the dry &amp; moist parts of the food affect total microwaving time? Or does it just heat more evenly? <sub>I usually just mix after microwaving.</sub></li>
<li>Does it matter where I put my container in the microwave?</li>
<li>Does the position of the food in my container affect microwaving-time?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is there any hack (not technical) that I can use on the microwave?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know there are some rather technical questions here, but I'm pretty sure there are some hacks you can use when microwaving. If you're not a microwave expert just ignore the technical questions and share the experience you made when it comes to microwaving as fast as possible.</p>

I need to remove the small metallic bit holding the two black parts. These pictures also show a different angle of where the umbrella broke. </p>

<p>My idea is to take apart this bit on both umbrellas and carefully cut the threads holding the fabric on both umbrellas. Then I will replace the broken part with a good one from the other umbrella and I sew the fabric back. I think I will need to use wire or something similar to fix the joint. </p>

<p>Does anyone have an advice on how to dismantle such junction? Do you have any other idea of how to repair my broken umbrella? </p>

"How to effectively prevent the shower curtain from snuggling?","<p>My shower curtain does not stay where it belongs. When I start showering I wet it and then press it to the wall, but when I put the shower head up on the shower head holder, the curtain starts flying inwards.</p>

<p>I figured that the hot water heats the air which then drifts outwards through the only possible way - which is near the roof of the bathroom, creating a zone with less air pressure and pulling the curtain inwards.</p>

<p>This is not only annoying, it also allows the splashing water to spill itself onto the floor as the curtain is moving and therefore not in the way of the water, where it should be. </p>

<p>Any suggestions? Has anyone solved this problem?</p>

"Keeping raccoons out of a dumpster","<p>What is the best way to keep raccoons out of a dumpster? </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cblo7.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cblo7m.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>And we have a pretty large population of raccoons that seem to be pretty inventive when it comes to getting inside of it and pulling trash and food out.</p>

<p>The waste management company we use wont allow us to modify the dumpster. They own it and more or less rent it to us.</p>

<p>We've tried a few ways of ""tying"" the lid shut, but the raccoons will reach a hand between the two lids and pull out what ever they can, they also tend to chew on what ever we use to tie them down with, so strapping the lid shut doesn't work very well and the straps don't last long.</p>

<p>I've heard we could use cougar urine as a deterrent, but it rains fairly often where we are and handling urine on a regular basis is a little unappealing. </p>

<p>This should go without saying, but I'm also not looking to kill or otherwise harm the animals.</p>

<p>So, I'm trying to find a good way to keep the animals out, while still allowing us easy access, without modifying the rented dumpster or harming the wildlife... Any thoughts?</p>

"How can I legally identify pesky robocallers?","<p>I am planning to move to New Hampshire soon, and one of the great benefits of living there is that unlike most states, private citizens can prosecute misdemeanors. That means once I become a New Hampshire resident I can summon and bring to court people or organizations that are breaking the law, so long as the law is a misdemeanor and I am the aggrieved party.</p>

<p>So, what kind of criminal organization am I thinking about? Robocallers of course!!!</p>

<p>In New Hampshire, the Federal laws concerning illegally calling someone on the Do-Not-Call (DNC) list are replicated by local statute. That means the criminal penalties for illegally calling somebody on the DNC in New Hampshire are legally actionable. I think the penalty is $1500 per call or something like that.</p>

<p>So, my only problem is identifying the perps. Obviously if they are in Pakistan there is nothing I can do, but a lot of ""Rachel"" calls apparently originate in the US and are made by US-based organizations. Can I just subpoena the phone company to get true of the identity of the caller, or is it going to be more complicated than that?</p>

<p>I know I can get an answer here by just starting an action in court and I am sure the phone company's lawyer will explain everything to me, but I am hoping somebody here is an expert in call tracing and give me the lowdown on how to do criminal phone tracing ahead of time so I have a leg up on the process.</p>

"My pants are falling off!","<p>I have some pairs of sweatpants and shorts that have either one side of the string outside the loop, or the whole string is out of the pants all together. This can be a major issue because I either choose to not wear them since they might/will fall down or I'll have to take the chances of my pants falling off in public if I choose to wear them. I know I could just gain enough wait to hold them up without needing the string. But there must be another way? How can I get the string back into the pants/shorts?</p>

<p>I've tried just with my hands of pushing the string through, when one side hasn't fallen all the way out. Which can sometimes work if there's not much more way to go. Other than that I usually just bring them to a sewer.</p>

I know that I could buy or build a <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/?q=plucking%20machine&amp;ia=products"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">machine that would do that for me</a>, but buying a machine is expensive, and building one myself would be exciting, but would take a lot of effort.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Put your tights in the freezer.</strong></p>
  
  <p>I thought that this was a silly old-wives tale, but it actually does
  work! Putting your tights in a plastic bag and storing them in the
  freezer when you aren’t using them helps keep the material firm and
  less prone to ripping.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>From an <a href=""http://www.purewow.com/fashion/How-Freezing-Your-Tights-Will-Change-Your-Whole-Damn-Life"" rel=""nofollow"">article on <em>PureWow</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good thing there’s a super-easy trick for extending the life of your
  tights.</p>
  
  <p><em>You freeze them.</em></p>
  
  <p>Yes, it sounds crazy, but hear us out: The next time you buy a new
  pair (and before you wear them), run them under water until they’re
  damp. Then place them in a plastic bag and freeze overnight. Take them
  out and give them a day to defrost and thaw out.</p>
  
  <p>You only need to do this once — after that, you’re good to go. The
  chilly temps firm and strengthen the individual fibers of your tights,
  making them less susceptible to runs later on.</p>

"What is the best way to recondition a whiteboard?","<p>Our office has installed new whiteboards over the last two years.  Many of these boards are heavily used and have already devolved to the point of being useless -- the writing on them has become all but permanent and they are heavily stained. </p>

<p>I've found that simply cleaning them (with a household cleaner, such as Simple Green) goes a long way toward keeping them in a usable state.  After cleaning, much of the marker (80%-ish) can be simply wiped away, but there is still a strong ""ghost effect"" remaining.</p>

<p>I've tried commercial white board cleaner.  It's about the same as household cleaner, but is more expensive.</p>

<p>I've tried both WD-40 and car wax (Turtle Wax and Rain-X), as recommended by various sites on the internet.  The car wax does not seem to offer much improvement.  The WD-40 is the better of these two solutions, but leaves the board a little greasy, and the markers tend to smear (only a bit) when wiped.</p>

<p>This photo doesn't even do it justice. It is neon, day-glo orange. It's too orange for me, but other than that I like the bag so wish to keep it. I also just spent a bunch of money on this bag, so I don't want to go out and get the zipper replaced or buy dyes and equipment or anything like that as that will just add a greater cost. </p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn't inhibit the function of the zipper</li>
<li>Is permanent, or mostly permanent (fading over years of use is to be expected)</li>
<li>Doesn't discolor or otherwise affect the green fabric around the zipper or the red and white fabric inside</li>
<li>Uses only household supplies or supplies found cheaply at a hardware or grocery store</li>
</ul>

<p>I have access to a clothes washer and dryer, but not a bathtub. Also, there are a lot of different materials to work with on the zipper: the zipper teeth are plastic, the part that attaches the teeth to the bag is some kind of canvas, and the pull and runner feel like metal.</p>

"How to store books in less than ideal conditions?","<p>It's not hard to find out how you should store books. Just Google ""how to store books"". Metal or sealed wood shelves, 50% humility, 60-75 °F, keep that constant, keep away from light, don't store in bags... But lets assume that some of these aren't obtainable. How, then, would one go about storing books.</p>

<p>Curerently, my climate controls aren't especially good. In the winter the temperature ranges from mid 50's to 70 °F, and in the summer, mid 60's to mid 80's. That's in an 8 hour period The land lord doesn't seem to think there is anything wrong with the HVAC and I can't install a window unit. I don't know what the humidity is, but as I type this, I am not comfortable.</p>

<p>My books include mass market paper backs, text books, hard covered books, collectors edition books (mostly Eston Press), trade paper back American and Japanese comics, and a handful of single issue comics. All of the American comics are of the modern sort, printed on pretty decent paper. I don't own any of the older, cheaper kind.</p>

<p>These are stored on cheap plastic veneered composite board constructed book shelves. These shelves are sufficiently old that I assume any solvents should have mostly dissipated. I have my more expensive books in open zip lock bags. I know that CLOSED zip locked bags are bad due to trapping humidity, and encouraging mold growth, but I also assume that an open bag should slow the rate at which humidity, and to a lesser degree temperature, changes. Even more valuable ones (anything worth more than $100) are also loosely wrapped in bubble wrap. I have a few Easton Press books still in their original manufacture's shrink wrap, which has small holes. my individual issues are bagged and boarded.</p>

<p>So, as for the question in this post: </p>

<ul>
<li>What should I do to help protect these books? </li>
<li>Have I made any invalid assumptions? For example, are my book shelves an issue, or the zip locks? </li>
<li>Also, what would you guys suggest to help mitigate the potential damage caused from a the inconsistent, and occasionally warm/humid environment where I'm living (second floor)?</li>
</ul>

<p>So much of what I've found is geared towards what is best, but ""best"" isn't always an option.<br>
Alternatively, am I already doing everything I should do under my restraints?</p>

<p>PS: I completely forgot that I own a dehumidifier, something which neither the land lord nor neighborhood council will complain about. That's one fewer issue. I just moved here and completely forgot about it. I'll dig it out, but humidity is probably the thing I'll have to worry about most.</p>

"Free distilled (deionised) water, as a byproduct","<p>My wife needs a CPAP machine for sleep apnea.
One of the things her model does is humidify the air.
To do this it evaporates about 1 cup (237 mL) of water every night.</p>

as, if one uses the hard tap water, limescale quickly builds up.</p>

<p>Now while distilled water is not expensive (though it does add up),
I am wondering if I can get it for free from one of the devices in my house.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.explainthatstuff.com/dehumidifier.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dehumidifier</a> - My notion is since it is pulling water vapour our of the air, the fact that it is vapour means it can't have much impurities dissolved in it. Though vapour isn't a gas  so maybe it can.</p></li>
<li><p>condensing clothes drier - After drying a load of washing it needs at least 2 cups (473 mL) of water to be drained. If all that water is being evaporated (rather than spun) out of the cloths then it should be pure.</p></li>
<li><p>window vacuum - You use this to wipe/suck condensation off of windows. It doesn't make much water but it does make some.</p></li>

"How to vacuum stairs with minimal effort?","<p>This is related to <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/4298/how-to-vacuum-room-with-minimal-amount-of-effort"">How to vacuum room with minimal amount of effort?</a> but specifically aimed at vacuuming stairs.</p>

<p>I recently moved to a two-story house after being in single-story houses for a while.  The stairs in the new house are carpeted.  There are an assortment of small kids and pets in this house, so not vacuuming is not an option.</p>

<p>Right now my technique is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start at the top and work my way down with the regular upright vacuum by attempting to man-handle it over each stair.  This is a cumbersome procedure which gets most of the central area of each stair fairly clean, but still leaves bits in the corners.</li>
<li>Clean out the corners with a smaller hand-held attachment vacuum.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could just skip step 1 and use the smaller hand-held attachment vacuum to do the whole job, but I think this would take much longer.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a quick, easy and effective way to vacuum carpeted stairs?</strong></p>

"Alternatives to sleep masks and black-out curtains","<p>Note - This is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/5853/how-can-i-effectively-black-out-my-room-for-sleeping-cheaply-and-such-that-i-ca"">How can I effectively black out my room for sleeping, cheaply and such that I can still open the curtains during the day?</a> because <strong><em>I don't want to black out my room</em></strong> and I am specifically excluding the answers to that question.</p>

<p><strong>Excluded</strong></p>

<p>Blackout blinds/curtains/window-covering - I tried blackout blinds but they were unsuitable. I like to sleep with the windows open. They were affected by the wind blowing them away from the window frame. In any case <em>I do not want to black out my whole room</em> - just prevent light from reaching my eyes.</p>

<p>Elasticated sleep-mask - This is my current solution. It works but there are problems with comfort and slippage. I want to move on.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What novel method can I use to prevent light from reaching my eyes whilst sleeping?</p>

<p>One possible answer I have thought of is to use black eye-makeup to paint my eyelids.  As a man who has never used makeup of any kind, I am reluctant to try because (a) I don't know if it will be effective in blocking light (b) I don't know how easily I would be able to remove it (c) I don't know if constant application and removal would cause skin problems (d) I'm not sure if it will be expensive.</p>

<p>Is my solution viable?  If not, how else can I shield <em>just my eyes</em> rather than wearing an uncomfortable and unreliable sleep-mask? Note that I want the room itself to remain illuminated.</p>

"Pair of rimless prescription titanium glasses : screws fit into frame but strips. Hack to fix?","<p>I have a pair of rimless titanium prescription frames. I love it. I want to keep it forever - I know this isn't possible but i'd like to extend the life of the current pair I have. The specific model has been discontinued and I'm stuck with this pair so I need to hack it for longevity. I have another pair of different glasses - but as mentioned, this one is special -its successor is not a fit for me.</p>

<p>Currently the screw fits into the frame itself.</p>

<p>This is a bad design. The screw often strips, and then the arm is loose. I know its titanium, but it strips. Glue is obviously not a option - eyesight regresses and I already need to replace the lenses.</p>

<p>My question, considering that it is titanium, considering what the frame looks like, would it be possible to (and Im really happy to pay someone with a steady hand for this but I'm asking if its possible to) drill a hole right through where the screw is, and then attach a good looking nut on one of the sides (screw one side with nut on other side)?</p>

<p>The idea is to get rid of the thread in the frame that holds the screw -as this is the weak point, and if it ever does break, its simply a matter of getting a new screw and nut.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a better idea of how to get past the problem of the screw fitting into the frame? </p>

"Get rid of house fly problem?","<p>I have a problem with flies suddenly. I have been living in my house for almost 20 years and never had a problem with flies. How can I find out where they are coming from and eliminate the source?</p>

<p>They are almost all on the first floor, so that would seem to rule out a source in the basement or upper floors. For example, I have a cat litter box on the second floor, but there are no flies there, so I know the flies are not coming from anywhere near there.</p>

"How to make a 100% cotton shirt repel moisture?","<p>I bought a casual 100% cotton button-down shirt the other day from the brand <a href=""http://www.esp-fashion.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">ESP fashion</a>. </p>

<p>I live in Bangkok, Thailand and it's crazy hot here at the moment (or any moment), so I figured a white one would probably A) not be as hot in the sun and B) not show sweat as easily as other colors.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the fitting room the shirt was really nice, soft and appeared to be a bit moisture-repellant. Got home, put it in the washer to get rid of possible left-over chemicals from manufacturing (it's just something I have a habit of always doing when I buy new clothes). After washing I noticed it wasn't as soft as before, so I figured they had perhaps used some softener on it (which I generally don't ever use).</p>

<p>The next day I put the shirt on, and my back was still a bit moist from the shower. Now the shirt immediately absorbed any moisture it came into contact with, even for just a fraction of a second! My theory that white wouldn't change color when wet got immediately debunked - it looked bad, really bad.</p>

<p>My theory is that the fabric was treated with something to make it a bit softer and to repel moisture, but that treatment/coating was washed away even after the first washing. So now I'm wondering if there are any products one can use to make clothes repel moisture better? Obviously, one can wax them as I have done in the past with hiking gear, but that doesn't really seem appropriate for a nice looking button-down shirt that is meant for urban use. Anything better suited for nice looking clothes? Are there any softeners or other products one can use in the washer to aid in moisture repelling?</p>

"Common noise levels of reliably constant loudness","<p>This isn't a home improvement question, but one that applies to buying any product that makes noise or sound: how can you ask reviewers to compare the noise level of a product with some reference noise levels that are about the same across most people, places and situations?</p>

<p>An example to help explain my question better: I want to buy a window A/C unit. Every single one I see reviews for on Amazon has contradictory opinions across the decibel spectrum, from ""It's quiet"" to ""It's so loud I have to crank up the TV"".</p>

<p>Unlike with dimensions, the vast majority of people don't have a sound level meter. If they didn't have a ruler, you could ask them ""How big is it in relation to a CD"", since all CDs have the same diameter (12cm). <strong>What are some sound levels that are reliably about the same?</strong></p>

<p>I've looked at <a href=""http://www.50hz.com/decibel.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this table of common decibel values</a>, but ranges like ""50 - 65"" for normal conversation are way too imprecise, given that <a href=""http://www.noisehelp.com/decibel-scale.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an increase of 10 db means a doubling of the perceived loudness</a> and ""every increase of 3 dB represents a doubling of sound intensity, or acoustic power"". Also, the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale makes it too confusing to consider about asking random reviewers to think in any terms other than some common sound levels that are approximately the same everywhere (hence why I'm not posting this on Physics.SE).</p>

<p>Some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6wutP-ECms"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">riffle-shuffling</a> a deck of cards</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLL43vsifBE"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">opening a soda can swiftly</a> (though this is a short-duration noise and may be misleading when compare long-running appliances such as A/C units or refridgerators)</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize that any sound will be perceived differently depending on the acoustics of the room but let's hope that reviewers can mentally map these ""reference sounds"" to the condition of the room they (and the appliance/product) are in. A soda can pop will sound much louder in a hardwood floor small room than in a larger carpeted room but when I think about that volume level, I think of it in the context of the room I'm in.</p>

"How can I re-seal hearing aid batteries that have been accidentally unsealed?","<p>Zinc-air hearing aid batteries come with a sticky tab on them to prevent air contact; once this tab is removed, the battery starts draining.  The instructions warn that ""<em>thou shalt not removeth this tab until a few minutes before thine need of battery</em>"".</p>

<p>Recently, my roommate's kids discovered that the tiny metal lumps with sticky things stuck to them were a much more enjoyable toy than the nice new expensive plastic monstrosity their father just gave them; long story short, about two months worth of hearing aid batteries are now unsealed (and hidden in crevices throughout the house, but I think I found them all).</p>

<p>Google searching has come up with mixed results regarding simply resealing them with Scotch tape, mostly suggesting that it won't work or that it will work but not enough to bother with.  However, these seem to be in the context of re-sealing while they're in use (i.e. prolonging the life of an active battery by re-sealing it when the hearing aids are turned off, rather than for any form of long-term storage).  I threw some tape on them anyway just on principle, but no clue how much if any effect it'll actually have.</p>

It's gonna cost a small amount (I'm not in the states but it's about $15),
but it's less than 10% of the price of a new pool.</p>

<p>The bottom will be a bit more interesting - I'll have to lift up the pool from the bottom and press against it - I'll probably have to get rid of most of the water in there now (not a lot) and when I do press it from the bottom, the water will then disperse to the sides and I'll have to try and get water on the exact spot above the nozzle again.</p>

"How to protect goods in a shipping container?","<p>When shipping goods, including computer hardware, books, clothes and tableware, across the globe (crossing the equator) in a container it seems natural that heat, humidity and physical impact would be the main issues. But the details are not so obvious:</p>

<ol>
<li>What magnitude are they, for example, how high does the temperature actually go, and how many newtons of (sustained/impact) force can be expected?</li>
<li>Are any unusual measures (other than simply stacking in cardboard boxes) necessary to protect the goods adequately?</li>
<li>Are there any other factors which are important? For example, are containers regularly dropped from any height? Are they ever turned on their side? Do the contents have to be packed so that inspectors can get to every single thing easily? Are there pests? Etc.</li>

"How do I keep dust away when applying a laptop screen protector?","<p>I'm getting a matte anti-glare screen protector for my 15 inch laptop tomorrow, and many of the reviews I have read say you practically need a cleanroom to keep dust particles off the back of the protector/front of the screen during the application process. I've also heard that the protector tends to get statically charged and literally attract particles to itself during this process.</p>

<p>Is there some way I could remove dust from a small room where I plan to apply this screen protector in?

"Cleaning a microwave","<p>What is the easiest way to clean dried/burnt-on food out of a microwave? </p>

<p>Cleaning out the microwave was always one of my least favorite tasks back when I worked the graveyard shift at the local diner. The graveyard shift was usually an 11pm to 7am shift, so I usually got stuck cleaning all of the kitchen's appliances after they were heavily used and abused throughout the day.</p>

<p>The microwave offered a special challenge, because you couldn't soak it in water or use the heavy duty chemical oven cleaners in it to loosen the dried/burnt-on food stuffs.</p>

<p>Manual scrubbing would work but it was painfully time consuming, and unpleasant because the microwave was mounted on the wall overhead, so scouring usually meant standing on a stool for 20-30 minutes and applying an awful lot of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_grease"">elbow grease</a>.</p>

"How to cool an object coated in a thermosetting substance, without damaging/leaving an impression in the coating?","<p>I've been looking for a way to cool things that are fully coated in a hot substance without damaging the coating. While reading a question about cooling chocolate covered items and how they ended up stuck to the cooling rack, because the chocolate had wrapped around the wires, I mused that placing a cooling item covered in a ""liquid when hot, solid when at room temperature"" substance (like chocolate) onto an array of pins/nails would be one of the better ways of allowing it to cool without becoming stuck/acquiring an excessive imprint from the cooling rack</p>

<p>Thus, I'm trying to think of some household object with a fairly low density pin-grid arrangement, large size (larger than 1 ft x 1 ft) and flat layout and I'm coming up blank.. The pin density would probably be in the order of 3 or 4 per square inch</p>

<ul>
<li>Hairbrush - too small/not flat</li>
<li>Sticklebricks or similar ""plastic spikes that cause the pieces to stick together"" type toys - pins are too close together</li>
<li>Boot cleaner floor mounted brush - too small</li>
<li>Artificial grass - too dense</li>
<li>Pin art device - probably too dense, too small</li>
<li>Doormat with widely spaced plastic bristles - i'm sure I've seen some that are like plastic fingers in a circular pattern, but cannot now find them</li>
</ul>

<p>It kinda feels like something would have to be made, by hammering picture pins/tacks through a plastic chopping board, or getting a square mesh cooling rack and using a grinder to cut through an entire line of wires, and then twist the wire they remain mounted to, to turn them so they point upwards as pins</p>

<p>Can anyone think of an available product/material that is already a pin-like arrangement? I'm not averse to cutting pins off if it's easy enough (cutting a sticklebrick would be hard work).</p>

<p>I'm also not averse to a completely different solution, if there's an alternative that would work better; perhaps skewering the objects with pins and suspending them? Something far out, like a device that blows cold air through a  pipe with the aim of suspending the object in the air stream until it cools, is probably going too far.. (You know how if you blow air though a straw and then put a lightweight ball into the air stream it kinda hovers? That's a bit over-complex, though it might give a good result)</p>

<p>I'd prefer a solution that involves minimal modification to an existing object. Driving 200 nails through a board is just slightly more involved than I'd want to recommend to a less tool-equipped relative. Cutting a wire mesh up with an angle grinder is way beyond </p>

"How Can I Fix a Broken Pant Fly?","<p>My wardrobe is not aging gracefully, and I too much despise shopping for clothes to replace it. To be sure, after a long, gradual decline, it has gotten to a point where if I pull out a pair of pants, it is a great surprise to me if the zipper on my fly still functions in its original capacity. More commonly, I will pull out a pair of sad pants with two rows of teeth to form a fly, but either no zipper or a zipper only attached to one set of the teeth. Personally, I couldn't care less whether the zipper works, but I've been told that it is <em>most uncivilized</em> to walk around with one's fly hanging open, and that explaining, ""No, it's okay because it's broken!"" does not, in fact, make it more civilized. Thus, I would like, at least, to elegantly ensure that my pants do not have a hole where the fly once was sagging open when I am wearing them.</p>

<p>I consider this problem very annoying. So far I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the sliding bit of the zipper stayed on one side, I've tried shoving the other side of teeth into the appropriate slot in the sliding bit, but I've never succeeded in fixing them this way.</p></li>
<li><p>I've tried avoiding other people all day. This is a nice universal fix to all wardrobe issues, but it's sort of hard to do - and it gets tiresome to have to figure out when no one's looking before making a dash across more public space.</p></li>
<li><p>I <em>once</em> tried putting the pants on backwards. This looked even worse and felt terrible.</p></li>
<li><p>I used tape to hold the fly shut. It sort of works for a while, but eventually the tape gets unstuck. It's also kind of noticeable and I'd rather not have any conversations starting with, ""Hey dude, why's there so much duct tape on your pants?""</p></li>
<li><p>I managed to run a loop of little wire through the pants and through the zipper to hold the fly closed in the middle; this works the best out of anything I've tried, but the pants still look kind of strange, being held together at just one point in the middle.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought about soldering the zipper (mostly) shut, since I don't really care whether it can open or not, however decided against it since it would leave that section of the pants stiff. (Not to mention that this is an issue I invariably wish to solve <em>after</em> I've left my house - in locations where one will receive strange looks if they start soldering their pants together or remove their pants to safely do so - though, perhaps with some good answers here, I can remember to fix my pants before trying to use them).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these solutions are particularly satisfactory to me and I feel like this has <em>got</em> to be a common problem. Is there a better way to repair one's fly?</p>

"How do I stop the ends of curtain poles (finials) falling off without making a hole in them?","<p>We've recently moved into a rented house in which we aren't meant to make holes in the fittings. </p>

<p>Several of the curtains are hung on wooden poles, like <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775&amp;q=wooden%20curtain%20poles&amp;oq=wooden%20curtain%20poles&amp;gs_l=img.3...1174.4096.0.4753.20.10.0.10.10.0.88.687.10.10.0....0...1ac.1.64.img..1.19.720.zNaZLt2uFKk"" rel=""nofollow"">these</a>. The end curtain ring on each side is kept in position by being placed between the bracket holding up the pole and an end stop / finial. Only they aren't kept in position because the finials and the endmost curtain rings fall off whenever anyone opens the curtains in anything other than slow motion. The finials are not screwed on to the ends of the poles; they are meant to be held on by friction - only it doesn't work. </p>

<p>If we owned the house I would drill a hole through the side of the finial and hold the pole in place by a small screw, but as tenants we are not meant to drill holes in the landlord's fixtures. </p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a means of keeping the finials in place which does not mar them or the poles?</p>

<p>I have tried Blu-tack but it isn't very satisfactory, as the presence of a blob of Blu-tack on the side of the pole tends to make the finial go on awry, or stops it going on at all. If you roll out the Blu-tack very thin to prevent this, it shreds when you insert the pole into the finial and does not work at all. Putting the Blu-tack at the end doesn't work either, as there is a large gap between the end of the pole and the inside of the end of the finial.</p>

<p>Any suggestions gratefully received.</p>

"Rising to the Challenge - Mattress on top of Roof","<p>I'm going to be moving across the US in a few days and am looking to transport my queen mattress (no boxspring) about 600 miles.

"Preventing Bed Resonance","<p>This is somewhat similar to <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/15533/how-to-prevent-bed-movements-noises-when-having-sex"">this question</a>, but not exactly the same, because it's not about noise per se and I'm not the one causing it (yet). The floor of my apartment is very light (probably cheap) fake wood vinyl, and it's above a mostly-empty and not well insulated crawlspace, and is attached to one other apartment. And unfortunately, the way the building is set up places the two apartments' bedrooms right next to one another. So, whenever my neighbors perform some certain...oscillatory activities, I can feel the vibrations very distinctively from my bed. </p>

<p>What should I do to cut down on this? Would lowering my bed to the floor help? It is currently supported by six approximately 6 inch metal legs and on a box spring, on a hardwood floor (which I know is the real problem, but unfortunately I can't change that). Would it help to place the bed legs on a rug or something? What about a heavier bed-frame? It's currently resting on the thin metal rails that came with the mattress.</p>

<p>Also, should I assume that anything I do on my bed would be felt in the same way by the other tenants? If it's my bed that's causing the resonance effect, maybe I wouldn't need to worry about bothering them (unless they have the same kind I suppose). Or would whatever changes you recommend also cut down on this?</p>

<p>So I'm thinking whether it is practical to transport a washing machine up/down stairs alone.

"Where to put used-but-usable clothes (a.k.a. alternative to ""The Chair"")?","<p>We all know The Chair.

"Sources for odd items and components","<p>In pursuit of various diy projects, I often need materials, components or items which are not regularly carried in stores.  For example, for a small diy vacuum chamber which I would like to build, I need a 1-2 foot length of 10+"" diameter PVC pipe.

"Managing day-to-day sound from upstairs neighbours","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> : What are some original and/or just generally effective ways to block low-frequency noise?</p>

<p><strong>Not TL;DR</strong>: 
This question has been asked in various forms already, such as <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/57402/what-diy-should-i-do-on-the-ceiling-to-prevent-noise-from-neighbor-upstairs"">this</a>, but I am not looking for a physical solution (unless someone knows one I can implement easily, That would be awesome). Rather, I need solo ways to deal.</p>

<p>I just moved in to a basement suite fully aware it would be loud above. There is a 3 year old up there. I am super sensitive to this type of noise, and in fact is normally the only deal-breaker in turning down a place. I <strong><em>despise</em></strong> it, and it makes me SUPER anxious. I also don't like kids so this adds to the stress. But this is not about my hangups, it's about managing the noise.</p>

<p>I had no choice. This is the only place I could get and this is where I will be for a year. I feel like advice saying I should reconsider living here, that I should move, or I should get mental health care, etc, would be facile and not super useful. Still, all advice welcome.</p>

<p>I'd be great if advice could <em>not</em> focus on:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modifying the ceiling or doing other physical alterations. I mentioned this already earlier (at least I think I did?)</li>
<li>Talking to the neighbour about the issue. Since this is how it will be no pleasant discussion will change it. As all parents (I've encountered) say when confronted with their child's noise, my neighbour too uttered the ubiquitous: ""it's a kid. What can you do?"" mantra. 
Also, the noise is not extra ordinary enough to really justified a ""talk.""</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm hoping to get irregular ideas since I've already tried and thought of the regulars. I am sensitive to sound after all, and this didn't just develop over night.
I've tried earplugs of various types. Foam ones work the best. Also I use a white noise app with headphones. </p>

<p>My latest attempt is blasting white noise while wearing earplugs - in fact a long time attempt at a solution for me. It's a poor solution though and I need to turn up the white noise so loud that even with ear plugs the loudness hurts my ears, and makes them ring for some time afterwards.</p>

<p>While looking for a solution I found this <a href=""https://www.earplugstore.com/npsf-low-frequency-sounds.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> article about solutions, which I was led to by this Slate <a href=""https://slate.com/human-interest/2005/05/quiet-please-finding-the-best-ear-plugs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> about earplugs. These are much better than the general google search solutions I've found on the issue, but still these links offer no silver bullet. And a silver bullet is, obviously, what I'm after,</p>

<p>Also, not sure if this is the correct forum for this question.</p>

"What is the best way to tape a cardboard box?","<p>While moving recently, my wife and I had a lengthy discussion on where tape should be placed on a box in order to maximize strength while using the least amount of tape possible. Assuming we already taped the main opening of the box shut, how can we make sure the box doesn't break open with weighty items inside?</p>

<p>To me, it doesn't make sense to put tape perpendicular across the opening of a box, detailed below.</p>

<p>This doesn't strengthen any weak points of the box. If anything, it may only be helping the tape that is going across the box's opening stay in place.</p>

"Grey water reuse into back of toilet?","<p>If I remember correctly, adding water to the back of the toilet storage tank will cause the level in the toilet to rise(after the next flush).  </p>

<p>I have a dehumidifier now, and am wondering about pouring the water it collects into my toilet's storage tank.  Not only would it save on water usage, but would reduce the stress on my septic tank.  The amount of water it collects is probably worth a couple flushes a day.  Admittedly it's pretty minor, but I can locate the dehumidifier near the bathroom and it becomes no more difficult to empty it into the toilet than it is to empty it directly into a drain.</p>

<p>I can either manually pour it into the tank, or setup a drain hose to automatically empty into the reservoir.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What will happen if I overfill the reservoir, either by pouring too much into it or via an automatic drain hose that might pump too much water?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can I adjust the bulb in the toilet in such a way that it fills the reservoir significantly less, so that it uses less water after a flush, since I will be replacing some of that with grey water?</strong>  Or is it not possible to make such an adjustment without screwing up the normal operation of the toilet?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note there are <strong>two concerns</strong> to overfilling:</p>

<ol>
<li>Could the reservoir overflow and flood out of the top of the reservoir and onto the floor? (with a continuous drain hose from humidifier)</li>
<li>Could the reservoir fill to a point where it does not overflow, but on the next flush it overflows the toilet?  Sometimes my toilet clogs but it doesn't overflow as long as you only flush it once and clear the clog before flushing again.  I want to be sure the reservoirs are designed such that it's impossible to fill them to a point where the next flush would overflow the toilet.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think one of the vertical pipes in the toilet is open on top to allow overflow to drain out.  Will this prevent both of the potential scenarios?</p>

<p>Note, this information would be useful to others who might want to create a DIY grey water reuse scenario that is similar to the continuous drain scenario.  Perhaps having the drain from a second story sink feed into the reservoir of the first story toilet.</p>

"Preventing smoke entering apartment when windows are opened?","<p>I live in an apartment building, on the second floor. Now that it is nice outside, I have noticed a very frustrating problem - when windows are open, I frequently smell cigarette smoke in our apartment. </p>

<p>Looking at the patio of the downstairs neighbor below makes it clear where this is coming from. </p>

<p>This smell bothers my allergies fairly significantly, ignoring any health effects.</p>

<p>The apartment has <em>very</em> poor circulation of air so in the summer, leaving the windows open is desirable. The windows face west, so it becomes very warm in the afternoon sun without cooling.</p>

<p>It would be absolutely wonderful to find a way to avoid having to shut them all summer. The door faces into the building, but there is a window in the common space so I <em>could</em> pull air through our apartment on days wind blows that way. Some of the options which I have thought about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try to find out which apartment they are and talk with them (not sure what I'd say though - there aren't really good places to smoke nearby)</li>
<li>Running the AC all summer (this would be expensive.. and feel lame when it's only 75°F (23.8°C) outside)</li>
<li>Trying to run the furnace fan to circulate air out somehow(?)</li>
<li>Talk with property manager (this is a bad idea I think...)</li>

This is a general consumer electronics question, but <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/110484/is-there-a-stack-exchange-for-consumer-electronics-questions"">there's no such site yet</a>.<br>

<p>My problem is similar to this one: <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/346/how-do-i-get-lint-out-of-a-headphone-jack"">How do I get lint out of a headphone jack?</a></p>

<p><strong>My problem:</strong><br>
I have a Lumia 640 XL device, a little bit more than 1 years old.<br>
I use it with a Sennheiser Urbanite headphone on a daily basis.  </p>

<p>One day I noticed, that my music stopped suddenly. Even if I resumed it in the player (Spotify), the music wouldn't start again. After a few trials and moving the headphone cable a little bit, it worked again. But during walking, it stopped very often.<br>
It still happens almost every day, even if I barely move the cable or anything. It's like the phone loses the connection with the headphones.</p>

<p>When the music does come back somehow, it's like it's on for a few seconds ""muted"" (I see in the music player that it's playing), then all of a sudden I can hear it again.</p>

<p><strong>Investigation</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not because of Spotify, since the problem happens in Youtube as well</li>
<li>The headphone works flawlessly with another phone, notebook, tablet, etc., even if I try to move and ""break"" the cable a little bit</li>
<li>The phone works with another earphone flawlessly, even if I try to move its cable like with the headphone</li>
<li>I tried to clean the headphone jack both with a toothpick like tool and with compressed air. Some stuff came out, I'd say it's clean now.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I make sure, that my headphone / phone is broken, and not the other one?</li>
<li>How can it happen, that both of them function properly with an other tool, but not if I use them together, and they were fine for a year?</li>
</ul>

If I put the device under a table, it will be hard to interact with as well </p>

The two thumbs are too big (and it would look kinda ugly on the thumb) and the 8 other fingers are too small. The ring cannot be easily resized down further more due to its design and as it is not a very fancy ring, we don't feel like paying too much (or even anything!) to make the necessary modifications. Its value is sentimental.</p>

<p>How can we make sure the ring doesn't get lost?</p>

<p>We thought about an elastic to make sure it doesn't move but it is ugly. We thought about adding stuff in the interior of the ring to resize the internal part of the ring but couldn't find something that worked fine. Do you have a trick?</p>

"How to swim before work (wet towel and clothes problem)?","<p>I like to swim on an almost daily basis, just before going to work. So first I go by bicycle to the swimming pool, swim, and then go by bike to the office. For what it's worth, choosing the best way:</p>

"How to retain air in the tires of bicycle for long?","<p>The tires of my bicycle deflate within a couple of days. I have to pump every time before riding it. Is it true that if a bicycle is kept stationary(not used) for a day or so, then the chances of deflating are more than those when it is used regularly?

"Electrical tape that doesn't get sticky over time","<p>Regardless of which brand I buy or where I buy it from, the electrical tapes always get sticky over time.

"Continuous vinegar disinfecting of dehumidifier water basin","<p>Being a very lazy person, I get tired of vinegar spraying the inside of my dehumidifier's water basin every week.  It's a highly compact machine, and the water basin is has an odd shape, with all sorts of hinged doohickeys at the top (which is the opening), so it takes a bit of dexterity to ensure that I coat all of the interior, deep down to the bottom.</p>

<p>After spraying liberally, I let the basin marinate in the vinegar for about 20 minutes before rinsing it out, then wiping down the outside.  Since the bottom has complex contours, I jiggle the basin every few minutes to ensure a fresh layer of vinegar on the surfaces that are not at the lowest point.  It's not exactly a hands-off process.</p>

<p>One way to avoid the need for this might be to simply pour a few table spoons of vinegar into the basin whenever I empty it out (daily), and leave the vinegar in there while the dehumidier operates.  It will mix with the condensed water extracted from the air, and be in constant contact with the bottom of the basin.  The top of the basin, which doesn't touch liquid water (but might be exposed to high humidity air due to the water in the basin) doesn't get contacted with vinegar with the exception of one of the side walls during the emptying of the basin.</p>

<p>Has anyone ever tried this?  Does it actually make it unnecessary to do the weekly disinfecting?  Would the constant exposure to vinegar harm the plastic?  Would the lack of exposure to vinegar of the top part of the basin (including the complex doohickeys) be at risk of developing grime, mildew, or mold?  Does it make the home smell like vinegar all the time?  Would that be bad for one's lungs?  </p>

<p>I also wonder whether it would be just the smell of vinegar in the air, whether the vapour in the air would actually be acidic.  If so, then in the long term, constant exposure could harm all things exposed to the air, e.g., books, plastics, fabrics, HEPA filters, etc.</p>

<p>Just wondering about the overall wisdom of indulging my laziness....</p>

"How can I better protect my laptop in my backpack?","<p>I recently purchased a new laptop. This one is an investment as I intend to use it for consulting and moonlighting. I take my laptop with me commuting to and from work, as I've got opportunity during the commute to bring it out and do work. Since this laptop is an investment I want to do the best I can to protect it from damage. I put my laptop into my backpack, in the compartment built into the backpack for laptops. However, to be honest with myself, the backpack I've got is just the garden variety that you get at Sam's Club. It's a Swiss Gear backpack I got 4 or 5 years back. Yesterday I took a close look at the compartment for laptops and found that it really isn't well padded. The public buses and trains that I take to commute normally jostle a lot. Clearly the best thing to do would be to purchase a better backpack with proper padding. But, at least at the moment that exceeds my budget. Especially when I look at some of the brands out there where a really good backpack with good padding for laptops is around $200.</p>

<p>So, I'm wondering if there something I can put into my current backpack's laptop compartment which will give it good protection from the bumps I normally experience in my commute? I've thought of maybe using old clothes or a towel, but wonder if that would just leave lint that could go into the air vents of the laptop. What other material might I consider?</p>

"How to maximize total apple/pear volume in a space limited bag?","<p>My grocery store frequently has a special on pears and apples where you fill the bag for a set price and I'm never quite sure how well I've done maximizing the contents.</p>

<h2>My restrictions and (limited) sense of etiquette:</h2>

<ol>
<li>I prefer apples to pears, so I wouldn't want a solution of more than 1/3 pears.</li>
<li>I also get bored with one fruit, so I don't want 0 pears.</li>
<li>I also refuse to harm any fruit in the process (i.e. no apple sauce.)</li>
<li>The bag is 2 sheets of 30x30cm plastic when laid flat. Apples are 4-6cm ~spheres, while a pear might be 4x6cm.</li>
<li>I have no measuring instruments in the shop, no willingness to replace fruit already in the bag, or take an excessive amount of time, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given these restrictions, my question is how do I maximize the total volume filled and minimize the air gaps assuming these varying sphere and pear shapes?</p>

<p>Do I start with smaller or larger apples first, do I start with pears first? Are same size or mixed size/shaped objects easier to use to fill a space? Etc.</p>

<h2>More about the bag:</h2>

<p>It has plastic handles at the top which need to be closed together making a rough sphere. It is prone to ripping, particularly where the handles connect, so stretching is not practical. The bottom corners are pushed up inside about 2 cm and welded in the side welds, making it slightly more spherical when full. The offer claims that it can hold at least 3 Kg.</p>

"How to work around European size hardware measurements","<p>I have some furniture which was made in Europe.  The bolts and what-not are all in metric measurements.  Some of the bolts came loose and were misplaced, and some of the pieces necessary for converting stages of the furniture were missing.</p>

"How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically and the same every time","<p><strong>First off, this isn't about trimming techniques or Dos and Don'ts.</strong>
I use a similar <em>electric trimmer</em> to the one the OP posted in the following question: <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/1806/what-to-do-if-your-shaver-broke-halfway-through-shaving/1829#1829"">What to do if your shaver broke halfway through shaving?</a>
I also already follow the rules mentioned in the top-answer of the above question.</p>

<p>I don't have a beard, and I don't shave close. That's why I used the term facial hair. I have a certain facial hair style I want to accomplish every time I trim my facial hair again.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/P7oiMm.jpg"" alt=""quick sketch of my personal style""></p>

<p>So I actually have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I trim my facial hair symmetrically?</li>
<li>How do I achieve the same facial hair style every time I trim?</li>
</ol>

<p>To trim symmetrically I just use my good eye and move my head from left to right and trim here and there, until I find it symmetrically.</p>

<p>If my last trimming-session isn't that long ago, I can still see where the hair is shorter; I see the trimming-lines and try to follow them again. But if I trimmed a long time ago, I can't recognize where I trimmed last time.</p>

<p>I thought about something like a template. But what would that be made of and where could it be fixed?</p>

<p>I hope I'm not the only one bothered by this.</p>

"Career lifestyle - feel tired every afternoon","<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>

<p>I recently started my career as a professional. I have the luxury of working ""<em>flextime</em>"", meaning I can start and finish when I want, as long as I work my 7 - 8 hour days. Virtually all of my work is at my desk on the computer.</p>

<p>The travel time to work is about 45mins, and I enjoy having more free time in the afternoons, so I choose to work from 7:30 to around 3:30 - 3:45.</p>

<p>However, when I get home at around 4:30, most days, I feel extremely tired / lethargic. I'll often ""slump-out"" for up to an hour, essentially loosing my extra free time, and then feeling sluggish for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>I always get 8 hours of sleep, but still struggle to ""grind out"" the entire day. I don't drink coffee, mainly because I just never got into it and I don't particularly like it.</p>

<p>Some of my friends are tradesmen who wake up at like 5:30 and still manage to last until 10 o'clock at night - I don't know how they do it!!</p>

<p>I eat plenty of food and drink plenty of water throughout the day. I'll have a small meal at 9:00 and another when I finish work at 3:30. These are on top of lunch and a few snacks as well.</p>

<p>Due to my regular water intake, every hour or so, I go for a walk to a distant bathroom to stretch my legs out.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>

<p>Is this lifestyle routine something that I will get used to as I get older?</p>

<p>What strategies can I employ to feel less tired in the afternoon?</p>

<p>I really don't want to start work later because I don't like getting home late(er).</p>

"How to prevent my new shoes charging me?","<p>I got already a few ideas from <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/q/281/10538"">How can I avoid getting static shocks in the winter?</a> .</p>

<p>But I think my question is still diferent in the solution being asked for, as a) I am well aware of what causes the charging up and b) for me it would also work, if instead of reducing the shock I could prevent charging up in the first place.</p>

<p>So I have a new pair of shoes. Since I wear them, I get very easily electrical charged. Especially if walking on carpetfloors. I was hoping this will get less, after the shoes start being worn a little, but it didn't stop yet for 3 weeks. After having had a walk of like 50 meters on the hallways at work, I get almost assured a shock, when ever I have to touch a doorhandle. What is quite often the case, and the shocks I am getting are sometimes as painful, that it is even when touching metal with my arm through clothes very unpleasant. Not to mention how much it sometimes hurt at the finger tips...</p>

<p>So are there any modifications I could do to the shoes<sup>1</sup> or myself to prevent charging up?</p>

<p>And if not so, is there any item, I could use to discharge myself in a comfortable way in a work setting? Even the walk to the Watercooler requires me to touch 3 different doorhandles leaving alone the water cooler it self having metal buttons... And it feels unhandy for me having my carkeys with me every time I have to go somewhere as I usually lock them away while at work.
But if there was an item being more handy for this setting, that would work too.</p>

"How to reattach headphone cables that have separated","<p>Many headphones have two plastic-sheathed cables, one attached to the bottom of each speaker.  The two cables meet in a plastic joint a few centimetres below the speakers, and then continue as a connected double cable until they terminate in a jack.  (See picture below)</p>

<p>The problem with this design is that the connection between the double-cable sheaths is pretty fragile.  It's not uncommon for the two cables to become separated after the joint.

Is there some kind of glue I could use that won't make the cable too stiff?  Or would it be possible to non-destructively heat up the cables so that the plastic sheaths fuse back together?</p>

"Water Softener salt and Dehumidification","<p>I have a Water Softener which uses tablet salt so I have plenty of salt available. I have a problem with my loft (attic) in that it is constantly very damp. I've noticed that salt seems to be able to draw moisture from the surrounding air, spontaneously forming a salt-solution.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if I can rig-up a device a bit like one of those low-tech (Chemical) dehumidifiers:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pUQTo.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
 where the resulting salt solution is captured in a vessel and I can then empty the solution into the softener - getting 2 functions from one bag of salt. The softener actually requires brine to regenerate the resin-bed so it relies upon steeping the salt tablets in a controlled amount of water and it then sucks that up during the regeneration.</p>

<p>1) Will this work?</p>

<p>2) Can anyone see any potential problems?</p>

<p>3) Any suggestions for building the device?</p>

"Best method of getting a wine label off a wine bottle?","<p>In the ""old days"" wine labels used to soak off in warm water, presumably because they used plain paper and a water-based glue.  Nowadays 99.34% of labels are of the self-adhesive variety, laser-cut with embossings, metallic and plastic finishings and coatings and seemed to be designed to military specifications NOT to be removed. </p>

<p>I am a home-brewer and need a supply of clean re-usable wine bottles, and removing these modern labels is a chore.</p>

<p>I have tried the following but I may have missed some good ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>soaking in water... this sometimes sort of works - it seems to depend on the quality of the paper versus the power of the glue.  Fails often on coated labels. Resort to scraping with a potato peeler. If that fails bin it.  ~ 5% chance of success</p></li>
<li><p>VERY carefully pick up a corner and peel it off by hand. When it rips, try a different corner. Again this depends on the paper quality vs glue and seems to critically depend on the angle of peel. Good approach for coated labels. Often you can succeed in doing this on the front label then fail totally on the 2 back labels which have an entirely different constituency. ~ 5% chance again</p></li>
<li><p>Lighter fluid.  from an old trick in removing floppy disk labels - tiddle lighter fluid liberally over the entire surface of the label (only works on non-coated labels) so that it soaks thru the paper into the backing glue. I use my fingers to spread it. Wait until it just appears to have dried - then peel as for 2.  If it rips - you can try repeating the whole process. Often leaves gluey residue.  Use a paper towel and more lighter fluid to remove it, and polish it off.  ~ 70% chance.</p></li>
<li><p>heat bottle in slow oven oven at ~100C. use gloves and try and peel label with other hand. Some skill/risk required  ~ 40% chance</p></li>

However, as mentioned, I am at work and unfortunately we do not have a stove for me to keep a pan simmering for 10 minutes but I do have a microwave and a kettle and other standard kitchen utensils.

"Could smoke odor be originating from the HVAC system of an adjacent townhome?","<p>I live in a townhouse and I hired a company to remove the smoke odor in the house. Now, the odor is almost gone when the heat is off.</p>

They tell me that, because there is smoke smell in my neighbor's house (which is true) and our ventilation systems are connected (which I am not sure), the odor will be sucked into the vents and then get into my house when I turn on the heat.</p>

<p>But my furnace is a closet in my living room, and my neighbor's heat is NOT on when I turn on my heat. That's why I'm not sure if the ventilation systems are connected.</p>

<hr>

<p>While peeing stand up I wonder where should I aim to minimize the amount of little drops splash out. Some alternatives:</p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuhzP.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IuhzP.png"" alt=""toilet diagram""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>In the middle of the water (F5)? Near the border (G5)?</li>
<li>To one side: Near the water (H5)? Far from the water (I5)?</li>
<li>Should the angle of the stream with the surface should be orthogonal (F3) or the more tangent the better (F9)? </li>
</ul>

<p>Also where should I stand. Maybe just the normal/in front is not the optimal place.</p>

<h2>Possible causes</h2>

<p>The male urine stream breaks up about 15 cm outside the urethra exit. The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau%E2%80%93Rayleigh_instability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Plateau-Rayleight inestability</a> forms the droplets before <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_impact"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impact</a>. The angle of attack, the distance (velocity of the stream) and the type of impact surface are some of the key elements that will determine the type, direction and amount of splashes. Droplets create a large <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c66KVU5ah8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cavity in the water</a> (due to its surface tension), which then collapses, cause the splashback (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XNDM4eAn1U"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">similar physics for poop</a> (AKA <em><a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Poseidon%27s%20Kiss"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kiss of Poseidon</a></em>)).</p>

<h2>Notes about possible solutions</h2>

<p>There are <a href=""https://scholar.google.com.ar/scholar?as_vis=1&amp;q=toilet++splash&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=1,5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">some research</a>. <a href=""https://splashlab.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Splashlab</a> was widely <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-24820279"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">covered by media</a>. Based on their research <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgOx7zPtsaM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">and video</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>""When pee hits the porcelain at a 90 degree angle, the splashback is terrible""</em></li>
<li><em>""Narrowing the angle really helps""</em></li>
<li><em>""best practice"" means standing slightly to one side, and aiming downwards at a low angle of impact.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Of course the best option is to pee sitting down (although in Germany <a href=""https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sitzpinkler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">they'll call you <em>sitzpinkler</em></a>; silly sexism IMO).</li>
<li>Reducing surface tension with a shield of paper over the water. Using a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">surfectant</a> like soap or solvent wouldn't be enough.</li>
<li><strong>Other options</strong>

<li>Future toilet with hydrophobic coating.</li>

"How can I fix a broken wire?","<p>I bought an electronic device that consists of a controller attached to a larger main unit by wire.  The wire cannot be detached from either end.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the wire is coming apart on the end attached to the controller, as you can see in this photo.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/huf7C.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/huf7C.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I asked the seller for an exchange, but they really don't want to exchange it and are offering me money instead to keep it.</p>

<p>Is there any way to fix this wire?</p>

<p>I have looked around and there are various suggestions for broken wires/cords:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Heat shrink sleeve/tube.  That will only work for a wire that is completely cut.  I wouldn't be able to get the sleeve/tube over the wire in this case.</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical tape</p></li>
<li><p>Liquid electrical tape</p></li>
<li><p>Electrical glue/putty such as <a href=""https://sugru.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sugru</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>I think the main difficulty with this is that the wire is coming apart right at that trapezoidal cylinder-shaped flexy thing (does anyone know what that's called?) on the controller.  Electrical tape would have to cover both that and the wire and I'm skeptical it'd be a strong hold.  Not sure liquid electrical tape or putty would work either.</p>

"Removing Liquified Plastic Layer Residue From Notched Metal Surface","<p>I use old electric hob (as shown in the picture) for preparing my food, which takes a while to heat up and then takes even more time to cool down after use. Today I made a grave rookie mistake - as the hob was cooling down, I thought it would be a good idea to put my plastic cup of water on it, in order to warm it up. One minute later I recognized that the plastic began to liquify due to heat still being there, apparently...</p>

<p>Now, the second biggest mistake probably was my reaction, as I hurried to scrape the remains of hot plastic with a knife, which removed 99% of it, but a small visible layer of it still remains. It probably was not an issue, if the metal surface was smooth - but it's actually composed of many little notches, which makes it somewhat difficult to reach and clean them.</p>

<p>Therefore my question is - how do I remove that plastic layer lurking on top of the notched metal surface? Will heating itself be enough for it to slowly evaporate, or is there some other 'smart' way to react with this plastic? </p>

"What's the best way to avoid slippery (frozen) outdoor stairs","<p>My outdoor stairway has been very slippery this winter. I've regularly removed most of the snow and ice, but the last thin (and almost invisible) layer of ice covering the stone steps has been difficult to remove, making it at times dangerous for some of my guests... </p>

<p>I've been wondering what would be best to avoid my guests slipping on this thin layer of ice: sand (gravel), salt or sawdust. I haven't used sand because I considered it unpleasant to bring in ""dirt"" with the shoes, and I'm not so fond of using salt because I think it might not be so pleasant for my cat (but that might not be correct?), and sawdust is something I never even considered, before reading about it in the newspaper the other day. It said sawdust is efficient, and durable, but is it ""dirty""?</p>

<p>Given other household items, is there a way to do a quick measurement faster than running out to a store and buying a new scale?</p>

<hr>

<p>First ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My first thought's to place the item in a small bucket, put it in a sink/tub, then measure the approximation water displacement to back-calculate the weight.  But that'd seem to waste a lot of water.</p></li>
<li><p>Basically the same as (1), but using two cups or bottles of different sizes instead of a bucket and tub/sink.  Could extend this to handle high-volume items by balancing the item to be weighed in the center container to use it as a plunger, but would still seem to need an outer container that has sufficient volume for heavier items.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe using something like floss to do some sort of pulley-based system against a known weight?</p></li>

"Using electricity at night","<p>In Germany I get offers for reduced electricity rates from 22:00 to 6:00 for private households. The reduced rate is about 20% less than the normal rate.</p>

<p>Children go to bed at 20:00, my wife latest 23:00 and I between 23:00 and 24:00. We get up between 5:30 and 6:15, depending on how many of us decided to take a shower in the morning.</p>

"How can I remove skin oil from my phone's screen?","<p>My phone screen picks up the usual fingerprint smudges, but there is a band where the swipe keyboard appears that is particularly bad.

"Fuse / patch two papers side-by-side without noticeable seam?","<p>Today I got a raffle ticket which is used for  our seminar party last night.

Recreate this ""complete"" raffle ticket as if it was never been cut in half, in other words, is there any way to ""fuse"" two piece of paper(of same type) side by side so that it forms one big piece? The dashed line between the two piece is intact in this case so that the fusing part does not involve any pictures to worry. Obviously tape should not be used in this case and using glue could end up messy. If I crudely put them together firmly a noticeable seam can be seen.</p>

This question specifically points to the body part of the refrigerator and it focuses on foods only, not drinks and beverages or any other items that we can fit in the refrigerator. Most of my foods are used / leftover viands.</p>

<p>I have a small compact size refrigerator and I can't fit every food that I want to store in it. In my estimation I can store goods (composed mainly of foods etc. vegetables, meats, fish, fruits) that is good enough for 2 - 3 weeks, I am living alone and I eat normally (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack and dinner). So my goal is to make it at least good enough for a month or more.</p>

<p>So far here are the things that I've tried already:</p>

<ol>
<li>I didn't buy much food - Obviously by buying small quantities of
food you can avoid wasting them, but this doesn't answer my problem
of maximizing the storage capacity, it's more on avoiding waste of
food.</li>
<li>I search for foods that I can store outside the refrigerator - This
helps me a lot like removing garlic, onion, most of the fruits like
banana, orange, watermelon and other foods that seems to be okay
even if they are not inside the fridge. And I they are the first
that I consume.</li>

"What is the most appropriate type of water bottle for home use?","<p>When at home I use a bottle to drink water from instead of a glass. For some time - actually, several yaers - I used glass bottles, since:</p>

<ol>
<li>they can be reused many more times without involving any serious health risk from chemical substances bleeding into the contained water,</li>
<li>due to their re-usability, they are not so harmful to the environment, leading to a lower personal carbon footprint,</li>
<li>they - at least this is what I have found out in these years - keep water cool for longer time during hot days, when compared to plastic bottles, </li>
<li>they are easier to clean and also do not get that permanent smell as easy as plastic bottles.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, there were some things that made me reconsider my choice the last months and use plastic bottles as:</p>

<ol>
<li>my glass bottles used to get a permanent smell, after some time, that, even after cleaning with vinegar - something I mostly use to clean my water bottles; also suggested in the first answer of <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/3972/how-to-stop-rim-of-water-bottle-becoming-smelly"">this question</a> - was perceivable,</li>
<li>they also got something like a black rust around the mouthpiece and, more specifically, around the place where the cap of the bottle was placed which was removed by scrathing it with a knife or something similar,</li>
<li>they were pretty heavy for water bottles, as I tend to use 1-2 lt bottles.</li>
</ol>

<p>All the above, especially the health risks I might take made me reconsider and start using plastic bottles. However, there are several drawbacks in using such bottles, as:</p>

<ol>
<li>they are not that sustainable, so I'm oblidged to buy new bottles quite often which leads in more consuming of plastic, which increases the harm I'm causing to the environment,</li>
<li>use of plastic bottles poses also several health risks, especially those mentiond in the second answer of <a href=""https://lifehacks.stackexchange.com/questions/18608/how-can-you-reuse-a-disposable-water-bottle-indefinitely"">this question</a>,</li>
<li>cleaning them has not provided many results, since they easily get a smell and, moreover, even a day after having them, thoroughly cleaned,</li>
<li>they are way more vulnerable to exposure to sunlight than glass bottles.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bearing al these - and whatever may occur - in mind, which of these two types of bottles is the most appropriate for home use? Additionally, are there any other types of water-bottles more suitable for home use and, if there are, how do they relate with the abovementioned issues (eco-friendly, low-to-zero health-risks, easy cleaning, long-lasting etc)?

<p>After having used the facilities (ie going #1 or #2) in a public bathroom, walking up to the sink; what is the proper hand washing etiquette? </p>

<p>To have dry hands and hit the soap dispenser with one hand, the water with another, and proceed to wash?</p>

<p>Or turn on the water, wet your hands, proceed to touch the soap dispenser (with a wet hand) and proceed to wash hands.</p>

<p>To me there are issues with both procedures. </p>

<p>First example, dry hands on the dispenser provides the possibility of leaving some of your ""business"" on the soap dispenser handle. Granted, the next person touching it will be washing their hands also...knowing how most people behave regarding germs, seems like it's not the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Second example, having wet hands and touching the soap dispenser handle, leaves behind a wet dispenser handle for the next user who may by chance be a dry hand soap dispenser person. Again it doesn't seem polite leaving behind a wet dispenser handle for the next person to touch, regardless that the person will be washing their hands anyway.</p>

"What can be used ( instead of / for ) a plastic straw?","<p>A lot of beverages are difficult to drink without a straw such as smoothies and drinks with crushed ice to name two. If you're confined to a bed, that's another accessibility issue.</p>

<p>Plastic straws have joined single-use packaging as pollution and are about to be banned if they haven't been already.</p>

<p>Paper straws fall apart but are re-cyclable 100%. I recently overheard someone complaining that they've gone through six straws with one cocktail (leisurely sipped I assume).</p>

<p>Metal straws are a problem for a couple of reasons: portability - Who wants to carry them around? Where do I put it after I've used it? Cleaning it/them between drinks depends on where you are. Cleaning them causes more pollution and energy use - soap, hot water, Q-tips, brushes, more?.</p>

"Inhaling less chalk dust while erasing blackboard during teaching","<p>While erasing stuff written using a chalk on a blackboard, with a duster, it is commonly observed that a lot of chalkdust is released in to the air, some part of which is inhaled (largely) by the teacher, and sometimes, also the first/second row students. This can be a problem, since even if we discount the case of bad allergies from chalk-dust, this inhalation can cause coughing etc. which one would ideally want to avoid.</p>

<p><strong>What is the best <em>hack</em> to ensure you inhale as little of chalk-dust as possible during this process</strong>?</p>

<p>(Of course, this problem does not apply to the relatively swankier <em>marker-whiteboard</em> version of the same, but that's not what this question is about.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Here are a few hacks I seem to think off, but none of these is of the creative variety that one would ideally want as an ingenious solution to the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Switch to a classroom with a <em>marker-whiteboard</em> arrangement. (<em>Least creative resort, this isn't what I'm asking about here. This changes the condition of the question</em>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Adopt ""<em>non-dust</em>"" chalk. (<em>Doable, but still not the creative answer I'm anticipating</em>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Turn up earlier than the class timings, and wipe the blackboard with a wet cloth, which would reduce the amount of chalk dust inherently existing on the board, even without you having written something. (<em>This is doable, e.g. for the first class of the day. But when multiple classes cascade, i.e. one after another during the day, this is time-costly option, and hence, not very efficient.</em>)</p></li>
<li><p>Go outside the classroom, and bump the duster on a flat surface, which would eliminate most of the dust it has procured from earlier, and hence, you are working with a lesser amount of chalkdust.</p></li>
<li><p>Tie a handkerchief on your nose and mouth while erasing it, to reduce the amount inhaled. (<em>Perhaps the worst option, I mean, seriously</em> ...!!!)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any simpler strategy (i.e. <em>lifehack</em>) around this problem?</p>

Cockroaches always hailed in my house but they hardly bothered; two or three could be found under the sink or at the attic. But they have multiplied at a mammoth rate recently! Huge numbers of nymphs roam on the table at the verandah at night; things went worst when today I saw many nymphs floating on the drinking water I stored in a pan. Even they don't spare the fridge!! I kept my chipps &amp; cakes at the fridge but was at the blues when I saw cockroaches already enjoying the snacks!! I have used pesticide(spray); yes it killed many but was only temporarily successful. On the 5th or 6th day, I could again see cockroaches. And recently(day before yesterday), I again sprayed on the table at verandah &amp; at the morning I saw many nymphs dead but yesterday I saw with disgust they were resurrected again:( I am very dubious of the effectiveness on the spray; moreover I don't want to use such things as I have a pet dog; he always licks his paw &amp;  pesticide might stick on his paw; he has his drinking-water outside &amp; though I cover it before spraying, it still gets contaminated. I don't want my dog to get die in the course of removing cockroaches.

"Jury-rig a walker for outdoor activity that might involve reaching","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<p>I want to aide my mobility-limited father in modifying his walker, so it still provides some stabilty and support
even when he momentarily removes his hands from it.</p>

<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>

<p>My father is 85 years old.  He has had three different spinal fusions, a rotator cuff repair, and other surgeries to alleviate arthritis.
Each surgery has eased pain at the expense of range of motion.</p>

<p>He can walk short distances un-aided, as long as it is over firm level terrain.  For any longer distance, or any variation, he needs a walker.
He normally has the walker around, even when moving about his house, just for safety. At the store, he generally uses a scooter, but can get by
just using a shopping cart as a substitute walker.  His walker looks very similar to this one, but with rubber pads in front of the wheels that engage
when any downward pressure is applied.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uu9AB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uu9AB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>His ability to bend over is also reduced.  He pre-ties his shoes and uses a long-handled shoe horn to get them on and off.  He uses a grabber like this
one for other reaching tasks.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g41hn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/g41hn.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Desired Outcome</strong></p>

<p>The other day in an email, my father asked my help in brainstorming ways to give his walker a bit of a ""Tim Taylor Treatment"" and make it possible
for him to do some activities he enjoys in the outdoors a little more.  One example is pruning bushes- to grab a branch with one hand, and lob it with
shears with the other hand.  Another example is Geocaching, where a small tube might be hanging within
a tree and need to be unscrewed or un-buckled, the log within signed, then returned.</p>

<p>Each of these things requires taking both hands off
the walker.  Even though he won't be moving his feet while doing so, because he has to reach out slightly, he is concerned about maintaining
balance, and wants to still have a little support from the walker.</p>

<p>My father has engineering background and we both have done plenty of tinkering with stuff before now.  He has notions of ropes and straps tied between his belt
or suspenders and the frame of the walker.  I'm not sure this will work, and haven't had any ideas of my own so far.</p>

<p><strong>The question(s)</strong></p>

<p>Has anyone successfully modified a walker to do what I am describing and give my father what he desires?  What suggestions do others have for
doing this?  Is walker modification the way to go, or should we go ""outside the box"" with some other solution?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit with some after-thoughts that may or may not be relevant:  </p>

<p>The surgeries and consequences mentioned above did not happen all at once, but slowly over the last twenty or so years.</p>

<p>Mom is deceased, Dad lives alone.  I am an only child, and live six hours away.  I am endeavoring to increase the frequency of my visits (and plan to soon switch jobs and move closer.)

<p>The people are a variety of ages. Some are in school and have a tight budget.</p>

<p>The fairest system I've heard of is - whenever something shared or for the household is needed anyone buys it, puts the receipt in the jar with their name on it, and at the end of each month the cost for the receipts in the jar are divided up evenly and the purchaser is reimbursed.</p>

"Storing herbs, spices, coffee and tea in my Florida van? Temperature inside insulated bag inside insulated freezer","<p>I live in South Florida where the summer sun has no mercy. I drive a new van and I've taken steps to keep the inside cooler during the day. I live in the van for weeks at a time and need to store things in the van. I rarely hang out inside the van from 11am to 3pm unless it's parked in the shade or unless the AC is turned on. At night I have a very large and powerful vent fan and have no issues sleeping in the van even in July and August. However, my goal and concern here is with keeping some items in the van when parked in the sun. I can't afford to run my freezer every day. Items include dry good and things like Herbal supplements, Teas, instant coffee and Olive oil. These are not things that are generally very sensitive to some warmth and humidity ... but I want to see what I can do to offer them a safe storage in my van. Here's what I've done so far:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install a large aluminum and glass solar panel on my roof, this the space directly above the place i store these things and blocks the sun. </li>
<li>Open large vent opening under the solar panel where heat escapes.</li>
<li>Install reflective mirror vinyl where the solar panel does not cover. </li>
<li>Install reflective insulation a 1/2 inch below the roof metal</li>
<li>Install a sealed plywood ceiling </li>
<li>Placing said items in an insulated bag</li>
<li>Placing the insulated bag in a highly insulated and sealed Freezer (that is usually off)</li>
</ol>

Does it sound like these items are going to go bad or worse be dangerous for consumption if stored as describe ... I mean, tea and herbs are dry leaves and roots ... what if the temp inside the bag is 90 F degrees? Is it even possible it could be 90F inside that bag?</em></p>

"How to make a sticky mess (a permanently sticky material like sap)?","<p>I have some items I want to add rustic handles to by wrapping them in rope. Imagine a frying pan or feather duster. The items are slippery enough that the rope may loosen or even come off. I would like to coat everything in an adhesive gunk that causes the rope to grip better, without actually gluing it. (Typical glue may not adhere, plus I'd like the chance to remove the handle.)</p>

<p>Sap would be ideal, but I don't have time to go to the forest and hunt for it. 3M 72 spray is supposed to be permanently tacky but its not available in my local stores. I noticed cooking oil forms a sticky mess, so my current thought is to carefully boil some oil and paint that on with the help of rubbing alcohol. Will this work? Should I use a partially drying oil like canola or a more stable oil like olive oil?</p>

<p>Possible solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrap the item with 3M 300 LSE double sided adhesive. This works, even on exotic plastics like Delrin.</li>
<li>Dip the item in spoiled shellac. For example, blonde (bleached) shellac which has been left in the sun/heat for a long time. However, I'm not sure shellac will grip plastics.</li>
<li>Sap, dissolved in a solvent like rubbing alcohol, mineral spirits, or orange oil.</li>
<li>Chewing gum, boiled to make it soft and sanitary.</li>
<li>Latex exercise band, wrapped around then glued to itself with a dab of super glue.</li>
<li><s>Wrap the item with a tack cloth before adding rope.</s> Even tack cloth adds no grip.</li>
</ul>

"How can I know the people following me just use multiple cars but not a GPS tracker?","<p>Dealing with a <strong>very toxic</strong> situation, I am listened/spied on by my neighbor and his friend and they follow me as soon as I leave my home, be it on foot or by car.</p>

<p>Is there a trick I can use to determine if they are just using multiple cars to follow me (doing it professionally like cops maybe) or if they have planted a GPS tracker, either permanently inside the car or just stuck underneath it?</p>

<p>I bought a RF detector <a href=""https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Professional-G318-1Mhz-8000Mhz-Wireless-RF-Signal-Detector-Tap-Detect-Mobile/112157437998?epid=2261039752&amp;hash=item1a1d1ab02e:g:rQQAAOSwvutayRhv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this one</a> but this has been ineffective for various reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is catching background RF noise.</li>
<li>I am driving alone, so I can't sweep the car while driving.</li>
<li>The tracker could send location either every 5 minutes or only on demand (via SMS).
So this solution is not working.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have caught them following me 3 times (by luck maybe), but I just wonder if they are trying to make me believe they follow me by car to make me stop looking inside the car for the tracker, if there is one.</p>

<p>I know for sure that I have been followed because if I rent a hotel room I spend the night awake because they prevent me from sleeping by renting the room next door and making small noises loud enough to awake me. So this costs me 50€ every time for nothing.</p>

"Physical Text To Digital Text","<p>Let me first prefix this question with, I have no idea which StackExchange site would be most appropriate for this question, but I thought LifeHacks might work...</p>

<p>In 1998 my Mom's side of the family had a big family reunion (my great grandmother had ten kids so it really was a big gathering). One of my distant Uncles wrote a sort of book on our families history for this reunion and my Mom gave me the book to read. I couldn't believe how big it is and how much research went into the book. I would like to figure out a way to get the whole book on a website I'm going to make where I can then share it with everyone in our family and ultimately preserve the history for longer than this flimsy book can.</p>

<p>In the hope that I don't have to type word for word this entire 300 page book is there a way where I can just scan the pages and get them in digital text? Obviously I could just take pictures and make the website using the pictures but I feel like it would be more beneficial to have it as actual text because then it might show up on Google searches better when someone searches a family members name or something like that. Also, if someone in the family ever does maybe a research project on our family they'd be able to copy some of the text and reference it more easily.</p>

<p>So does anyone know the best way I can get this old family book into digital text?</p>

"How to stop a commercially manufactured garment’s dye from bleeding out?","<p>So, I have an odd dilemma with two pieces of clothing I own:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vintage 1982 dark green 100% cotton Atari promotional Centipede t-shirt.</li>
<li>Modern 2018 dark blue 100% cotton denim button down shirt from Uniqlo.</li>
</ol>

<p>While both of these items were made decades apart, they both share an amazingly annoying attribute: They both bleed their dyed color like crazy.</p>

<p>I can’t wear the Atari t-shirt anymore (too small) but I would like to wash it and make sure the dye doesn’t bleed out anymore. The denim Uniqlo shirt seems like a selvedge material, and even the white buttons on it show signs of the dye bleeding out.</p>

<p>If I simply soak either of these items in a sink in warm to hot water without any detergent, I can pull them out as little as 15 minutes later and the water is dyed. Deep enough it almost seems as if a frozen ice op was dropped in the water. Washing in a washing machine doesn’t seem to help.</p>

<p>What can I do to stop the dye from bleeding out like this? I have read articles <a href=""https://www.thespruce.com/set-and-stop-fabric-dye-bleeding-2146657"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this one</a> and <a href=""https://www.speedqueen.com/smart/2017-q2/the-secrets-to-stopping-colors-from-bleeding-and-fading.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> online but I seem to get more confused than anything else. I’m not too worried about garments fading as much as I am worried about dyes leeching out. I simply want to stop the bleeding!</p>

<p>Should these 100% cotton items be soaked in salty water? Or vinegar? Or something else?</p>

<p>I mention that these were commercially dyed (by the manufacturer) because some commercial products for after-market dyeing exist to prevent those items from bleeding. But I doubt they would help in the case of items that are commercially dyed on a factory level.</p>

But I actually don't and I also don't care what you're thinking.</sub></p>

<p>The problem is that I get a hole in the front pocket of my fairly new jeans. The fabric wears off on the inside of the pocket, the one touching my thigh, until there's a hole. This doesn't bother me to much, because I'm always carrying my <strong>wallet and my keys</strong> in that pocket (the keys are on the outer side, so the wallet prevents the keys from getting tangled in the hole/worn off fabric but it still rather seldom happens). But when it happens it's really annoying! I'm trying to unlock a door and start to pull on my keychain (picture below), which is connected to the belt loop of the jeans with a carabineer, but the keys are tangled in the hole/worn off fabric and I need to reach into the pocket and untangle the keys.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aOlv0m.jpg"" alt=""keychain""></p>

<p>It only happened with that pocket (the left one - if that really matters) and I'm guessing because of the sharp edges of the keys - I actually don't want to change the habit of carrying my wallet and keys in the left, and my cellphone in the right pocket. But if it's the only solution I'll have to.</p>

<p>With one pair of jeans, I've already tried to replace the whole pocket with an old kitchen cloth. It seemed to work, but washing once already resulted in a hole at the bottom of the pocket, where the seam is.</p>

<p>My jeans really are not that old and I don't have holes in other parts of the jeans, so I don't want to throw them away, just because there's a hole in the pocket.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a reason for these holes, which I didn't mention?</li>
<li>Is there any way to prevent worn off fabric in jeans pockets (make fabric stronger/""protect"" sharp edges of keys)?</li>
<li>How do I properly replace/fix a jeans pocket which has a hole in it?</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do Not Wash. Do Not Bleach. Line Dry. Do Not Iron. Do Not Dry Clean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I read <code>Do Not Wash</code>, I thought that I could dryclean the thing. However, in the end, it also says <code>Do Not Dry Clean</code>. Then how am I supposed to clean this thing? On further reading, I noticed a little note from the distributor (Miniso) writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brand: MINISO; Product name: cushion; Bar code: <em>something</em>; Material:
  exterior: 95% polyester, 5% elastane; Insides: 100% polyester.
  Caution: do not soak and do not brush. Do not bleach. Wash gently with
  hands. Avoid direct sunlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So some questions from an oblivious new cushion customer here:</p>

<ul>
<li>It says <code>do not wash</code>, but it also says <code>wash gently with hands</code>. Well, I need to wash it <strong>eventually</strong>, so I assume we're gonna do it with hands. How do I wash things 'gently'?</li>
<li>It also says <code>line dry</code> and I looked the term up. It means to literally dry the thing on a clothing line, thus <strong>direct sunlight!</strong> But it tells me to avoid direct sunlight. What? What should I do?</li>

"Upgrade jackets to be water- and wind- proof","<p>I have two winter jackets, for different lowest temperatures (i.e. one thicker and one thinner). For a while they were both fine, until I had the experiences to go through rain or through stronger wind (not both at the same time, yet). Regardless of the advertisement and labels, they are not at all proof.</p>

<p>Because I would not continue the business buying jackets, hoping that one day I will find one suitable, I want to ""fix"" the current ones.</p>

<p>My plan would be the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>thoroughly clean the jackets;</li>
<li>properly dry the jackets, avoiding accumulation of dust or some other debris;</li>
<li>apply a good layer of liquid ""solidifiable"" something; good soaking / impregnation of the outer layer of fabric is mandatory, I assume;</li>
<li>wait for the ""something"" to properly cure;</li>
<li>be happy wearing the jackets.</li>
</ol>

<p>From my point of view, the ""something"" to be applied on the jackets must have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>must stick to the material of the jackets (I have no idea what they are made of);</li>
<li>must remain flexible at very low temperatures; I already encountered temperatures of -25C, so flexibility at -30C or lower is desired;</li>
<li>must not become sticky / fluid at higher temperatures; even if I do not wear them in the summer, the temperature in the wardrobe may go well about 25, not to speak about transportation, in case of a relocation, when temperatures in the trunk of the car (or wherever) may go in excess of 40C;</li>
<li>must not crack over time; i.e. must keep the proofing capabilities;</li>
<li>must not peel as a result of using, or as a result of machine washing;</li>
<li>ideally, if it cracks it can be repaired;</li>
<li>others; which?!</li>
</ul>

<p>I have in mind the following solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>some specialized spray; however, I think that they are not a long term solution, but more of a hack while in the middle of the trip;</li>
<li>diluted silicone;</li>
</ul>

<p>However, with diluted silicone I worry about:</p>

<ul>
<li>will it meet the criteria above? including the flexibility;</li>
<li>which variety of silicone it better suited?</li>
<li>fresh silicone does not (usually) stick to cured silicone;</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>So the bottom line questions would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Which substance should I use?</li>
<li>Is my planned technique good enough?</li>
<li>Is there anything better than I planned?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>I had several jackets in the past claiming that they will keep me dry in case of sweating. I always sweated inside those jackets and soaked in my own water a lot, the entire technology seeming to be mostly snake oil - so I do not care about claims of destroying non-working technologies.</p>

"Hacking a proximity card (Oyster card) for legal use","<p>I have the equivalent of an Oyster card (proximity based public transport card). </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kVpcN.jpg"" alt=""Oyster card""></p>

<p>I'm interested in having the information stored in another way so I don't have to carry around yet another card, perhaps stored on a ring or an NFC enabled smartphone. </p>

<p>Can this be done?</p>

<p>I know there are <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mclear/nfc-ring"" rel=""noreferrer"">NFC rings</a> and you can get NFC implantable chips, but can the information be removed from the Oyster card and transferred into the ring, smartphone or implant?</p>

"How to remove salt from salted pumpkin seeds","<p>I bought some shelled pumpkin seeds. I didn't notice that they were salted at the time of buying.</p>

<p>They taste unbearably salty and I want to remove salt from it completely if not to a substantial extent.</p>

<p>I tried soaking a few of them in water overnight but they tasted almost as salty the next day.</p>

<p>Is there are another way to remove the salt from it? I noticed that the salt is coated on the shells.</p>

<p>Is there some DIY osmosis setup that can be made?</p>

"When dining alone at a restaurant, how can you indicate you're coming back when temporarily leaving the table?","<p>I often dine alone at restaurants because I personally find it to be more convenient and tasty than preparing my own food. On occasion, though, I find that I have to temporarily leave the table in order to visit the restroom. Even though I might only be gone for a few minutes, if the timing hits just right, it can happen that my table has been cleared because the staff thought I was finished eating and was not planning to return. (One could also imagine having to take an emergency phone call, and going outside to do it so as not to annoy other diners.)</p>

<p>Generally, I am <em>mostly</em> finished eating by the time that the urge hits me, so it definitely looks like I have abandoned the remaining food on my plate&mdash;but I haven't! I plan to return and finish, just as soon as I take care of this emergency business.</p>

<p>The consequences of this happening include losing the uneaten food that remained on my plate (which seems like a waste to me, both financially and otherwise) and causing the restaurant staff to think that I've skipped the check (left without paying the bill). This results in awkwardness all the way around.</p>

<p>When you're dining with others, this is simple. They know your intention to return, so they can just tell someone who shows up and tries to clear the table. But when you're dining by yourself, the table looks abandoned, and there's no one to convey your intent.</p>

<p>What can I do to indicate to the restaurant staff (e.g., a busser responsible for cleaning tables) that I have only <em>temporarily</em> left, and that I plan to return and finish my food? How can I convey that I am still eating?</p>

<p>I've thought about leaving some personal effects on the table to indicate my plan to come back. Obviously this isn't foolproof&mdash;the restaurant staff could assume that I just forgot my personal effects&mdash;but a bigger problem is that someone else could steal them. For example, I could leave my phone, but there's a good chance that it won't be there when I return. I have tried leaving my credit card to convey both that I plan to return and that I haven't skipped out on the check, but that isn't ideal either, as someone could easily pick up my credit card and walk off with it while no one is watching.</p>

<p>Anyone have other suggestions on how to indicate this simply yet effectively?</p>
