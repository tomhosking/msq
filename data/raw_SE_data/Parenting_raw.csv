"How much should you tell your children about your sorrows and joys?","<p>I come from a house where no one talked about anything except paying electricity bills, rent, or studies.</p>

<p>I was never asked questions about myself, my social life, friends or lack of them etc. My parents never told me anything about their lives.</p>

<p>I want my child to share her sorrows and joys with me so I think I will have to start first by telling her about myself. This way I will set an example that it is normal to talk about your life to parents and vice versa.</p>

<p>At what age should this be started? What is the way to start this? What should and shouldn't I talk about?</p>

"How can a parent who is known by their child or teen not to be teetotal raise their offspring in sobriety?","<p>Individuals up to 18 yrs old (or 21 in some jurisdictions) are not supposed to drink alcoholic beverages. But it is an open secret that this obligation is being notoriously broken and convincing children to actually keep it is a great challenge for parents.</p>

<p>Can the very fact that a child knows their mother or father does occasionally have a drink prompt them to drink prematurely? Can this make it more difficult for such a parent to talk to their child once they find out the child was drinking prematurely?</p>

<p>I remember watching a TV show were a mother returning home with her quite young child found an unexpected party thrown for her there. And she did have one drink there, though somewhat grudgingly, for she was kind of irritated with this surprise party. Later the show humorously hinted the child got seriously drunk there.</p>

<p>This made me think, how could such a mother talk to her child after this party?</p>

<p>“But Mum, you were drinking this yourself!”</p>

<p>“I can, you can’t. Fine enough?”</p>

<p>I suppose such a dialogue isn’t going to be any helpful…</p>

<p>Or should parents of children of any age be teetotal to gain credibility while expecting their children not to drink?</p>

"Condoms in a care package: Parents advice","<p>Following <a href=""https://parenting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1135/condoms-in-care-packages-questions-about-sex"">a bit of advice in Meta</a>, I wanted to ask for the advice that parents who have this experience (or know who has) what is best.</p>

<p><em>I am strictly not looking for opinions about whether this is right or wrong.</em></p>

<p>I am in an organization that happens to be religious and we are doing care packages for our outgoing seniors to college.  A lot of food and toothbrushes and things have been collected, and that's awesome.</p>

<p>I've spoken to my pastor and she said not only was it fine by her, and knowing the congregation, I believe it should be no problem.</p>

<p>Setting aside that preface, my question is: *how best to do this <em>logistically</em> for the kids (who are now adults).  The care packages are going to be received by mail, will include all sorts of food and things, but I want to include condoms as my contribution.</p>

<p><strong>As parents, is there literature or packaging that should accompany these in the care packages?</strong>  These are going randomly to about 100 of our college students almost evenly split gender.</p>

<p>Caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enough food and clothing has been collected</li>
<li>They don't expire until 2019</li>
<li>The recipients will be both adult men and women <em>and I'm concerned about any embarrassment when the packages are opened around peers</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>What, from a parent's personal experience, is the best way to include condoms in a college care package?  Instructions?  Put them in an envelope to avoid initial embarrassment? Do you think they would like instructions (condoms come with them and I can copy them and include it).  <strong>This question is not about whether it should be done (that has been established), it is about best logistics &amp; packaging,</strong> and your experience as a parent on this.</p>

"How to deal with a one year old who resists sitting in shopping cart?","<p>We have an 11-month-old boy who is very mobile (has been walking since 9 months) and now loves to play, run around, and climb on things. One problem we have is that when we're in the grocery store, he'll usually sit calmly in the cart at first but his state eventually deteriorates and he desperately wants to be unbuckled so that he can run around. We've tried to keep him preoccupied with food or toys, and it helps, but it usually doesn't last long.</p>

<p>We've started (perhaps mistakenly) to let him out and push the cart around in the store. (He also loves pushing his stroller around at the park or anything that has wheels really). It works for a while in terms of us being able to continue shopping, but eventually he gets bored and wants to run all over the store. This, of course, is not conducive to shopping, and he doesn't follow us around much; he just wants to run (i.e. top speed/max distance run). He really resists being put back into the cart (e.g., screams, flails, etc... an early tantrum maybe?). </p>

<p>Before taking him to the store we've tried making sure he </p>

<ol>
<li>is not hungry</li>
<li>has recently woken up from a nap</li>
<li>yet has had some time to run around at home for a bit</li>
<li>and has access to toys and things to distract him.</li>
</ol>

<p>He shows similar behavior after being in his high chair for a while. Once he is done eating, he tries to get out of the seat, flails, and screams. We've tried teaching him some sign language (e.g., ""all done"") but he doesn't understand that this will get him out of his high chair much easier than screaming. Generally, it seems like he doesn't like to be restrained. He will sit in a stroller calmly for a while, but it's obvious that he really just wants to walk. Other than this problem, he is mostly very happy (e.g., smiles and laughs a lot, loves to play with us, be around other kids, etc.).</p>

<p>It seems like most questions and other internet resources on tantrums are geared toward toddlers, specifically 2-3 year olds. There's not much on one year olds, and the issues seems to be different. E.g., our son isn't upset that we're not buying him a toy or a candy bar, he just wants to walk around.</p>

If you do not sit on the steps, you will have to stay in the house for the rest of the day, three more hours. Ten minutes is shorter than 3 h.” With younger children, some parents have drawn timelines for the child to illustrate, for example, <strong>how 10 min is shorter than 3 h</strong>.</p>

<p>I've also seen that a 4 year old I know cannot grasp what 1 hour (or any amount of time for that matter) means <em>for him</em>. Yes, the hour hand moves from one number to another, but how long does it take to do that? Even adults sometimes lose track of time, and 1 hour may sometimes seem much longer or much shorter, but we have a basic understanding or expectation of what 1 hour feels like. We wouldn't look at the clock to see if 1 hour has passed yet, after just 2 minutes.</p>

"Getting out of rewards for what kid does","<p>My 6-year old, 1st grade son started taking some language classes past August. This is a language we speak about 50% of the time home. These classes are pretty tough, teach reading, writing and speaking. The kid sees very little point in learning the language (especially reading and writing), as family and friends can speak to him in English. Still, he is doing pretty well in it, and I am confidant that he will move on to the next (intermediate) level.</p>

<p>However, to kick start the learning (back in August), I told him that he'll get a Xbox if he successfully finishes this year. My sense is that he is putting in the effort for the Xbox. </p>

"How long should a 3 year old be sent to his room?","<p>Our son is almost 3 years old and he's been getting worse about talking back and not obeying our directions (such as ""put on your shoes"" or ""pick up your toys"").  We're thinking about implementing John Rosemond's ticket system where he gets 5 tickets per day and after he loses them all for 5 misbehaviors, he is sent to his room for the rest of his day.  The thing we're not sure about is whether is this an appropriate length punishment for an almost 3-year-old.</p>

<p>So my question is: Is an entire day too long for a 3-year-old to be sent to his room?  If so, what is a more appropriate length of time?</p>

<p>We were leaning towards starting with a 1 hour room punishment after losing 5 tickets.  And after that time is up, he gets 3 tickets back.  Subsequent loss of all tickets would result in perhaps a 2 hour timeout.  This is starting to seem a little too complicated, however.  Thoughts?</p>

"Making isolation not feel like a punishment","<p>My six year-old son is very extroverted, and prefers to play <em>with</em> someone.  My three year-old daughter is strong-willed but introverted, and prefers to play on her own.  When they play together, my son is very controlling trying to maintain my daughter's participation in his activity of choice, which inevitably leads to conflicts.  We are working on teaching him more sociable ways to play, but the bottom line is that in the mean time, playing together is very stressful on my daughter, and playing apart is very difficult for my son.</p>

<p>We give him several chances to make it work in the same room, but after that we usually end up making him play in his room for a while.  This gives respite to my daughter, but my son perceives it as a punishment.  To a certain degree, that's okay, since he is the instigator and the one invading his sister's space.  However, giving my daughter enough alone time makes my son's perceived punishment too harsh, but reducing the time apart to make the punishment reasonable doesn't give my daughter enough alone time.</p>

"How to ensure that necessary things get done when time is short?","<p>My question is based on the following assumptions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think that children learn by their success, if a certain behavior ""works"" to get what they want or not.</p></li>

</ol>

<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Often the child does not want to do what it is supposed to, maybe as it wants the freedom to decide itself what do to at what time.  </p>

<p>This is not possible however, if there is not enough time to wait, e. g. in the morning if we have to go to nursery school to be there on time.</p>

<p><em>Recent example:</em><br>
Our son (3.5 years) does not want to brush his teeth and we only have some minutes left until we have to leave.  </p>

<p>While I think that we're well equipped to explain to him what is and is not acceptable language, it will likely be a while before he is able to make that distinction.  While I generally consider profanity to be ""just words"", we'd rather avoid having issues with other parents or teachers.</p>

<p>What can my wife and I do to avoid our son picking up some of our more colorful vocabulary?</p>

<p>Slip ups will happen from time to time, at least until we can get used to the new restrictions.  How can we mitigate the damage of any lapses?  Are there any general strategies that can demonstrate proper behavior without causing confusion along the lines of ""do what we say, not what we do""?</p>

"Should I be concerned about my daughter's behavior (or my wife's)? Trying to co-parent","<p>For reference, please see my <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/30596/my-3-year-old-daughter-who-lives-with-my-ex-wife-put-me-in-time-out-in-a-dark"">previous question</a>.</p>

<p>As a newly divorced father I have worries and I am not sure if I am making too much out of them or worrying about nothing. Getting some sleep at night would be nice as this weighs on my conscience every night.</p>

<p>To start, maybe not applicable to the conversion but worth noting my ex-wife does work, and has been on and off Prozac (currently back on for the last 2 years) and I have been noticing some strange behavior. Telling me something that did not happen, accusing me of not telling her stuff that did not happen, accusing me of losing or taking something my daughter had that she did not have.</p>

<p>Whenever I pick my daughter (now 4) up, her eyes always seem puffy like she has been crying or tired.</p>

<p>I see her once a month for the weekend.</p>

<p>I don't really notice any strangeness when she is with me, happy go lucky 4-year-old, likes to color, go to the park, go on walks, watch some TV, eat. I can tell you getting her to bed is a challenge, she is constantly up and down, drink, bathroom, more drink, story, bathroom again, before the end of the night you feel like you negotiated a peace treaty.</p>

<p>For the past year, every time I have to drop my daughter off, she cries as soon as we hit the street she lives on, sometimes it's just whining, sometimes crocodile tears, when I do drop her off, she will not shy away from her mother, doesn't really run to her, but is not in any sign of distress when she grabs her and carries her inside. A couple of times she has stood by car and cried and my ex had to come grab her.</p>

<p>The relationship between me and my ex-wife is stranded to say the least, she is constantly trying to trick me into signing stuff (sign off my rights, defaulting on the divorce, telling me she doesn't have a lawyer so I don't need one, etc.) </p>

<p>Based on what is given here should I be worried about anything? Not wanting this to turn into a wall of text, yes it is more a gut feeling that something is wrong, couple of things that stands out:</p>

<p>She doesn't want to go home and of course the crying when she has to.</p>

<p>When her mother does Skype with her when she is with me, my daughter does not want to talk and will run from the phone. I Skype with my daughter every Wednesday and as soon as she sees me she smiles and I try to talk to her but usually every time my daughter asks ""When are you going to come pick me up?""</p>

<p>I do discipline my daughter, maybe not the same way my ex-wife does or for the same things and my ex-wife tells me nothing on how when or where to do so.</p>

<p>I do not want to call Child Protective Services (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Protective_Services"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CPS</a>) I think that's maybe a little more drastic than what the situation calls for and I am not trying to make my relationship any worse with the ex. I am just wondering what if anything can be done? When I ask or question my ex about anything it will usually turn into a fight and gets nowhere and getting any info out of her about what she does in a given situation usually leads to ""You are the father figure it out"".</p>

"How can I make my preschool child brush his teeth, and similar mandatory tasks?","<p>Most tasks and chores can be taught by letting the child experience consequences, because those consequences are mostly immediate and direct (e.g. <em>not</em> going to the playground if the child won't put on shoes). That's <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/2892/109"">discussed in this question</a>.</p>

<p><strong>But some tasks are mandatory</strong> (like brushing the teeth in the morning, or other personal hygiene), but the negative consequence is neither immediate nor direct (e.g. possibly cavities after some months) and there might not be opportunity for removal of privileges before an extended separation from the parent (e.g. about to go to day care).</p>

"How do you gauge if a show, movie or story may be too frightening for your child?","<p>My 2-and-a-half year old seems to be fond of shows that I would have expected to be too scary for someone his age.  He loves to watch <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps_%28TV_series%29"" rel=""nofollow"">R.L. Stine's <em>Goosebumps</em></a> (he was introduced to it at daycare by some of the older children), and gleefully watches some rather rough scenes of predation on nature shows and short youtube clips.</p>

<p>Not once has he ever showed signs of nightmares from watching this sort of stuff (although we try to keep viewing restricted to at least several hours before bedtime).</p>

<p>However, there clearly is a line for him, and he seems fully aware of it.  There have been some things we've watched where he says it is too scary, and asks to watch something different.</p>

<p>I'd rather not expose him to stuff that he considers too scary, even if he is good about telling me if something is too much.</p>

<p>Since that line between ""fun scary"" and ""too scary"" varies wildly from child to child (we have a 4 year old cousin, for example, who finds the music from <em>Thomas and Friends</em> too scary), how do you identify where the line is for a particular child?</p>

<p>Just because we haven't had problems with nightmares yet doesn't mean it can't become an issue.  I'd like to </p>

"How concerned should I be about husband's anger display around baby?","<p>My husband got angry at me during an argument yesterday and threw his keyboard (in shattered) and ripped down the whiteboard (may have thrown it, I don't know. We had left the room) on the wall and raged a bit more (I heard a few bangs, but doesn't appear to be more damage). I was holding my 9 month old (who screamed), but left the room and closed the door. I was a bit scared and I know my son was, but likely from reading my reaction. I calmly reassured him and played with him alone in the other room and he bounced back quickly, but it alarmed me.</p>

<p>Before baby, nothing like this had happened. About 6 months ago, husband threw and shattered a mug in anger during an argument, though.</p>

<p>I don't know how concerned I should be. Keeping my son safe is obviously my #1 priority.</p>

<p>I know he would not intentionally hurt either of us, but the display of rage is intimidating and frightening.</p>

<p>I am seeking professional help to try to help with my part of the communication problem. In this case, we had a disagreement and he started stonewalling, which is his usual. I normally can just let it go and let him cool off (sometimes takes a day or two), but yesterday, I was just tired of  like my concerns were being rug swept, and I kept on talking and  really raise my voice.  I know I need to work on my tone with him, because obviously, it triggers something for him, but I also know it is 100% his responsibility how he handles his anger when triggered. To me, throwing things seems like an unacceptable display of rage, particularly in front of the baby.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I was feeling triggered by his stonewalling and raised my voice. I know that was my responsibility, and when he told me to pause, I should have listened. Like I said, I am seeking therapy to learn how I can catch myself before raising my voice. I know I had a major part in the argument and it was disrespectful of me to continue talking, even when he was telling me to pause, as he clearly needed some time to cool off. And I also think raising my voice was probably inappropriate in front of the baby. But I feel like throwing stuff is over the line. I need some perspective. </p>

<p>In my family, we raised our voices, but never threw anything. I can't imagine that ever being acceptable in my family, and I would be ashamed to tell my family that my husband has done this and that I have stayed.</p>

<p>I think for him, raising voice must be a big trigger. I'll try to remember for the future. He was verbally and physically abused as a child and especially teen.</p>

<p>I've asked repeatedly for us to go to therapy and he refuses. I think we had some problems with communication before baby (me having a tendency to want to hash out the argument and quickly get through it, him straight up stonewalling on most disagreements), but baby has really highlighted it and made it much worse.</p>

<p>How concerned should I be? Now that baby is in the picture, he has often told me to shut up and called me stupid, called me a bitch Or told me to stop bitching (neither are acceptable to me, and my family would never have treated each other that way), and these two incidents of throwing things. When I talk to him calmly later about the names and the shut ups, he says it doesn't seem like a big deal to him. I haven't brought up the throwing stuff, but my guess is he will try to say it is my fault for continuing to talk/argue when he told me he wanted to stop (again, I realize I should have stopped, but I think he should have gone for a walk or something, anything, rather than fly into a scary rage like that).</p>

<p>I'm just concerned about our son seeing this as he grows. I was scared (I don't think he would intentionally hurt either of us, but I know plenty of people say that and end up in horrible situations...my sense is it would never be intentional, but it is intimidating...made me feel like I had no choice to shut up and get away so as not to be hurt by some random debris from his rage). </p>

<p>I don't want my son to grow up thinking it's ok to call names or throw things in anger. If husband won't seek help, is there any way he will get better, though?</p>

<p>I already am just like, well I 100% can never have an argument with him in front of our child again...which I think is unrealistic. My next thought it, well, I have to work really hard to own my way of handling the anger and work on healthy expression.  But it is like eggshells sometimes. He gets so moody, cranky and down right snappy with me about little things (not being able to tell him exactly which pocket the keys are in in the diaper bag, for example), and it feels quite disrespectful. At the same time, he seems overly concerned about me not showing him respect. As best I can tell, he interprets certain tones as disrespectful (i.e.:yesterday I was worried and he took it as being condescending, which started the argument), and seems to interpret any disagreement as disrespectful. I'm a smart woman, and if I disagree, I want to be able to tell him. I obviously need to consider my tone (it must be coming off differently than I intend), but I just feed like there are some big double standards on his part.</p>

<p>It's been a stressful year. Sorry for the long post. Can anyone offer any perspective/insight? Is my olnly option to end if? Am I blame shifting? He is a fantastic father otherwise and a pretty decent partner a good potion of the time. I want to believe we can work through this, but the blame-shifting, demonstration of rage and refusal to go to counseling with me have me worried. I want to do what is best for my baby. </p>

"Do babies want to be carried in order to develop their eyes?","<p>There have been a lot of questions on this site regarding the phenomenon of a baby needing to be not only held, but carried.</p>

<p>In my specific situation (7 weeks old baby), my baby wants to be held, in a stomach down position and carried around (simply holding is not enough, neither is carrying in another position).</p>

<p>I have read some research on the topic and have concluded the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>When trouble is afoot and you need to get away quick a crying baby can be a liability. Hence evolution selected for babies, which keep cool, when the mother moves it from A to B.</li>
<li>The baby is programmed in a way, that it is not enough to just hold it, you need to be moving while holding, for the instinct to kick in. This is a distinct feature. For example in cats, you only need to hold them by the scruff for the same feature to kick in.</li>
</ol>

<p>However I think there might be another factor: Boredom. Since my baby wants to be 1) held 2) on its stomach (which gives it a good view) and 3) moving (changing scenery) boredom must be playing a factor here as well? Maybe babies, who are just developing their eyes, need to be carried in order to train their eyes?</p>

<p>Is there any research backing or disproving this?</p>

"Are fidgets an effective tool for helping ADHD children focus?","<p><em>Fidgets</em> are small toys or gadgets that can be twiddled, poked, and/or clicked.

"Questions about ""Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids""","<p>I just heard about <em>Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids</em> by Dr. Laura Markham (on this site) and I started looking into it. I really like some of the things I've read about this approach to parenting, but I have some questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does Dr. Markham actually recommend rewarding misbehavior? I can't find it now, but I read a customer review on Amazon that said something to the effect of ""My life is so much better now. When my son hits my daughter, I just hug him and tell him I love him."" I don't see how this could possibly reduce misbehavior. If anything, basic psychology says you can expect the misbehavior to increase.</p></li>
<li><p>Does Dr. Markham really say you should turn behavior problems into games?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In one example, a child wants the parent to move from a particular spot on the couch and the parent is supposed to make fun and games with the child... but not move from the spot... Another example is about spitting, instead of consequences for spitting in the house the solution was to take the child outside to make a game of spitting out there. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/review/R398NFJKYLAJR0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0399160280"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(source)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems impractical to me. I barely have the energy to get my kid a drink, let alone take him outside for spitting contest. Also, I think this could lead to problems at school where it's just not possible to make games out of everything, or when I'm in the middle of something and can't.</p></li>

"How to deal with an 11-month-old child crying during/after eating?","<p>My 11-month-old son has so far always been a good eater, although he has often had a habit of crying when his milk was finished, or at the end of meals. This has generally been ok to deal with.</p>

<p>However recently in the last few days he has been having a sudden full meltdown mid food, with angry crying and throwing himself around in his chair (worse than his typical end of meal crying, which is a lot more manageable). It's generally been food that he likes (and he may resume eating it once calmed down) - Is this probably down to teething, or could it be related to anything else? (it's noticeable that he doesn't seem to do this when eating yoghurt - which is one of his favourite foods).</p>

<p>He only has milk at start of the day (and occasionally on evenings) - he has rarely got upset mid bottle (not recently). He has got angry with similar consistency to yoghurt foods (such as mashed potatoes). He has only 7 teeth so we try not to give him anything that requires too much chewing.</p>

<p>Have other people experienced this and do you have any advice for dealing with this issue? It's happened 3 days in a row now. The other point to note is that we were away visiting relatives on the weekend, and he's been doing this since we have come back, could this also be related to the issue?</p>

<p>Update Edit:   I think it was teething, it did seem to go away again.   I found if he kicked off too badly, I would take him out of his chair and calm him down, then once calm again, he would go back to eating if he still was hungry.   </p>

"Should we get her a doll?","<p>Winter is coming, and with it, Christmas and presents.  We have a 3 years old daughter, who has an almost 2 months old sister, and it's time thinking about which toys to get her (we have almost full control, since we have to choose for presents from grandparents as well).</p>

<p>In particular, we are wondering about the benefits of dolls.</p>

<p>Currently she has neither dolls nor tea parties (she has tons of cuddly toys though).  When she wants to play tea parties, either she gets actual dishes or she uses objects or toys which look like dishes (or not…).  As for dolls, yesterday she took a jar of pickles, named it as her newborn sister, and used toilet paper to dress it.</p>

<p>It seems like not having a doll or tea parties would help developing imagination.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can see she tries to identify as her mother and she'd probably like to have a doll which she could dress and play parent with.</p>

<p><strong>So, I'm wondering about the implications of realistic toys versus ""hijacked toys"".  What would be the benefits of having a doll against having her <em>making</em> a doll of whatever she can find ?  Should we get her one ?</strong></p>

<p>I'm wondering about the implications of realistic toys versus ""hijacked toys"".**</p>

<h2>Side notes :</h2>

<p>I won't buy her a doll just <em>because she's a girl</em>, because I don't want to enforce gender stereotypes.  I'll buy her one if I think it's beneficial to her mind.  <strong>But gender stereotypes are not the point of my question.</strong>  Answers addressing primarily this issue are off-topic.</p>

<p>In addition, she goes to school, but currently she doesn't have much out of school interactions with other children so we're not much concerned about her being jealous of other children toys.</p>

"Why would my 9-week-old refuse to nurse from breast?","<p>My 9-week-old has recently started to refuse to nurse from the breast. She will only eat from the bottle (pumped breastmilk). </p>

<p>She has successfully breastfed since birth, she also uses the bottle rarely, just on the occasions when her mother is away.</p>

<p>The breast is not too full for her to latch on. She drinks the milk perfectly fine from a heated bottle. </p>

<p>When we try to put her to the breast, she moves her head away and cries and won't latch on at all. But then, she will accept breastmilk from the bottle with no problem at all. </p>

"How will a child learn to express themselves in the absence of verbal communication?","<p>I'm curious to understand - if you don't teach a child how to speak then will the child develop a new language to express itself?</p>

<p>When a newborn is brought into the family everyone wants to look at it, talk to it, play with it, etc. The child learns by constantly observing, processing and reacting, and children have a very adaptable mind. Unlike adults they pick up things faster because their minds aren't subject to inertia.</p>

<p>So if you play with a child, smile, laugh and take care of it well, but never talk to it then how will it learn to express itself? I know that talking to a child is very important - mothers talk to their children to make them feel safe, and sing lullabies to make them fall asleep. Nevertheless, assuming that everything else remains the same what will the child learn in the absence of verbal communication?</p>

"How can we get some free time (on daily basis)?","<p>I'm a working dad of a 3 m/o boy. My wife is on a leave and she will be a 'full time mom' for several more months. The newborn changed our lives to an extent that we don't have free time, at all (yeah, that must be a news for all of you in 'already parents' category, right?). Our baby boy needs/wants constant care and physical contact, even while sleeping (otherwise he'll wake up screaming, demanding another round of 'rocking'). When I get back from work I start taking care of him while my wife starts doing chores. Most of the time we have to take shifts to eat or go to the bathroom. At the point I managed to put him to sleep, my wife is already sleeping, I'm near the melt down point and have no more energies to do anything else. If I have some fuel left in me, well, than I have to do my part of chores.</p>

<p>To sum it up, at the end of the day, we feel exausted, miserable and grumpy. In our previous life we had a lot of free time for our hobbies/passions and it's so hard not to 'blame' the kid for it. </p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grandparents or a nanny are not a viable option.  </li>
<li>I said 'blame' just to express the feeling of weariness, we wanted to have a baby and we're doing our best to take care of its needs and putting all our love and energy into it. </li>
<li>The baby is healthy, it just doesn't sleep more than 12h/day (and at night sleeps max 3h before waking up to get breastfed)</li>

"How can my toddler learn to stay under the blanket at night?","<p>My 2yo son slept in a sleeping bag (see image below) until around 1½ years old, then he didn't like that anymore so we switched to using a blanket. He moves around so much while sleeping that the blanket usually isn't covering him at all. This hasn't been a problem so far during summer, but now the cold season is coming and we think he'll get too cold at night. He's already rather cold in the mornings -- with cold hands and cold feet -- so the current mode of operation won't do.</p>

<p>We're not tucking him in ""English style"" with the blanket going under the mattress, but average ""European style"" where it's just draped over him. He's very active and dislikes being restrained, so ""English style"" is not an option.</p>

<p>I've learned to stay underneath my blanket during sleep, but I have no recollection how I learned it -- can we somehow ""teach"" him, or does it only come naturally with age? <strong>How can we keep him under the blanket?</strong> </p>

<p>What we're already trying:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We are re-covering him several times during the evening until we go to bed ourselves, and sometimes again during the night if we're up for any reason. </p></li>
<li><p>We are dressing him in warmer pajamas and socks to keep him from getting cold at night, but we can't comfortably dress him warm enough in winter. If we dress him warmly (so that he wouldn't become too cold without the blanket) then the blanket makes him too warm and he wakes in a sweat, so we avoid that.</p></li>
<li><p>We are trying to find a sleeping bag that fits his current size (92cm) but seem to be rare in these sizes; apparently they're only popular for infants but not so for toddlers. Even if we find one, there's a risk that he'll reject it, just like he ended up doing half a year ago.</p></li>

"How long do children normally read without comprehending?","<p>My son is six years old, nearly finished with his first year of school.  He reads pretty well, on par with his age I believe.  What concerns me is he has difficulty answering basic questions about a sentence immediately after he reads it.</p>

<p>For example, ""On his bed was a cuddly teddy bear.""  If I ask what was on his bed, he can't answer without re-reading it, then he answers in his halting reading voice, even though he knows perfectly well what a teddy bear is.  It's like he reads the words without connecting them to the real world objects.</p>

"How do I get my child to eat healthier, better and more varied?","<p>I have a ten-year old child and it's about that time in their lives when she is constantly getting invited to stay over at other friends' houses either for the weekend or a night. To be honest, as a single dad, this can be a huge relief and allows me to get some work done over the weekend, so I am generally OK with her staying over at her friends'.</p>

<p>However, there's a problem: she is a very picky eater. She doesn't eat vegetables and a lot of other stuff people generally eat (no sauces, no soups, nothing with a particular strong smell). This results in a lot of anxiety for her and for me. She is ashamed to admit she ""doesn't like stuff"" for the fear of seeming spoilt (which she is to an extent, I raised her on my own and cater to her every desire). I don't like her to feel this way.</p>

Should I talk to her friends' parents and tell them to brace themselves to host a particularly picky eater?
Should I force diversity into her weekly diet so she gets used to variety?
Should I talk to her friends?</p>

"Should I cancel child support?","<p>I'm the father of an 11-year-old boy. I've had custody since he was ~1 1/2. His mom does not have her life together and probably never will. I was a single father at the time but have since remarried. His mother has been paying support (albeit about 30% of the court recommended amount) since then, but has been unemployed for over a year now, and her unemployment has now ran out. She's asking me to cancel the support order and forgive arrears for the past 2 months so she doesn't go to jail.</p>

<p>My initial reaction is that it's her problem, not mine. She is a constant source of stress in our lives, and the life of my wife of the past 4 years: frequently being selfish and causing all sorts of problems. I would not consider her a good influence in his life at all, but she <em>is</em> his mother. I can live without the money; it wasn't that much anyhow, but every bit counts. </p>

<p>I feel like this would be awful for my son though, and I can only imagine that she'll make it clear to him that she got in trouble not because of any fault of her own, but because I refused to cancel the court order. </p>

<p>What are my options here? Should I insist she give up legal rights if I cancel it, so I can at least have a silver lining of not being legally required to deal with her more problematic outbursts? Should I just leave support in place and let her deal with her own mess? </p>

"Breaking 5 year olds tantrums","<p>My 5 year old son has recently got into the habit of getting into these incredibly annoying tantrums. They start when he doesn't get his way and can often rumble on over a couple of hours. They usually peak at bedtime.</p>

<p>When it occurs he doesn't do anything. He lays on the floor and says ""nothing"" when you ask him to do something. After a while mixes this up with raspberry-blowing spitting and saying the word ""poo"".</p>

<p>I start off being over nice, attempting to coax him out of his tantrum. I make some jokes to try to get him to smile. I offer to help him do things. Ask if he wants to pick a bedtime story etc.</p>

<p>This practically never works.</p>

<p>I then get frustrated and shout. This usually lasts about 10 seconds. He cries and says he doesn't like me.</p>

<p>I become calm again but I have a child who won't go to bed. At this point I put him to bed. I pull him up. I then hold his hand and steer (encouragingly pull) him towards the bathroom, I ask him to do everything that is expected off him. He doesn't. I sit him on the toilet. I wash his hands. I gently edge him towards his bedroom and get him into his pyjamas while he continues to say ""nothing"".</p>

<p>During this process he protests a little bit but I am not aggressive. He isn't being dragged along the floor. He doesn't like it but does reluctantly comply. He does edge a foot up about 3cm from the floor so I can slide on his pj's etc.</p>

<p>I hate doing this final step. It isn't right but if I don't, if I leave him outside his room he will sit there and start saying words he knows he is not allowed to say. We once left him for 45 minutes and he laid there contently running through the list of things he is not allowed to do.</p>

<p>What am I supposed to do? We have taken away his treats the next day but doesn't seem to do anything.</p>

<p>Has anyone else dealt with this behaviour? Does anyone have any advice?
Just want to add. 70% of the time he is well behaved. 25% of the time he is a bit silly. This is like 5% of the time where he seems to get into the mindset where he doesn't want to comply with anything and wants to try to press to buttons.</p>

"How can I convince my parents to accept my approach on school?","<p>I'm a 16 year-old junior in high school. I often spar with my parents over the fact that I'm failing many classes. The issue, however, is not that I do not understand the material; it's that ""failing"" is simply my approach to passing.</p>

<p>I tend to get high 70s to low 90s in the first quarter of each semester without having to study, pay attention in class, or even do the work. Then, in the second quarter (which usually comes with more ""difficult"" work), I can exert <em>about</em> the same level of effort and pass the class.</p>

<p>For example, in class #1, I earned a 77 in the first quarter. Therefore, I only need to earn a 63 in the second quarter to pass.</p>

<pre><code>77 + 63 = 140
140 / 2 = 70
</code></pre>

<p>Often, I sit in class programming on my laptop while listening to music. When this is not an option (because of a strict teacher, etc.), I generally write down math problems to solve, or zone out.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm a fairly knowledgeable guy, IMHO, and I know <em>most</em> of the things that my high school teachers (public school) are teaching. My standardized test scores have always been pretty good for my age (for example, I took the ACT at age 12, and got a 26). I may or may not go to college (I want to be a computer programmer), but if I do decide I want to, I will apply for scholarships that are based solely on ACT scores (planning to take it this spring).</p>

<hr>

<p>My parents have different goals for me. They feel that I should have a 90 or above in every class (they've lightened up from 95 to 90), and to get a full ride to college. They constantly push for me to do more than expected (often bribing me, or threatening to take away my things if I don't comply).</p>

<p>I've had a discussion with them before about possibly not attending college and instead going straight to the work force, and they seemed quite disappointed. They said many things like: ""it's so sad that you think that"", and other demeaning things along those lines.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not trying to spill my whole education history online, but I thought some background information might be helpful.</p>

<p>My real question is: <strong>How can I get my parents to accept that I'm only trying to pass (that I will, in fact, pass), and that I'd like to spend my time doing harder/better things?</strong></p>

<p>They often tell me that I'm smart, but they are constantly pushing me to get better grades, or get onto me for having sub-par grades (by their definition). This trend has occurred throughout my life, even when I was younger when they would require I read <code>x</code> number of chapters or for <code>x</code> number of hours to earn time on a computer or watching TV.</p>

<p>I'll be 17 soon, and I believe I'm being treated like a young child. How can I get them to treat me like the age I am? Also, I feel like they rarely hear me out when I disagree with their way of thinking. How can I even start this conversation without them immediately shutting it down?</p>

"How to react to an eleven-year-old sneaking out at night to look at the stars?","<p>During the holidays, two kids from two families that we are friends with snuck out at night to look at the stars.

<p>The boys didn't do anything ""wrong"", that is, they didn't steal, destroy, or take drugs. They just wanted to see the night sky (and some falling stars), and did that alone when their parents weren't too enthusiastic about a night without sleep (they have younger children who don't yet sleep through and value a good night's sleep highly). But of course getting out at night might be dangerous for kids of that age (although I cannot quite imagine them getting mugged or abducted).</p>

<p>Is it appropriate for children that age to be that independent? Or should the understand that they at least have to tell their parents first? And what is the best way to tell them? On the one hand I feel that the anger of the one mother would certainly instill a feeling of not doing something like that again in her son, while the bemused and relaxed explanation of the other parents might show their son that he can basically do whatever he wants and his parents will be okay with it.</p>

<p>The whole school community was abuzz with this news, and everybody knew of the incident by that evening. All except my friend, that is. Her daughter didn't say a word to her parents, even though they asked her how school was, like they always do. She was sullen though, but at the time, it didn't seem suspicious. Later that night, my friend learned about the whole thing directly from the victim child's mother, and was rightfully shocked. That something like this happened, and more so that her daughter witnessed all this and never said a word.</p>

<p>Now how my friend handled that with her daughter is not really ideal. She <strong>demanded</strong> to know why she had been kept in the dark about all this, and how <strong>she</strong> was embarrassed that she was clueless when the parent talked to her. She probably thought this was under the umbrella problem of her daughter just not talking to her a lot these days. Her daughter just kept quiet and said ""well, [my friend] didn't want to tell her parents either&hellip;"" Now that my friend has had the time to reflect, and talk it out with me, she feels that may be it was too traumatic for her daughter to repeat or re-live, and that's why she didn't say anything.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it the fear of re-living the trauma that kept the child quiet? Something else? How can my friend ask her daughter, and get her to talk about this? Should she even try to get her to talk about it?</li>
<li>My friend obviously did not react well when she found out about the incident. How should she make up for it to her daughter?</li>
</ol>

<p>Some updates based on the responses here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The mother wanted her daughter to tell her about this because

<ol>
<li>As a parent, she wants to be in the loop when something major and especially disturbing like this happens at school. This has the potential to affect her daughter directly or indirectly. and</li>
<li>She's worried the victim's mom may have felt that she and her daughter don't care enough for her son to discuss what happened to him. (I don't really get this part myself. But the two moms <em>are</em> close-ish, so figure what you will.) It was not about missing out on gossip. and possibly</li>
<li>Other children told their parents, why didn't her daughter tell her?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The daughter is most definitely not frightened of her mom. There may be a disconnect between them though. The mom does over-react a bit at times.</li>
<li>The daughter is not afraid of the teacher who lashed out; nobody is. He is an erratic guy, who lost control with a student and got himself fired and sued. He's not a malevolent authority figure to be afraid of.</li>

"How to help my 18-year-old who may be the victim of bullying?","<p>My 18-year-old son is in high school and near graduating; like 40 days from now he will graduate. He is so smart and into business and science and gets top grades so I am thankful. He is so respectful to me and his mother and to all the elders. Before this, my son was in a different country, so he had a different culture and way of making friends; now it is different and he just doesn't like the type of people here. </p>

<p>Two months ago, he found a group of friends and he's been hanging around with them now, he went out with them like six times now and stopped all of the sudden, when we asked him he said that ""I don't like the type of people here"". They weren't really his friends, they just let him sit with them talk to him about school and that's it. They don't go out or anything like that. He is not depressed or sad, he just likes to be alone. I know that that's normal to be alone. Heck I like to be alone sometimes, just so I can gather myself.</p>

<p>Now, two weeks ago he started complaining about this kid who has a mental disability. That kid just goes around the school and keeps swearing at everyone, but for some reason he found that my son gets angry real quick and so he just started to push the limits until my son hit him, the school were so shocked of my son's actions that they forgave him because they know that he is good.</p>

<p>After he hit him, he regretted it. Yet, that boy still keeps coming back and just saying the same mean things. My son came to me today and was just so angry because that boy called his mother a bad word. He said ""He can say anything at me and I won't get mad, but not at my family""</p>

<p>We keep telling him to ignore him, and that he will just go away, but I think that he is displaying his anger which is what the boy wants out of him so he just pushes. I think it's his new friends that are bringing him trouble because he tried to say that once but didn't finish what he was saying.</p>

<p>What should I or we do as parents? Is it right that he should just ignore him because there is only 40 days until graduation?</p>

"Assertiveness for 6-year-olds","<p>So our 6-year-old daughter is quite a sensitive person and she finds it difficult when the other kids at school argue with her (or even with each other).</p>

<p>We're normally quite a quiet family. We wouldn't normally shout unless something was really wrong. So she has trouble laughing it off when other kids shout at her at school - to her it's really upsetting.</p>

<p>Of course this is all part of normal life, I want to help her learn to cope with it.</p>

<p>I think what she needs to come up with is an assertive response, rather than bursting into tears. She tries to stop herself but she doesn't have much success.</p>

<p>Can anyone recommend resources - maybe a book or DVD? - that might be helpful? Or other recommendations for ways we could help her to cope?</p>

<p>We've tried role-playing with me / her mum playing the part of the other child, but she finds even that too upsetting.</p>

<p>She's not being bullied - this doesn't happen very often, and it's the kind of thing which many other kids her age would laugh off or even enjoy and treat as a game. I want to help her understand that she doesn't have to treat it as the end of the world when someone else has a cross tone of voice - they might not mean it (with her classmates, usually they don't mean it) and even if they do mean it, I want her to learn to be a bit more thick-skinned, because I think that would make her feel happier.</p>

"Have you experienced shaming of motherhood and how did you cope with it?","<p>It seems common for people to have negative opinions or even attack women who embrace the very important role of being a mother. </p>

<p>As someone whose own mother is a successful professional, I fully support any woman who chooses that. So I would like to avoid discussing the rights which women already have in western nations. But it seems to have developed into an socially conceded axiom that women must prefer pursuing a career path over being a stay at home mother. There is a social stigma surrounding it and sometimes if you speak positively in appreciation of the importance of a mother's role in her child's development, people are quick to accuse you of degrading women. If you're a stay at home mom or endeavor to be one, people seem very quick to suggest that you pursue a career and almost militantly attack any suggestion that you might have a fulfilling life as a stay at home mother that will benefit your family. Sometimes this is extended beyond being a stay at home mother to treating motherhood itself as if it is morally wrong.</p>

<p>So this is for moms, especially stay at home moms, have you experienced such things? <strong>Are there social barriers and have they led to more tangible barriers in the way of being a stay at home mother or even just as a mother? Did this affect your decision to be a stay at home mother or not?</strong></p>

<p>I realize that this can be a sensitive issue and there are some mothers <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/12147/how-to-help-my-wife-cope-w-being-a-stay-at-home-mom"">struggling to cope</a> with being a stay at home mom and then there are many cases of <a href=""https://www.babycenter.com/400_how-can-i-afford-to-stay-home-with-my-baby_500584_1.bc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mothers who would absolutely love to stay at home</a>, but feel don't have that opportunity.

<p>My youngest and his wife delivered a healthy, normal weight baby on their due date, but on the first full day at home, the baby started having difficulty keeping her oxygen level up (she would turn bluish). They took her to the ER, where she actually stopped breathing. Unfortunately, although she had nearly every test known to man, they never came up with a reason why she stopped breathing. She was discharged after 12 days, most in intensive care.</p>

"Sympathetic Adults","<p>You all know adults who undermine your authority when you're out and about with your children.  They coddle your kids when they misbehave, and your kids know it and take advantage of the situation to see how much they can get away with, especially when your focus is elsewhere.</p>

<p>I want this to be a relatively generic question if possible, but for one example, my son does this thing where he waits for his little sister to pick a toy, then instantly he wants that toy and none other, even in a room full of toys, and even though it didn't interest him until it interested her.  He then starts pestering her about letting him play with it.</p>

<p>He knows we don't tolerate that pestering, and if he came to us we would make him play with something else, so instead he approaches a sympathetic adult, puts on a sad expression, and starts whining about his sister not ""sharing.""  Those adults then treat him like he's the victim, give him lots of attention, and spend a lot of effort finding him a toy he will like better.  If we comment on his attitude, they take his side.</p>

<p>First of all, why do adults do this?  Second, what are some ideas to either stop it quickly or teach kids not to take advantage of it?</p>

<p>I'm not talking about grandparents or other relatives here.  With those people we have had plenty of time to lay out our expectations.  I'm talking about people like receptionists, nurses, retail workers, waiters, etc. with whom we don't have time to have a lengthy discussion on parenting.</p>

<p>Consider that our situation might be worse than other parents.  My 10 year-old has cerebral palsy, but we still expect her to behave to her potential, which others are not usually aware of.  However, it is not in her nature to intentionally take advantage of her situation.</p>

<p>My seven year-old is quite small for his age, and since he is homeschooled, is often out when other kids are in school.  I think this leads people to unconsciously set their expectations lower, as if he were preschool age, which he can kind of pass for.  He's really the one who milks it for all it's worth, usually at the expense of his sisters.</p>

"When does a toddler understand the joke of a man falling down on purpose?","<p>A few days ago I was watching a circus show with my almost 3-year-old daughter. There was a guy who was doing some pirouettes on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_bar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">horizontal bar</a>: he would turn several times in a row and then stop to make some jokes.</p>

<p>After a while, and since he was also a comedian, they put a mattress on the floor so he could fall on it. And this is what happened: for us adults it was clear that he would turn and turn and, in a certain moment, release from the bar and fall on the mattress as if he had fallen down. Also, he would walk a bit on the bar and then pretend he slid and fall on the mattress again.</p>

<p>All of this was funny and they (him and his assistant) were making funny faces. However, the subtleties of the joke were not clear at all to my daughter, who started to feel very anxious and helpless.</p>

<p>I explained to her that it was a joke and walked her to the side of the stage to show how big the mattress was, and how he was not hurting himself at all when falling on it. However, none of this helped and she kept feeling very sorry for the man. I decided to just move out for a while and come back when the show was over, to see how the man was smiling and feeling perfectly safe.</p>

"How to implement natural consequences to make an 8-year-old stop being rude to a sibling?","<p>I have an 8-year-old son, a 6- and a 2-year-old daughter. My son is a model student but really likes to argue. He's extremely stubborn and always right. When he argues with me, I'll correct him and laugh it off when he continues.</p>

<p>Now, I'm a fan of natural consequences, so long as the child is not in any immediate danger. When he argues with other kids at school, for instance, and I learn about it later, I'll explain to him that arguing is not a very good way to make friends. This is a natural consequence that I'm okay with.</p>

<p>Of his two sisters, only the older one is old enough to argue back. She's much more relaxed and considerate than he is (surprise, she has more friends). But she can also be extremely annoying (""What'cha doing? What'cha doing?! Huh?! Huh?! Huh?!""), so the two of them clash a lot.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the natural consequence of losing friends doesn't exactly apply at home, and my son does worse than arguing with his sisters. Today, he was holding a treasure box and shaking it, which was making a lot of noise. His older sister wanted to know what was in the box, to which he responded by hiding it. When she asked again, he just ignored her. This kind of thing <em>really</em> gets on my nerves, so I asked my son irritably ""Why are you being a jerk? She just wants to see what's in it. What do you get by holding out on her?"" This made him feel really bad, but he still wouldn't let her see it. He just pouted and sulked. His sister, unable to take a hint, persisted, so I told her ""Just leave him alone. He doesn't feel like being nice right now.""</p>

<p>I'm sure there's a better way to handle situations like this, but it's hard to think clearly when I get irritated. In the past, my wife and I had a hard copy of ""the rules"" that helped us by giving us clear consequences (e.g., rudeness will result in being sent to your room) so we didn't have to make quick decisions when these things happened. But there are two problems with having rules like this:</p>

"How to talk to a teen daughter about her weight","<p>My daughter is 16 and is gaining weight. My wife and I are on board with what needs to be done - and there's a lot to do.</p>

<p>But as to talking to her about her weight, we are at a loss. She's an ultra liberal feminist, so any discussion about her weight has and will inevitably lead to accusations of ""fat shaming"" and make things worse; we've been there already.  She points to celebrities who are fat and successful.</p>

<p>The last argument about her weight she pointed to the medical profession's opinion that ""a little"" overweight isn't the worst thing in the world. And she points to us - her parents - who are also slightly overweight. Perhaps she's right, and perhaps there's a middle ground. And perhaps, she's living under our roof and so our rules? I suspect we need to choose the right time and the right words - this is where your advice is needed.</p>

<p>Some background: She's not obese, but she's about 25&nbsp;lbs (11&nbsp;kg) over her ideal weight (she's 5'3"" (160 &nbsp;cm), ~160&nbsp;lbs (73&nbsp;kg)). I don't know her BMI.</p>

<p>She's a couch potato, is in love with her phone and laptop playing games and chatting with her friends. She's in between seasons (she plays field hockey and softball). She does not drive.</p>

<p>Her eating habits are horrible, too. She snacks on crap, and eats second and third helpings. All the junk food she gets she buys herself with money she makes from babysitting - another occasional low calorie activity she does with a 2-year-old.</p>

<p>We are not the best role models, but we don't eat off-mealtime, and we don't buy junk food. While consistent mealtimes are important, it just doesn't work in our household. We have a son who is in scouts, sports, and a band, and so there is that logistic. I coach both my kids, and volunteer in the scouts and band. So sports and other activities just make each day very different than the other. My son, by the way, is slightly underweight.</p>

<p>We started to limit what we cook and what we put on the table in order to limit the amount of food she eats.</p>

<p>We try to have dinner ready for early evening. If that can't be done, preparing something in a slow cooker can work - the kids can help themselves if we're not around. Or they can make something on their own.</p>

<p>We plan to lock her out of her phone, laptop, and Wi-Fi until she does things around the house that elevates cardio activity: doing yard and gardening work.  We also want to get her a walking app for her phone, and have her walk or jog a couple of miles a day as a requisite for getting her phone and laptop privileges, but, the irony is she needs the phone to use the app.</p>

<p>I'd like to get her to a gym, but none of her friends want to go, and none of the gyms will take her without an adult present. The YMCA would take her in a limited duration program, but getting her there is another problem - we work during the day, as does all of her friends' parents. Evening trips to the gym could work in theory, but with sports, scouts, band, and other community groups we're a part of, that all doesn't make it easy or consistent. We are members; we just don't go that often.</p>

<p>Any advice on what else we can do? Most importantly, we need to talk to her - that's our biggest concern, attempts in the past have lead to horrendous fights with her.</p>

<p>What has worked for you?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks all for the responses.  I waited a long time to respond so as to be able to try most of the suggestions in earnest.  So far, things are going well.  She has not lost weight, but she has changed attitude.</p>

<p>For my wife and I, the first plan of attack as suggested was to back off the talk.  Next, my wife enrolled in a gym, and has been there for almost 4 months now, and has lost 40lbs.  For me, I'll be joining only in between seasons, so not the best, but I'll still be on the field as I coach.  Also, we eliminated all junk food in the house, and, we were particularly careful around Halloween and Thanksgiving which are traditionally difficult to navigate food- and drink-wise.  Next up is Christmas and New Years, and we're staying home.  Still, no talk - only action.  And my daughter seems to be responding: substituting green tea for soda, yogurt for ice cream, and she's no longer buying junk food with her babysitting money.  Meanwhile, better planned meals allows to have however much she wants without us having to say anything.</p>

"6-year-old bed wetting","<p>It seems that most questions on this site about bed wetting involve toddlers. My 6-year-old daughter (almost 7) still wets the bed almost every night. After she was potty trained (a long, difficult process), she wore night time diapers for years. For about the past year, we've had the same routine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Before she goes to bed (around 8:30 pm), she always goes potty. I sometimes let her have a <em>little</em> drink because I feel guilty making her go to bed thirsty.</li>
<li>We wake her up around 10:30 or 11 (when we go to bed) to go potty. If we wait until after 11 she is usually wet already.</li>
<li>We wake her up at 3:30 am to go again.</li>
</ul>

<p>The 3:30 potty time is the most problematic. We used to set our alarm and wake her up ourselves, but this was always a battle because she's groggy and uncooperative at that time in the morning. Over the past few months or so, we've been setting <em>her</em> alarm for that time. This was working for a while, but sometimes she sleeps through the alarm, or the alarm malfunctions, or we forget to set it.</p>

<p>We have a plastic cover over her mattress but we're constantly running out of sheets. We've changed her sheets almost every night this week. What should we do?</p>

<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>I'm also wondering: is it okay to make her change her own sheets? This seems like a pretty natural consequence to me, but it also feels a lot like punishment.</p>

(In case you want to know, I am 28 and I have grey hair from the age of 21)</p>

<p>I was shocked when I heard his tone and the way he said it. It was amazing how he thought he could use that against me (I don't know where he could have caught that, maybe in school or maybe at home)</p>

<p>I was just quiet and I didn't  speak a word to him the whole party and he still carried on saying things to me.
(It was my way of saying it doesn't affect me.  People have said much worse things to me)</p>

<p>So my question is: ""<strong><em>How should I behave with a 6-year-old who is suddenly very rude to me</em></strong>"" ?</p>

<p>PS: I did not get offended by him, I was shocked. I want to know what the correct way that <em>I</em> should behave with him so that he doesn't do that to others. I am old enough to not get offended by kids, like I said before people have said worse things.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> I met the cousin again yesterday and tried to observe him if he is saying anything like before. However he did not say thing rude but was quite playful with me and was hanging around me for a long time.</p>

"Should we expect the kids to make an eye contact always?","<p>Having seen so many questions on this site dealing with the kids <strong><em>not</em></strong> making an eye contact, I was wondering if there are times when we should ask the kid not to make an eye contact?</p>

<p>I remember my childhood and adulthood when my father and mother used to hit me as hard as they can, and I also remember myself staring in their eyes back! That used to be my way of telling them <em>""Huh! If you think you are physically strong enough to hurt me so am I strong enough to ""deal with you""! Go on now, why have you stopped!""</em></p>

<p>Seeing my stare my father used to yell at me saying <em>""Keep your eyes down or I'll take them out""</em>! It usually didn't deter me ever.</p>

"Son (22) has to keep initiating contact between son and parents after moving out","<p>Me being 22, I moved out a year ago (about half an hour drive away) to live with my girlfriend after I proposed too her.</p>

<p>I always (and believe I still do) had/have a good connection with my parents and experienced a good childhood, despite my parents having had to deal with a heavily handicapped and unfortunately now deceased son. </p>

<p>Since I moved out december last year I am the one who keeps asking ( about 1 time a month) when it suits my parents to meet again, so we can have a laugh a drink or anything else. Not once last year they asked me to come over neither did they ask if they could come over for a cup of coffee or anything else. </p>

<p>If they're going to do stuff with my family, for example they go for a walk or go bowling they don't invite us or me alone. </p>

<p>My dad called me once last year and my mom probably about 2 times. They do give the occasional whatsapp, but those are mostly: remember grandma's birthday or whatever.</p>

<p>I love my parents and I assume they think I am too busy (Working 42 hours a week, buying a house, preparing a wedding and taking care of my chronical sick girlfriend, so I am also running an household), but I'd love it if they would simply give me a call when they would go out bowling or visiting my grandparents. </p>

<p>It kind of hurts to see on Facebook that they do fun stuff with my brothers (23 and 15) who still live at home without even inviting me. </p>

<p>I would like some advice about how to approach them, because at the moment I do feel left out.</p>

<p>Response to questions given:</p>

<p>Q: Before you moved out, were they happy in your choice of a girlfriend/fiancee?</p>

<p>A: I believe they were</p>

<p>Q: Were they disappointed when you moved out?</p>

<p>A: I don't think so. They said they would miss me, but things never got emotional.</p>

<p>Q: Did they help you move?</p>

<p>A: Yes they did.</p>

<p>Q: Did they rely on you for anything when you lived there that they're having to do without now? </p>

<p>A: Only my presence</p>

<p>Q: In other words, can you think of any reason they might be upset with you for leaving them?</p>

<p>A: No I can't think of anything. The only thing I took was my own playstation and they gave us a refrigerator.</p>

<p>Q: Were they solicitous of your affections and attentions when you lived at home?</p>

<p>A: Yes they were. I could tell them anything and they told me more about their life as I got older (finances etc.)</p>

<p>Q: Did they really hear you when you spoke with them, and respect your opinions?</p>

<p>A: Yes they did. We were not any emotional wonders being a family of 4 men. But when I spoke up they listened</p>

<p>Q: Did you all go out together to do things everybody liked, or that just a few liked?</p>

<p>A: We did the occasional funfair or zoo. Sometimes they would go out walking and since that didn't tend be my thing I would stay home. But they always asked me.</p>

<p>P.S. It's kind of the same for my brothers. I barely see them and they barely ask me to meet them.</p>

<p>P.P.S. My parents in law do actually contact both of us to meet up, or ask for an occasional coffee/tea</p>

<p>P.P.P.S If this is not the right setup for this kind of question you are free to edit it or tell me in the comments.</p>

"8-year-old refuses to blow his nose","<p>My 8-year-old son constantly has a runny nose. When he sniffles and I hear it, I'll usually ask him to blow his nose. Sometimes he starts arguing and whining as soon as I ask - for some reason he hates blowing his nose - but usually he'll go get a tissue and pick his nose with it.</p>

<p>Today, we were waiting for the bus in the car and he was sniffling like crazy. I handed him a tissue and told him to blow his nose.</p>

  <p>Son: [practically crying] I did! Nothing <em>ever</em> comes out when I blow
  my nose!!</p>
  
  <p>Me: No, you didn't. If you blew your nose I would have heard it. And
  from the way you're sniffling it's clear that snot would have come out
  if you actually blew into the tissue.</p>
  
  <p>Son: [more arguing and crying, bus arrives]</p>
  
  <p>Me: Well, put the tissue in your pocket in case you need it later.</p>
  
  <p>Son: Eww! No way! Then I'd get snot in my pocket! [leaves tissue on car seat]</p>

Finally, after he has been coaxed to drink enough liquid, the food goes down, but feeding is a long, drawn out process because of it.</p>

"Toddlers cries when mum or grandparents leave the living area","<p>He is one year and eight months. We live downstairs (grandparents live upstairs) and there is an exit door that connects to the genkan (we live in Japan- entry area) before the front door. No problem if mum or grandparents are just in the other rooms which he plays but god forbid they try to leave. No problem if dad (me) leaves even though I look after him for many hours a day. Mum and grandparents used to sneak away and then it was no big problem however now my son is starting to watch them closely to avoid them sneaking away. He even misses mum a lot when she is away do shopping or appointment- stay at home mum. Happily playing with toys makes no difference. What can we do? </p>

<p>To demonstrate that many answers to somewhat relevant questions don't help. He has moderately good contact with many family members. He is already running downstairs and involved as much as possible in household activities- vacuuming, putting up and down temporary barrier and hates being in the playpen- the only punishment that I am allowed to do (it works) and he doesn't really follow being told no. ""bye bye"" was possibly the most distressing words in the English language for him but not as much now. The situation is bad for him and us although Grandpa seems now to be able leave without hysterics, Grandma finds leaving very hard. It is worse for mum and also him as he ends being carried in a baby sling rather than playing. No answers that say its normal or try to make feel better please.

"As a parent, how do I discipline kids who refuse to comply without physically or emotionally harming them?","<h3>Core Question</h3>

<p>My 13 year-old younger brother defies any attempt to control him and my parents do not/can not tell him to do anything that he doesn't want to do.  He simply refuses to do it and there is nothing they can do about it. (e.g. time out fails miserably and if told to sit in his room he frequently does not go even for a short time)</p>

<h3>Full Question</h3>

<p>My parents are extremely busy and have not had enough time to develop a healthy relationship with their kids.  A major issue that has arisen unchecked from this is the fact that my 13 year-old brother has become defiant of any attempt at discipline.  Short of physically restraining him, which he knows my parents won't do, they have no options when he refuses to comply and as a result, in my own opinion he has not been disciplined for any reason for several years.  How can I (assume I am the parent in an identical theoretical case) or what can my parents do to punish him for doing something when he becomes violent without physically harming him yet not letting him ""win"" all the time?  What can I do in my present situation?  It is silently driving a deep wedge between my parents and myself and I am no longer comfortable talking to either of them about anything private.</p>

<p>Just to note, in this situation I am not the parent (16 y/o older brother) but have written it from that perspective since trauma resulting from years of this has made me question whether I want kids or not when I am grown.  Is there a way to deal with this and prevent it before it gets this bad?</p>

"At what age can/should a child be able to clean themselves after bowel movements?","<p><strong>How can parents find the right time to encourage a child to clean itself after bowel movements?</strong></p>

<p>Our son is nearly 4 years old and it is still difficult for him to get to the toilet early enough (see here: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/2209/how-can-we-potty-train-our-pre-schooler-outside-the-home"">How can we potty-train our pre-schooler outside the home?</a>). During our holiday, for 2 weeks everything worked perfectly and he always told us when he needed a toilet, so that there was not a single ""accident"" in those two weeks (even in a foreign environment).</p>

<p>When we got back to the kindergarten after the holiday, 2 days went well and then he started again to poo in his underwear (also at home), so that we finally decided to make a step back to diapers (as he often stated, he did not want to go to the toilet, because it was ""too far"" and seemed not to be willing to cooperate).</p>

<p>At the same time he said each morning, that he did not want to go to the kindergarten (when asked for reasons, they were manifold and mostly concerned preferring to play at home with certain toys...) .</p>

<p>I got aware of the fact that the kindergarten teacher let him clean himself, when the diaper was full - I assume to show him that it was not an enjoyable job for <em>them</em> - which at first seemed to make sense to me. (Sure they helped him afterwards, but he had to start putting the diaper off and cleaning as good as he could.)</p>

<p>However I  then learned, that <strong>he seems to see that as a punishment</strong> and therefore does not tell them less than ever if the diaper is ""full"".</p>

<p>So we then thought, that it might have a strong <em>negative impact to force him cleaning himself.</em> And I got aware of the fact, that <em>at home</em> we had <em>never allowed or encouraged</em> him to clean himself, so he was forced to do something which he maybe thought was forbidden.</p>

<p>I've been talking to several kindergarten teachers and they claim that the other kids (>3 years) are also cleaning themselves. 
That's why I'm asking.</p>

<p>I understand that this is much easier for the kindergarten teachers and that autonomy is a good thing to learn, but I wonder</p>

<ul>
<li>are those kids at the age of 3 really able to clean themselves appropriately?</li>
<li>what about hygiene (washing hands, ...)?</li>
<li>what about children with special <strong>digestive troubles</strong> or disorders?<br>
Our son has bowel movements at least once daily, sometimes 4 times a day and it is often quite loose bowels, so maybe more difficult for him to get aware of it coming out and for sure much more difficult to clean, as it is quickly distributed everywhere in the diaper...
After long ""research"" we finally seemed to find the reason for that: he seems to have an <em>imbalanced gut flora</em> which might cause those frequent and often loose bowels (as well as weakening his immune system etc.)  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Update
We made some good progress during the last weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>we encouraged him also at home to clean himself and made clear to him that this is a privilege to be allowed to do that, and after some days of seeming to be not very comfortable with it, he now tries to clean himself voluntarily.</li>
<li>for 7 consecutive days he managed to leave his pants clean, which gives us hope that we're on a good way<br>
(he normally poo'es in the morning before going to the kindergarten and in the evening before going to bed - and most days he seems not to have had more bowel movements than those two.)</li>

<p>She's been fast with everything so far. She was born in under 1 hour, doubled her weight in two weeks, started lifting her head almost immediately after birth (she can hold it up and control it completely now), and since a few weeks, when I lie her down in bed on her belly, she's starting to show signs of wanting to go crawling. </p>

<p>But here's the thing. Lately, she starts squirming and showing general signs of being displeased. There seems to be nothing in the world I can do to please her at that moment, except...help her stand on her legs. When I do that, she turns all smiles and becomes happy once again. Her stance is quite firm already; I can sometimes even let go for a sec (which she thoroughly enjoys, obviously). </p>

<p>Of course, as a good parent, I want to stimulate everything they indicate they are ready for. However, there's this gnawing concern I have when letting my daughter stand like that...<strong>she's barely 2 months old!</strong> I vaguely remember some doctor saying to me in the past that stimulating the legs, hips and back at too early an age can cause deformations later in life, because not all the cartilage has turned to bone. </p>

"How do you support/cope with your 15yr old daughter wanting to become a boy?","<p>I'm going to give a quick history on this to support my question. When my daughter was 12, her &amp; I moved to my hometown, where we already had friends and family that we are very close with. After moving she joined 4H, track &amp; band (her grades weren't the greatest) and really started coming out of her shell. </p>

<p>A couple new students started at her school, 1 of them a grade above her. After hanging out with these friends she started to copy their style (colored hair, music, ripped shorts/jeans &amp; whatnot). I had a ""unique"" style &amp; friends in school as well so I had no issues with that. But she then decided that she was bi-sexual after awhile. </p>

<p>After these changes she started having issues getting along with other girls at school, started developing anxiety issues, then started having issues getting along with these friends, 1 of which started cyber bullying her(on top of the general teenage girl drama). As sad as it is to say, it seemed like it was a trend in this group of girls &amp; boys to cut yourself and post attention grabbing things on facebook, they ALL did it. Things were going so horrible for her that I wanted to get her out of that town, and away from these kids, so we moved back &amp; she returned to her previous school. Since we've been here her grades have improved tremendously, she made several friends the first day of school, &amp; the cutting stopped, as well as the depression, she seems very happy &amp; upbeat now which means more to me than anything.</p>

<p>She now is insisting that feels like/would prefer to be a boy. When she's at school it's like she lives a double life. As hard as it was I let her get a very short haircut, she dresses more like a boy now and goes by a boy name at school around her friends. She plans to take testosterone as soon as she's old enough, which is one thing I will not support at 15 years old. </p>

<p>So far what I keep telling her is that this is a big decision and these are changes that you can not fully make until you've grown up, gotten out of school, etc. As a teenager you are gonna spend all 4 years of highschool just trying to figure out who you are, you can't make these kind of life decisions as a teenager. I also tell her that being a teenager &amp; being in highschool is hard enough, making these decisions right now is going to add to the highschool angst. I am fully supportive of her feelings and wishes on this, &amp; she's very open with me, we are very close, but I will not allow her to make any drastic changes to her body. If once she graduates she still feels strongly about this, I will support her all that I can. </p>

<p>I would just like to know if there are any other parents out there that are going through anything similar to this, when you know your child may have a long hard &amp; painful road ahead if they follow this path, how you handle it? What do you say to your child about it? What are your feelings?

"Why are some babies always fussy and crying while others are always cheerful?","<p>I have noticed this very often. I have seen babies who are cheerful ever.<br>
My brother in law's daughter has <em>never</em> (not literally though) been seen crying/fussy etc.<br>
While as my brother's baby son is <strong>always</strong> fussy/crying.<br>
In hospitals too I have noticed the pattern with the visitors. No, I am not talking about ill babies.</p>

<p><strong>I would like to understand what causes such huge temperament differences among babies.</strong></p>

<p>One thing more I have noticed is that the fussy babies are usually weak and the ever cheerful babies are mostly healthy. </p>

<p>Is this related to health?<br>
Is this genetic?</p>

"Is complimenting children where they can hear it good or bad?","<p><em>TL;DR</em>: Is there anything wrong with praising children to their parents while the children can hear it?</p>

<p>From R. Kipling's ""The jungle book"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘How beautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And
  so young too! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the
  children of kings are men from the beginning.’</p>
  
  <p>Now, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so
  unlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to
  see Mother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable. Tabaqui sat still,
  rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is praising children so they can hear it really considered bad behaviour, or is it just based on superstition?</p>

<p>I can think of a situation where a parent just reprimanded a child for doing something bad, at which moment praise could be unwelcome - but other than that, it seems to me that children hearing their positive treats praised can only increase their self-esteem?</p>

"How can I mitigate how my toddler has generalized a fear related to insects/flies?","<p>I'm typically careful of not instilling needless fears in my toddler as I want her to be afraid of important danger and not everything and anything that might be dangerous.</p>

<p>We went for a vacation recently and I was being followed by 3-4 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_fly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">deer flies</a>. I kept waving my hands around to shoo them away and my daughter understood that these bugs bite but has generalized this idea to ALL flies. She also got bit by something (deer fly or black fly) but I'm not sure she noticed what bit her or what happened (just saw a scab in her scalp). </p>

<p>This became a problem later during our vacation when she would break down at a restaurant because a (regular) fly was wandering around our food and also in the car until I managed to get the fly out. I don't mind my toddler being afraid of deer flies but being afraid of all flies is going to be hard on her! They are sort of difficult to tell apart as well so I'm not sure how I can help her out. I've tried explaining to her that they are not the same kind, that the regular flies don't bite. If one landed on my arm, I'd leave it there so she could see that I'm not scared.</p>

<p>I assume this fear is simply going to pass like many other things but are there any actions I can take to speed up the process? </p>

<p>I live in a place where most bugs are not dangerous at all; at most they will take some of your blood but there is no venom involved or direct threat to life. How do people living in places like Australia teach their toddlers to distinguish between a dangerous and a non-dangerous creature? </p>

<p>ETA: I was thinking some light exposure like trapping a regular fly and doing some observation involving the ""protection"" of a mason jar may be good for a start. </p>

"How should a parent react when their child comes out of the closet to them?","<p>Several of my good friends, including my best friend, are gay/lesbian/queer. All of them have told me that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out"">coming out</a> was one of the most emotional and difficult things they've ever had to do. Their parents' reactions ranged from shock and vulgar ignorance (""You mean you like to do it in each others' [censored]?"") to rejection to loving acceptance. </p>

Obviously some reactions are more positive than others, and ideally all parents would love and accept their child as they are, for the person that they are.

"My sister thinks her kid can ""swim"", but he can't breathe in the water. This is DEFCON-1 danger, right?","<p>I am a childless uncle who just became very worried about the water safety of my nephew. Whether this is my business, or not, I'm thinking of making it my business:</p>

<p>My nephew (<strong>who is 4-yrs old</strong>) recently finished ""swimming"" lessons. However, he can't roll right/left to breathe while moving forward. And, he can't float on his back. All he does is swim out to a person standing in the pool; breathe; swim back to side of the pool.</p>

<p>This Thanksgiving weekend, I was at a bar adjacent to a huge pool at a resort. On the far side, my nephew was taking leaps into the pool and ""swimming"" out to my father. Then... rather than take a leap, he turns left and starts running along the side of the pool. It was a cool day, very few people were out, and no one was near where my nephew was running.</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I wrong in thinking that this was a life or death situation? My sister is blowing me off about this. She is proud he can ""swim"".</li>
<li>Am I wrong to think that a child needs to know how to float on his back, or be afraid of the water? My nephew is currently fearless of ""swimming"". That is incredibly dangerous?</li>
</ul>

<p>I've read the opinions of the haters of ""ISR infant swimming survival"". They argue that ""ISR"" terrifies the child. Yes, it is terrifying. And, that is how it should be. If you can't get on your back a float, you should not (get in) / (fall in) water deeper than you can stand. That's obviously common sense, right?</p>

<p>btw: My first memory is the ""final exam"" of my ISR training. I was innocuously asked to put shoes on. Then the instructor sat next to me, tied the shoelaces together, and threw me in... That <em>was</em> torture. I found the name ""Dr. Harvey Barnett"" in the ""about"" page of <em>infantswim.com</em> . My instructor's name was ""Harvey"". If that Harvey taught swimming in central Florida in the late 1970s, I might have found my man. I do forgive him though. He made me into a strong swimmer.</p>

I'm not prepared to move furniture for theoretical future children. </p>

"I love my step son so much but it irritates me when he compares me to his dad","<h2>My step-son keeps comparing me to his biological father, and I don't know why.</h2>

<hr>

<p>I've been in a relationship with this woman for almost 3 years. She has been married previously and has a 6 year old son. I have a great relationship with her son. He loves me so much and trusts me a lot; there hasn't been any conflict between him and me. </p>

<p>I feel, however, his biological father is irresponsible:</p>

<ul>
<li>He left his Mom when she got pregnant and had to stay home while he had to work and provide. </li>
<li>He is about 29 years old now and he is still in school </li>
<li>He doesn't have a car and he lost his driving license due to DUI several times. </li>
<li>He lives in his gf's apartment and works in a restaurant. </li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast, I'm from a wealthy educated family, I am educated and have a great job with great pay, and I feel I don't have a lot in common with my step son's biological father. </p>

<p>My step son sees me as his role model; he always tells people that he wants to be like me when he grows up, and he once told me that his dad is smart but I'm smarter than his dad. </p>

<p>But there is something that he often brings up and I don't understand why: His dad is 6'4"" and I'm 6'2"" and he often tells me that his dad is a little taller than me. I always act cool about it and acknowledge that, but he keeps telling me that every couple of weeks, anyway. <em>Why is he doing that?</em> Sometimes he says that his dad has more hair than me too. I'm cool with the facts but when it happens frequently, it kind of gets on my nerves. </p>

<p>I once talked to him about his comments, and he said he understands but sometimes he brings it up again. Any idea why he does that? As well as the comparisons, he often acts protective of his dad when his dad makes a mistake and his Mom calls it out.</p>

<p>N.B: I never talk down about his dad in front of him. Ever. I always shield him from the frequent fights his mom and dad have. I always say that their fights doesn't make them bad people, I say to him that '<em>it's just your dad and your mom can't get along and that's why they aren't together</em>'. I've never told him that his dad is a loser, I actually tell him that he is lucky to have two dads so he can learn different things from both.</p>

"How to deal with sibling/child who doesn't contribute and is stressing out their parents whom they live with?","<h1>Context/Story</h1>

<p>I have a sibling who's stressed/saddened their parents whom they live with, with their lifestyle. Communication is poor to nigh non-existant between parties involved. (1 parent felt like any attempt to confront the individual would've been met with 'fuck you') I've been disconnected as I've spent the last 3 years in intense schooling, mainly focused just on keeping myself afloat.</p>

<p>Most recent incident was a starkly silent family dinner where I felt I perceived tension/awkwardness was rather stifling.</p>

<h2>The person in question is</h2>

<ul>
<li>Low-20s (age) currently doing work/study rotation (in post-undergraduate school with a career related part time job) to finish off a post-undergraduate degree, eventually take a related license exam.</li>
<li>They were advised to work from home as it is dull work or something. A point of friction in the past with their parents was a few failed courses which delayed graduation.</li>
<li>Has had a strong/unhealthy interest in playing video games from a young age &lt;= 11, parents were busy and the parenting was so-so arguably</li>
<li>Lives at home with parents, recently moved to a small/quiet town (nice place for seniors to retire, not so great for young new-ish grads) 40 minutes from suburbia (previous town), 1 hour and 40 minutes away from a big capital city, their network of friends moving all over to pursue their careers etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Primary points of friction appear to be</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sleep cycle leans towards being a night owl (my understanding is this is prime time to be undisturbed as normal people are asleep, don't want to be interrupted this days for dem online multiplayer games)</li>
<li>Absolutely awful, unapproachable and ungrateful attitude when in their early waking hours (related to 1st point)</li>
<li>Cycling through an abundance of video games, movies, shows, etc, entertainment</li>
<li>Lack of engagement outside of leisure/entertainment activities or social life? The house hold has recently moved to a location that's great for retiring seniors not so much new graduates. (My impression is their friends have kept in touch online and I know they play games together online.)</li>
<li>Prefers to stay on the computer at home, leaves room for meals. Bathroom is connected to their room. </li>
<li>Doesn't help with chores, (grandparents used to consider this their duty and would be irritated if someone took their work as it made them feel useful, additionally parents didn't emphasize independence or helping around the house, as they wanted us to devote all our time/focus into academics)</li>
<li>Hasn't been going out of the house much outside of work/school, I asked and they haven't been going to the gym recently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

<p>I feel it would be somewhat hypocritical for me to call them out on this as I wasn't much better either previous years, when on break from school. I believe that the fact I haven't lived at home for any extended period of time recently, makes me look better. Or at least I am out of sight and out of mind, free to live however I like and suffer the consequences of my actions.</p>

<p>This has been a problem for them since childhood for them (only thing they really seem to want to do is play games, which I don't know if I can blame them as I feel the same, much of the time). </p>

<p>A few years ago there were issues with the individual angrily screaming, yelling, punching the table and walls over online video games. A polite request to calm down, and maybe not play if the game is clearly not making them happy and just angry was met with: ""<em>BUT IT'S A GAME I CAN'T WIN</em>"" followed by seething with anger.</p>

<p>A recent discussion with the individual about this makes it seem that this should be slightly better.</p>

<h2>What can be done?</h2>

<p>My belief/understanding is that unless a person wants to change themselves or wants to be helped there is very little an outside party can do. But I suppose I owe at least 1 attempt at a cringey/awkward intervention, that will get brushed off before I return to being overwhelmed at school. As far as I can tell/believe there's a nasty feedback loop of snowballing.</p>

<p>I share little in common with my sibling besides common vices and parents. We aren't that close either and didn't like each other while growing up (I wanted computer time too, which they would be loath to share), and I've spent most of the last 3 years focusing on passing school. </p>

<p><strong>What are the best things that a younger sibling can do? What are the best things the parents can do?</strong> Otherwise context is ~1st generation? Asian/American/Canadian low to middle class suburbia. We're pretty much low to no public displays of affection and don't like to talk about our feelings.</p>

<h2>Current planned future approach</h2>

<p>My current impression, at this point is the only effective thing to do <em>as a sibling</em> is state this discomfort across the entire household, and suggest they move out to survive on their own (out of sight and out of mind, no longer creating friction). Or if not make some serious effort to make their parents happy since they've sacrificed a lot to do right by us.</p>

<p>Though I don't know if there's any stock in my words when I wasn't much better in the past.</p>

<h2>Follow up Hypotheticals for my current planned approach</h2>

<p><strong>Hypothetical 1 good/bad end?</strong>: if they were to somehow agree to move out but fall apart, are they  just a lost cause that should be truncated? My parents won't be around forever and I can't/don't want to spend my life burdened babysitting/enabling their lifestyle. I have enough trouble trying to get by.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothetical 2 nothing changes</strong>: they don't want to move out, (It's a pretty sweet deal living with your parents , economically ,etc.) and doesn't change their lifestyle, doesn't help around the house.</p>

<p>We're still at square 1 here then.</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for your time, sorry for the long post, I'd be happy to add any more details I can/feel comfortable sharing.</strong></p>

"Helping a child cope with a parent's relationships","<p>First- if anyone has a better title suggestion after reading this feel free to edit. I had a hard time formulating a brief description.</p>

<p>My oldest son is the result of a failed relationship that ended when he was an infant. I started dating my husband seriously when he was about 15 months old and then remarried when he was 4. I have always had full custody. He visits his dad more or less every other weekend, less so when he was a baby. All this time, I have been in a monogamous, stable relationship that produced two more children. We have a happy, healthy home that is grounded by a happy, healthy marriage.</p>

<p>On the other hand...my son's father is a womanizer. (Hence, we are no longer together, amongst other reasons.) He had several relationships when we first split; he was often staying with one girl one month and then with another the next month, which resulted in very little visitation due to his reluctance to ""freak out"" his gf's by bringing a baby home. Eventually, he found a girl that had a kid the same age as our boy and he married her. Kinda all of a sudden. They played house: since she had a kid it was now convenient for him to have his son over, so he went over there a LOT and grew close to his step mom and brother (reluctantly-this boy was not very nice to my son physically or emotionally.) Two years later it was over. On Christmas Day, when my son was FINALLY going to spend Christmas with his dad. 
Within weeks of his divorce, he showed up at my house with a new gf to take my son to the zoo. I guess the play date with the kid wasn't her thing because he showed up a month later with a different girl. This girl moved in with him after about a month and now they are engaged.
My son was devastated when his dad got divorced before. He still misses his step mom and step brother (it's all I can do to be sympathetic. Only because I love him I manage-they were nearly intolerably awful people). He asked me upon return from the zoo-date if he should call dad's date ""mom"" or her first name. Now, he's getting amped up for the wedding and a new step mom.
I'm happy that at least this girl is nice and she seems to truly care for my son (unlike the other one playing house) but I'm concerned that all these relationships are damaging him. He asks me all the time how come daddy gets to get married all the time and I only got married once. When he was young, first of all, he didn't hardly notice, and if he did notice the ""frequency of turnover"" of his dad's partners I was able to provide fairly ""light"" and pre-school friendly answers like: ""daddy is still practicing making friends-those girls aren't mommies"" or when he got divorced I managed the explanation: ""everybody is like a puzzle. There are lots of pieces and you have to try different things to see if they fit. The last piece of everyone's puzzle is a special piece that actually fits in two people's puzzles. One piece fits perfectly into both to join them together to make one big picture (our family). Daddy thought he found a fit (like you do when you do puzzles) but it turned out the picture was mixed up and it wasn't the right piece.""
That explanation was satisfying for him but, I can't help but wonder, how else, besides the strong example we have set in our home, can we teach him the value and seriousness of making good relationship choices? He idolizes his father, so I fear that he gives his father's life choices equal weight. I am not so obtuse that I don't see that equalization is logical in his mind, and in other instances an advantage (in the sense his <em>good</em> experiences are doubled.) But as a mother I can't help but want to mitigate or prevent harm though. </p>

<p>Without preaching, or criticizing his father, how can I teach my son to choose healthy relationships over lust based flings, and ultimately, the value of a marriage? The upcoming wedding is a very very big deal. I want him to have fun, and be happy for his dad, but I wish he could understand that for now, it's <em>his dad's big day not his.</em></p>

<p>Btw-my son will be entering middle school next year. He's 10.</p>

<p>I realize marriage is often a religious topic, so I should mention that we are not religious, but have taught the children the basics of a few of the major world religions and about spirituality in general, so answers based in any faith (or lack thereof) are welcome. </p>

"Can admonishing hinder a child's mental growth?","<p>I recently got into a heated argument with my sister over her not admonishing her 5-year-old son. Sometimes he does things that really need a firm warning. For example, doing things that might cause physical harm like trying to walk on the couch's arm rest. Or running around opening all the doors - fridge, wardrobe, all the rooms, etc. Or eating while running around the house.  </p>

<p>Although opening doors or eating running around isn't something wrong but it just isn't good manners.  </p>

<p>So she tells me that he is not at an age that deserves admonishing. That's because that would hinder his mental growth. She says that warning a kid deters them from exploring and learning. I am of the opinion that manners should be taught from an early age.  </p>

<ul>
<li>What is the right amount of warning?</li>
<li>Does it really hamper a child's mental growth?</li>

<li>Allows a parent to reach under the shield to release the harness.</li>

<ul>
<li>Would be sat on and hang over the front of the seat.</li>
<li>Could not be removed unless the harness was unbuckled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some concerns I have though, this shield:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can't interfere with the child restraint's safety features</li>
<li>Can't introduce additional risk to the child. For example, a hard device which could break and lacerate the leg.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Is there a device on the market like this? That accomplished the same goals.</li>
<li>If there isn't a device already; what materials could I use? I originally considered plastic, but worried about the additional risk from breaking. Another idea is very thick leather, to prevent the child gathering it up, to get around the shield.</li>

"Baby / toddler girls - is it necessary to wear swim pants to prevent infections or inflammations?","<p>We have just been on a beach holiday in Italy with our almost two year old girl. For a whole week she'd happily run around on the beach, sit and play with the sand, or go in the water, all the time completely naked. For us parents (and more generally in our cultures, i.e. in central and northern Europe) it was completely natural to let her be naked.</p>

<p>Until one day a lady seeded some doubt in my mind. She approached us and said <strong>we are in the wrong by not having our daughter wear some swim panties</strong>, because (unlike boys') <strong>girls' genitals are more susceptible to infections, inflammations, or similar, <em>caused by sand</em></strong> (but not by going in the water?!). She may have meant that the sand can go up through the vagina if no panties are worn.</p>

"Daughter saying whole sentences at home but not in kindergarten","<p>My nearly 3 years old daughter is capable of saying whole sentences by now and using them nicely while at home with us.</p>

<p>However the kindergarten staff claims she speaks very little and not capable of saying whole sentences.</p>

<p>We tried to explain them the situation, but so far they were not able to ""convince"" her to talk the same way like she does at home.</p>

<p>Is this a normal behavior? Should we be worried or take her to professional help?</p>

<p>Possible causes that I can think of are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>She can get what she want without talking too much as the staff know her very well and love her.</p></li>
<li><p>She is very shy so maybe she's just being too shy to talk much when with other children.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing the cause might help, ideas for more possible causes are also welcome.</p>

"Why do babies suck their fist?","<p>My daughter is almost four months old. Few weeks ago she discovered and started having a lot of fun with her little hands: she keeps putting them in her mouth, she loves playing with the toys, etc.</p>

<p>However, recently we have noticed that she also sucks a lot on her fists. Especially from 3-4 hours before her bed time, she will start getting anxious and placing the fist in her mouth.</p>

<p>I did read some articles about the pain they may start having by this time, since teeth are starting to develop and this hurts them. However, and if this is the case, I wonder how can sucking their fist soothe them.</p>

<p>Is there any other possible explanation? Could it have to be with stomach ache?</p>

"How to handle a biting toddler in the crèche?","<p>My daughter is in a child caring facility (a Montessori children's house, for what it's worth) in a crèche group of children from about 1 year to 3 years old. For some months now, one child from the group causes issues by biting other children severely (including my own daughter). </p>

<p>I do not want to make the case blaming the other child, since I do not believe that she does it with evil intents, but the situation is somehow stuck. The teachers (do you say so in this age-group?) don't really know what to do, since it tends to happen, when they are occupied elsewhere. The afflicted children are having nightmares and do not want to visit the group (last Friday I had to stay for half an hour until my daughter was ready to enter the group's room and today it's been quite the same, when my wife brought her there - usually she barely looked back when entering), and we (and other affected parents) have our duties, which means that we can't really decide to stay home with our daughter.</p>

<p>Voices have arisen to suspend the <em>""responsible""</em> child from the group, but we don't believe that this would be easy and the right thing to do (my wife is the parents' representative in our group). The kid is already having a hard time (she is raised bilingually and is therefore a bit ""behind"" - language-wise and I believe that her parents are getting divorced) and she would move to the older group this summer anyway. </p>

<p><em>If</em> the facility can expound that they have done everything they can do to solve the issue, would it be reasonable to recommend the parents of the child to get professional help? How could this professional help look like and what would be a empathetic way to recommend it?</p>

"How to encourage 17 month old to walk?","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: my 17 month old son could walk 10 - 20 steps two weeks ago. But now he refuses to walk. What should I do to encourage him?</p>

<p><strong>Long version</strong>: my son had some serious eating problem when he was 8 month old and this lasted for around 6 months. So we accept that his development is far behind his peers. He has not walked independently yet, and currently has only 6 teeth.</p>

<p>However, 2 weeks ago he started learning to walk. At that time, he really enjoyed his new skill, and he could walk on his own from 10 - 20 steps. That was in the weekend. He goes to daycare on weekdays, and in the following week, after coming back from daycare, he walked less and less. And now he just refuses to walk, in fact he seems afraid of walking.</p>

<p>I have no idea what happened to him at the daycare. Perhaps he tried to walk and fell down very badly.</p>

<p>Question: how do I encourage him to walk again?</p>

<hr>

<p>@anongoodnurse: Yes, he still likes cruising, but he is crawling most of the time. He doesn't pull himself onto his feet, but he will walk a little bit if we hold his hand.</p>

We are in Vancouver, Canada which has a large Chinese population and Mandarin is very common. Neither of us speak any Mandarin whatsoever.</p>

"Should I be concerned that my two-year-old doesn't interact with kids his age?","<p>I have a 22-month old boy who is currently an only child. He's a very smart, outgoing child  who has never shown any sort of developmental issues. He enjoys books and music, has an amazing memory, and is speaking in long phrases and sentences. </p>

<p>Both I and my wife work full time, and until recently our child spent his weekdays with his grandma. </p>

<p>None of our nearby relatives have kids in his age range, and he hasn't had that much interaction with children his age. We've tried a couple baby/toddler groups through the local school district, and he's encountered children in public places like the park and play areas with some frequency. We're friends with another couple who has a daughter a couple months younger, but we only see them one evening every month or two.</p>

<p>Recently, grandma decided to go back to work full-time. We put our child in a home daycare with a woman who takes care of her own son and one other boy (18 months and 24 months).</p>

<p>It's been almost two weeks now, and he doesn't seem to be adjusting. Our provider says he appears anxious during much of the day. He watches the other boys, but never really interacts or plays with them. She tells us that keeping music on does help him relax somewhat, but he's still very clingy to adults, and he tends to cry if left alone with the other two boys, even for a moment.</p>

<p>Some of this certainly seems attributable to being abruptly put in this new situation with new people, but it is a tad worrying to me (and our daycare provider is clearly concerned).</p>

<p>How worried should I be? Should I just continue to give him time to adjust? Should we be actively seeking more opportunities to have him interact with kids? Do I need to discuss this with our pediatrician?</p>

"When will I feel the same attachment for my next child as my firstborn?","<p>My second child is due towards the middle of next year. This was an expected, planned pregnancy.</p>

<p>I have no worries or reservations about having another child. It's something my wife and I both wanted and we agreed upon the timing.</p>

<p>That said, I have found this pregnancy to be much less exciting and emotionally charged than the last (it's less pregnant, if you will). I know some of this is just because it's not <em>new</em> and many of my fears/worries about pregnancy were assuaged. </p>

<p>However, my lack of excitement is much more severe than I expected. I feel less emotionally invested in this pregnancy than the last. </p>

<p>I have read about some fathers needing a long time to feel attachment to their child, but these articles are usually about fathers who felt this with their first child. They're not about parental attachment to additional children/pregnancies.</p>

<p><strong>I don't have any worries about whether or not I will love my next child as fully as possible, but I do wonder <em>when</em> that will happen.</strong></p>

<p>Is this a common (or not uncommon) feeling during additional pregnancies? Is there any trend regarding when this attachment develops (such as during a stage of pregnancy, during labor/delivery, or some time frame after birth)?</p>

<p>If those questions are unanswerable, does anyone have advice on making pregnancies more exciting for the parents?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
Since there have been a couple responses that I feel might have confused the question, I wanted to clarify that I'm not concerned about my ability or potential to love my new little one. I've emphasized the relevant part of the question above.</p>

<p>I also wanted to add that we found out the other day that we're having another son. I'm marginally more invested now that I have a more concrete image of who's coming, but I still can't help but feel a little guilty about how little excitement I'm feeling.</p>

<p>However, I have found that two things are helping to make me more excited: 
 - Trying to decide on a name for my new son
 - Asking my firstborn questions such as, ""Do you think we should get a baby?""</p>

<p>I think these work because I'm adding to the mentality that there will actually be another person in our family soon.</p>

"How to stop my 8 year old son from doubting and/or speaking against the existence of God?","<p>I am a Muslim, and so is my husband. Our 8 year old son is refusing to learn how to offer namaz and does not offer prayers either, and in his school, he has been slapped and beaten by teachers for questioning the righteousness of God. (In my country, which is Pakistan, it is common for boys to be beaten to motivate them to learn, this happens in every school with the exclusion of international ones, which are extremely expensive.)</p>

<p>Recently, he came back home with half of his face completely red. When I asked him what happened, he told me that his teacher slapped him hard for asking ""Why is God so hungry for praise?"" and although this doesn't sound too much cruel in English, in Urdu, it was said in a very harsh and informal manner, which was ""Khuda itna bhuka kiyun hai tarifen or namaz key liye?""</p>

<p>He keeps doing these things often, and I am afraid that one day, he will get us in a very bad situation. I do not want the scholar at school or anybody to say that we should kill him, which is becoming more and more possible. (In Pakistan, there is a law set by the government that anybody, of any age, will be hanged for speaking vilely against God.)</p>

"How do you prevent a toddler from waking too early?","<p>My 18 month old has started waking up progressively earlier every morning for the past couple of weeks.  It used to be that he would wake up between 6am-7am, which was no problem because I would wake up at 5:30am to walk the dogs.  If he woke before 6am, I'd give him some milk, change his diaper, and lay him back down, and usually he'd be asleep or quiet in his crib for at least another 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Now, however, I am at the point where he is waking up at ~4:45am.  I try the same approach, and if I am lucky he will be okay until 5:15am.  This is starting to wear on me, and also I can't really walk the dogs in the early morning now.</p>

<p>The only impact on him has been that sometimes he wants to nap in the morning instead of the afternoon, and ends up a little more tired throughout the day (nothing major though).</p>

<p>The weird thing is that he is SUPER consistent about what time he wants to go to bed (6:30pm).  This time hasn't changed in months.  Should I make him stay up later than he wants to in the hopes that he will sleep in later?  I don't really think ignoring him when he wakes up early would work, and it's not terribly consistent with our parenting style anyway (right now I tend to ignore him if I just hear him talking to himself...I attend to him once he gets upset...which is like 4:45am...).

"What to do when my 3-year-old holds poop in and won't go in diaper or on potty?","<p>My son is almost 3 (33 months) and for the past few months, he has been holding his poop in, to the point that he won't go for many days a time. When this started, the doctor advised us to give him Miralax to make his stool softer so it comes out more easily. Even <em>with</em> the Miralax, he still managed to hold it for two days at a time sometimes, but at least it was coming out at all, so we continued with it.</p>

<p>Anyway, we've been giving him the Miralax for months now, and now he's (supposed to be) going to preschool in September, which of course requires that he be potty trained. We don't want to hold him back since he's developmentally ready otherwise, so we started potty training a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>He picked up the potty training really quickly – for peeing – but he still holds his poop in no matter what. If he's sitting on the potty, as soon as he's about to do it, he stands up and just keeps holding it in (and once he starts to stand, if we even so much as <em>ask</em> him to sit back down, he screams and cries).</p>

<p>We have tried <em>everything</em> to convince him (or distract him enough) to sit and poop: reading books, singing songs, playing games, playing with toys, offering him snacks/treats (graham crackers), giving him stickers, etc. Nothing works.</p>

<p>As of today, it has been a <em>week</em> since the last time he pooped, with the exception of a little bit today and a little bit yesterday (both of which ended up all over the bathroom floor since he won't sit down). The doctor says now we should give him an enema to force it all to come out, but even so, that won't solve anything going forward since he still won't go in his diaper or on the potty in the first place (what are we going to do, give him an enema every week, indefinitely?).</p>

<p>The issue isn't that he's scared of the potty itself, since (a) he was holding it before we started potty training, and (b) he knows exactly what he's supposed to do, since he has no problem with peeing (he sits down himself, points it out afterward, knows that it gets emptied into the big potty, etc.).</p>

<p>It's that he just <em>won't poop, ever</em> – not in his diaper, not on the potty – and the only reason why anything comes out at all is because we've been giving him the Miralax every day (and even then, these aren't ""full"" poops, just whatever happens to come out because it's soft enough that he's unable to hold it all in).</p>

<p>I'm at a complete loss as to why this even started, and what if anything we can do that would actually help. Is it a behavioral problem? Medical? Both?? Help!</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE: I just wanted to update this question since a lot has changed since I originally posted it. We discovered there was a specific situation where he <em>would</em> go in his diaper voluntarily: in our bedroom closet with the door closed. So we knew then that the withholding was intentional, since it was now established that he <em>could</em> go if he wanted to.</p>

<p>So we let him continue going in the closet and, over time, found that he usually went around the same time each day. Based on that, we then had him sit on the potty when we knew it was most likely he would need to go. We also managed to find two things that distracted him enough to sit (blowing bubbles and playing with his toy laptop).</p>

<p>By doing this, we were able to get him to go on the potty without really realizing it (so he didn't try to fight it), and then made a big deal out of it every time he did. Over time, that helped establish that that's what he was supposed to do, and now he does so voluntarily. He hasn't pooped in his diaper in probably 3 weeks by now.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say he's ""fully"" potty trained, in that an adult still needs to go with him and distract him (and occasionally remind him when he needs to go in general), but <em>finally</em> we made progress.</p>

He raised my son as his own. Needless to say every present I sent on birthdays and Christmas was returned for about a year so I eventually stopped.

<p>As the blog points out, just because a child is the oldest doesn't necessarily mean that they won't get clothing or toys passed down to them from older children (cousins and neighbors were mentioned as being good potential sources), but in a family dedicated to saving and passing on lessons of the importance of recycling and reusing, it seems very likely that the youngest children will get far fewer ""new"" things.</p>

They are at an ice cream shop and the vendor tricks them (now very popular among ice cream vendors) by giving them an empty cone where the kid was expecting to receive ice cream as well.  The customers are enjoying the trickery.</p>

<p>The kid didn't expect or appreciate the empty ice-cream cone. She then throws the empty cone at the vendor and starts a (fake, IMO) cry. In the shop, everybody laughs (including the mother) and the ice cream vendor quickly gives the ice cream to the kid.</p>

<p><strong>The mother's reaction</strong></p>

<p>I'm not judging the woman's response, but trying to put myself in this position and think about what a good reaction would be. I am well aware that this is just one recording and getting ice cream for this kid can be an exceptional moment. That being said, this video appears to be bad parenting to me (I am not a parent and know little to nothing about parenting)</p>

<p>The kid expresses anger by throwing the cone and then cries toward their mother to immediately get what they wanted. This might teach the kid that for any trouble, anger and cry is the good reaction to have. Also, the mother's reaction to laugh might lead the kid to think his mother does not care about their emotional distress or even that she enjoys seeing them angry.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p><em>What would be the ideal response on the part of the mother?</em></p>

<p>Should she have punished her kid for throwing the cone? If yes, what type of punishment? Should she have refused the ice cream from the vendor or at least delay the reception of the ice cream by the kid? </p>

<p>Of course there's ""chemistry"", where you just gauge the vibe you get from talking to the person, and how well your kids like them during the interview; but that's very subjective and going to differ from person to person.</p>

<ul>
<li>CPR and First Aid certifications would make me feel better, but I doubt I would have made the time to get them at that age</li>
<li>INA - International Nanny Association (which I only mention because it's mentioned on sittercity.com)</li>
<li>A background check would be nice, but performing it myself or through a service could be expensive/invasive/time consuming and it would be nice if it was just something offered through a service.</li>

"How to convince an adult son to seek medical help?","<p>Our son who is 26 is seeking a restraining order against us, his parents. We did not have any problem whatsoever for the first 25 years. After that, he had a career failure. We suspect he developed a mental problem after that. </p>

<p>He stopped communicating to us and to many of his friends). For several months he was talking reluctantly when he was visiting us. For the last seven months, we have not seen or talked with him at all. He blocked our phones, does not answer e-mails, we don't know where he lives. Before that, he answered one of my e-mails saying he has PTSD and needs some time alone. After that, several attempts to contact him by phone or e-mail failed.</p>

<p>Actually, he blames us based on those attempts. We don't care if he wins it or not, but we must do something to convince him to seek a medical help. I hope we'll see him in court and will be able to say several words to him. My wife (his mother) wants to say we love him, but I think this is exactly what he hates about us. We are not ""helicopter parents"", though perhaps I was overprotective. But anyway, we were friends for the 25 years of his life. </p>

<p>What can I say to him? Should I say anything? Maybe anybody who was in my son's shoes can advise?</p>

"When do infants and/or toddlers develop survival instincts?","<p>I am a father of a 10 month old son. I love to observe my son acquiring and developing new skills like crawling, responding to questions, and imitating other's behavior. Moreover, I was flabbergasted when I witnessed my son operating our TV remote.</p>

<p>As a recent development, I observed a new skill in him yesterday. He crawls on carpet freely with out any problem, he enjoys it. Yesterday, we (my wife and I) wanted to see how he would respond to crawling in grass. We left him in the middle of a small grass field. I think he felt the grass poking his palm and knees and then ,to our surprise, we saw him for the first time standing himself straight up without any support and stood up for at least 20 seconds and then carefully came down to a sitting position, maintaining the balance. Our jaw dropped with that sight. I could not believe that my son stood up without our or any thing's support. With that event, I totally forgot to capture the sight in my phone. I waited for 15 more minutes after that with my phone camera on to try capture the same sight again, but all in vain. He did not like the grass to crawl on, in the first attempt I guess.</p>

<p>Now my questions are:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How and when do infants &amp; toddlers create or develop the ""survival instinct""? By survival instinct I mean my son wanted to avoid the grass and instantly he got the instinct or a reflex to stand up.</p></li>

<p>My 18 month old child is usually shy and doesn't mingle with people easily, but if someone spends time with him and goes a little slow, he becomes friendly and responds.</p>

<p>Few days back we went to a 3 year old's birthday party. There were many children of different ages, mostly between 1 to 4 years.</p>

<p>Suddenly he mistook my friend for me, and holding his finger started to dance and play. Everyone in the party knew he had made a mistake and all were amused.</p>

"Should I show more anger when unhappy with a child's actions?","<p>I am naturally a very conserved and patient person. I think this is sometimes confusing to a 4 year-old, who can easily tell when his mother is unhappy with him due to her tone of voice. For me, I may tell him to stop (<em>or else, etc.</em>), in a matter-of-fact tone of voice, which generally doesn't do anything unless he is pre-inclined to agree.</p>

<p>The time when it is most annoying is when I don't think the action itself requires disciplinary action. It is just annoying me. Like constantly buzzing his lips and blowing raspberries. Apparently, he can enjoy doing it for long periods of time, and really if he's having fun with it, should I care? Usually I might ask him to stop, but then just let it go, because I don't want to put him in time-out for it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his mother can just say his name in a warning tone of voice and he'll stop. It's worth mentioning that he is not as familiar with me. We've known and been around each other pretty often for almost 6 months.</p>

<p>Should I make more effort to say my words in a different tone of voice? Should I be more harsh, and start using time-outs even though his choice of fun is just annoying me a bit?

<p>As an older sibling, I did this to my brother and cousins all the time. They'd have a laugh too, after the initial scare. I still love to scare people, and I do it to my nephews aged 4 and 5. My husband feels that I'm scarring them or traumatizing them by doing that. I argue that they don't show signs of being deeply affected by it. They still like having me around. Husband argues back saying it's because they like other things I do with them, like playing and reading, and I'm family. But if I keep up the scaring, they may start to avoid me.</p>

<p>I obviously don't want to wait till that happens. So my question is, does scaring children really traumatize them? As I said before, I keep it ""age appropriate""- at least according to me.

"8 month old not babbling, when to worry and what to worry about","<p>My wife and I have two boys: a 3-yr old toddler and an 8-month old infant. The toddler is doing extremely well with all physical/motor and emotional/intellectual/communication aspects.</p>

<p>My 8-month old, physically, is also right where he should be. He's crawling, sits up by himself, is starting to pull himself up on to things (yikes), rolls over, picks stuff up with both hands, etc. No concerns there whatsoever.</p>

<p>We also have a copy of the de facto standard, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1889392413"" rel=""noreferrer"">Baby 411</a>, which cites a whole slew of autism screening questions, and again, absolutely no concerns on the autism front: he makes strong eye contact, enjoys being around us and his older brother, cuddles with stuffed animals, is not ""off in his own world"", etc. No concerns.</p>

<hr>

<p>What I am becoming concerned about is his language/communication skills. This is one area where we've seen relatively <strong>no</strong> development since he was a newborn. On one hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>He <em>does</em> squeal and laugh when he's really worked up and happy

<ul>
<li>Extremely rarely, we'll get a quick ""<em>Ahhh</em>"" (vowels only, no consonants)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He cries when he's upset</li>
<li>He absolutely can hear (we've tested this thoroughly - sneaking up behind him and making a noise to see if he turns his head, etc.)</li>
<li>He does seem to respond to his name by making eye contact with us</li>
</ul>

<p>But, on the other hand:</p>

<ul>
<li>He's 8 months old, and not a single consonant sound (not a single ""<em>Ba</em>"" or ""<em>Ga</em>""), etc.</li>
<li>When we engage him isolated and directly (without our toddler there to disrupt), he just doesn't seem interested in communicating back and forth with us; either that, or he just doesn't ""get"" that he can try to engage us back; it just doesn't occur to him</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Finally, my question:</h3>

<p>If you ask the Google Gods ""<em>8 month old not babbling when to worry</em>""-and similar queries, you'll get an ocean of blogs and forums of parents with identical stories to ours. And in almost every case they get the same regurgitated/canned responses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All babies are different and acquire skills at different rates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes, I understand that, but:</strong> if my son is still not verbal at, say, 30 years of age, clearly something is wrong. So my point is that, at some point between 8 months and 30 years of age, he'll cross over a barrier where it's no longer acceptable to just chalk his lack of communication up to ""<em>All babies are different.</em>""</p>

<p>So my question(s) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is this barrier/when is this point? At what age do you finally worry that he may have some learning disability, or something else going on?</li>
<li>Once a child crosses over this barrier, what are some concrete/actual causes for lack of communication (when neither autism nor physical/hearing disability are present)?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Update 3/9/2016:</h3>

<p>About 3 weeks after posting this question, my son started babbling and using consonants (of course!). He's now 11 months and jabbers/babbles constantly, says ""<em>Da!</em>"" when he looks at me, and occassionally acknowledges my wife as ""<em>Mom!</em>"" (lol). So he's not quite at ""<em>Dada/Mama</em>"" yet, but I have faith he'll be there soon. I'll post updates to this from time to time as I think it may help other parents.</p>

<h3>Update 10/4/2016:</h3>

<p>Our little guy is 18 months old now and is <em>exactly</em> where he should be on the milestone chart (below, under the accepted answer). He barely made a noise for the first 8 - 9 months, then started becoming more and more verbal in his 9th/10th month. And now he's got a repetoire of dozens of words that he says with correct annunciation (more or less) and under the right circumstances. He's even starting to put 2- and 3-word sentences together (<em>I love you</em>, etc.).</p>

<p>All this to say, that we're no longer even remotely worried about him, and I advise any other parents with the same concerns that we had to read through all the answers to this question. The accepted answer was truly the best, but many of the other upvoted answers provided a lot of great guidance and emotional support.</p>

"Discussing early literacy tools with parents","<p>I have three couple-friends, all with toddlers (12-14 months), who rarely ever involve literacy in their child's lives. As an educator and researcher I know how strong a correlation early reading has with academic life, and I'd like to see my friends children have access to all the opportunities reading has to offer. </p>

<p>Currently, every one of the couples spends their entire evening unwinding by zoning out on the couch. I think unwinding is completely deserved of all working adults, but some of that time could be put to good use interacting with books, papers, even mail. </p>

<p>I have the resources and experience to have the chat, but I'm wondering how to best structure discussion on the subject without making anyone feel targeted. How, as a parent with a legitimate interest in your child's well-being, best like to hear constructive criticism? And how would that discussion be structured?  </p>

"Techniques for teaching children from the start about how to read advertising?","<p>I took a class in high school that taught media literacy and it has been one of the few learning experiences in high that really stuck with me.

<p>We already live in a household without much advertising (get TV from Netflix so there are no commercials, avoid websites with ads, etc) so it's jarring when we leave our house and are bombarded with billboards, buses wrapped with ads, and flying banners, and the ads on the TVs in airports.</p>

<p>The obvious thing would be to talk about the ads when we see them and explain to him what they are trying to do. Are there are formal techniques for teaching media literacy to young children? Does a household without advertising make it better or worse for a child to understand what they are seeing?</p>

Just then, our daughter told her mom that her eye is hurting her and if this a sign that she is going to die. My wife politely explained her that this is not the case. My daughter then asked if there are certain parts of the body that when they hurt mean she is going to die, and finally she said that she is afraid of death and she does not want to die.</p>

<p>2-3 days ago I had a discussion with my girl during playtime when she decided that one of her dolls is dead. I explained to her that if she (the doll) is dead, she'll never wake up again, and that is ok, because everybody eventually dies in the end, and this is the way of life.</p>

"My 5 year old's second language: Why is it not coming naturally?","<p>I live in Israel. I am a native English speaker. My wife is Israeli. My five-year-old son speaks Hebrew.  He understands when I talk in English.</p>

<p>But he has a lot of difficulty in saying a sentence in English on his own.</p>

<p>He will say it in Hebrew, I will tell him to say it in English, he'll repeat it in Hebrew.  Then I'll tell him 1 of the words in English.  Then he can sometimes stumble through the sentence, as if having told him one of the words has triggered in his mind the recollection of the other words.</p>

<p>He translates words pretty well from English to Hebrew.  The other direction is a bit more difficult.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>a) Is it because I am his only English speaking exposure that his English is not ""natural"" to him., i.e., if it were true that kids pick up languages so quickly, then, why is it still so hard for him to speak in English?</p>

<p>b) How can I help him improve his English:  (he hates the effort that I ask him to put in to try to talk in English)</p>

<p>c) Could it be that my enunciation is not so good, and that is a major problem? Should I work on speaking more lucidly and clearly?</p>

<p>Also, another problem is that recently he has developed problems in his Hebrew, mixing up the sounds sh and s - in fact; I noticed he is copying how some other kids in his pre-school are talking :(</p>

<p>I expect he will learn English with time and patience and perseverance.  But the question is, why is it not coming to him naturally and spontaneously and organically like everyone says it should be for kids, and like his Hebrew was?   </p>

<p>P.S.: He also has English exposure from songs on CDs/tv shows. Instead, it seems to come to him as it does to an adult, in a rigid logical way. As if he stores everything in Hebrew, and translates all English to Hebrew before handling. i.e., as if he does not think in English, only Hebrew.</p>

<p>I guess that it's just a silly myth that all kids are magically amazing language learners....</p>

<p>A little backstory, we've always been long distance (different countries) and we've been very on-and-off. I've TRIED being there to a certain degree (lots of facetime calls, trips to see them, etc.) but we're not really bonded the way a father and son probably should be.</p>

<p>I'm not really a good dad I don't think. I try my best, but parenting doesn't come naturally to me and I don't find it particularly fulfilling. I also haven't been physically around enough to get ""better"" at it.</p>

"How to breastfeed exclusively in a joint custody situation","<p>I have a friend who is single and finds herself pregnant unexpectedly. She and the father have no relationship at this point and don’t plan to, other than co-parenting, from separate households.  It will be a joint custody arrangement from the start, with my friend, the mom, having primary custody and dad regular weekend/overnight visitation. Or so she plans.* She also plans on exclusively breastfeeding her baby, perhaps bottle feeding breast milk, but definitely wants to avoid formula (for cost and health reasons). </p>

<p>Anyway...</p>

<p>She has been asking me for lots of advice, seeing as I have 4 kids she figures I have all the answers (HA!) but especially she asks me about BF’ing (Breastfeeding) because I’m the only person she knows who’s done it and feels comfortable enough discussing it with her. I do have a lot of experience about lots of stuff, and BF’ing for sure, but one area I don’t have any experience with is how the logistics of EBF (exclusive breastfeeding) works, or doesn’t, in a situation where dad will potentially be taking the baby overnight or for the weekend, which is the situation she’s contemplating. </p>

<p>Obviously, advice in that scenario is going to be different than in a two-parent home, or if formula feeding, or if single parenting totally solo. I don’t want to give her advice that won’t be practical for her. Of course, a lot of what I have to offer is relevant and useful-latch techniques, engorgement, over/under supply, back pain, bras, etc-but she’s also asking me stuff like: </p>

<p>How will I keep up my milk supply over the weekend/night?
How many bottles do I need? 
How will I know how much milk to send since I can’t measure intake per session? </p>

<p>I can attempt to answer these questions, based on my experience, but I think it would be more beneficial to her if I can provide her with answers based on the wider experience of this community.</p>

<ul>
<li>I say “or so she plans” because this what she talks about with me, as someone who has no idea what the hell she’s gotten herself into. None of us did, as first time parents, even if was our plan to become parents! But, in her case specifically, she didn’t plan on having children. In her mind, with being single and all she figures she will need either the time to rest or to catch up on “everything else” and so justifies the time away from baby. I personally don’t see how this plan will be feasible, having been through the “4th trimester” X4. I can’t imagine packing up my newborn baby, breastfed or not, and sending him off for the night or weekend. First of all, because I know I’d spend the night/weekend strapped to a pump, and certainly won’t be “resting” or getting “<em>anything</em> else” (never mind “everything”!) done. And then there’s the anxiety/longing because of the separation. However, before I make assumptions about how she will feel (maybe she won’t miss her baby like I did when I left mine for even a few hours or consider 12 pumping sessions in 24 hrs for 3 days straight as tortuous and not “restful” at all), I’d like to know if anyone else has direct experience with this situation or something similar.  I’d rather give her information that is experience/fact based than on speculation, even if it not my own. I appreciate that my friend thinks I know it all, but I don’t. </li>
</ul>

<p>I want to be as supportive as I can, but I also want to help her have realistic expectations. I think she has some ideas (as ALL parents-to-be do) that aren’t quite...practical...in regards to this custody thing (which is still not set in stone) and breastfeeding, and how they influence each other. I am not trying to dissuade her from either the custody arrangement or breastfeeding-I really just want to give her solid advice as to how she could pull it off and then let her decide if that’s how she wants to proceed.</p>

<p>But these days...</p>

<ul>
<li>Our nearby family is less and less of an option as they appear to be starting their own baseball team ;)</li>
<li>The high school aged neighbor is no longer trustworthy (He was house-sitting for other friends in the neighborhood and decided to take their car for a joy ride... when he was 13! His dad's response? ""But he's a good driver!"")</li>
<li>The couple we would sort of trade babysitting with work opposite schedules and have limited time to see each other, let alone take our kids. We feel bad asking, and have a hard time scheduling even when we do ask...</li>

"Teenage Boy wants to live with his Mum","<p>I have 3 kids. The eldest boy is 20 and is studying at University, my middle son is 17 and still at school and my youngest is a 12 yo daughter.</p>

<p>About six and a half years ago my wife left and at the time she agreed to my request that we maintain 50-50, week-about custody. For me this arrangement has been good as I have been able to maintain good relationships with the kids and also start and maintain a new relationship with my new wife of 5 years.</p>

<p>Life at my ex-wife's house(s) has been a bit of a rollercoaster for our children. In the 5 years that I have been with my new wife, my ex has had 7 or 8 boyfriends, none of which have lasted more than 14 months, and some that she has moved into her house (with their own kids) within days of meeting them on-line.</p>

<p>My ex is an 'intense' parent. Some call them martyr-mums. When she is between boyfriends she focusses her love and attention on the kids very intensely. She also tends to treat them more like friends rather than parent-child. What this means is that during those times the kids get very attached to her.</p>

<p>In contrast I am a more even, but less intense, parent. I probably don't tell them enough how much I love them, but that is probably more a bloke thing than anything else.</p>

<p>Of course, kids being kids, they can be incredibly selfish as most of them think the world revolves around them. So what has happened at various stages during the last 6 years is that any or all of the 3 of them have decided that they want to live solely with one parent or the other, whether it is me or my ex.</p>

<p>Now when they have come to me in that time (all 3 have done so at various times) and made the request to live at my place full-time, I have almost always said No, as I have told them that it is not fair on the other parent when that happens, and that I believe that the best outcome for everyone (parents and children) is the 50-50 split. There have been exceptions though, most notably 5 years ago when my ex felt physically threatened by my eldest boy, and I agreed to <strong>her</strong> request for me to take him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my ex does not take the same stance, and while she may not encourage the children to live with her full-time, she does not encourage them to maintain the 50-50 access. I have found out recently from a mutual friend that my ex never liked the 50-50 arrangement and has always wanted the kids to herself. This has meant that my middle son spent some time in the last 2 years living at her place full-time (until she moved boyfriend no 6 or 7 in and my son didn't get on with him).</p>

<p>So once again, my ex has been between boyfriends, and once again my middle son is saying he wants to be with his mum full-time. Because he is over 16, he can legally choose where to live. He is coming to me this weekend, but this is the first time he's been at my place for 5 weeks. I really miss him and just want the arrangement to go back to 50-50.</p>

<p>Is there anything that I can say to my son to try and fix this? Should I even be trying to persuade him to go back to the 50-50?</p>

<p>I only have just over a year before he heads off on his own big life adventure, and I would really like to have him in my life for half of that time.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE - 20th April, 2017</p>

<p>Well 18 months later I thought I should share how things went.</p>

<p>My son is now half way through his 18-week basic training in the Royal New Zealand Navy. While he has always continued to keep up the contact with me (more so, now that he is away from home), he never came back to me 50/50 before he went off on his big life adventure.</p>

<p>He spent last year trying to get into the armed forces, and spent most of the year working after dropping out of school. I was dismayed by some of the decisions that he made, but without much access to him he got very little 'good' advice. His mother even encouraged him to drive around illegally on a learners license for most of that year. Which ended up with him being caught and having to sit, and pass, his driving test.</p>

<p>However, since leaving for the Navy he seems to have had a renewed interest in me and more importantly, my (and his) family.</p>

<p>My ex is still doing her damnedest to keep him as close as possible by almost controlling his activities during his 4-day leave over Easter when he flew back down here to our home town. His car had mysteriously had the battery drained so she ended up ferrying him wherever he (or perhaps she) wanted to go.</p>

<p>Anyway, I do feel that I have a better relationship now with my son since he has been released from the apron strings. </p>

<p>Before the football (soccer) world cup, my 6 year old nephew hated football. He didn't support a team, his family aren't too keen on the sport and he wasn't too interested in playing it at school.</p>

<p>Now he's seen it on TV and he says he 'loves' the game. He wants to play all the time, collect football stickers etc. Obviously we're fine with a genuine interest in a sport and we would like to encourage him to be active and explore new activities.</p>

<p>However, when we actually start playing, my nephew gets very emotional, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lot of rolling on the floor and crying foul (picked up from TV of course)</li>
<li>Making up rules because he doesn't really know them (his official rulebook are the kids in the next class)</li>
<li>Accusations that we adults are playing unfairly</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to reach a state where we can just play football without having it end in tears and my nephew being sent to the thinking step.</p>

<p>My approach so far has been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Giving him some coaching to improve his game, with the aim of addressing the point about adults playing unfairly. When he takes the advice, his game genuinely improves, but he often doesn't want to do this. It's not complicated advice either, e.g. standing a few paces in front of the goal line if he's in net</li>
<li>Recognising his mood changes and trying to pack the game up before the point of no return, but he doesn't want to comply and the other adults don't spot the signs either</li>

Another bad habit is that he would often make his sister cry for no reason ( or as he often puts it, ""out of pure pleasure""). I try to reason him out of his bad habits, but it simply doesn't work. He would just frown and shout at me. It should be noted that I won't getting into a shouting match with him, not even once ( unlike so many of other parents). When he shouts, I just look at him in his eyes intensely and call him out for this poor behavior: ""boy, you are losing your cool, and I don't like your manner, if you continue this behavior, no one can talk to you at all""</p>

<p>He would then just walk off and lock himself up again. And he would just continue his bad habits. He does not respect my authority as his parent, neither does he behave like a grown up person. </p>

<p>How to deal with such a problematic kid? Should I just cane him in order to restore my authority?</p>

"How can I explain to my child that I'm not superman?","<p>If you asked Grace (2 1/2) right now ""What can't daddy do?"" she would probably not understand the question. Daddy can move anything, fix anything, run as fast as <em>lightning</em>; simply put, there's nothing Daddy can't do.</p>

<p>Except honestly, I'm a programmer for a living, and I don't work out. Like most (not all!) of my fellow IT guys, I'm not all that strong. And when it comes to fixing stuff, I'm really not all that great at that. C'mon, I had to go to Home Improvement Stack Exchange just to <a href=""https://diy.stackexchange.com/q/6310/2660"">fix a dryer duct</a>! And sure I used to be fast in high school, but I have a hip injury now that prevents me from running much at all.</p>

<p>But she doesn't know these things. To her, I'm a freaking superman.</p>

<p>So the other day, we were driving along when she said she wanted to go to the toy store. (It's actually a salvage center at a local landfill. Protip: they love $5 toys just as much or more as they love $100 toys!!) Except that it was the Sunday before a national holiday. In Canada (<a href=""http://www.hrreporter.com/articleview/16797-employees-prefer-time-off-over-salary-increase-survey"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the only country in the world that values time off more than additional pay</a>). So as you can imagine, it wasn't open. And that's when she had the <em>perfect</em> solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Maybe Daddy open it!""</p>
  
  <p>- Gracie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And try as we might, my wife nor I could get it through her head that no, Daddy can't open the toy store. (Daddy is a very big fan of not going to jail.) And I know it's very common, and of course it feels kind of cool to be thought highly of, especially in areas I'm historically horrible in. And I don't want to just crush her spirit, or make her think I'm bad at everything. </p>

<p>But I want her to know who I really am, to know the things I'm good at and not good at. I want her to know that it's okay to be not good at some things and that no one expects perfection. I want her to have a realistic sense of who I am. How can I do this in a way that isn't damaging to her?</p>

"Two year old starting creche, completely hyper when he comes home","<p>Our son (2 years &amp; 9 months old) is starting creche, we've had some ""introduction days"" where we drop him in for a few hours each day to become accustomed to the change.</p>

<p>Normally he's an energetic - but NOT hyperactive - child, he rarely sits for long, always on the go. We do lots of activities together, he especially enjoys the messy parts of baking and loves to eat the food he helped prepare.</p>

<p>However for the last few days he's come home from creche absolutely hyper, bouncing off the walls, and today completely sabotaged a cooking task we were doing. After creche he no longer seems able to listen, constantly grabs anything &amp; everything he can reach. </p>

I'm fairly sure this is a temporary change until he settles into his new routine, but obviously the fear is this won't go away.  </p>

"How can I help my toddler with his booger problem?","<p><em>Warning:</em> this one may be a bit gross...</p>

<p>They can stay there for days without coming out on their own, and they cause a noticeable whistle when he breathes.  </p>

<p>The rubber suction bulb our hospital gave us when he was a newborn does absolutely nothing to help; the masses are too far up, and too big.  Not to mention my son <em>hates</em> to have them shoved up his nose!</p>

<p>There is a medical reason why my sons... boogers... may be a bit bigger and thicker than average, but we've seen a specialist, and he agrees that they're not symptomatic of any actual medical problem.</p>

"How to Handle 5 Year Old Disrespect/Not Listening in Public?","<p>Our 5-year-old daughter is a very smart, sweet, and usually well-behaved girl. She usually hates to get in trouble and responds well to correction. However, lately she has been getting into some trouble at school for not listening and refusing to participate one day, and has been not listening to us and getting very angry about having ""rules"". She is going back to her younger behaviors of having trouble leaving places, such as family get-togethers, grandma's house, etc. She gets mad and STAYS mad, will pout and carry on for quite a while before she finally comes around and usually apologizes.<br>
I do not know where this has come from and have tried to figure it out. She likes school, and says she likes her teacher and friends. My DH (spouse) teaches at her school, so he is pretty in the loop about her days there, and he states that she is most always happy when he sees her, she plays with pretty much anyone.<br>
There have been no changes at home, other than I started working full-time in June, but that coincided with her starting kinder, so she wouldn't be home anyway.<br>
She is very moody, and the littlest thing can cause so much drama. She had been sick a couple times right in a row and her tonsils are still swollen, but not red, so I don't really think she is sick or anything that would be contributing... I kept hoping it was just a growth spurt or something because she has sprouted up recently and all her pants are short.</p>

<p>I have gotten some great insight and advice from other posts on here, but the biggest question I still have is what to do when she doesn't listen while we are out, or it is something time sensitive. 
For example: We are at a family function and when we let her know it's almost time to leave, she says ""No!"" and is defiant, and ran away from DH. This turned into over an hour of issues where she was saying she didn't care if she got in trouble, no one ever helps her, wishes she didn't have a mommy &amp; daddy, etc. To me, that is just unacceptable behavior, and I don't want to let her ""get away with it"". I find it hard to ignore because we are GOING to leave at a certain time, and so at some point it becomes a matter of force. Or sometimes I tell her it's bedtime and again, ""NO!"" and won't come, the consequence has been losing a bedtime story. But of course, telling her that just warrants more drama crying and anger.<br>
I feel there must be a consequence to defiant, disrespectful behavior, is that wrong? So many posts here say to ignore it. If I just ignore it, she will not be in bed. Do I just say ""I am available to read stories and tuck you in now, later I will not be""? I know it is getting to be a power struggle, and I want to nip it in the bud as it's new behavior. I am all for ""positive parenting"" but it's so hard for me in the moment, when she is being so rude!</p>

"Toddler is in bed but wakes up an hour early and walks into our room","<p>We have recently transitioned our 2 year old from a cot into a bed.  We did this with some reservation but he appeared to be ready as he would constantly ask to go into his bed.  Also he started climbing onto the top bar of his cot so we thought it might be best to move him to his bed.</p>

<p>However now he is in we have a problem that when he wakes up early he can get out of his bed and walk around the house.  Typically into our room.  In the past we could leave him in in his cot and he would either churp away or cry to be picked up at which point we might leave him for as long as possible.  </p>

<p>He has always been an early waker even though we never got up early to him.  At least from as long as I can remember anyway.</p>

<p>As he is only waking up 45min to 1hour we are finding it hard to tell him to go back to sleep, especially as he has already woken up walking around.  He wakes up at <strong>5:30am - 6am</strong> instead of <strong>6:30am</strong> which we would be happy with.</p>

<p>We are hesitant to completely close his door so he can't get out but apart from that we don't know what to do.  Why?  Just a personal thing at this stage in that we like to have his door ajar just so we can hear him if necessary.</p>

<p>His room is completely dark so when he wakes he won't be able to see much (so there's no morning light issues).  We have tried telling him it's not time to wake up yet however he is already fully awake by that time it seems tough to ask him to go back to sleep (for 45min to 1hr?).</p>

<p>He goes to bed early-ish in the evenings and at times has good sleeps during the day.  We don't force either of these and try to work in with his state each day, although we also stick to a routine as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE Sept:</strong>
I thought I would provide an update to this.  Our little guy is much better now although he is still waking up once during the night (at which point I just pick him up and take him back to bed) as well as waking up early.  However he is slowly getting better.  Now although he complains more often than not it's not a continual cry.  Things that we are doing now include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Purchased a Gro clock and have been constantly drumming in that he can only come into mummies and daddies room when the sun comes up.  He gets the concept and it's almost... working.</p></li>
<li><p>Started a sticker chart.  Although he doesn't fully understand it is a nice treat for him now and he sort of understands when he isn't allowed on.  He is only allowed one when he has stayed in his room.</p></li>
<li><p>I started off hoping into bed with him for a month in the core of winter but the last 4 weeks I've been filtering that off so now I don't need to and just take him back to his room (although he does still complain and cry/grizzle at times).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So it's been about 4months.  Slowly but surely he's getting there.</p>

"Should I use timeouts with my goddaughter if her mother doesn't?","<p>My goddaughter is 2.5 years old and lives in another state.  We video chat every week, which she looks forward to, but I only see her in person intermittently.  She is also an outgoing and assertive child, which I love, but it leads to her testing her boundaries on acceptable behavior even more then the average 2 year old.</p>

<p>I have pretty extensive experience with children, and so my instinct when she pushes her boundires too far is to put her in a timeout as I would with the other kids I mentor.  However, her mother almost never uses timeout's with her, preferring to discuss and reason with my goddaughter about why her actions are bad, even in situations where I would usually use a time out (in addition to explaining why the actions were bad during the time out obviously).</p>

<p>I have the mother's full permission to use punishment/timeout when I'm visiting my goddaughter, and I often take my goddaughter out for some fun time somewhere while her mother works when we visit where I'm the sole adult anyways.  I have no doubt that I <em>can</em> use a timeout, my concern is how effective they will be.  She isn't use to the concept of timeout form her mother, and doesn't see in in person often enough to become familiar with them from me.  Will she understand what a timeout, which she rarely sees, is about, and why it is happening, and/or just think it's something her godfather does sometime? </p>

"Extended family not catering for baby's routine","<p>We have a 15 month old child. He is the only sub 10 year-old in my side of the family. I recently got into a dispute with family, as they wanted us to arrive for a family occasion at a specific time, not earlier or later (reason: don't want too many people in the house at the same time). Whatever the reason, we would be happy to oblige if it wasn't for the child; for a variety of reasons related to the child, 30 minutes earlier suited us much better, and did not have any direct impact on the hosts other than the above reason.</p>

<p>We were told by an intermediary family member, that this demonstrated a lack of respect to those who were hosting the event. I replied that when it comes to anything involving a family with a small child, that you should not demand anything in terms of timing, but, understanding the complexities of managing little ones, a mutually agreeable consensus should be reached. I was then told that we ""cannot go through life expecting everyone to do what we wanted to on our own timescales"" (this straw man type argument is a familiar pattern with some members of my family). It was said that when their kids were young, they always bended to fit in with other people.</p>

<p>This was said by a member of my family who had children (many years ago) and presented as if it was an undisputable fact. However the experience of my wife and I completely disagrees with this. If a friend invites us to a social event and the time doesn't suit our daily pattern we either decline (not a realistic option with a family get-together) or suggest an alternative time (usually reaching a compromise). My wife's side of the family are all too willing to make sacrifices/compromises in order to accommodate us &amp; their other grandchildren (eg multiple sittings for meal times to suit various routines). Herein lies another issue with dealing with my family - when they present things as fact which I find not to be true in my experience. I don't know how to approach it constructively - it just turns into a brick-wall situation where person A states scenario X is true because of person A's experience, and person B disagrees because of person B's experience.</p>

<p>A few extra things to bring more colour to the scene - I feel that better direct communication prior to the day with the hosts could've improved the situation, I did not know how important it appears to be that we turned up 30 mins later, and perhaps they did not know the ins and outs of our child's routine (but should they need to know that? Is not a request from the parents enough - we are not intentionally awkward people). They were also a bit taken aback when we said we needed evening food some 2 hours before everyone else had theirs, but they coped with that. They gave us some bread &amp; cheese, which was fine, we didn't expect them to bring the full evening buffet forward for us.</p>

<p>My one thought as justification for the families' attitude is that my family are too far away in years from the time when they had little ones to remember what it was really like. </p>

<p>Also, by ""routine"" I mean his nap time, his meal times, and the fact that he falls asleep in the car very easily (which can be a blessing and a curse).</p>

<p>This leads to a few questions.
1) Who is right - is it ever OK to demand a fixed time of arrival for a family with young children. I am not asking this because I want to say ""ha the internet I was right"" but more to test our parenting radar/intuition. If I am considered right then it will boost our parenting self-esteem, if not then we will try extra-hard to be humble in the future.</p>

<p>2) Am I right to expect higher standards from family members in terms of catering for our us and our little one, than from friends? Are the standards I am expecting unreasonably high?</p>

<p>3) Crucially, any suggestions on how to move this forward? At the moment I feel reluctant/trepidatious about spending more time with the family on away turf, as I feel they will be unwilling to make compromises (around timing and other issues) for the sake of my child (this fear is based on this &amp; other incidents, where a quiet calm request to do things differently for the sake of me or my wife has been met with a (sometimes aggressive) no). I have already listed above a couple of the difficulties of discussing issues with my family but here's another one. My wife &amp; I would rather sit down and calmly discuss issues whereas my family are a lot more aggressive with disagreements, and rarely seem to actually resolve things. I (correctly) believed as a child that there must be a better way to resolve differences than this.</p>

<p>EDIT clarification:</p>

<p>Thanks for the responses advising to say no to family events, I see the reasoning behind it and will probably try to use it in the future.</p>

<p>However it was not an option on this occasion because it was a two-day event, that we had already committed to. We were only told of the time requirement in the last 10 minutes before we left at the end of the first day, and much of the food prep had been done for the next day. So to have told them we couldn't make it from there would've been, understandably, taken rather badly by the rest of the family (some of whom had travelled 3+ hours to be there).</p>

<p>I'm not sure what we could've done differently on this occasion (ideas welcome), just that we can chat about it with the hosts to avoid the scenario in the future.</p>

"14-week-old waking many times a night: poor sleep associations already? can we sleep train yet?","<p>My 14-week-old has been a poor sleeper since birth. He was ""colicky"" for the first 7 weeks, so did not sleep well. Then until about 10 weeks, he was starting to improve: there was less inconsolable crying during the day, and he would start the night by going 3-5 hours before eating again. However, he never actually slept the full 3-5 hours, because he won't fall asleep nursing--he requires soothing, rocking, carrying and sometimes a pacifier to get him to sleep. After the first sleep stretch, he would go for 2-3 hours before a second feeding, but after that one he was restless and gassy for the remainder of the night.</p>

I think it is a combination of teething already (our first son also got teeth early), gas, and possibly continuing reflux that is contributing to the steadily worsening sleep. Also the three month growth spurt has probably contributed.</p>

<p>He has been on Axid for several weeks, and it's not clear that it has helped; we are considering Prevacid, but it's not clear that reflux is much of an issue any more. I give Tylenol and/or Ibuprofen when it's clear he's teething, but that only helped a couple of nights. I don't eat dairy, and have tried eliminating various other foods--again, doesn't appear to have made a difference. We gave him Biogaia probiotics when younger but that didn't help; I've just started him on FloraBaby infant probiotics. He's still swaddled tightly, and often has a pacifier to help fall asleep, although not always. Have tried having him sleep in the swing, which seemed to help for a while, but not any more.</p>

<p>He goes to bed around 7:30 or 8pm, but then wakes up 40 minutes later to nurse (because I can't nurse him to sleep, so he's already hungry by then), then 1-2 hours later for the rest of the night. During the day he eats every 2-3 hours, and naps are not great, again because he won't go to sleep immediately after nursing, so he usually doesn't sleep longer than 40 minutes before getting hungry.</p>

<p>My question is, can he already have made sleep associations that I need to break? He doesn't nurse every time he wakes during the night, only after 2-3 hours, but he wakes more frequently and needs to be soothed, re-swaddled, given the pacifier, held, etc. If the frequent waking is due to pain (gas, teeth, reflux), then does that mean that sleep training wouldn't be effective? With our first sleep-challenged child, I read Weissbluth, Ferber, Baby Whisperer, etc., but I can't find anything helpful for this particular situation.</p>

"How to answer child's hard questions","<p>I have recently found myself facing my sweet 9-year old cousin, who looked at me with those big naive eyes, and knowing me as the geeky aunt who knows everything, asked ""why did the Germans do this to us?"" Meaning the holocaust. At which point I found myself opening and closing my mouth in search of something to say, because I'm 30, and I still don't know why.</p>

<p>I have more than one young cousin, and my friends' children, and I will eventually have children of my own, so I anticipate facing this kind of questions more than once. So how do you answer a child's questions about cruelty, injustice, bigotry - about evil? I can't explain to a child about the banality of evil, can I? It's such a cruel thing to accept. But what other answer is there? How should I have answered my cousin's question?</p>

"How to get children to participate in housework without using reward/punishment","<p>This is sort of an exploratory question, as I haven't really been confronted with the issue (yet).</p>

<p>I've been looking around for ways to get kids to do chores. I'm a bit put off by the fact that pretty much every source I can find suggests creating a reward system (possibly with punishments), and further, those rewards are often financial. It's my understanding that using punishment and rewards is bad because it basically makes the behavior contingent on whatever external motivator you've arbitrarily chosen, and thus the behavior will disappear when the motivator disappears (see ""Punished by Rewards"" by Alfie Kohn). And using money as the reward strikes me as a particularly bad choice, encouraging greed.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the question must be asked: how DOES one get kids to do a task that ""must be done,"" but which is inherently uninteresting? I'm leaning towards ""be a role model"" (in particular, don't expect to offload all the work you don't want to do on your newfound slaves) and trying to get the kids to understand the reason it must be done anyway (e.g. dishes must be washed so we don't get sick). But I admit I haven't got any experience.</p>

<p>So I guess my question is, aside from setting up a reward/punishment system, how can one encourage children to participate in tasks that need to be done, but aren't really fun/interesting?</p>

"Improving a parent preference?","<p>My wife and I arrived at my in-laws today at the end of a 3 day couple's retreat away from the kids (3yr8m boy and 1yr10m boy). We were both very excited to see the kids again and wondered if they missed us at all.</p>

<p>My wife was ahead of me as my older son appeared. She crouched down to the ground with her arms wide open to greet him with a big hug, but he saw me behind and ran around her to hug me.  The second didn't see me and ran to his mom immediately, then after hugging momentarily he noticed me, extricated himself from his mom, and ran to me. Both boys wanted to be in daddy's arms for the next 10 minutes.</p>

<p>My wife was heartbroken. Didn't her boys miss her at all? Do they even care about her? Would they be just as happy if she didn't even exist? These are the thoughts running through her head all day.</p>

She does have to discipline as well (no hitting, but she does raise her voice semi-regularly). Is there some way to help my boys be as excited about their mom as they are about me?

"16 month old, former good sleeper, now screams entire nap","<p>We've got a 16 month old girl who has been on a fairly regular sleep schedule for a long time now.  Recently, in the matter of about a week, she refuses to nap anymore though.  We do our normal nap wind down, and when we get to her crib she whimpers and when put in the crib she screams at the top of her lungs standing at the edge.  She will do this for the entire minimum of an hour, which we try to enforce. Before this she was pushing up to 2.5hr naps, which were great.  The nap time is on a regular schedule, and since she's started doing this she is clearly showing signs of being tired as it approaches.</p>

<p>Her ideal sleep schedule is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wake 7am.</li>
<li>Nap 9am</li>
<li>Wake 10-11 on her own.</li>
<li>Nap 1pm, or 2pm (about 2-2.5 hrs after previous wake)</li>
<li>Wake 3-4pm</li>
<li>Bedtime routine about 4 hours after last wake (bath, change, book, milk bottle, in crib)</li>
<li>In crib usually about 745-830, depending on day's timings</li>
<li>Generally cries about 15-20 minutes, sometimes needing an extra rocking, but then goes to sleep well.</li>
<li>Sleeps through night ideally, sometimes one wake.</li>
</ul>

<p>This all went out the window recently with her refusing to nap.  Its also gotten more difficult to put her to sleep at night since, when she cries more than usual.  She has always cried when going to sleep, but now more.  She has been waking more than usual at night as well, sometimes for 2 hours when she is not hungry, but wants to be awake, held or running around her crib talking/babbling to herself.  Of course, we are required to be there and she screams until that happens.  Sometimes she tries to fall asleep in our arms, but generally can't do that.  The moment we put her back in her crib to sleep she screams a piercing scream.</p>

<p>We generally have found letting her cry for a bit will let her fall asleep, but lately it is all scream or be held, a very strong attachment need happening.  How can we get past this and resume naps?  Why might she be doing this now?</p>

<p>When I correct him, he usually says ""oh, yeah,"" and then starts referring to it by the right color.</p>

<p>Similarly, he'll sometimes ask for his favorite car by saying the blue car, even though it is fire-engine red.</p>

<p>Is confusion between red and blue normal for color-blindness?  Is there a way that I can test this and eliminate the possibility that he's just getting the words confused?</p>

"Want to be Fair / Equal but Still Realistic with Bedwetting Pre-Teens and Social Issues","<p>I have two step-kids. Boy age 11, girl age 10. They both have bladder issues where they still wet their beds almost every night. The boy is a fairly gregarious outgoing personality who doesn't really care. He makes friends that don't care if he pees the bed, in fact they sometimes do themselves. (<em>clarification: He has friends who either do not care that he has to wear protective wear, or they have/had similar issues</em>)</p>

<p>The girl, however, is horrified at friends finding out she wears diapers to bed, much less that she sometimes pees her bed even with diapers.</p>

<p>The boy goes to friends houses, has friends over, but the girl refuses because of this fear. I'm dealing with a distinct jealousy on the girls part at the fun the boy gets to have because friends invite him out to multiple events but the girl has literally never been to a friends house for the 3 years I've been a step father.</p>

<p>I know that I can't ""make friends for her"" but dear lord... I'm conflicted and my heart hurts for her.</p>

<p>My wife has a serious mental health issue and so I work two jobs in order to pay bills. Our social life (as a family) is fairly non-existent (excluding holidays) so the kids don't even really circulate except for home, and the when they hang out at their dads place of business (he works in the service industry and they get to hang out at his job and play and such, but only sometimes). We don't do church (atheists), we can't afford extra-curricular activities (soccer, karate, etc), and so I'm sitting here wondering...</p>

<p>Is it best to leave her be and hope she'll figure it out? Find a friend or become more independent? She is FIERCELY co-dependent on her brother, and as they have reached that age where they are now in separate bedrooms, and having separate lives, she is mortified and lonely while he is starting to come into his own.</p>

<p>I've thought about trying to find a support group for bladder problems (if such a thing exists) or something similar so she can meet kids dealing with the same issues... but I'm not even sure that is a thing.</p>

<p>How can / should I help her?</p>

<li>Divorce : As I mentioned, they are my ""step-children,"" and from what I've gathered from both genetic-parents the divorce was rather lengthy, volatile, and stressful for all involved. Everyone is friendly now, but there is a good chance the divorce contributed to their stress and possibly their enuresis problems.</li>

<p>They prefer to watch mommy and daddy play rather than do it themselves. I think it started with drawing, we'd show them shapes, and they'd say ask for more: ""More circles!"" or ""More clouds!"" and I thought we were doing pretty good demonstrating how to draw a shape, first with a few examples, then holding their hands, then letting them try followed by praise.</p>

<p>But it seemed to always follow a path where they'd ask again for more and we'd encourage ""okay, keep drawing"" or something like that, and then they'd say ""No.. you do it!"" and if we came back to help, it would repeat - as long as they were moving their hand and such, they'd be fine. So reasonably at some point we have to tell them that they can keep drawing, but we have to continue doing what we were doing.</p>

<p>This has spread in to other activities, where when we play, they want us to drive the cars on the playmat, etc. and it seems to be getting a little silly with respect to how often they insist we do the activity that is intended for them. They just watch. It's become so that if I want to play with them, I end up playing by myself while they watch.</p>

<p>On their own, they're great with respect to imagination and motivation, it's as soon as we attempt to 'join in' that they back off completely and just want to watch.</p>

<p>Is there a good way to respond to this? Should we stop playing until they rejoin the activity? At present if we refuse, they will continue to insist until they get bored and walk away and start something that isn't really structured or constructive.</p>

At 3 months old he stopped doing the 3 hour stretch. Now at 4 months old, he'll do a 1.5-2 hour stretch and then he's up every 30-45 minutes until morning. His naps used to be okay but now he's completely regressed on those as well - doing only 2-3 naps the entire day for a total of 3-3.5 hours.

<p>We suspected silent reflux so we got him a rock n play (he's never spit up), he sleeps in that and it doesn't make a difference. We've tried co-sleeping. We've tried the Mamaroo. We tried swaddling/not swaddling and do white noise. We've tried modified CIO (going in every 5 minutes). The only thing that gets him to sleep (or back to sleep) is milk. The past month though he only drinks when in the rock n play or in his car seat, he won't drink in my arms. He was 7 lbs 5 oz at birth and now he's 17+ lbs. At his peak he was drinking close to 45 oz of milk per day, but he's since tapered off to about 32 oz. Our pediatrician dismissed his sleeping patterns and told us he was at risk for being overweight (which sounds crazy to me because he only drinks breastmilk). People do regularly think he's around 8 months though. I'm at my wits end, I don't know why my son won't sleep. I can see he's tired and I know he needs a solid block of sleep. Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be allergies (he's got a bit of eczema on his eyebrows/forehead, I keep it at bay with Aveeno lotion)? I don't drink cow's milk and I don't eat anything soy/nut related because I'm allergic. All advice appreciated. </p>

<p>edit: just wanted to add, his tongue tie was fixed. and he was a very quick all-natural birth, we've been to a chiro to fix any alignment issues and it didn't help at all.</p>

"Do pregnancy due dates accurately measure maturity (and over maturity)?","<p>Many doctors and midwives have strict restrictions on how far past the due date you can go before they'll induce labor. Some let you go 1 week, others 2 weeks. Many natural birth advocates claim that this is somewhat bogus because due date predictions are very rough estimates and are subject to a lot of change. I'm not educated on the methodology of predicting due dates to have an educated opinion, so I thought I'd put it to the community...</p>

<p>Are due dates an accurate measurement of babys maturity (or over-maturity)? Has their accuracy improved over time with new methods? Should they relied on any more than a rough guestimate of when the baby has become mature or over mature to the point of requiring induction?</p>

"How to get a 17 year old son to realize that laundry is not that hard to do and to do it on a regular basis?","<p>Our other kids that are now grown have pretty much always done their laundry since they were like 13 years old. This son is 17 and probably has only done his own laundry, all on his own, like 10 times in his life. He has a ton of clothes, probably doesn't wear most of them, but I think he tries on a lot of different clothes and if he decides not to wear this shirt or those pants, he just throws them on the floor and they likely just sit there for 2-5 weeks before he starts doing laundry again which usually ends up with him begging for us to help him finish it.</p>

<p>We've already tried explaining that laundry really isn't that hard to do, just throw it in the washer, if there's stains spray some stain cleaner on that part, etc. That it really doesn't take that much time to do it, since most the time it takes to do laundry is the time in which you don't need to do anything since it's in the washer/dryer.</p>

<p>Obviously he has other cleaning issues. I just don't understand how he can care so much about his appearance when he goes to school, but be so dirty in his room with more clothes as the floor instead of carpet. Does he have too many clothes? Should we give/sell a lot of his clothes, because maybe it's just too many choices on what to wear, in that it makes it harder for him to decide? With less clothes he would need to do laundry more, which could mean that maybe he could start forming a habit of actually taking care of his clothes on a regular basis? What can we do, really?</p>

"How to deal with my son calling me on the telephone when he is in a fight with his mother?","<p>I am divorced and have an 8-year-old son. Our son lives half of the time with me, half of the time with his mother. Communication between us parents is good, there is no conflict of any kind, and we cooperate well in raising our son.</p>

<p>Sometimes (about once every two months), when our son is with his mother and they have some quarrel that upsets him, he calls me, and, overwhelmed with hurt and anger, says something angry to me and then hangs up the phone. These calls come completely out of the blue for me, and I'm usually unprepared for them and busy with something else (I often work on those weekends that our son is with his mother).</p>

<p>The problem for me, when I get one of these upset phone calls, is, that I don't know what is (truly) going on – so I don't know what the appropriate reaction would be –, feel that he needs me (or he wouldn't call me) – so I feel I need to help him –, but at his age constructive discussions on the phone are not yet possible (and not what he needs). What he usually needs in similar situations when he is with me is time to calm down and some sort of ""making up"" when he and I are ready for it. I cannot do that over the phone, and I'm also not the person he has been hurt by, so what I often do is call his mother, talk to her, get some (biased) explanation, try to get <em>her</em> to calm down (if she is angry or upset) or change her perspective (if she is, in my opinion, overly strict) and then hope that they can resolve their conflict. Often I call them again later to see how they are, and usually they are fine, but sometimes the conflict goes on for some time, and sometimes I get a few calls with increasing emotions which then unsettles <em>me</em> because I'm too far away to actually interfere in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>I don't want to turn my phone off, because I want to be available to my son, but at the same time these events stress me out and often leave me feeling down for the rest of the day and I don't want to be what I like to call the ""trash bin"" for my son's negative emotions, when I'm not the ""culprit"".</p>

<p>I understand that in a family that lives together, similar things happen, but the phone makes these situations especially difficult. When I'm there, and he's in a conflict with his mother, I can ask him to go out and play soccer with me, and thus get him out of the frustating situation and allow him to take his attention away from his hurt so it can calm over. But when I'm on the phone there is nothing I can <em>do</em>. I can only talk, and talk doesn't help him get out of being focussed on what angers and hurts him.</p>

<p>So basically my question is, how can I deal with these phone calls? I can't always drop what I'm doing and go over there and take care of stuff. I also can't (or don't want to) turn off my phone for the time our son stays with his mother, because being divorced does not free me from the responsibility of caring for our child.</p>

<p>Mostly, I guess, I lack the abilty to listen to him and be there, but not let his emotions affect my own. These phone calls wouldn't be so difficult for me, if I were more stable in my own emotions and didn't feel so over-responsible for the happiness (not well-being) of my child. I understand that it is normal for every person to be frustrated, even sad, from time to time, but I cannot well deal with my son feeling bad, and being unable to do do anything over the phone is torture.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

"How to be a step-mom to a troubled (or hurt) 5-year-old?","<h3>A Bit About Myself</h3>

<p>I am in my late 20's, and I am a fairly-new-mom. 
I have been married to my daughter's father for about a year now, but I have been around kids my entire life. I have always had many children in my family, I'm a godparent and I'm involved in the lives of all my friends' kids. I began working with young-children when I was in my early teens (babysitting, tutoring, etc.) and still do so to this day; in fact, I've always been described as having a <em>type</em> of ""Snow White-effect"" - in reference to the mutual love I share with all children (and animals). <strong>However,</strong> I am <em>just now</em> realizing that all of the above means <strong><em>SQUAT</em></strong> when it comes to being a parent/mother! :-/</p>

<h3>A little family history</h3>

<p>My daughter's birth-mother had began using drugs approx. a year after she gave birth; which caused her and my husband to split. They were never married so there was only a custody battle, in which he won, and shortly after she left the state. Then, around the beginning of last year, she returned pregnant and sober. My husband had been allowing our daughter to remain in the lives of her mother's family, and because of how much they were helping while he was at work, he continued to do so knowing this now meant <em>she</em> would be in the picture. Unfortunately, soon after she gave birth to her second child, she sadly began using drugs again; so this time <em>WE</em> left the state!</p>

<h3>The present issue(s)</h3>

<p>It was only this past July that we moved, and so this has been a <strong>very</strong> big transition for my daughter; in addition to being in a new environment, home, just starting school/kindergarten and being away from the only people she knows, <em>now</em> she is missing her birth-mother!
:( </p>

<p>The only time I work is some weekdays, after I drop my daughter at school and until I pick her up; so, minus that time my daughter and I spend almost all of our time together, and I feel as though I'm practically a stay-at-home-mother; since she doesn't go to aftercare. I felt this would be the most ideal situation so that I could work closely with her on school and implementing new structure, and an overall <em>new</em> lifestyle for my whole family.</p>

<p>However, just lately my daughter has become very defiant, distracted, and troubled! This is at both home and now school too, where she just doesn't seem to care about anything but other kids and doing every thing she knows she's not supposed to! I have read, researched and studied <strong><em>everything</em></strong> on <strong>everything</strong> [discipline, keys to successful and happy children, etc.] NO MATTER WHAT I try to do differently not the slightest bit of <em>anything</em> changes!</p>

<p>She talks about her mom as if they did everything together, and we know that they did not. Then admitted to me that she makes up a lot of things or refers them to her mother (such as ""oh, I have that at my moms"" or ""my mom told me that""), but she still does it. She has even destroyed property (things that cannot be fixed - like walls - while using things that she <strong>knows</strong> very well cause irreversible damage) and then admitted to her grandmother that she did it because she misses her mom!</p>

<p>Obviously we knew this would be a tough adjustment for her and she could probably benefit greatly from counseling, but I still can't help thinking and feeling like there's something <strong>I'M</strong> doing wrong or that she's missing and we can't provide! Like, I can implement all of the <em>best</em> things that the <em>best</em> books and research could possibly teach, <strong>tons of love</strong>, in addition to all that I've already known from my history with children her age <em>(plus the fact that I am a woman)</em>, but <strong>still</strong> nothing will help!</p>

<p>Is it the ""child-mother"" factor that she's missing that's causing <strong>all</strong> of her behavioral issues? Am I not giving her the same kind of love/feeling/enough love? Will this pass without causing her long-term irreversible-damage? I feel <strong>so</strong> helpless and so much pain <em>for her</em>!</p>

"Is the ""cry it out"" approach harmful?","<p>We have several questions on this site that deal with infants and toddlers who cry a lot, for various reasons.

Perhaps we can find a good answer on our site here.</p>

<p>There are two basic approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Leave the child completely alone until the crying stops. <strong>&lt;-- This is what I want to address.</strong></li>
<li>Leave the child for only a short moment and then return. Repeat with increasing absences.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Is it likely to harm an infant/a toddler to let him intensively cry until he stops on his own?</strong></p>

<p>To elaborate, I have some additional questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>At what lower age/development limit would the practice be acceptable, and why?</li>
<li>What factors could help determine whether the practice would work on a specific child?</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purpose of this topic, let me define ""crying"" as real, full-strength, all-out,  non-verbal <strong><em>mommy-daddy-come-help-me</em> crying</strong>, not just whining or whimpering. Every parent knows his child and will recognize when the child <em>really</em> cries -- that is what I mean here.</p>

<p>Also, let me define ""harmful"" as not just transitory sadness but rather something where one could expect <strong>negative mid-to-long-term effects</strong> such as trauma, separation anxiety, lack/loss of trust in parents and others.</p>

<p>The crying could be related to bedtime/sleep but also during daytime when the parents aren't near.</p>

"Is my wife an over-protective parent and how does this influence my child?","<p>My daughter is 10 months old.  </p>

<p>Since her birth, my wife has never even once left the baby with me alone. First it was breastfeeding, then other excuses. She's constantly around me. Constantly checking me. Constantly enforcing her rules. It's ""her way or no way"". Our relationship is suffering very much because of this.</p>

<p>Thy typical pattern is that I suggest an activity - benign and something I suppose my daughter would like - and she comes up with one obstacle after another why this is not possible. If I put my foot down she will follow me and my daughter literally every step of the way.</p>

<p>It is always centered around hygiene and vague ""dangers"". My hands aren't ""clean"", objects like leaves of trees are ""dirty"" and she insists that I wash and sanitize my hands and wet wipe whatever I hand to my daughter. It took me months to take my daughter outside because it was ""too cold"" or ""too dangerous"" at 23°C / 73°F and my wife clearly stated that she doesn't trust me with the baby. The first months the baby spent most of her time with my wife in the kitchen and my wife is still reluctant to leave the house with me.</p>

<p>On one outing to a nearby national park when I had to carry our daughter because the trail was unsuitable for the stroller, my wife was so nervous and upset, almost to the point of crying. I tried to calm her, but to no avail. At one point I tried to show my daughter a leaf from a nearby tree and my wife objected.  She insisted that a leaf from a tree could be first poisonous, then possibly causing an allergy and finally one from a non-allergenic tree had to be cleaned with a wet wipe first, I gave up and we went home.</p>

<p>Admittedly, with all the fussing I sometimes cave in and simply desist from playing ith my child.</p>

<p>My wife was afraid of everything from the time we met each other. She's like that with our baby too. I'm the total opposite - I'm not afraid of something that I see as ""safe"". She says ""everything will change when the baby gets older"", but I'm afraid she's just saying that to make me happy. I think nothing will change because that's how she behaves with herself and that's how you'll also behave with your child. Consequently our relationship will suffer and even my relationship with my daughter will suffer.</p>

<p>I love my child and would never put her in danger, but I want to play with her and show her the world. But I can't do that if I'm constantly restricted and basically forbidden to pick her up unless I wash my hands first.</p>

<p>I have confronted my wife various times and she always insisted that I was not to be trusted, that her behaviour was perfectly normal and that all mothers are as protective of their babies as she is. Is that true?</p>

<p>Is her very protective behaviour really good for our daughter or might she actually cause harm? What can I do to make sure my child really gets what she needs? </p>

<p>Or is my wife right and she is too young to go on excursions and the world is so full of germs that it is better to wipe down everything? Am I missing something?</p>

The children spoke their first words between 7 and 9 months of age, some even speaking sentences at 10 months. They had conquered most of the basic rules of grammar by age 2, while the controls achieved a similar mastery around age 4. Longer-term studies showed that the kids did very well in school, including in math and science. By the time they entered high school, 62 percent of them were enrolled in gifted or accelerated programs. Critical parts of Fowler’s training program need further study, but his work is terrific. It adds to the overwhelming evidence that a whole lot of talking is like fertilizer for neurons.</p>

"What's an appropriate age for a Swiss Army Knife?","<p>My 11-year-old son watched a documentary on the Swiss Army Knife and is enamored with getting one for Christmas. We are in the UK regulatory sphere.  </p>

<p>He proposes to use the knife on camping expeditions either with family or with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Cadets_(United_Kingdom)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sea Cadets</a>. Additionally, I am pretty sure that having such a tool bestows status among his peers in the neighbourhood, so there is also a 'non-utilitarian' motive.  He is somewhat advanced in terms of maturity and is good-natured and he is generally not exposed to criminal influences, gangs, and the like.</p>

<p>I know there is a knife for first-timers, I cannot see the value in it and contemplate a somewhat more <a href=""http://www.victorinox.com/global/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Medium-Pocket-Knives/Compact/p/1.3405"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">versatile model shown on this page</a>.  </p>

<p>I am OK with deferring this until another year if needs be. I wonder if there are regulatory aspects to consider and if so, which.</p>

"How should a child be prepared for adulthood?","<p>How can parents best prepare their children for the difficult task of choosing a profession, and dealing with all of the (frequently tedious) steps involved in making that career happen?</p>

<p>The typical jobs most children will wind up having will set them up for a lifetime of a fixed schedule, with limited recreation time and opportunities.  Discovering this can be quite a shock to people, as introduction to professional life can be disorientating, and can cause some people to falter and fail due to not being adequately prepared for the commitment and discipline required.</p>

<p>Even worse, choosing poorly, or inadequate preparation, can result in winding up in a career that they do not enjoy, and will therefore spend the majority of their waking hours unhappily working in jobs that are performed only out of necessity.</p>

But he is showing opposite behavior to me; he is misbehaving, very aggressive, doesn't listen to me, says ""NO"", uses bad language, shouts a lot, cries on the top of his lungs and doesn't listen to me even if I uses harsh words, slap him, or beat him. He also doesn't listen to his father, throws heavy things on others, especially on his 5 year old sister. He also beats his sister a lot, snatches everything from her, kicks her and says he doesn't like her.</p>

<p>When he was 3 years old I was harsh with him. To discipline him I would slap him often and used to leave him at a relative's home (as i have to take my daughter to hospital for admission) and he feels bad about this. I think I can't reverse things now. But now harsh behavior is not working any more.

"My friend opened up to me about depression","<p>So I'm 13 years old and in 7th grade. I have this friend that I met this year. She's been a really good friend to me but I wouldn't describe her a best friend. There has recently been some drama over someone liking her and she lashed out at that person in a group text I was in, using extreme expletives. I texted her about it and asked what was up, and she said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason I yell and lash out all the time is because I am constantly sad. I'm lonely. Even when surrounded by a lot of friends I still feel alone all the time.</p>
  
  <p>I'm sorry I shouldn't have told you all of that. I'm going to go, bye.</p>

From what she's told me, I have a suspicion she is bipolar. I've encouraged her to go to a doctor or to our guidance counselor, but she says that she 'can't trust them' and that the doctor would recommend pills which would 'screw her up even more'. She has told me she doesn't want me to tell anyone about it, and I said that I would only tell an adult who can help if I think she needs it, but I if I did she would never forgive me. </p>

<p>I am thinking of getting a <strong>wide baby gate</strong> to cover the whole window up to 3.5 feet. Although, the wife now feels that will draw the toddler's attention to the glass window, and perhaps even facilitate climbing the gate and fall over/against the window? </p>

"Child wearing glasses, does he need them?","<p>I have a 3-year-old son, who has a developmental delay. He isn't yet talking, and he is just beginning to walk. We have taken him to 2 top eye doctors, who have basically said the same thing: That he definitely needs glasses, and life for him without them is very blurry.</p>

<p>This is the perscription (same for both eyes) Sph. +6.5. Cyl -3.5</p>

<p>He has been wearing glasses since about 1 and a half years old.</p>

<p>My problem is, he takes off his glasses all the time. He isn't interested in wearing them at all. If he's distracted he can leave them on, but if bored he takes them off. I haven't seen any difference in his vision if he wears them or not. I mean, he sees a toy from a distance away, even without his glasses. And even from near, when playing with small objects I see no difference if he wears them or not. I feel that it's a loosing battle to keep telling him off to put them on.</p>

<p>However the doctors say he needs them... It's hard for me to go by my judgement that he may not need them, against the doctors.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice? How could we get him to keep on his glasses? We have tried with a strap behind them, but this didn't help. He still is at the developmental stage of putting things in his mouth, so he likes to chew the arms of the glasses.</p>

"Helping teenage son to get over his crush","<p>Our teenage son (17) likes this girl, but he allegedly doesn't have chances with her (*). While we do think that this is something he has to deal with himself, it did affect his mood visibly over the past few days. He's less happy and optimistic than he normally is, and it's rather sad to see this. We haven't really said much to him about it because we are not sure <em>what</em> to say/do: saying the wrong things isn't going to make it better.</p>

<p>So what should we do? Should we do anything, or let him deal with this himself?</p>

<p>(*) Based on some answer comments, I think I phrased this a bit confusing (non-native speaker here!). While the girl didn't flat-out reject him (i.e. saying ""no""), he did approach her but her reaction wasn't the most 'open' one, if that makes sense. Basically she tried to avoid him most of the time and didn't feel much like conversation with him. So the problem isn't that our son doesn't know how to approach her.</p>

"13 y/o step-son wants to be a ""furry""","<p>My 13 year old step-son told his mother yesterday that he wants to be a ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furry_fandom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">furry</a>."" </p>

<p>A couple days ago he decided he wanted to make a cat costume. I just shake my head most of the time when he comes up with these ideas and try to remind him he's 13 now and that might not be the priority at the moment (like saving for a car and other teen boy interests). He has ADHD, so his personality is that of a very sensitive and slightly immature nature.</p>

<p>He ended up making his costume and wearing it to school. I didn't know this until after the fact. But his mother (my wife) said that while no one laughed or made fun of him in front of him there was probably some talk behind his back. It is a very small school in a very rural part of the US.</p>

<p>This prompted my wife to have him Google what a ""furry"" is and after doing so discussing it a bit further on his feelings about that topic. I'm sure the whole concept was introduced to him from spending too much time on YouTube and coming across things which may seem innocent but have longer term effects or other connotations attached to them.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to do this ""because he can be who he is."" I think the whole thing was pretty innocent but a bit <em>off</em> for a 13 y/o. After the later discussion he expressed that the costuming and what-not would just be a hobby for him, that its not some kind of lifestyle change or related to fetishism. </p>

<p>I'm concerned for a number of reasons. While I struggle with the idea, I worry more for him dealing with it all. I don't see his bio-father taking it well nor his maternal grandfather. Maybe that won't be a big deal if its only a costume making hobby. Should it be a regular thing to wear to school, etc., I see problems. Being in a small town, yet big enough for weirdos as it is, people are very judgmental. </p>

"Are children harmed by the awareness of their parent's sexuality and sexual activity?","<p>My wife and I are having our first child this July and a conversation that we have now and then is the prospect of having sex with our baby in the room.</p>

<p>I've read other questions related to this topic but I have found all answers to be inadequate...</p>

<p><strong>Here is my position:</strong></p>

<p>Children of ANY age are <strong>unharmed</strong> by the awareness of their parent's sexuality and sexual activity if the parents age-appropriately explain how intimacy goes along with their lovingly committed relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Here is my rationale:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am of the opinion that parents are best positioned to talk to
their children about sexuality because the children trust their
parents. In the context of trust, talking about how two people who
are committed to each other also physically enjoy each other will
make sense of the parent's affection and sexuality. If the parents
are concerned that the child may be misinterpreting the sounds
coming from the bedroom as violence, the parents can easily clear up
the confusion by explaining it as the noise they make when
experiencing the pleasure of love making - which leads to my second
point.</p></li>
<li><p>The earlier parents communicate with their children about
sexuality, the less likely the child is going to explore their
curiosity on their own. There are a ton of YouTube resources* to
demonstrate how sex leads to childbirth that are very academic.
Guiding your child through how sexuality functions will deter your
child from ""playing doctor/mommy-daddy/other euphemisms for sex""
games with their peers. If the consequences of sex is appropriately
explained, children will be less likely to ""play with fire.""</p></li>
<li><p>Children who grow up knowing that sex is natural, pleasurable,
and good <strong>in a committed relationship</strong> will be much more prepared
to protect themselves from being taken advantage of AND they will be
more equipped to deal with their emotions if they tragically are
taken advantage of. Children who are aware of their parent's sexuality and its expression will be able to develop a framework for how they will personally experience their own sexuality.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What I'm not saying:</strong></p>

<p>I'm not saying that you should flaunt your sexuality in front of your children or invite them into the intimacy you share with your spouse. The framework should be one that establishes that sexuality (as well as bathroom nudity) is something that happens in private; that sexuality shared in an intimate relationship strengthens bonds and affections; that sexuality has powerful consequences both chemically as a couple and physiologically if a life is conceived.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that there is no risk of harm. If you fail to navigate the issue well, I would not be surprised if the child grows up and has strange sexual proclivities, is unable to ""unsee"" what is seen, and needs therapy sessions to talk things through with a professional.</p>

<p>*Here's a YouTube video which beautifully explains how conception works with graphics appropriate for children: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFrVmDgh4v4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFrVmDgh4v4</a></p>

"How to encourage our 3-year-old, who has 100% ""miss"" at home, to use the toilet?","<p>We started to potty train our 3-year-old daughter about a week ago, after she showed the initial signs by asking to wear underwear ""like mom and dad"". We explained to her it means she must use the potty or toilet for pee and poo and she appeared to understand.</p>

<p>Potty turned out to be ""too boring"" and she refused to sit on it, so we showed her the toilet seat for kids we also bought and she was all happy and cheerful, sitting on it without a problem and feeling really adult for using mom's and dad's toilet.</p>

<p>However, ever since then she just holds both pee and poo, and crying when it's finally arriving and causing either a puddle (usually on the floor) or a mess in her underwear. It happened many times by now. Things we tried, to no avail:</p>

<ol>
<li>Telling her constantly ""you have pee? please go to the toilet to check"". Most of the times she just says ""no"" and doesn't go, sometimes she will go, sit for a few minutes, say ""I'm done"" without doing anything and go away.</li>
<li>Taking her to the toilet every 10 minutes or so even if she says she doesn't need to. Most of the time, she refuses to sit and when she agrees to sit, see #1 above.</li>
<li>After every ""miss"" explain to her kindly that next time she has to tell us <em>before</em> it happens and go to the toilet. She just nods her head and says yes but... nothing really changing.</li>

"I don't want to be an involved grandparent. How do I let my son know?","<p>I know I'm in a small minority when I say I'm NOT excited to be a grandparent. I've never really liked children, and used to be determined against having any of my own. But mainly because my husband wanted, we did have a child. He was very involved and together we managed to raise a well balanced son. Looking back, I feel my main goal was to have a balanced life even with a child, and to raise him to be independent (of me, basically). This worked out well as a parenting philosophy, although I suspect my interests and freedom were really in the forefront.</p>

<p>When our son didn't live with us anymore, we continued to have a meaningful relationship with him - with the proverbial good fences. My husband and I retired early and went back to travelling, which we love. Our son is now 27 and married with a child on its way. He's already talking about what a wonderful grandmother I'll be, how much I can play with the child, and how they're thinking of moving closer to our house so we get more time with each other during the weekends. From the looks of it, he's counting on me to be really hands on in helping them raise the child. His wife's parents are not in the picture anymore, so that leaves us to be the only grandparents. (I don't believe that not having a constant presence of grandparents will affect kids in anyway. I grew up without any - they'd all passed or lived 100s of miles away - and never felt like I missed out on anything. But that's a debate for another day.)</p>

<p>I don't want to break his heart, or his wife's, but it worries me that yet again I have to help raise a baby. It is exhausting! I'm still not a fan of kids, and even when I find them adorable, they quickly wear me out. Only this time, I'll have responsibilities without the ""power"" to discipline them - I'm not even sure I want that disciplinarian role. I do not look forward to spending all my weekends with the baby, which is what I fear will happen if they move closer to our place. I don't know what this would end up doing to our travelling plans. I just feel like <strong>once again</strong>, I'm getting into taking care of babies when I'd rather not.</p>

<p>What I can do is play with the baby <strong>for some time</strong>, babysit <strong>for some time</strong>, and if asked, advise or help in any other way. ""Some time"" is key word here, because like I said, babies wear me out soon and I'm not even young anymore. I'm more comfortable with kids over 5 or 6, when I can actually have a conversation with them. I understand that if I'm not in my grandchild's life now, I may not be when they're older. I guess I'm ok with that...</p>

<p>I don't know if this makes me horribly selfish, but that is not what my question is about. Its about:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I convey my feelings to my son (and his wife)?</li>
<li>And when? Should I set expectations early on, or wait till it starts to get on my nerves and then tell them exactly what it is that I can't handle?</li>
</ul>

<p>My husband is ambivalent - he doesn't want to give up on our personal time and space either, but at the same isn't worried about having to take care of the baby. We've talked about it, he doesn't seem to think one will be affected by the other and generally thinks that we'll just cross the bridge when we come to it. Im 57 and my husband is 58, if its relevant.</p>

"Building a better relationship between half siblings for a more unified home?","<p>My step son is 5. He's still struggling with the seperation of his parents. We have all been trying to reassure him in this home that he is loved. His father takes him for outings, sometimes, due to supervised visits his father takes his ex wife along too so she can can time in with him.</p>

<p>This is not getting any better, for anyone here. His father and I have a fourteen month old daughter. Who is not getting the same attention from her father. His spare time is dedicated to issues pertaining to his ex wife, work, or just making time to do things with his son.</p>

<p>I get it, she is so very young. She can't do legos with the boys. She can't play board games with them. Or cheer for a sports team with them while they cuddle up and watch a game together. </p>

<p>And with this divide, I feel that his son is being shown that my daughter and I are not as valuable. He makes choices. We revolve her naps/ dinner around his schedule at times. He gets to leave with daddy and go places while we sit home and I prepare dinner.</p>

<p>He has no interest in playing with his sister. None. He will play around her, or play aggressively. I make play dates now, outside of the home during his school time for her. And I see a difference in other older siblings with their younger ones. No child is perfect, and I know we are all responsible for how they learn. I am just growing confused. </p>

<p>We finally had a family outing- all four of us- for the first time in a long while. When we came home, my daughter was by herself playing while he and his father were joking at the dinner table. I was doing dishes. All laughs, but then he came out with it again: He wants his sister and me to leave. He says this probably about once a day at least. Even in passing thought.</p>

<p>He had gotten a bit violent with her before - choking her, kicking her off the couch causing a bad bruise under her eye. He has expressed violent behavior towards the family dog. To be honest, I'm not sure what else to do, and no one seems to think he needs help. Or is doing anything about it. I am not married to his father, I have no rights. I can't do it.</p>

<p>I want my daughter to have her father and brother in her life. I just don't know how to get him to not see her as an enemy? </p>

I went to the school and tried to meet her, but they said it's not allowed during school time, so I had a meeting with the coordinator and the school principal who both insisted that this is the right way of correcting the homework and said that it is better than marking all the homework with red and crossing it out for him. I certainly believe that erasing a kid's homework will cause a negative impact which already happened, he cried when he found it erased and asked ""why do I have to do it all again?""</p>

"My husband is likely the father of a child, but the child doesn't know. Is it too late with the child being 12 years old?","<p>This happened before my husband and I were together! My husband was told 11 years ago that he fathered a little boy. The mother told him it was his then the very next day she told him she was just lying to him. She showed my husband a Birth certificate that her husband signed. (Basically to try and prove it wasn't really his). My husband's name is NOT on the Birth certificate. The mother got pregnant and went and got married (her husband's name is on the Birth certificate) before the child was born. Then she came to him (my husband) and told him he was the father of her child, then she changed her mind a day or 2 later and said ""never mind I was drunk when I told you that"". Her and her husband were going through a rough patch when my husband was told.</p>

<p>We have 2 young kids together and the child in question is now 12 years old and looks identical to my husband and our boys. There has never been a DNA test done but he is really starting to look just like my husband. I believe the guy who is raising him knows (or assumes) that the 12-year-old isn't his biological child.</p>

<p>My question is will it cause more pain for this boy to learn the truth about who is real father is? Should this come out now at 12 or wait for the child to find out when he is older from friends or an adult around town? I have no question that this young boy will find out eventually. It has been out and about with people in town talking about it lately. My husband is concerned that it could do more harm than good if we press the issue now. We are at a loss of what to do now that the mother has lied about who the young boy's father is. Should my husband press the issue or should we just let it go and if the boy finds out down the road just explain to him that (my husband) was told it wasn't his? We live in the same exact town!</p>

<p>We believe our 4 children we have now will be fine either way if they find out the news now or in years down the road. There is one more twist... My husband family has colon cancer that runs in the family. My husband's grandfather died at 32 and his own father died in his 50's. My husband is followed closely by doctors along with my boys who are starting to be followed at 6 and 8 years old. My husband is concerned how the news will affect the young boy being a 12-year-old.</p>

"Should we indulge this unusual request from our daughter?","<p>I recently watched a movie with my husband and daughter entitled Cherish. It's about a woman who's been sentenced to house arrest for a crime she didn't commit. She has to wear an ankle monitor as a condition of her house arrest, which leaves her in a tricky situation, as she has to find a way to get out of her house in order to clear her name, which she eventually does, in case anyone's wondering. </p>

<p>My daughter was intrigued by the ankle monitor and decided to do some research. She went online and found that there are companies that deal in GPS devices that actually lease them to private citizens. A couple of them even promote them as a way of monitoring wayward teens.</p>

<p>She has asked her father and I to lease an ankle monitor for her to wear. I know how crazy this request sounds, so let me explain her reasons for wanting it. First, she's interested in a career in the justice system, possibly as a parole or probation officer, and is curious as to how accurate they truly are, how people react to those who wear them, etc. Second, she confessed to us that she ditched school several times last year without us ever knowing and was tardy on several other occasions. She says she really wants to be more focused on school this year and is afraid she'll give in to temptation and skip. She would like us to use the device's geo-fencing features so we'll receive alerts if she's ever late for school or tries to play hookie. That way, she'll have to be on time each day and won't be able to leave without us knowing. </p>

<p>We told her we'd need some time to think on this one. Maybe I'm crazy, but part of me wants to grant her request. I know it's weird that a teenager would actually request being put on a leash like this, but I understand and admire her reasons as well. She's said she'd be willing to wear the device for the remainder of the school year and possibly for her senior year as well.
What do you all think? Is indulging this request a bad idea or should we go for it?</p>

"Securing books from toddler","<p>We have several bookcases filled with books in our apartment. Our little Tasmanian Devil is not even walking yet, but everytime we put her on the floor, she starts crawling towards a random bookcase and tries to pull out one of the books on the lowest shelf; on occasion she pulls herself up and tries to pull out a book from the second lowest shelf. This will only get worse once she starts walking. We are trying to find a solution for this. As a first step, we have put all of our non-essential books in boxes in a separate storage space. We've also put all the valuable books in the higher shelves, and packed the ones in the lower shelves as tight as they can go, so that they are not so easy to pull out. However, we are aware that this is only a short-term solution: as she gets bigger, she'll become strong enough to pull those books out and start chewing on them, or rip pages out, or go at them with a crayon. </p>

<p>Is there a way to keep her from pulling out our books until she's learned to handle them properly? A friend suggested installing doors on the bookcases, but that would be a last-resort solution (for one, we would have to have the doors custom-fitted to our bookcases, and at that point, we might as well go to Ikea and buy a brand new set of closed bookcases). I'm thinking more like a security gate that stretches the full width of the bookcase. Does this type of product exist, and if so, where can we purchase it from?</p>

"Do parents get punishment too?","<p>Just because we are parents does not mean we are infallible. We are definitely capable of bad behavior and sometimes our children see or are affected by it. If we do something wrong that we would otherwise punish our children for, should we give some sort of notice to our children that we will receive some sort of punishment also? If so, who decides said punishment? If not, <strong>how do we teach</strong> our children from the mistake that we made and still be able to stand our ground if they do the same thing and need some form of a consequence.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add from comments:</strong></p>

<p>It's a conversation that came up between my wife and me so I'd thought I'd post it here. For the sake of the question, let's assume there is no law breaking occurring. For an example of willfully naughty, what if a parent did something from spite and anger like ripped up a drawing the child made during the child's tantrum or said something hurtful. For a mistake, a parent promises to wash a pair of pants but forgot to or accidentally spilled a drink on the child.</p>

<p>[What do you do when your child is willfully naughty vs made a mistake?]</p>

<p>Willfully naughty usually equals loss of privileges like TV/games and most recently being sent to their room for a period of time. Made a mistake usually equals spot correction with a redo. Making mistakes is not a cause for punishment.</p>

<p>I know part of the determination is due to obvious safety issues (e.g. small parts that could present choking hazards for toddlers and infants, movable parts that require more strength or manual dexterity than young fingers might manage, etc.), but how do they determine the upward bound?  Or the lower bound when safety issues aren't the only determining factor?</p>

<p>My son has enjoyed playing with a number of toys that were ""too old for him"" (toy trucks and cars that do not present choking hazards, for example), and there are a number that peg him squarely in the proper age range that seem ""too young for him"" (<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B002B555QQ"">this ball popper</a>, for example, lists a range of 9 months to 3 years, but my son started playing with it at 6 months and lost interest before 12 months; I can't imagine many 2-3 year olds finding it entertaining for more than a few minutes).</p>

Since last week, my mom told me that she is having nightmares.
As I am her best friend, she came to me last night, while silently crying, saying she had a nightmare about skeletons and mummies.
I know this is absurd, but I also know that a kid's imagination is far more powerful than mine.

"Stop a 14 month old from hurting the dog","<p>I am the father to a 14 month old son, an only child, and he is pretty much how I would expect a toddler to be.  He has an unquenchable curiosity, a need for play, occasional cuddles, intense desires to perform strange focused tasks, and a spectacular display of dramatics when he is throwing a tantrum.</p>

<p>Lately I am wondering if this one behavior is normal and how to get him to stop.  He occasionally will just kind of wander around looking for something to do, and when he sees the dog he runs over and just starts to hurt him.  He will smack the dog, grab his droopy lips or long Bassett Hound ears and pull on them, sometimes he even tries to step on him when he is laying on the floor.  What makes this even more concerning is that he is <em>enormous</em> for his age so his size and strength don't match up with his emotional or mental maturity just yet.  He registers 99% percentile in height and 90% in weight according to the pediatrician.</p>

<p>My dog is thankfully incredibly easy-going and extremely patient through all of this.  He will sometimes squeal in pain but he never snaps or displays any aggressive behavior.  He is starting to become scared of the toddler however and it breaks my heart.</p>

<p>Of course when I see it happen I physically prevent him and try to give him a firm NO!  I don't think he mentally grasps the concept of NO just yet or if he does, he doesn't seem to have the impulse control to stop himself.  When I stop him and tell him No he more or less seems annoyed.  I have also tried positive reinforcement by teaching him how to pet and hug the dog.  He will pet nicely and then give a nice big hug and he responds well to praise. He seems pleased with himself when I praise him for being nice, but then I can see his body start shaking like he is about to do something he has no control over and then he starts getting hyper and violent with the dog again.</p>

<p>He is a sweet boy but I am wondering if this random violent hitting behavior is normal in 14 month old boys?  Is this a phase?  Is this a sign that he might grow up to be a violent person?  Also what techniques can I try to help teach him NO and to stop hurting the dog?</p>

<p>My husband and I were born and raised in N, but we've disliked living there since we were young adults. It had become more so in our mid 20s, with its ignorance, casual and criminal discriminations, the callousness of both the people and the government, and <em>the absurdity of the very ""culture"" that we're supposed to be teaching our kids</em>. (Yes I know every country has its problems, but we've travelled extensively and from what we've seen, the place that hurts our sensibilities the most is N)</p>

<p>We decided we will not have a child in the toxicity of N, and moved to C. We do look different from the majority of people in C, which may prompt the questions ""where are you from? where are you <em>really</em> from?"" Once our child is old enough to see that she looks different, she'll surely wonder where she's <em>really</em> from, and all about that place.</p>

<p>I don't know what approach we should take here. Personally, I'm unable to see anything positive in the current state (or the recent past) of N.

"5 Year Old - Separation Anxiety and Preparing for a Death in the Family","<p>My 5 year old son recently started school and, his separation anxiety pre-dates school, but it has really highlighted to me just how bad it is. He gets upset when he gets dropped off at school, when his dad leaves for work, when family members visit and have to leave, when going to activities where we are in sight (e.g. gymnastics class where he could see s through the window). He starts with crying and saying he doesn't want to go to [insert place here], then he starts to breathe heavily and hugs you and then he starts to cling to the point where he physically has to be prised off, then when you've got him into school or his dad is going through the door etc it all starts again. I also have a 2 year old who copies everything he does so I am worried it will create an issue in her. </p>

<p>Thinking back, my husband and I feel like it started when his great grandmother passed away at the beginning of the year (we also lost our dog last year), at the time we explained it in very simple words - ""Granny Anne has died because she was very old and sick and we won't be able to see her anymore. It's okay to miss her and be sad."" We have also reassured him that we aren't going to die and just because someone gets sick does not mean they are going to die but he does still (9 months later) ask a lot of questions about death. He also talks - and sometimes cries - about our dog and his great grandmother which we encourage as we feel he is still processing it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have just found out that his grandmother has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and its very aggressive so she could pass away fairly soon. We have not told him yet and while he has seen my husband and I upset, I don't believe his anxiety level has changed since we found out. I have contacted the school nurses and informed the school but they are taking a while to get back to me and as it is a time sensitive issue I decided to also seek advice elsewhere. </p>

<p>Mainly, how do we prepare him for the death of his grandma without making his separation anxiety worse? Should we take him and his 2 year old sister to visit their grandma when she is very sick? They last saw her nearly 2 weeks ago and she has rapidly declined. How should I broach the subject with my 2 year old? </p>

In school, it can take him a long time to complete his work because he is easily distracted by friends and material objects, such as math manipulatives.  During class, he often moves around talking to others or humming to himself.  Once distracted, teachers find it difficult to redirected to join in the class activities.  Some similar distractibility is seen at home from time to time, but at other times he can concentrate for long periods of time (30+ minutes) reading or following detailed printed instructions to assemble Lego sets.  He greatly enjoys physical tasks and can stick with them (e.g., he can do pogo stick or stilts more than 500 jumps or steps).</p>

<p>His teachers are not happy with his lack of attention.</p>

<p>My question is, do kids out grow this?  (For example, what percent of kids show this type of distractability and what percent of adults?)  If distractable kids become distractable adults, is there a recommended method to help address the problem.</p>

But he is able to say rhymes, number, shapes, colors, etc. But he doesn't or rarely understand what I and others are speaking.

"My 3 year old daughter sometimes out of control!","<p>My wife and I have 3 year old daughter Olivia. She is lovely and very sweet at normal times. She goes to daycare everyday and am happy in the daycare with her friends. However, here comes with her problem. Her personality seems very different from others in my opinion. She is very demanding. Sometimes she insisted something very consistently. If my wife and I don't satisfy her, she will cry and crash for very long time. We don't know how to distract her.</p>

<p>For example, this just happened this morning. She finished her breakfast in the morning and my wife wanted to take her to the daycare. She insisted that she wanted to play for another two minutes and then go. OK, my wife agreed. But after 2 minutes she asked for another 7 minutes. My wife knew her personality and again agreed. After 7 minutes she still requested more time and said she didn't want to go to daycare today again and again. Of course my wife can't convince her. When my wife was trying to force her to get dressed, she became out of control. She cried, fell on the ground, took off the pants and socks, and became like totally out of control. Eventually my wife used her strength and carried her to the car and sent her to the daycare. You can imagine the process was really out of control and my daughter cried with sharp scream. Finally when my daughter got to the daycare and saw her friends and teachers, she became a little calmed down. I would guess she will have a good day in daycare. But these types of stuff has happened several times a week and now becomes a routine for her life. I want to check your opinion. When she is happy and normal, she can be very lovely and adorable. But when she can't get what she wants and we can't distract her, things become out of control and drive us crazy. Is it common or a little bit uncommon to a 3 year old girl? Or I should make appoint with mental health care professional for help?</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your advice.</p>

"Is my two year old gifted? what should we do about preschool?","<p>My son turned two in October. He's known all his letter since about fourteen-fifteen months. Also learned small numbers around then. He knew a bunch of sight words before he could speak. He used signs before then. </p>

<p>Now, at around 27 months he has started to sound out words. He can read a little bit, but most of his struggle is with telling where words end and begin. He can subtract one from any number under five, and add one or two to any number under ten. He can count by tens, and count up to 100 objects. He can count backwards from ten. He is obsessed with science. Particularly astronomy and physics. He listened to me read a hard fact book about Jupiter for a half hour today. He told me almost 100 times today that all 8 planets circle the sun, and that they are all very far away, very far distance.  He knows them all, even a few of Jupiter's moon's. Yesterday I told him a moon was a body that revolved around a planet, asteroid, or a dwarf planet, and he yelled, ""dwarf planets like Pluto, charon!""</p>

<p>He watches some dry lectures on space, and math and he freaks out while he watches them. Like he does flips and stands on his head and jumps around, like my friends two year old when she watches yo gabba gabba. He just can't hold still while he's learning, the kid is pure energy. </p>

<p>I try hard to get him to do stuff that isn't learning, like pretend play. He loves to make everything talk to each other, and tell stories. He pretty much talks non stop. </p>

<p>So going at this rate, what would preschool be like for him? I want him to go for the social skills it provides, but there are no play based preschools here. He doesn't see other kids much, but he does play well with others. Although he tends to get overexcited and can't contain himself. That usually leads to trouble without a break from the activity. </p>

<p>Should I keep him home for another year and just start him in kindergarten? Or try preschool? Do I tell them about him first? Has anyone had experienced with this? We are also considering homeschooling. Could he get enough from homeschooling?  I'm just doing whatever he asks typically now. He picked out the Jupiter book from the library. He rarely reads fiction anymore.</p>

"Should we tell our children that we 'spy' on them?

<p>We didn't directly tell him (yet) he is being monitored, but we sometimes make remote conversations (from other rooms) like: ""Bravo! You've made a nice rainbow tower, do it again!"" and ""Don't put this in your mouth"", and he responds nearly as if we were in the same room.</p>

"What to do when 18 month old doesn't want her dinner?","<p>It's becoming more frequent that my 18 month old daughter has started refusing the dinner we give her without trying it. Our best guess at why, is because it contains green things. </p>

If, later she decides she does want the food, we'll put here back on her chair and let her eat.</p>

I'm happy to give him some limited choice about what he wears but sometimes he doesn't want to wear a sweater when I or his Dad feel he should or he doesn't want to wear a hat or gloves on a cold day. He understands that if he's cold, wearing warm clothes will make him feel better.</p>

<p>I'm keen to encourage him to learn from his own experience as much as possible but he's still very small and I'm not sure at what age he should be able to make some reasonable decisions about how much warm clothing he needs to wear.</p>

<p>I'm not going to do anything extreme like let him out in a T-shirt when it's freezing outside but for more minor situations, when should I start to let him take some responsibility for this kind of thing? For example, the other day, he didn't want to wear his gloves so I didn't force him to but then I felt his hands and they were cold. He knows that gloves would have made his hands warmer so I can only assume that he didn't mind having cold hands. Also, he often doesn't want to wear a sweater in the house on a cold morning.

<p>We both find this behavior manipulative, and it puts our son in the middle, since we then wind up having to tell him ""no"" more frequently than not.</p>

<p>As for why we say ""no""... well, the full details aren't relevant, but their apartment is small, there's little for him to do aside from sit there and watch their TV (which is always on), and we want my mother-in-law to get out of the house as much as possible, since she's essentially a shut-in ever since she broke her arm, and was told she can't drive.</p>

<p>My sister-in-law drives her over to our house for visits frequently, and we also meet them at local restaurants for dinner regularly.  In fact, we average seeing them at least once a week.</p>

<p>By contrast, we only see my own mother, who lives only 5 minutes further away by car, maybe once a month or so.  My son actually gets particularly excited to see my mother because, according to what he's said repeatedly, he doesn't get to see her very often (he's explicitly compared the frequency to his frequency of visits to my MIL, e.g. ""I get excited seeing Grandma and Grandpa, because I don't see them as often as I see Grandma and Aunt"").</p>

<p>I can imagine that the time will become stressful as soon as the child is on the way, not to mention the time when the child is finally born. I guess there are so many things to consider/decide/plan that you’ll hardly have <em>enough</em> time for all that.</p>

<p>I like to be prepared. <strong>Is there anything useful I could do <em>now</em>?</strong> Parents, in retrospective, is there anything you would have liked to do (or learn, or think about, …) beforehand?</p>

<p>So far I read about picture-books and add good/valuable ones to a list. Not sure how useful this is, but anyway, there has to be more.</p>

"The toddler is being frightened of ghosts at daycare. How should I deal with the child before the fear sets in completely?","<p>I can't make out who said this to her at daycare, and it doesn't matter since I don't have any control over the daycare people.</p>

<p>Toddler is 2.6 years old.</p>

<p>3 days back the toddler told me that there is a ""ghost"" behind you. Other room was dark, and she said, ""there is a ghost in that room too because it is dark"".</p>

<p>I took the child to the dark room, took the lead and explored every point of that room to show her that there isn't any ghost.</p>

<p>She agreed to me that day, but yesterday again she started mentioning that the ghost is in the dark room. Again, I took the child to the dark room, took the lead and explored every point of that room to show her that there isn't any ghost.</p>

<p>Still she kept on repeating the same.</p>

<p>I am not worried about the fear of dark. She had that fear before too. I am worried about the ghost part.</p>

<p>The fear hasn't yet set in. This is the time to act. <strong><em>It has been just 3 days.</em></strong> How should I deal with the child <strong><em>before the fear sets in completely</em></strong>?</p>

"Helping a child who's still developing language skills to understand she's being given a chance to make a decision","<p>I'm asking about interacting with my 1.5 year old goddaughter.</p>

<p>I'll start off by saying I believe it's good for kids to make decisions and feel empowered to do so when possible.  I want to give a kid as much decision making power as I can on small stuff so she knows she can express herself, even if some decisions she's not allowed to make on her own.  She's already independent and self-confident, but it's a trait I want to further encourage.</p>

<p>As such I do what I do with slightly older children, and try to offer decisions often.  For example while babysitting her last night in a mall I would offer her the choice of where she wanted to go in the mall by suggesting she could point where she wanted to go (she loves riding on my shoulders so she can't always just walk that way on her own).  I also gave her choices like to play or go eat.  I try to phrase them in ways shes capable of understands and make it clear how she can express her answer (like saying one option is eat because that's one of the words she can say and uses to express hunger so I know she will know how to express that choice, or suggesting she points since she does that all the time to express desires).</p>

<p>Sometimes I get very clear answers and that's great when it happens!</p>

<p>Other times I don't get a clear answer from her.  That's not always wrong, she may not be up to parsing some of the questions I'm asking yet and sometimes she may not have a strong opinion either way.  However, even when I think she is capable of understanding the question and likely would want to make a choice she doesn't always respond.  </p>

<p>I think part of my problem is that I try to talk to her always when were together, to help her develop her language skills and generally allow more interaction with her, especially when were doing something otherwise 'boring' like walking places.  With me talking soo much to her though I don't know how much she is listening to me, and I suspect sometimes she just drones my words out.  When I try to ask her a question I'm not always certain if she has heard and bothered to understand the question, or if she stopped listening to my constant talking to pay attention to something else.  That's particularly hard to tell when she's riding on my shoulders as she is prone to do since I can't tell where she is looking or if she is paying attention.</p>

<p>Any tips on how I can better express decisions to her?.  That could be ways to make it obvious that she's being asked a questions and may want to pay more attention, or ways to make it easier for her to understand her options and/or help her to understand how to communicate her preferences back to me?  </p>

<p>I also sometimes feel a little odd deciding what to do when I don't get an understandable response from her when the options are just complex enough to challenge her cognitive understanding.  I know there is a good chance she may not understand me, but there is also the chance she did but didn't know how to express her decision (not every question can be answered by pointing).  If she did have a preference she couldn't express and then I pick the opposite decision because I couldn't understand her choice I know it would be frustrating for her, she imagine her sitting on my shoulders wondering why I bother to ask a question if I'm just going to ignoring her.  I don't think there is much of a way to avoid that happening on occasion, that's just part of the frustration any kid has during that period of language development where they can understand but not always respond back, but I wonder if there is a good way of explaining ""were doing x because I couldn't understand your answer"" that still makes it clear she has the right to make a decision if she expresses it and I'm not intentionally ignoring her answer?</p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>An update from a year later.  My goddaughter ended up needing tubes in her ear due to fluid buildup and ear infections.  The fluid build up was muffling sound making her somewhat hard of hearing,  After her surgery her vocabulary improved rapidly, as did her ability/willingness to discuss things with me and respond to my comments to her.</p>

<p>So it's likely the extra difficulty I had with getting her to express herself, relative to other kids her age, is that she honestly couldn't hear me, or at least was hearing my voice muffled enough to make it hard for her to understand.</p>

"9 Month old vomiting for the first time when waking up in morning then acts normal","<p>I have a 9 month old who woke up at 4:30 AM, hiccuped, then vomited.  The vomit was breastmilk white, with some remnants of solids from dinner the previous evening.  She is breastfed with the introduction of solids with each meal.  She did not have anything new to eat the evening before.  As is typical for her, she woke around 2:30 AM for a breastmilk feeding.</p>

<p>The weird part is that there seems to be nothing strange or different about her aside from that episode of vomiting.  She has never vomited or even spit up in her life up till now.  Temperature feels normal, and she is acting her normal happy self, and was her normal happy self before bedtime the night before.</p>

"How to motivate my extremely lazy 12-year-old?","<p>My 12-year-old son is a good kid, but he is extremely unmotivated to do literally anything unless I or his mother are constantly riding him the whole time.  As a young child, he was ""easy"" to raise because he could always entertain himself.  There was no fussing on long car rides, no running around grocery stores uncontrollably, and very little rambunctiousness or getting into trouble when he got bored.  He was always a pretty compliant child and has always been an introvert more or less.</p>

<p>The problem with that though, is that when discipline was necessary, time-outs and loss of privileges were never really an effective tool, because he'd just sit there in the corner perfectly content with getting lost in his own imagination.  Motivating him has always been a problem, but things have just gotten out of hand in the past year (I know, welcome to the teenage years, right?)</p>

<p><strong>Here are some examples of his behavior:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>He takes a <em>very</em> long time to complete even simple chores.  30 minutes to clean the cat box, 45 minutes to empty the dishwasher, 1 or 2 hours to clean his room, etc.  He seems to examine every little thing before putting it away, or in the case of the cat box, he sits there stirring the sand around like it's some kind of zen garden.  When getting dressed, he moves move like a sloth, sometimes sitting on the edge of his bed with one sock on, looking around aimlessly like ""where's my other sock?""</li>
<li>He uses often ridiculous excuses when we call him out on taking so long to do things.  When getting dressed, for example, he'll say he can't find his pants or something (which are in his drawer where they always are), or when doing homework, he will say his pencil ran out of lead (he knows where the extra leads are).  He will also pretend to not know how to do things he clearly knows how to do.  With the dishwasher, he will pile half of it on the counter and claim he doesn't know where they go.  Or that he forgot how to do simple multiplication when doing one of the steps to his math problems.</li>
<li>He puts more energy into stalling than it would take to just do whatever he's supposed to do.  This last winter we had an unusually heavy snowfall and I needed his help shoveling the driveway.  I told him that if he kept moving his body he wouldn't be cold, and the two of us could get it done quickly.  But after a few minutes he decided that shoveling snow was hard so he just stopped.  I said he wasn't allowed to go inside until the driveway was clear.  I got tired of barking at him to move, so he just stood there shivering his butt off in the frigid cold for an hour while I did it.  Earlier this month while the whole family was outside doing yard work, he spent the whole time pulling on a sapling that had taken root by the foundation of the house. I told him there was no way he'd get it out with his bare hands, but he clearly preferred working up a sweat on that one stupid tree than the easy job of pulling weeds in the back yard (which is the job his mother asked him to do).</li>
<li>He has started lying about things.  This is entirely new behavior in the last year.  He never used to lie about stuff.  Now he lies all the time.  Lies about his chores.  Lies about having done his school work.  When it comes time to do school work, he'll say he has to poop and then he'll lock himself in the bathroom for an hour.  We've had to confiscate his phone a few times because he will lie about being on it when he's not supposed to.  He got an F on a book report because he lied about reading it and just wrote a nonsense essay about the picture on the cover.  He even lies about stuff that there's no reason to lie about.  Like what video game he was playing during his screen time.  There's nothing inappropriate to play, and it was his time to do with whatever he wanted, so why lie about it?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I have done to try and correct this:</strong></p>

<p>We found a neat little free app called Chore Monster for his phone.  We load it up with chores he's supposed to do and assign a point value to them.  When he completes a chore, he marks it done on his phone and then we get an alert on the parent app so we (usually his mom) can verify and award the points.  You can set up prizes in the app that he can win by accumulating enough points.  We set up a point system for almost everything he's expected to do; brushing his teeth, doing his school work, showering, and (obviously) chores.</p>

<p>For a while this worked great.  He won a couple of things he really wanted and was even asking for extra things to do so he could get more points!  That only lasted for a few months until he started half-@$$ing things.  Like he would just run the water for a couple minutes without actually brushing his teeth.  For the cat box, he'd just scoop out the obvious turds and then pour a bit of fresh litter over the top so it looked clean.  When we stopped approving those chores, he just kind of gave up.  Now when he does actually complete a chore we have to remind him to log it so he can get the points.  He barely cares anymore.</p>

<p>What do I do to motivate him?  This is only going to get worse as he gets older.  My wife and I feel horrible because we're basically yelling at him all the time now.  I think the lying is a result of him getting into trouble so much.  He just will not do anything at all unless we're cracking the whip so to speak.  So far he hasn't gotten into back-talking yet, but I fear that will come soon enough.</p>

<p>Later this year there is a big retro video game convention in a city about 4 hours from here that he wants to go to.  I'm going to make it a weekend just for us.  I decided not to carrot-and-stick this one because I think he needs some man-to-man time with his dad and I'm hoping he'll open up a bit on the trip.  But I worry because he has started to display a lack of interest even in that and it's still 4 months away.</p>

"Is my child's cooperativity a trait or a choice?","<p>My wife and I are about to have a child. We wanted to know, through experience or studies, if we can influence how cooperative our child can be.

Instead he will stay rooted to his bed and moan. If he needs the toilet he will start shouting ""I need a wee"" yet will not get up without being called.</p>

<p>We keep reassuring him that it is fine to get out of bed. I understand why he may not want to get out bed if it is dark or quiet but in the mornings when there is light and activity it would be nice for him to be a bit emboldened and come and say hello.</p>

"3 year old gets bullied all the time","<p>My 3 year old daughter is a very shy and laid back girl. She loves playing by herself and will not really care if she has got someone to play with her or not. I usually look around for playdates for her since she's an only child and I want her to get used to playing with other kids. My problem is that because of her passive personality, she does not try to defend herself at all when some other child hits her or takes her toys. She will simply ask me to step in or cry if they hurt her. I usually step in and figure out a way but I am afraid she will always depend on me to solve such issues and I cannot be around all the time. </p>

<p>Recently we went to a party and she was playing in the other room with all the kids. There was another 3-year-old who was continuously hitting her for no reason at all. My daughter simply cried and did not do anything at all although the other girl was half her size. After that, my daughter refused to play with anyone at all and spent the entire evening on my lap.</p>

<p>I have never felt so helpless and heartbroken as I did on that day. How do I help her? The bully's mother and I are in the same social group which meets once a month. Should I avoid taking my daughter along, or continue so that she gets used to such situations? Please help.</p>

<p>BTW I just found out that that girl's elder brother, who is 6 years old, is also a big bully. I have tried to communicate with their mother but the woman could be least interested. She says that kids will be kids and they have to learn these things on their own and if adults get involved in such ""minor"" things, it's just silly. Wonder how she would feel if her kids were at the receiving end?</p>

I worry when I get too mad he won't have fun and it will ruin it for him.<br>
I worry if I don't do anything about it he will continue to embarrass himself, for both of our sakes.  </p>

"When and how to teach a 2 year old how to walk properly","<p>I have a 2 year old daughter who doesn't walk quietly or softly. She stomps. I can't tell whether she likes the noise she makes on our wood floor or she doesn't know any better. Her walking/running looks the same outside though.  I/we have been making attempts at educating her for weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>telling her to move silently,</li>
<li>pointing out how much more silent her mom can enter the room, </li>
<li>taking her by her hands and walk with her around the room while encouragin her to avoid noice</li>
<li>making walking slowly and siliently some sort of ""fun"" game</li>
<li>making funny faces while tiptoeing around</li>
<li>... about everything we can think of that is fun/good/better/preferable when moving silently.</li>
</ul>

<p>While she does seem to enjoy herself a lot, it has absolutely not affected her stomping. She is only 2 and definetly still discovering her body and the degrees of freedom it posesses, so I don't want to push hard. She has enough to learn and discover already. I'd just like for her to shift her priorities a little ...</p>

<p>So my actual questions are:
How long does it take children learn to walk ""normal""? Can I expect her to stop stomping soon, within the coming year, shortly after kindergarden, right before puberty? When and how can I actually start teaching her? I have absolutely no clue what is ok, expected or considered normal progress for learning how to walk. Other children look about the same when they move, but they move much more silently.</p>

I gently tried to pull the baby away from the fence, but he wouldn't let it go. He was firmly holding onto it and smiling. He wouldn't let go. So I gently let the baby's body closer to the fence, to ease the force of me pulling on the baby, and again tried to gently pull the baby away from the fence, but he wouldn't let go and was smiling even more.</p>

<p>I didn't want to pull on the baby to make him let go of the fence, so I moved the baby's body closer to the fence, and gradually bent my knees so that the baby was holding like 50 % of his own body weight.

<p>Is this kind of behavior normal, or is he having colic or some other ailment? What worries me is that there are only 20-30 mins a day when he is awake <strong>and</strong> calm while not being subject to breastfeeding, holding, or some other kind of interaction. Should I take him to a medical professional?</p>

"Wife agrees with parenting, but is intentionally less strict","<p>The situation is this: My wife and I are married and happy together, with one single child, who is still pretty young (5).</p>

<p>It is a little boy, but the question would work regardless of gender.</p>

<p>We both usually agree on parenting topics, for example what punishment or suspension of privilege is right for specific situations, and what reward or added privilege is right for specific good deeds.</p>

<p>The thing is, I am always the one dealing with the negative stuff. I take away a toy for an hour, deal with time-outs, etc. While we both take equal parts in giving rewards, there is a serious unbalance in who deals with punishments.</p>

<p>My wife's reasoning goes like this: Yes, discipline is very important, but since you'll do it anyway, then I won't risk being the one he gets angry at.</p>

<p>No matter how I try to convince her, it just makes sense to her that if she can avoid looking like the bad guy and the discipline still takes place, then why not do it?</p>

<p>Now if I were to completely stop doing discipline, that means there would be a unknown duration of time during which nobody would be disciplining, and I feel like this would be a problem if our kid was to figure it out during this time, and start misbehaving because he can.</p>

<p>I don't want to play a good cop/bad cop routine with my wife for years. I'm actually scared that, even if my wife agrees with the punishment, if she never gives them herself, the kid will think she disagrees with them and actually start talking more to his mother about problems and life in general by thinking I'm the bad guy or something. Maybe out of some sort of spite.</p>

<p>What should I do to balance things out? If things go on for much longer, will things turn out like I fear, or am I just paranoid?</p>

"How to cope with my guilt about the way I punished my child?","<p>My 9-year-old child is afraid of swimming, although he is good at parts of it. In just 6-7 days, he is now able to float and can swim a half of the length of the pool. But he doesn't go into the pool to do these things willingly. </p>

<p>I got angry one day, and punished him in a way I now feel terrible for. I told him I was leaving for home and he could come home alone. I left him behind. He walked for about 8-10 min thinking he was alone, not knowing I was following him. The road was not lonely, it was a busy road and he knew the path home, but home was far away from the swimming pool. </p>

<p>I am still feeling very guilty about how I could have been so rude to him. I asked him later, ""Were you afraid of being alone?"" He said ""Yes, I was afraid."" </p>

<p>Apparently he had called out for me 2-3 times after I left the pool, but I couldn't hear that, and then when he thought I went home, he started walking towards home. </p>

<p>I feel very guilty about what I've done. He is such a good kid. I spoke with him about this, and he said, ""Mom, forget that. That is past."" </p>

<p>I know that is past and now I can't change it, but how can I deal with my guilt I still feel over this terrible behavior?</p>

"1yo cries almost non-stop when her mother is present - driving my wife to a breakdown","<p>We have a fairly high energy toddler and a 3yo son. Our daughter is usually friendly and high-energy, but could rarely self-entertain. We've slowly gotten to a place where she will fuss or cry 80% of the time when her mother is caring for her. When others care for her, she is much calmer. However, if her mom is even present, the fussiness factor goes way up.</p>

<p><strong>The lead up:</strong> For the past several months she would often fuss until one of us picked her up. My wife would cater to her more than I would. I'd say I'd carry her around for 20 minutes out of an hour and my wife would carry our daughter 40 minutes in an hour. Her fussiness slowly grew until it got to this ""crisis"" point over the past two weeks.</p>

<p><strong>My biggest concerns:</strong> It is really starting to affect our son. Whenever my wife watches both kids, our daughter gobbles up all the attention with her fussing/crying. My wife is also extremely stressed out and calls me crying from the stress. Our son is not getting the attention he needs.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions?</strong> I keep coaching my wife to try to start weaning our child from carrying and let her cry a bit. (<strong>Update:</strong> Don't do the following) I believe we just need to teach her that crying is not the way to get the attention she wants. Unfortunately, when my wife starts to try this our daughter just cries her head off and clings to our feet. I think we just need to let her cry in an isolated place, but return to keep reassuring her. Or something like that.... ???   </p>

<p>I'm very eager for other ideas or validation that this might be a good approach.</p>

"How should I act during conflict between my child and my spouse if I dispraise the child's behaviour?","<p>We have a lot of conflicts with our son (now 7 years old, but this was not different the years before). One common situation is: there is a conflict between him and my wife (and I'm not involved or only partially involved), e. g. </p>

<ul>
<li>he behaved very unfriendly / short-temperedly</li>
<li>he insulted or yelled at one of us</li>
<li>he hit one of us</li>
</ul>

<p>This is especially problematic if the second parent is present or near, as he knows if he is in conflict with <em>one</em> of us there is still the second parent to go to.
This also happens very easily if <em>grandparents</em> are present, as he knows that they are usually more patient and less consequent with his ""bad"" behavior.
He then tries to play someone off against the other, and with the grandparents that works quite well often and then leads to a conflict between them and us parents.</p>

<p>Such situations are difficult and I wonder how to handle them properly.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Our son was in a very bad mood. We assumed that he might be overtired and/or hungry and tried to calmly and friendly remind him to be polite to us and to find out what he wants to help him get out of this situation.<br>
Unfortunately, he often (mostly?) does not take advantage of the situation when we try to smooth the way for him to get back to normal and appropriate behavior and we get into a downward spiral.<br>
We always offer him to hug him in such situations asking ""do you need a hug?"", but he refuses in most cases.<br>
Very often he is then sent to his room to calm down and come back if he can behave appropriately.</p>

<p>In this particular case, he got very angry and yelled at my wife, he did not want to stay in his room. He then also yelled at me, I don't remember how it went on but some time later he was quiet again in the kitchen and prepared his meal.</p>

<p>He then finally had accepted a hugging from me and was ok with me again. <strong>But</strong> he did not try to make up with my wife and my mother (who had left the room crying during this (for her) unnecessary conflict out of nothing.</p>

<p>I proposed to him several times to make up with the two others. He ignored that completely, sat down and ate his meal. My wife was really really upset about that.</p>

<h3>I wonder: How can I act appropriately in such a situation?</h3>

<p>I see 3 ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the one hand I know that I could force him to apologize if I stop my interaction with him as long as he has not apologized to the other(s).
But this apology is quite worthless as he only does it to get back my attention/time.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand I could - as he has made up with me - treat him completely ""normally"" and interact with him as if nothing else had happened.<br>
This would feel very strange to me, as he has hurt people who are very important to me (my wife, my mother) and I don't want them to be hurt and don't want to play /spend time with the one who did that and does not regret it.</p></li>
<li><p>In consequence of his behavior I refuse e. g. to don't read a bedtime story to him (which is quite hard for him).<br>
However, this should not be coupled to the fact if he has apologized to the others or not, but it should just be the consequence of his behavior, so it is still is free decision if he apologizes or not.</p></li>

"How to balance teaching that hard work pays vs chores for free","<p>We made a conscious decision not to give our kids much pocket money: it seemed a bad life lesson to teach that lots of free cash gets handed out on demand. So far that's been okay, and they've learned to save up if they want something expensive.</p>

<p>Now our eldest is a tweenager, and she's growing in independence. Along with this, her spending has gone up. It's nothing extravagant - she's not making unreasonable demands for the latest fashion or gadgets. It's just that now she's able to go out with her friends by themselves, she spends all her money with them on things like the cinema, thrift stores, drinks in cafes. </p>

<p>This all seems perfectly fine, but her pocket money doesn't cover it anymore and she quite reasonably wants extra. </p>

<p>Now we could increase pocket money but as stated, we'd prefer not to do that. So instead it seems a good idea to pay her for doing chores. It teaches a good life lesson that you have to work to earn money. But here there's a problem.</p>

<p>Most household chores that she's capable of doing are ""things that must be done"". They're not ""work"" per se, but the kind of everyday tasks that are part of living independently. Washing up, hoovering, cleaning the bathroom, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>When, in the fullness of time, she moves out, she needs to learn that other people she might live with will expect her to do these things for free. We do them for free. We'd like her to learn that they simply need to be done to maintain a good, orderly and pleasant house. </p>

<p>What can we do to offer her a way to earn money, and still balance these two important lessons?</p>

Our response is then to give him his bottle, at which point he washes down whatever the semi-solid may be.

"How to discipline teens for littering?","<p>We have a chore system for our two tweenagers, where we all clean up at the end of the day and they help out. So far it's been pretty good with less and less oversight needed over time, and relatively few arguments.</p>

<p>Recently I found out that when taking out rubbish, one or both of them have been just slinging it over the fence rather than putting it in the compost heap or the bin (small bags not big black bags). This doesn't seem to be every time, but it was at least 6 separate times from the amount I've just cleaned up, inside the last few weeks. Two times it was a nappy bag from our youngest which is particularly irksome.</p>

<p>The odd thing is, they actually walked out to where the compost heap is, then rather than lifting the lid and putting the bag in, just threw it from there. The bin for non-compost waste is in the opposite direction, about the same distance - so throwing nappy bags that way seems malicious. One was up a tree.</p>

<p>The trouble is, I don't know how to find out who did it and I'm not sure on an appropriate response. I'm pretty angry that they've fouled the nest, so to speak, and that they've acted so irresponsibly or maliciously. </p>

<p><strong>Some background</strong></p>

<p>One is sometimes prone to dishonest and sneaky behaviour, 12-year-old boy. The other is prone to burying her head in the sand and coming up with terrible solutions to problems (e.g. hiding rotten food rather than throwing it out until bad smells cause issues) and has a defiant streak a mile wide, 13-year-old girl.</p>

"Using pornography in sex education","<p>My son, who is eight and a half years old, has begun asking about sex more frequently in recent months. His questions are less about the reproductive aspect of human sexuality (which he understands, because it is explained in verbal and visual detail in many children's books and documentary films, both on human reproduction and animal life) and more about the basic procedure of human intercourse as well as about what adults would call lust and eroticism.</p>

<p>Being familiar with his own penis and the flaccid penis of his father as well as the outward form of female genitalia, my son seems to find it hard to imagine that a penis can be inserted in a vagina and what needs to be done to produce those enigmatic spermiums that he as yet has never seen and probably cannot conceive of ejaculating from his own member.</p>

<p>He also does not yet have any romantic, much less sexual, feelings about girls (or boys), and the only difference he sees between the genders are differences in the media they prefer. Otherwise girls are just as much fun to play with, and he does not quite understand why any person might want to kiss or caress someone except for familial affection.</p>

<p>In other words, he is still (sexually) an ""innocent"" child, but he recognizes signs of romantic and sexual activity in the adults, teens and other children around him (and in the media), and he is curious about what it all means (and, possibly, what is coming up for him).</p>

<p>I have begun to go through the books that are advertised as explaining the topic of human sexuality to children, but I have found them to almost completely omit the reproductive act itself as well as everything that has to do with sexual lust. They do mention love (albeit usually between married parents), but they do not help a child prepare for a teens feelings of horniness. They do explain (often in boring detail) the development of the fetus and the hormones of the female cycle, but they do not even mention wet dreams or intercourse.</p>

<p>When my son asks me, I try to answer as truthfully as possible, but I often find it hard to explain some aspects without visual reference.</p>

<p>When a child asks you about how something is done or what a certain thing looks like, you will find it easiest to give a comprehensive answer by showing him the activity yourself or a movie that shows it. For example, when you try to teach your child to swim, you wouldn't expect him or her to understand what you are talking about without ever having seen another person in the water. In fact you will perform the movements and ask your child to mimick your behavior.</p>

<p>For that reason, I have wondered wether or not my son might find it helpful, if I allowed him to view some (carefully preselected) pornographic images or (preferably) a pornographic movie. There are a few videos and photos on the web that to me show what I think of as tender, loving sex and that include only what I perceive to be normal, healthy sexual behavior.</p>

<p>But apart from worrying about my son telling his friends, and them telling their parents, I also wonder if this (one time!) exposure would either shock him or influence his own sexual development unfavourably. I think, neither, but what do you think? Or what alternative do you recommend?</p>

<p>However, there's a problem.  Whatever step in the process we are on, she wants to do the previous step, and only that.  Unfortunately, this is quite often an irreversible process, such as grinding coffee beans.  Thus a session goes something like this:</p>

<p>This process repeats about 10 times, once at each step where there's an irreversible action like grinding beans or running water through them.  Whatever step we just did is the one she wants to do.</p>

<p>Things I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repeating the step.  If I throw the coffee grinds out and restart the step, she goes back to not wanting to do that step.  The instant I repeat the step myself, she screams about how she wanted to do it.</li>
<li>Trying to wait for her mind to catch up doesn't seem to work.  I feel like I get the same response whether I give her 1 chance to behave before turning the switch, or work with her for 5 minutes before turning it.</li>
<li>Repeating the process.  This is hit or miss.  Sometimes she pulls it together enough to repeat the whole thing (I end up with an extra cup of coffee), sometimes she goes back to ""I DON""T WANT TO MAKE COFFEE!""</li>
<li>I can ignore her, and make my coffee, but this pattern seems to happen with any task with multiple steps in it, so it seems like something about how her brain is learning.  It feels really awkward to ""just ignore her,"" which is advice I see on many site regarding tantrums.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this a common pattern that kids grow through?  Are there recognized tricks for how to help her through these?</p>

"Playing with legos with a toddler around","<p>I need your advice on how to get my 4-year old son to play less with legos (or to play in a more controlled fashion) when his toddler brother is around.</p>

<p>Currently my son goes through a period where legos are his only toy. He takes them apart, builds something new, plays with it for a while and repeat the whole process all day long. This is fine and I encourage him to do it for now, but in a few months his toddler (6 month old) brother will begin to move around the house and will encounter the lego blocks. I am worried he might swallow them and I'm looking for a way around the problem. We can't keep them separated because we live in a small apartment.</p>

<p>Should I ban legos completely for the ~ 1year period when the toddler is prone to swallow small things? Should I introduce other types of toys (if yes, which types?) for my 4 year old to get him to play less with legos?</p>

<p>If you've had this problem, how did you manage it?</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice!</p>

"34 month old refuses to swallow or spit out food","<p>He refuses to swallow or spit out his food. We are at a loss on how to combat this issue as he won't just hold it in his mouth for half n hour. We are talking 3 HOURS + HERE! The only reason he spat it out after 3 hours is because we ended up telling him to swallow it sternly and he got upset and spat it out involuntarily because he started crying.  And it isn't towards the end of the meal either. It's become the first bite he will do it. Our rule is that when he starts pocketing food, we don't make him eat anymore. We take the food away but he is not allowed to leave the table until he swallows what is in his mouth. He also refuses to spit it out or even open his mouth. I have had to try and scoop it out of his mouth before because he can't go to bed with food in his mouth as it's a choking hazard and he will just bite down on my finger. And it is also all sorts of food. Not just food he doesn't like. We can tell it is for attention and stubborness but has anyone had their child do this for 3 hrs at a time?? We are starting to wonder if there could be possible psychological issues going on as we know he can chew and swallow fine. </p>

"Staying focused getting ready for school","<p>We have three kids (a 9, 4 and 3 year old) and our middle child is severely disabled.  My wife has some commuting challenges in the morning and thus has limited availability at the critical time and there's not much we can do about that.  As such, I have a pretty tight timeline on getting everyone ready and out the door in the morning and my attention is quite divided to boot.  </p>

<p>The short of it is that I need to find some way to train the 9-year-old to focus on things like eating his breakfast, brushing teeth, etc. on his own.  I can remind him every five to ten minutes, but it seems I have to do it every one or two before he absent-mindedly disengages and begins playing with a toy or staring off into space, etc.  It's hard for me to sustain this and nearly every morning we find ourselves rushing out the door in a blind panic no matter how prepared I am the night before or how early we start.  The time is simply taken up by idle activity.</p>

<p>How does one teach focus to this age group?  Are there some fair incentives to keep him on track and what's the appropriate behavior as this keeps reoccurring?  I've been getting upset (which of course makes matters worse), but I'm really at a loss here.  Would love some suggestions.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I failed to mention in the original post that I have a limited window of time myself due to time syncing with our European and Australian offices (I'm in EST).  There are excellent suggestions about starting earlier and baking incentives into the morning routine that won't work for my particular situation but may be helpful for others.</p>

"Ten year old is lying and seems to believe her own lies","<p>My ten-year-old stepdaughter has recently developed a habit of telling bold-faced lies to avoid getting in trouble/having to do something she does not want to. How do we respond to this?</p>

<h1>Some background</h1>

<p>The child’s parents have been separated since she was three, and for the past five years she has primarily lived with parent A and myself. She is supposed to see parent B on alternating weekends and twice during the week. B often cancels these scheduled placement times with just a few hours’ notice. Recently this has started to greatly upset the child (previously she acted indifferent or just a little disappointed). The child has always had some behavior problems, primarily ignoring people when they talk to her, arguing when asked to do something, and not following directions. She has been screened for hearing problems and her hearing is normal. She has also been screened for learning disabilities and ADHD and at that time (two years ago) she did not meet the criteria for those conditions. </p>

<h1>The current situation</h1>

<p>In the last few weeks, my stepdaughter has started telling lies to avoid getting in trouble, and she doubles-down on the lies even when confronted with evidence to the contrary. </p>

<p>The lies can be very small, for example saying that she brushed her teeth, to pretty substantial, for example saying that she did not get in trouble at school even after we received an email from her teacher explaining how she misbehaved and what the consequences were.</p>

<p>The part that is very concerning is that she digs in and doubles down on the lie when confronted with evidence that her lie is not true. She truly seems to believe that her lie is reality. Example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Parent: You need to brush your teeth.</p>
  
  <p>Child: I already brushed my teeth.</p>
  
  <p>Parent: You did not brush your teeth. I watched you walk into the bathroom, play at the sink, and walk back out without brushing.</p>
  
  <p>Child: I did brush my teeth!</p>
  
  <p>Parent: I am telling you to brush your teeth now.</p>
  
  <p>Child: (crying and/or yelling) I told you I already brushed my teeth!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She has also started yelling and crying when she is doubling-down on the lie. In the past she would usually accept that she had been caught in a lie and accept the consequences/do what she was asked to do. She was not one to easily cry. </p>

<p>We have received reports from her teachers at school confirming that the same behavior occurs there. </p>

<p>The next steps we will take are meeting with her teachers and school counselor, and we have made an appointment for her to meet with a counselor outside of school. Parent B is kept informed of the events occurring and is encouraged to participate in the process but so far has chosen minimal to no involvement. </p>

<p>As an aside, I strongly suspect that something happening when the child is with Parent B is fueling this, and/or Parent B’s lack of interest and involvement in the child’s life is fueling this behavior, but that is not something Parent A or I have the power to change. </p>

<h1>My Question</h1>

<p>Until we can meet with the counselors and get more information about what the underlying problem is and how to address it, <strong>how do we respond when she is doubling-down on her lies?</strong> We are left feeling like sputtering idiots when she is denying things that we saw happen with our own eyes, and questioning our own grip on reality. And we are not sure how to respond when she tells us something that seems implausible but which we can't prove or disprove.</p>

<p>For the big lies she has told about her behavior at school, she lost TV/electronics for one week, and after the latest set of lies a few days ago she was grounded from those things indefinitely. When she raises her voice or starts crying as in the example above, she is sent to her room and told we do not talk to each other that way. Is there a better way to deal with this? <strong>Is it important to get her to admit that she is lying, or should we just stop engaging with the lie and move directly to issuing consequences?</strong> </p>

<p>In the last few days it has become unpleasant to spend time with her or engage in conversation because it might devolve into an argument about the nature of reality. Even small things could trigger an argument. Our patience is worn so thin and we have no idea how to address this. If she was an adult I would say she is gaslighting us.</p>

<p><a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/28072/what-to-do-with-a-teenage-girl-who-wont-stop-lying"">This question</a> is very similar in nature, but the answer doesn't seem likely to help and doesn't address some of my other concerns.</p>

"How can I help the Bitten?","<p>In her creche, my 2-year-old daughtergot severely bitten by three different children now with a couple of months between each incident-cluster. The first biter moved to a different creche soon after, the second one became her friend after parents and teachers worked closely together, but the third continues to be a problem. The parents are quite aggressive and from what the teachers say I have the impression they refuse working with them but get defensive.</p>

<p>My daughter is clearly affected by the incidents as even weeks later she reenacts the biting with her doll and from within unrelated situations we have dialogues as »I cried.« »Why did you cry?« »X bit me.«.</p>

<p>It is my first child so my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I am beginning to fear there is a pattern as other children do not get bitten as often. Might there be behaviour that encourages other toddlers (all under 3) to seek her out? Which would that be?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I help her both dealing with it and avioding it in the future without suggesting to her it's her fault? I don't really want to tell her to avoid the biter or push her, but don't really know what else I can do.</p></li>

"What to do about step children who don't listen to us, don't do their chores but are being spoiled by their grand mother?","<p>My husband has two lovely boys, age 8 and 9. Boys are staying over in 
in-laws' house to finish their school. Boys are coming over for weekends and I take them to school on Mondays. 
We are having issues with</p>

<ul>
<li>following directions/listening</li>
<li>showing respect</li>
<li>asking politely</li>
<li>behavior</li>
<li>greetings</li>
<li>and ignoring.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have step up House rules, so boys know how they need to behave. They have simple rules.
For example ""Say please"", ""thank you"", ""excuses me"", ""yes""/""no"" ""sir""/""ma'am"". We want them to be polite, boys are smart, and I know they know these words.</p>

<p>Here is a problem, their grand mom (she is doing a great job ) lets them treat her as 'no one'. She serves them with everything. Last time I was picking them up, one of the boys asked for French toast </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want French toast </p>
  
  <p><em>grandma does the toast - 5 minutes later</em></p>
  
  <p>When my toast will be ready?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I step in and I explained that such behavior is not accepted and it is rude. And I told him how it need to be done</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grand mom, I would like a toast? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grand mom can I please have a French toast?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And wait until it's finished. </p>

<p>Grandmother lets them do it everytime. </p>

<p>When adults are talking at the table, they cut in and interrupt, they talk back, they do not do what we asked for, or they ask why they have to do it, or ""I don't want to do it"". When we talk to them, and we explain why their behavior is unacceptable, the older one is making faces, he is laughing like he is ignoring. 
They treat us like peers, they do not say hello or goodbye. They do not say thank you, or if they can be excused from the table - we remind them everytime, but it is getting sick, for past seven months I am doing the same thing every weekend.</p>

<p>They do not want to clean their room (the share room and restroom ). For example, if one thing is left the excuse is - it's not mine it's mark and via versa. We are trying to teach them how to share, how to talk properly, how to be polite, show respect, explain why they need to listen. All this stuff is on the house rules. </p>

<p>When boys go back to gradmom's house, our progress goes backwards. She lets them get away with everything, then they are coming over to us and same issues all over again. I copied the house rules and gave it to mother-in-law. It is hanging in the kitchen, still boys are ignoring it. </p>

<p>They are not absent minded, they have A's and B's in school- one of them is in gifted program. I believe if they know how to pray before the dinner, they can learn how to behave and how to be polite. They know how to behave at my mother's house, by the time we get into the car, everything is getting back to ""their"" normal behavior. </p>

<p>We tried time out, the older one stands there and keeps asking ""how much longer"", or he is screaming so loud that I can't stand it. We tried taking toys away. The younger one is little different - he doesn't want to disappoint you. But when we put them together, it's crime after crime. It is just making me tired of the repeating the same thing, when I know that grandmother will do it her way. </p>

<p>Also, let me add that my husband and I do things with boys - color, puzzles, learning languages, gardening. We spend time together. But their behavior it's turning us off. Last weekend, we were invited to a birthday party and we did not go because boys could not behave. Last weekend, we got late to dinner because boys waited to do their things (clean their room, take shower, vacuum their room) for 4 hours. I told them why they have to do it, that they have 2 hours etc. still nothing...</p>

All her USG done till far except the last one which was done couple of days backed the USG fetal age was 1 week ahead of LMP. The last USG she wen't through showed the fetal age to be 2 weeks behind the LMP. Our doctor mentioned that this is not a good sign as this is indicating that the baby is not growing properly. So he was suggesting an early delivery within 37-38 wk.
As far as I have researched I found that</p>

<ol>
<li>USG dating is more reliable in early pregnency when the proportional growth of all babies are consistent.</li>
<li>At later pregency the USG dating is +- 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Baby growth at later pregnency is not uniform.</li>
</ol>

<p>So my question is</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it really a concern if USG fetal age is 2 weeks behind LMP fetal age?</li>
<li>Is it enough reason to go for early delivery?</li>
<li>Can the USG dating be wrong considering a 3 weeks prior scan showed the USG age to be 1 week ahead of LMP age.</li>

I've been running in at the first sign of crying and giving her her pacifier. As of 2 days ago, the behavior started spreading to her day time routine.</p>

<p>We have a routine set up where she wakes up, eats (wife breastfeeds), has her ""awake time"", and then we put her down awake for her nap when she shows signs of being tired (lather, rinse, repeat).  She normally didn't wake up more than once or twice a night or during her naps, where as now it's anywhere from 4-7 times a night and 2-3 times during a nap.</p>

<li>""gradual extinction"" to remove pacifier dependency all together</li>
<li>just deal with it till she can self soothe</li>
<li>remove pacifier during day and deal with her, and then let her have it at night.</li>
<li>add a midnight feeding at 2-3 AM and remove pacifier during day</li>

We both got through a good portion of the game but at one point, he got stuck on how to continue. It was a spot I had trouble with also, so I pointed him in the right direction and he was able to continue.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to a week or so later and now, almost at every hinge-point in the story line, he comes and asks me ""Where do I go next?"" I watched him as he plays and discovered that the root cause of his inability to follow the story line is that he reads little to none of the dialogue. </p>

She and the children live in a different city from me and I visit for two days of every week. For the last year I've been staying in a small separate place nearby when coming to their city, and the children have been coming to me.

""Our"" here refers to only herself and the kids.  The kids have picked up on this language, so now her house is ""our house"", her parents (who live nearby) and relatives are ""our family"", her possessions are ""ours"" etc. The aim here seems to have been a passive aggressive method to get the kids to see my place as not theirs, and in that she has partly succeeded.  </p>

"16 year old boy with existential crisis","<p>I am a single working parent of a 16 year old boy. He is highly intellingent, well read and a social person - has good friends and hobbies. He also studies at the uni (currently doing a BA in math and CoS) so he is under a lot of stress. Ours is a democratic household, so he pretty much does what he wants (he had chosen what to study and where, and it'd be fine with me if he instead of studying would have chosen working on a farm or whatever.) 
Puberty hit him pretty hard and he became:</p>

<ol>
<li>antisocial, has mood swings, depression, can lock himself in his room for days,</li>
<li>claims that his teachers at high school are incopentent and they aren't worth his attention, that he hates it there, saying that he only lectures worth his time are at the uni, and missed quite a lot of lessons at high school (and some at the uni.)</li>
<li>had completely stopped working out, and while he participates in weekend activities with his friends (no drugs and almost no alcohol, we checked) his lifestye is pretty unhealthy,</li>
<li>displays the classical Holden Caulfield behaviour, disillusioned with society, conformity etc. </li>
<li>not very thrilled to spend time with family, prefers his friends (which is fine, the family members are understanding and they're ok to wait out this period)</li>
</ol>

<p>What should i do with this almost banal and textbook case of identity crisis?
I want to support him, but while in the past he shared his worries with me and if needed asked for help/advice, lately he doesn't confide in me much.</p>

<p>I made him promise me that he will discuss his problems with his friends, and not keep it all inside, and he agreed, but maybe he needs more than his friends' advice.</p>

<p>My impression is that he sometimes is almost scared by the intensity of his feelins and mood swings/depression. It seems he is also feels that he is now messed up, because he set his goals years ago to finish his B.A. at the age of 18-19, but at this time he is too distracted to study as usual and his grades arent A+ anymore.
I told him that it's fine to leave the university and live as any 16 year old, and to have more free time if it's too hard on him or if he decides to continue, i can help him with the material he missed, and if he prefers someone else, we can hire a tutor... 
but as for now, he is now not sure what he wants except for me to leave him alone to wallow in his depression. Which I pretty much did and try not to crowd him.</p>

<p>But maybe let things sort out themselves is not the best idea. Sould I at this stage try to convince him to see a psychologist (he doesn't overly excited about the discipline of psychology though, thinks it's useless, and that neuroscience is the way to go to achieve real results) or just let him 'grow out of it'?

"How should I handle academic disagreement with a teacher?","<p>A second grade teacher of a friend of my daughter taught her class that Columbus was not a nice man, and explained why.  My daughter was not affected by this teaching. However, it brought up the question of what should I do when/if this happens to my daughter?  Whether or not Columbus was a nice man, second grade is not the time to teach this and therefore I disagree with the teacher.  What should I do should this happen in a class my child is in?</p>

"What age do children understand what it means to hide?","<p>My 4-year-old niece doesn't understand yet the difference between <em>not seeing</em> and <em>not being seen</em>: when she wants to hide from someone, she simply closes her eyes, and that's it.</p>

<p>For example, when somebody comes home she likes playing the ""Let's pretend I'm not here"" game, and then... Sometimes she hides properly, for example under a table, but other times she simply covers her eyes with her hands, or buries her face into the couch, and just stays there, in plain sight. Clearly, she is following the rule ""If I can't see you, you can't see me"". When will she realize what it really means to hide? Given her ability to speak, play, draw, and do everything, I'd expect her to know better. Clearly, I'm wrong, and I'm not worried by this, but I'm still curious about how long this will continue.</p>

<p>I've found <a href=""https://theconversation.com/young-children-are-terrible-at-hiding-psychologists-have-a-new-theory-why-67979"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an article</a> explaining that this is done by pre-schoolers, but it doesn't clarify how long it lasts, and ""when they go to school"" seems way too late (but of course I might be wrong!)</p>

<p>So, what age do children realize that covering their eyes does not mean to hide?</p>

"Using a visual device to indicate good/bad behavior status for toddlers","<p>My 3 year old has a habit of not eating her dinner. It's been our policy to tell her if she's not going to eat, she can just go to bed. Sometimes she's happy to do that, so we wanted to further discourage the no-eating behavior by saying if you don't eat your dinner, you can't have a snack the next day.</p>

<p>So, we ended up making a little fridge magnet with a red side and a green side (since she knows colors and what red/green mean) and if she eats her dinner, we will turn it to the green side so that the next day she can look at it, know she can have a snack that day, and associate it to having eaten the night before. and of course, the opposite for not eating. She's picked up on the concept very quickly.</p>

<p>Is this a good technique? Part of me feels there's something about this that is going to backfire, or end up contributing to some negative behavior. Anybody tried this before? Anything in child psychology studies?? If it works for dinner time, could the same technique be used for other things like taking naps, cleaning room, etc?</p>

"At what age can children understand and respond well to discipline?","<p>When my daughter was 6 months old, she liked to crawl over to our floor lamp and play with it (which is dangerous).  Instead of trying to correct her behavior, we simply moved the lamp behind a child gate.</p>

"Should I stop teaching my toddler a second language if his exposure to it will be limited?","<p>I have stared to talk exclusively in English to my son when he was less than 6 months old. However, we have decided not to move to an English speaking country, so I ended up practically alone.</p>

<p>It's been two years since then (he's 2y7m old now) and he clearly understands (my) English (he does know colors in English, cars, can count in both languages to ten...), although he answers in Slovak.

"When does an adoption ""sink in"" for a child?","<p>We adopted our six year-old son at age one.  When he asks questions or makes comments about the first year of his life, or when he was ""in momma's tummy,"" we have never lied to him.  We tell him we didn't know him yet because he used to live with a different family when he was a baby.  However, this information always goes straight over his head, and he shows no further curiosity.  It's like the idea seems completely absurd to him, so he ignores it.</p>

<p>I had a friend who found out when he was 18 that he was adopted, and the sudden revelation really shattered his sense of identity.  I had hoped to spare my son much of the same difficulty by being open about it from the start, but it seems he is headed toward it suddenly ""hitting him"" one day anyway.</p>

<p>Should I sit my son down with this express purpose and hammer the idea until he understands?  He has very strong ADHD-like behavior, so we occasionally have to do this for other concepts.  Or should we continue answering him truthfully but not pressing the matter?  Is there a certain age or stage at which he will be more receptive to the information and we can expect natural curiosity to prompt him to ask us more questions?</p>

"My 4-year old son - in preschool full time - only wants to stay home without kids in his free time. Should we be concerned?","<p>My son is 4 1/2.  He's been in daycare and preschool since he was 6 months old.  As such, he has been surrounded by other kids every weekday for his whole life.  As an introvert, I totally feel empathy for his situation.  He sometimes complains to me and my husband that when at school, he wants to be left alone or have quiet/alone time. However, when we talk to his teachers about this, they act surprised and say that he's as active, social and talkative as all the other kids. </p>

<p>On the weekend, he wants nothing more than to enjoy his ""stay home day."" He wants to stay home and play with his cars and trucks, and it's hard to get him to go out.  I sometimes let him stay home...but I start to get cabin fever and feel like we both get bored and start getting frustrated with the situation.  So, I struggle with this -- is it good to give him that experience of just enjoying being at home?  Is this a sign that his environment is not right for him and he's out of balance?  Or, should we schedule activities and outings and recognize that he's just never going to want to shift gears, regardless of what he's doing?  My inclination is to give him one solid day at home and then schedule something fun for us to do on the other.  </p>

"How can I encourage my 4.5 year old daughter to eat without needing tons of time along with play?","<p>It seems that our daughter is not so fond of most foods.  She is fond of milk though - any kind of milk, cow, goat, even soy. While eating I get the feeling she is bored. She eats very slowly and not all the foods. Actually very few. So, in order to eat, we got into the bad habit of playing at the same time. This started at a very young age. When I say ""playing"" I mean ""playing together"". This slows eating a lot. Yesterday it took her 1.5 hours to finish her food and at the same time we finished a nice Lego construction with a semi-complicated story in between bites.  The story included castles, dragons, knights, and a princess. Maybe I am bit over the edge, but you see my point.</p>

<p>In other words, if there is no playing she doesn't want to eat (thus, she doesn't eat at school). Strange is that she can eat by herself when in company of her cousins and eat all together (safe space?). </p>

"How can I help my parents?","<p>Hope this is the right place to ask this question because it's upside down: I'm the child and don't know how to help my parents, so I need an advice.</p>

<p>My parents have always had a lots of arguments since I have memory. They have really different kinds of personality and hobbys so they don't do a lot of activities together. I can remeber a lots of arguments where my mom ended telling me ""I don't leave your father because I want you and your brother to grow up with a family"". I have always believed this to be true.
The situation between them has never really improved but I'm not sure how things have been lately. At 19 I started university and since then I've not been frequently at home, and after I moved with my girlfriend. Since more than a year I came back to my parent's house (love is gone...) but in a different flat with my brother, where I still live even if it's temporary. I don't spend a lot of time with them because I don't have much time: work, friends, my actual girlfriend who works abroad and our project to move together... A lots of stuffs absorb all my time.</p>

<p>This morning my mother came to me crying and saying she can't really stay with my father anymore. I know (because she told me) there was a lots of family related reasons to ""not break the family"" even in recent past. Her mom was sick, my brother had personal problems... But now all these are gone and she has already started a new life. She stopped staying always at home and she is now involved in community related activities with new friends. She seems happy.
She says yesterday she was arguing again with my father and she is scared because he doesn't accept the fact she wants to break up and he seems to be somehow violet. Not physically(until now) but she is scared.
I remember in my childhood my father being excessively aggressive with my mother during some arguments. I think he has never really beaten her but sometime he has been verbally rude, screaming and advancing at her so that she had to step back. And a couple of time she came to my bedroom crying because she said she was ""scared as hell"" by my father during an argue.</p>

<p>What can I do? I really think my father is way too aggressive, but probably he has never really beaten my mother (can't be sure, she wouldn't tell me) and would never really do it. I believe my father is just a bit desperate in this situation because he has not a lots of friends, he's not (at all) an open-minded person and he doesn't want to be left alone and/or somehow forced to change his life.
I really hope to provide them help so that things can resolve without external intervention, also because my brother (despite older than me) is really attached to my parents and a ""hostile/legally"" separation will strongly impact him. But what can I do to really help them? Should I prioritize my mother fears even if I think they are a bit exaggerate? Should I talk to my father even if I don't think he will listen to me because he's too stubborn?</p>

"Teaching a child 2 languages that are not part of their environment","<p>I've seen a few question regarding language, but none that fight my current situation.

"How to stop my 4-year-old from having tantrums at preschool?","<p>My 4-, soon to be 5-, year-old daughter has temper tantrums at preschool. She does  not have them for me and has not had them for me for the past couple of years. I never fed her temper tantrums. It took my husband longer to get the point, but thankfully she has quit having them for him as well.  </p>

<p>The problem I have is that she is doing great academically. She can read, write some, color, spell, and some very basic math. Her preschool teacher insists she thinks she is on the autism spectrum due to her ""behavior problems"". They treat her temper tantrums like she can not control them. But she can and she does. My daughter does not like to do certain things. She does not like to color, but loves to play with crayons. Don't get me wrong, she can color and stay in the lines...but it is not her favorite activity. So, if she is required to color for an activity at school, she will throw a fit knowing full well she will get put in time out and get what she wants...she doesn't have to color.  </p>

<p>My problem is that most people (teacher and other support staff) speak to me as though they feel the temper tantrums are my issue. I strongly disagree. She does not behave that way for me and I don't allow it. If she throws a fit for me I either speak very sternly to her and make clear the consequences (and I follow through <strong>every</strong> time) or I simply ignore her depending on the situation. The result is that she behaves for me.  </p>

<p>What am I supposed to do about her throwing temper tantrums for others when I am not there? These are definitely temper tantrums and not meltdowns as she calms as soon as she gets what she wants...per teacher. Even when she did have them for me I could quickly get it to end.</p>

<p>I agree that temper tantrums in toddlers are often an indication of bad parenting...but what about bad teaching? I feel they are attributing her temper tantrums to something she can't control, when clearly she can. </p>

"When can a toddler be taught that dropping unwanted food on the floor is unacceptable?","<p>Teaching a young toddler to eat solids can be challenging, particularly when they reach the stage where they want to control the feeding, and insist on feeding themselves.  </p>

<p>It is also messy.</p>

<p>Lots of food ends up on my son, on me, on my wife, and on the floor.  Much of that is accidental.</p>

<p>At 15 months, my son does fairly well now putting food into his mouth (unless it is particularly slippery).</p>

<p>However, if he decides he no longer wants something that he has in his hand, his typical response is to drop it on the floor (it is almost never dropped on the table).  If he is walking with a snack, and decides he doesn't want it anymore (whether he's just tired of it, or sees something else he wants more, like his bottle), he will pause, and then carefully and deliberately drop it <em>behind</em> him.</p>

<p>If he has multiple pieces of food available to him, and decides he doesn't want them, he insists on pushing every single piece out of his immediate reach, usually by sweeping his arm across them or brushing vigorously with his hand.</p>

<p>He doesn't throw food, and there doesn't seem to be any element of defiance to his actions.  It is simply ""I'm done with this, so I'll drop it/move it away from me"".</p>

When she was caught, she obviously offered up a bunch of lies and denials, and for this I have to ground her. My question is what happens after the grounding?</p>

<p>I work in IT, so I am not new to this kind of media or unaware of the dangers and issues it presents. I have full knowledge in how to lock down her devices and put content filtering in place or a whitelist of allowed services, but let's be honest, I can no more stop her than I could stop a tidal wave. I can restrict her access, lock down the computers, search her devices periodically, but there are still friends' houses and a multitude of other ways she could and will access this stuff. I would like to believe otherwise but it's just too prevalent in our society, and everyone she knows is doing the same.</p>

Nothing of the sort happened, she just wanted to run around wet instead of be dried. We both corrected her that no one hit her, that we just dried her.</p>

<p>I imagine that she is ""lying"" because well, at least in the first instance, she is used to only falling down because of her elder sister pushing her.

"Should I be concerned about my 1-year-old and her mother moving in with a man I've never met?","<p>About 8 months ago, I and the mother of my 1-year-old child separated. Everything was mutual and amicable and we have a reasonably good relationship now - if a bit awkward.</p>

<p>This weekend, when I returned my daughter to her mother, she told me that she's moving in with her boyfriend (of 3 months or so). I have a couple of concerns about this however.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Her new boyfriend is (I'm told) a policeman, and so theoretically is safe to be around children. I don't know this man (even his name) and I feel like I ought to if my daughter is living with him and at least be able to verify his identity.</p></li>

"How do I get my 4 month old to nap longer than 15 mins","<p>I can't seem to get my 4 month old boy to settle in his cot for naps. I have had to feed him to sleep, hold him for a while and then transistion him to his cot - in which he would just wake up 15 mins later screaming. Most of the time it's because he needs to burp (I do try to burp him and also feed him in an upright position to minimise burps). </p>

<p>Note: Night times are ok. I do feed to sleep and he wakes a couple of times (before I go to bed) to burp but at some point he just goes to sleep on my breast and I put him in his cot and he wakes either twice, once or not until morning for a feed. </p>

<p>I have ended up for months just holding him while he sleeps because id prefer him to nap and get quality sleep than to just have a total of 45 mins to 1.5hrs a day across his 3 naps. </p>

<p>I tried CIO today without a feed before hand - following the eat, play, sleep routine. First nap he cried for 2 hours and I really wanted to follow my sleep schedule so I got him out of his cot at the time he's supposed to be up - fed and played with him. He seemed happy but I knew he was tired. </p>

<p>Second nap was the same. Screamed when I put him down (rocking doesn't work with this kid) and he cried for 1hr 10 mins before I needed to pick him up because my 2 year old son was also trying to nap. I ended up feeding him and he napped for 30mins before needing a burp. Putting him back in this cot resulted in more screaming. </p>

<p>Third nap he was rubbing his eyes so I put him down in his cot straight away and he screamed until it was bath time. 1.5 hrs later. </p>

<p>Without feeding him, how do I get him to settle himself even when he's hysterical? I have picked him up and soothed him a couple of times but he just smiles at me. I've tried patting but he just cries, I've tried white noise and he doesn't care. Should I just continue the CIO even though he's taking hours and still not remotely close to falling asleep? i know I've only done it for one day but it just seems like he's not going to give in. </p>

<p>Any help would be fantastic. </p>

"Am I wrong in what I did? Locking a door on a screaming toddler at bed time!","<p>Our first son would cry every night for my wife to come lay with him to go to sleep.  At 3 years old, it continued.....every night.  My son would be put to bed and he would start his whine - ""Mommy, come lay with me....Mommy, come lay with me.... "" (this was after we spent the time reading a good night story to him)  It was now at the point (a 1.5 years of EVERY NIGHT) where I had to get up and go to his room and tell him he needed to go to sleep and mommy was not going to come lay with him. </p>

<p>I told him if he did not stop his crying, I was going to close the door.  He did not stop his crying - so I closed the door.  He then got up and opened the door and started the whole ""good night crying program"" once again.  I of course went back and closed the door - he got up and started again.   </p>

<p>So, I did what I could to lock the door (a friend of mine told me that he had to lock his son in his room in order to break this bad bedtime crying habit).  I did not have a door on his room that was lockable from the outside - so I tied a series of neckties from the doorknob over to another doorknob. My plan was not to leave him locked in the room all night long - but to get him into an understanding of what sleep-time is supposed to be....Sleep Training - right?  Well, my 3 year old son went out of his mind throwing books and everything he could get his hands on around the room. </p>

<p>My wife felt that this was very cruel and eventually gave in. She continued to get beckoned to his room <strong>every night</strong> so my son could twiddle her hair in one hand while he had his other hand's thumb in his mouth.</p>

<p>I did not think that this was cruel; however, my wife, 14 years later, is still bothered my this. Can someone kindly offer their thoughts? </p>

"How to deal with a preteen's sudden unhealthy obsession?","<p>Say a preteen girl is going through an unhealthy obsession. I know many people go through a phase of extreme obsession with something at some point, whether it's with a celebrity, a school crush, a band, etc, but it almost always subsides eventually.

"Are there any dangers or downsides to white noise as a calming tool","<p>We find white nose to be extremely effective for soothing our 5-week old son. Loud white noise (60 decibels or so) will help soothe him when he is overtired and crying, and if we play soft white noise (40-50 db) near him as he sleeps he is much less likely to fully wake himself up when he stirs.</p>

<p>But I have a few concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Will hours of white noise a day cause hearing damage? We make sure that sustained volumes are always less than 60db which is below any level for hearing damage, but the temptation is to have it going whenever he is asleep and I can't find any data if long term, low volume of a constant sound can be detrimental to an infant's hearing.</p></li>
<li><p>Will this become a crutch he will need to get to sleep even when he's much older? On one level that wouldn't be so bad since it is extremely easy to provide (just flip on an iPhone app). But I'd hate to make things more difficult for us down the line.</p></li>

"Can a toddler spend too much time with books?","<p>Back when we were still expecting our son to be born, we were told all about <a href=""http://www.cfs.purdue.edu/itsi/briefs/EffectsOfSharedParent-InfantBookReadingOnEarlyLanguageAcquisition.pdf"">how important it was to read to our son</a>, even <a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/217722-benefits-of-reading-to-an-unborn-baby/"">before he was born</a>.</p>

<p>Being avid readers ourselves, my wife and I felt this was a good idea.  We read to him daily, both before he was born and after.  Now, at 16 months, it is firmly a part of his daily routine.</p>

<p>However, I'm starting to wonder if it is perhaps <em>too</em> much of a part of his routine.  </p>

<p>The first thing he does in the morning after eating is to ask for a book.  He wants us to read to him constantly.  While he does play with his other toys, books are his clear favorite.  Its not uncommon for him to ask that the same book be read to him 7 or 8 times in a row.</p>

<p>He gets plenty of physical exercise, and I don't believe he spends too much time reading during daycare on the weekdays, but it seems like as much as 50% of our direct interaction with him may involve reading to him.  </p>

<p>Beyond our own patience and tolerance, is there a point at which we should say ""no more books; go and play with your other toys""?  Can too much focus on books interfere with his development of other skills?  If so, how do you tell when you are reaching that point?</p>

"Allowing freedom of choice to toddler/preschooler isn't working, what next?","<p>I've read a lot about giving children the freedom to choose between <strong>acceptable</strong> choices, to make them feel like they have some control over things and hence reduce tantrums. And I was pretty convinced by its effectiveness. </p>

<p>Until my 3.5 years old nephew was offered a choice between A, B and C, and he immediately chose D. Cue tantrum, because his mother couldn't/wouldn't allow for it. Here are all the variables in the scene:</p>

<ul>
<li>He'd been coughing for a long time, so his mum decided it was time to use the inhaler mask. He resisted like he always does, so she offered him the choice : ""who gets to hold the mask to your face - you can choose between me, dad, and aunt"". He immediately says nobody. Mom offers, ""So do you mean to do it yourself?"" And he explains, ""NO!! I said nobody!"". (I may be imagining it, but he said it with a smirk so he knows this is a way out and is using it well) That wasn't an option, of course and it blew into a tantrum.</li>
<li>Not using the inhaler mask ""to show him the consequences"" wasn't an option. He'll cough his throat dry, but still won't realize he needs it or ask for it himself.</li>
<li>They've only recently started the choice system, somewhere after his 3rd birthday. Before that, they just used to tell him he's got to do {stuff}, he'd say no, they'd reiterate the same thing, he'd still say no and so on. His parents have always had to plead, distract, trick, and scold him into doing anything and almost always takes a LOT of time.</li>
<li>He's generally a stubborn kid who has the toughest time transitioning from one activity to another.</li>
</ul>

<p>There has been at least one other time where giving him a choice didn't work. It was about having to go out and getting to choose a shirt. Is he too old for the choice system? Did they start too late? Why isn't it working? </p>

<p>And what should the parent do when the child insists on an option that wasn't offered? We can say that's not allowed and all that, but how do we avoid a tantrum while we're denying the child his choice?</p>

"How to choose a psychologist to do a psychoeducational assessment?","<p>I am trying to choose a psychologist to do a psychoeducational assessment of an 8 year old with no diagnosis but with attention issues.</p>

<p>I have received a dozen or so glowing recommendations from parents and a small number from the child's school, but I do not trust most of them because when I check out the clinicians I find some are not licensed, some are not members of the American Psychological Assn or the state psych association, and others have web pages that feature therapeutic approaches that are panned in published reviews of the literature.  Also, some are not on the list of approved vendors of my insurance.</p>

<p>In my search, I will focus on the few remaining names and the names on the approved list of providers.</p>

<p>I would like to get some information from the psychologists to help me choose one.  What questions might I reasonably ask a clinician to get relevant information to make a decision? What might I look for?  Or how else might I go about choosing such a psychologist?</p>

<p>Addendum: I am looking carefully at what I can find about the clinicians.  The dissertation abstract from one is available online.  It contains illogical phrases (or simply grammatical errors).  Carelessness in preparing a dissertation makes me worry about the level of professionalism of this clinician.</p>

<p>Addendum 2: I have researched the first 30 or Ph.D. psychologists listed in the approved providers booklet (out of a total of about 150).  So far 2 seem like they might be appropriate.  In addition to the reasons above, I found listings of the specialty areas or interests for some of the clinicians and their interests are not relevant.</p>

"How should we support 16 year old step sister who ran away from home","<p>We're in Canada, if that's relevant.</p>

<p>My partner and I live by ourselves (late 20's), and my partner's 16 year old step-sister has recently fled an emotionally abusive home life (no physical abuse so far as we can tell). Because there's no physical abuse, we're finding it much harder to determine how we should evaluate the situation - damage is much less tangible. </p>

<p>How can we, as outsiders, tell how much emotional abuse is ""too much"", to the point where it's beneficial for a teenager to be removed from their parents? Is it appropriate to react to this situation by offering to host her while she figures things out? Are there best practices or guidelines for what to do when on the receiving end of a runaway?</p>

<p>What factors should be considered when deciding whether we should support her independence, try and push her and her parents back together, or try to stay as neutral as possible in everything?</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> While previously on friendly terms with the parents, they've gone somewhat ""off the rails"" now and lashed out at anyone who has contact with their daughter. They follow her friends on social media (she's blocked them), hunting for untagged pictures, and wait outside her school to find out where she's staying etc. I would be hesitant to try and confront the parents about the situation and try and have a reasoned discussion, as they're unstable enough to fall into ""scary"" territory.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
For anyone who happens upon this, I figured it was worth updating how it played out. Roughly 2 years on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Step sister was reasonably well prepared to run away, as much as a 16 year old could be. She stayed with her biological sister for a short time but the sister was not in a position to support the step-sister (same family, similar situation, also ran away when she was younger)</li>
<li>We hosted the step sister for just over a year</li>
<li>Her parents went a bit more crazy, abusing each other, threatening to show up at our house and take her back, nothing actually happened though (we got a heads up they were on their way over, so we left and locked all the doors, no idea if they actually showed up)</li>
<li>Entire side of the family cut us off, which was difficult for my partner but easier when it was so obvious who the terrible people were</li>
<li>Eventually it came out that there was some physical abuse, but ""not that bad"" (not downplaying physical abuse, just saying the step sister considered the emotional abuse to be more impactful, which says a lot...)</li>
<li>My partner helped step-sister get settled, got all the needed ID (parents held it hostage), got a driver's license, etc.</li>
<li>Step-sister did a few therapy sessions, but was not eager enough to continue on her own</li>
<li>Step sister graduated high school (yay!) and did a year of university in a program that supports those who don't really have the skills or knowledge to be in university. This was a personal goal of step-sister.</li>
<li>As you might imagine, university went terribly. No study skills, too much life to live out from under oppressive parents</li>
<li>Now she's mostly living a mundane adult life - job, boyfriend, friends, etc.</li>

I emphasized that he should spend some time saying goodbye to our cat and bringing him any comfort he can. My wife and I did <strong>not</strong> tell him that we were going to euthanize the cat.  We sent him to play at his grandparents house (who he frequently sees and spends time with anyway, so nothing would strike him as unusual about this) the day we euthanized our pet. When it was over, we called him and told him that he had to come home because our cat had died. We let him see and pet the body. We also let him see me bury the body in the backyard, where we all said a few nice words and shed some tears.  My son asked a few questions (will our cat be in heaven, etc.), but didn't seem to take the situation too hard.</p>

Recently I told my wife that I want to move to another state because my new job lets me work remotely and the state we are in now has killer property taxes and cost of living (because it's so close to NYC, and I no longer need to be). </p>

<p>""We can find a much nicer house with warmer weather and pay much less for it,"" I said to my wife.</p>

<p>She however is reluctant to move because her extended family is here. My first daughter is also siding with Mom because her friends and grandparents are here. And she grew up in this house.</p>

<p>Now suddenly I am the bad guy who is putting money and a bigger house over family and friends. So the parenting side of this dilemma is what impact will this move have on my daughter if I go through with it? What will it teach her about what are our priories in life?</p>

<p>Just the talk of moving right now brings tears to her eyes. Should I call it off for her (and for my wife of course)?</p>

"What are some good games, books (or any suggestions) to teach my 10 year old more patience and persistence?","<p>My 10 year old gets frustrated very easily. When I ask her if she'd like help or suggestions she says ""no!"". She'll often become angry and then give up. I have some of these tendencies (except being so hard on myself). I think it's  combination of :</p>

<ul>
<li>She's actually quite talented at things an thus has not had to learn persistence. (Her twin sister has always had to work just a bit more at learning physical things and is quite tolerant of failure). (I think she gets that from her mom, who, as a child only pursued things she was talented at.)</li>
<li>Is intolerant of failure, feels that it's an indictment of <em>her</em>.</li>
<li>Very focused on the outcome not the process even if it's something she enjoys. (""Am I done yet?"") </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I've tried:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Asking if she wants hints, suggestions, help, or me to do it for her. I try very hard to take her lead and stand back (even letting her fail) if she so desires. That would be fine except that she gets made (not very adaptive behavior)</li>
<li>Telling her to take a break (starting by asking, but demanding a break if she starts breaking things or gets abusive toward someone helping her) letting her know she deserves a rest.</li>
<li>Asking her to write down (or video taping) her feelings about the frustration and subsequent solving of the problem so she can develop the confidence that she will be able to accomplish the task. </li>
<li>Pointing out the few problems (worth solving) are solved with the first attempt. I've shown her the various editions of the company catalog I create every year or two, showing her the first one (from 1997) and how awful it is but that it got better each year.</li>
<li>Got her the Lego Mindstorms she's wanted for over a year (for xmas) (after letting her test it out @ a friend's house, where she was remarkably patient). She hasn't played with it much. (I'm going to help her (as much as she wants) this weekend again).</li>

"At what age or developmental milestones is it safe to leave children unattended?","<p>I'm curious what kind of criteria others are using to decide when a child can be left at home unattended for a period of time.</p>

<p>I realize that the answer is going to depend on a few factors: The child's safety awareness and knowledge of what to do in a particular situation; their age; their maturity level; how long you intend to be gone; how far you're going; etc.</p>

<p>For a more concrete example: My daughter is 7-1/2, knows right from wrong, how to use a phone, our phone numbers, 911 (US emergency services number), not to answer the door unless we ask her to, not to mess with the stove, etc.  Is it conceivable that she's old enough to stay home alone for relatively short intervals?</p>

<p>We'd have to start with very short (5-10 minutes) intervals until both our and her confidence were built up, but I think she should be able to gain the confidence to be left home for longer than that.  I don't think she's old (or mature) enough to be left in charge of her younger siblings yet, but she could entertain herself and stay out of trouble.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This is about children taking early steps towards independence at home.  I know that when I was a teenager, my parents left me at home alone while they went shopping (which can be an all-day event with my mother :-) ) or even spent a weekend away.  They trusted that both the house and I would be in one piece when they came home.  But those weren't my first times being left at home alone -- this question is about the first steps one takes towards that level of independence.  When is the right time to start?  What are you looking for in your children that makes you think: ""They're ready to begin this particular journey?""</p>

"Does my toddler have night terrors or anything else?","<p>My daughter is 2 years and 7 months old. Sometimes at night, she starts crying badly during sleep and wakes up, but does not stop crying. She calls me mama mama and when I hold her she never stops crying as if she had severe pain in her body. Then she wants to go to her father, but doesn't stop crying. </p>

<p>We offer many things, but she does not want to take anything at that time. We ask about pain, but she doesn't reply, just cries badly. We ask her if she was scared? But she doesn't respond. After 15 to 30 mins or more she stops by herself and sleeps. It happens almost every month. I am worried about her. </p>

It is fairly round in the back left but the back right is noticeably flatter.</p>

"Formal curriculum for infants first few years?","<p>In the context of independent behavioral, developmental and psychology fields (regarding people of any age), there appears  common revelation about the first few years of life... and their impact on the rest of it.</p>

<p>For example, in the context of speech pathology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders
  has estimated that about 6 to 8 million people—children and
  adults—have some form of language impairment. It is believed that the
  <strong>first 6 months of life are most crucial to a child’s development of language skills prior to school age <a href=""https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/communication-and-swallowing-disorders-in-children"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[1]</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or in the context of learning abilities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The emotional, social and physical development of young children has a
  direct effect on their overall development and on the adult they will
  become. That is why understanding the need to invest in very young
  children is so important, so as to maximize their future
  well-being <a href=""http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/importance-early-childhood-development"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[2]</a>.</p>

"Autistic child constantly mobbed by other children - what can be done?","<p>The autistic child (Asperger Syndrome, age: 12) is constantly mobbed by other children, both in school and on the way home. It includes calling him names, mocking, showing faces, pushing, threatening, taking off his things (such as a cap or gloves in winter), planting feet etc. It seems that the children have developed even a custom code of mobbing, with nuanced behaviors that are not considered offensive by others, such as using special faces or special words, so the poor boy is bullied even in front of adults (teachers). Bullying usually causes in him outbursts of aggression, which include cursing and throwing things (he has once thrown a chair out of a window at school). The teachers are already prejudiced against him, considering him to be aggressive and harsh-languaged. </p>

<p>What measures can be taken in that case to teach this child to control the aggression? It is quite obvious that the other kids are bullying him not for the sake of bullying, but because of his outbursts of aggression, which are very funny for them. </p>

<p>However, such repetitive mobbing has made very deep behavioral changes, and Asperger's makes things worse, because the answers from <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/379/what-is-the-best-way-to-respond-if-my-child-is-picked-on-by-other-children"">How to respond if my child is picked on by other children?</a> are virtually useless in that case, for example building self-confidence relying on social background (friends) or trying to understand other people's motives. </p>

"Too many variables at play -- troubled ""son""","<p>So, here's the story.</p>

<p>My <strong>ex</strong>-girlfriend, whom I have an 11 year old son with, had a son before ours with a man who has never seen his son past the age of one. He's now 16. He grew up a generally happy kid (ADHD, but still very bright). But, circumstances that I'm not privy to knowing in the past year, had it so that he stopped taking his medication, he got into some trouble with police, and generally his mother absolutely hates him, doesn't trust him, had the police arrest him, and had a police-assigned psychiatrist come to the conclusion, in a couple hours, that he was also a sociopath. Apparently, he shot his brother, from a distance, with a BB gun.</p>

<p>So, he went to stay with his 85 year old grandma for about 3 months. As you can well imagine, grandma wasn't equipped to raise a child in today's day and age. He stopped going to school, and was very angry all the time. Grandma had had enough.</p>

<p>So my wife and I offered to take him. So that he would at least pass high school, and generally aimed toward his career choice.</p>

<p>That was since January 2013. Now, September, he's doing pretty alright. However, I still have some concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not able to get him to consistently call us to tell us where he is, even though I provided him the cell phone (but, he does respond 95% of the time when we txt him to ask where he is)</li>
<li>He frequently stays out late... 10:00pm~11:00pm on a school night, is that still late?</li>
<li>He is seldom home for dinner, and when he does get home (late), he eats quite a bit</li>
<li>often skips a class or two at school, never the whole day, just a class. And not really the whole class... he goes on time, but tends to leave in the middle of class. Teachers mark him absent for this.</li>
</ul>

<p>He is most definitely NOT a sociopath, he feels bad for things he does, apologizes for things,  does things to help around the house sometimes without being asked, and doesn't feel sour when he doesn't get what he wants. He had smoked a lot of marijuana, until I convinced him the consequences of letting this drug become a lifestyle. In absence of his ADHD medication (which he fears, because mom had over-medicated him), he says the pot helps calm his nerves. So, I permit it... never in the house, and again, don't let it become a lifestyle. Once in a while, on the weekend, sure. But Don't let it become a lifestyle.</p>

<p>I used to tell myself, ""we just need him to graduate. once that happens, he can be on his own, do what he wants, and it's not under my jurisdiction."" So I've been providing him a safe and clean place to stay, dinner and breakfast and such, and basically to live with us so he doesn't have to live with his grandma, or try to reconcile with his mother (who, by the way, won't give me guardianship because she fears it will hurt her claim on back-pay of child support from his birth father, who hadn't paid a cent since his son was born). I hadn't tried to replace any parental figure he has, but really, he has none he can trust or confide in, but us.</p>

<p>Specifically, my question is two-fold:
 - do I just keep on, not trying to be ""dad,"" but just give him a safe place to live until he graduates (with any guidance that you guys could offer?)
 - or, do I need to convince him that I'm as good as Dad as he's going to get, to start treating me like one, or else there will be consequences?</p>

<p>I'm not very good at all at setting a structured home system. I have generally taken things as they come, and if I at least have forewarning of an opportunity for him to make the right choice, I tell him the consequence for making a wrong choice. But, I have no consistency, and certainly no structure. I know this is likely the problem. But, how do I approach this?</p>

"8-month old terrified of new caretakers","<p>My 8-month old will hardly let anybody ""new"" pick him up, or spend time with him if his mother or I aren't present.

<p>My mother wants to be able to babysit, and we're moving to a new daycare in a few weeks. I've tried giving my parents ""alone-time"" with him, so they can get used to each other; he calms down to a certain degree, but remains upset, clingy, and quick to cry, and he lunges at me desperately as soon as I return.

"What to do when 3.5-year-old still asks for pacifier 6 months after weaning?","<p>Our 3.5-year-old girl has no pacifier since her 3. birthday. Before that, she was really addicted to it, asking all the time if she could have it (although we had clear rules, only during sleep time etc.). She did not want to give away her pacifier voluntarily, so we decided to take it way when she turned 3. We communicated that several month before and spoke about it on a regular basis (and she more or less ""agreed"" with that). We explained to her that it's not good for her teeth, speech etc. We were really afraid that it would be very difficult for her without pacifier, especially during the night (she never slept without for the last 2.5 years), but to our astonishment, it ways not a big deal for her and after a couple of days, we all thought it's over. </p>

<p>But after some months, and especially after her (several months old) sibling got her own pacifiers, she startet again to ask if she could have again a pacifier. For the last 3 months now, she spoke about it several times a week, sometimes several times a day. Often, she takes the pacifier of her baby-doll in her mouth (just a hard plastic stick). For us, it is really hard to see her like this, she seems to suffer a lot, she wants one sooo badly.</p>

<p>After 6 months now I'm now very confused and uncertain what to do. Probably it was too early (or too late?) for her to give away her pacifier (apparently, she was not ready for it). I'm actually thinking of giving her again a pacifier to give her another chance to give it away when she is really ready for it. But I'm unsure if this is a really bad idea. So far, I forbid her to take the pacifier of her sibling. But more and more, I have lost the hope the situation will calm down by itself. </p>

I have read articles on multilingual kids, but all the languages that they are learning are not similar. Where Russian and Ukrainian are different languages, but are closely related to each other.
I am afraid that my son (9 months old now) will confuse these two languages. I understand that there may be some confusion with either languages. But I would not like him to eventually be speaking neither proper Russian or Ukrainian but Russian-Ukrainian dialect. 
Theoretically it should not be difficult for him to pick up Ukrainian when he knows Russian. 
Are there any parents that are raising trilingual kids with two similar languages? And if there are, what are you doing to teach them both languages. 
I was thinking of using one parent - one language method (or in my case mom - two languages and dad - one language). But I was going to switch languages (Russian and Ukrainian) every other day. It will also be more effort from my side to create Ukrainian environment around him. As there are no Ukrainian speaking playgroups where we live and I do not know anyone who speaks Ukrainian.</p>

<p>But now here comes his second birthday and people are expecting an invitation.</p>

<p>We really want to celebrate his birthday to make him feel special but still think that it will be more of party for adults rather kids doing fun.</p>

<p>What should we do? 
Will it have a psychological impact on my son going forward when he will know that we didn't celebrated his birthdays like other parents did.      </p>

"Respectful parenting and discipline","<p>Been reading a bit about Respectful Parenting and mutual respect as a parenting style and it appeals to us. We have four kids so keeping track of reward charts and various other trackers is complex and time consuming, we'd much rather work toward mutual respect and a willingness to do the right thing ""most"" of the time. </p>

<p>One thing that I'm not quite clear on is how to discipline within that framework without it looking like punishment, which then blurs the lines into a more controlling and coercive framework. </p>

<p>For example, we have two 11 year olds who are obsessed with their phones, and would happily wander around with them glued to their faces 24*7. Previously we have given them jobs to do to earn credits towards phone use, but we'd much rather they do jobs because it's the right thing to do in a family and then self-regulate their phone use. How do we encourage that, without the threat of taking them away? It's not just phones, that's just an example. 
How do we ""punish"" a lack of respect and cooperation without it being a punishment?</p>

"Homework in schools in England","<p>Our 4 year old daughter recently started school in London, and started getting homework for the Weekends. We are not really happy with both the type and the quantity of work that she is supposed to do: the tasks (e.g. writing letters and drawing pictures of things that start with that letter) seem to be inadequate for her age. Continuing with this example, she can't really write the letters properly, as if she was not explained the direction, etc. She can't really name things starting with a letter either. Hence in effect the homework is more for the parents, who are supposed to do the schools job and teach their child to write letters. We don't think that kids should spend so much time learning to write at this age, because there are so many different things (also in the curriculum) to learn, like arts or social skills.</p>

<p>Moreover, we often go away for the weekends and she is supposed to hand in her homework on Mondays. Hence a couple of questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What would be the consequences if we just ignored (part of) her homework regularly?</li>
<li>How would you deal with this situation?</li>

"Is it okay for an infant to sit in a regular stroller? Does position matter?","<p>I have a 4 month old. She has pretty good head/neck control. She just barely fits into our stroller. Is there a general guideline of when an infant can sit in a regular stroller based on certain developmental requirements for the spine?</p>

<p>The only reason why I ask is that the instructions for our other gear, our baby carrier, says this...(sorry for the long quote)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before the XYZ Carrier attained the popularity it now enjoys, it was thought that slings were a better alternative to the outward facing carrier, in the sense that there was no pressure put on the developing spine.</p>
  
  <p>This is due to the fact that the baby is in more of a horizontal position in the sling, 
  rather than suspended by the crotch with legs dangling and pressure put on the developing sacrum at the base of the spine.  At birth the spine is shaped like the letter C, as it was in the womb.  As the spine develops it acquires secondary curves in the base of the spine and the neck.  These secondary curves begin developing from birth.  According to Rochelle Casses in her paper entitled “Infants and Spinal Stress”: </p>
  
  <p>“A baby's spine is placed in a compromising position in many of today's popular carriers. If the carrier positions the infant upright, with the legs hanging down and the bodyweight supported at the base of the baby's spine (i.e. at the crotch), it puts undue stress on the spine which can adversely affect the development of the spinal curves and, in some cases, cause spondylolisthesis.”</p>
  
  <p>The XYZ Carrier used with the infant insert  address these very issues.  In the XYZ 
  Carrier the baby faces towards the babywearer with the back, sacrum and legs supported in an upright position.  The infant insert  has a bottom support cushion that is designed to support the natural curvature of a baby’s spine by encouraging a slight forward-leaning position with the pelvis tilted forward.  There is also padding to support the back along the length of the spine.  The position of the infant in the infant insert is exactly the position that a baby would be in if carried with its bottom supported by both hands and the head resting in the chest with legs tucked-up and, if the infant is old enough, straddling the waist.  An update from the editor of a new edition of the above quoted paper validates XYZ's new design:</p>
  
  <p>UPDATE: This article was written in the 1990s when the all of the popular upright baby carrier designs had the harmful characteristics described below. Today, several new and improved upright carrier designs are available. The gold standard for carrying your baby should be your own arms. In other words, an upright carrier should hold your baby the way your arms would, e.g., facing you with legs in a frog-like, spread-squat position with the baby's weight supported across the buttocks and thighs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her position in the stroller is not as reclined as when she sits in her car seat. One thing that I can do is to recline the stroller back to match the recline position of the car seat.</p>

<p>I guess a similar question goes for the car seat...is the position ok for the development of the baby?</p>

"Washing Cloth diapers","<p>My boyfriend and I live in an apartment building and have shared washer and dryers. We are expecting a baby girl and have been leaning heavily towards cloth diapers. He is concerned if it is worth the cost of 1.50 a load as well as sanitation.</p>

<p>While I recently read that it isn't all that unsanitary. I'm concerned about the prewash/ presoak part of the procedure. The machines don't have that option.
My thought was to presoak for an hour before using the machine in a plastic container and potentially doing 2 hot washes. One solo wash and another with whatever clothing I could fit. Though it seems that most people just do one hot wash. But then to save on drying cost to just get a towel rack to air dry. If I were to just wash them solo.</p>

<p>I guess my overall ""question"" is. Would doing the procedure of soaking the rinsed of diapers in cold or hot water in a bin, doing a solo hot tide detergent wash, then letting them sit on a towel rack to dry work out?
or should I reconsider this procedure or just go for disposable diapers?</p>

"How can I get my toddler to exit discreetly when threatening-looking people are around?","<p>I was having lunch with my 3 y.o. daughter today, and some threatening-looking types start having lunch there also (one looked like he was on drugs).  This is solely based on their appearance; they never bothered us in any way, and for all I know, they could be lovely people once you get to know them.  Nevertheless, I felt a strong desire to leave, without drawing attention to us in any way (i.e. I didn't want to make it seem like I was uncomfortable with them around my daughter).</p>

<p>However, I know that if I would have attempted to leave prematurely, my daughter would likely have protested, which would have drawn attention to us (she was enjoying her meal, and was completely oblivious to any of my perceived threats).</p>

"Our 6-year-old son complains of stomach pain only when going to school - and refuses to go","<p>Our 6-year-old son is crying almost every day when we try to leave him at school. He will start to cry and complain of stomach pain. This stomach pain only shows up in the morning when we are about to go to school or on the way to school. He does not have stomach pain at home, nor during after-school activities nor on week-ends.</p>

<p>To be sure, we have been to the doctors to have him checked. They could not find anything. He has some intolerance to gluten, and he had a period last year when he complained about stomach pain but then it wasn't ""only when going to school"".</p>

<p>He is very social and has generally had an easy time to make friends and adapt to new environments. We moved to a new country 1.5 years ago, and the first week he cried when we left him at kindergarten - but he picked up the new language and made friends and it took about a month and he was genuinely  happy to go to kindergarten. This year he was looking forward to start at a new school. </p>

<p>The first weeks went fine. Unfortunately, there were three (maybe four) incidents between him and some older children at the playground where he had been hit by them. All these incidents occurred at the time when several grades are waiting to enter the canteen. We have of course taken this up with the school and the director. We believe this has been resolved and there hasn't been any more incidents since then. He is now eating at home instead of at school (as do many other kids). </p>

<p>We have met with his teacher and we have seen him during a break at school. I trust his teacher and he seems to get along fine with his classmates. On the way to school and home from school several kids want to talk to him - he seems to do well socially. The teacher says that she can see those mornings when he has been crying, but that he is happy in class and does well in school.</p>

<p>However, he is crying and is complaining of stomach pain in the mornings, often just at the time when one says ""OK now it is time to put on the shoes and go"". We have asked for a meeting with the school psychologist. </p>

<p>We are not sure exactly how to handle this. Initially, when we were not sure what was going on, we would have him stay home instead of going to school. He would play with his toys as normal at home (but no screen time!).</p>

<p>Once it was clear it was not a physical health issue and after meeting with the teacher and it felt that school should be safe - we said he has to go to school - even if he feels he has stomach pain.</p>

<p>We have tried to ask him about his stomach pain but I'm not sure he knows himself what exactly he feels or why he feels he has pain.</p>

<p>He has complained that school feels long. He might be bored. It may not be what he expected school to be like (it is different from kindergarten). He might also not feel safe (yet) due to the incidents.</p>

<p>To complicate matters, where we live (Barcelona), the school is in Catalan, while most social interactions on playgrounds etc., are in Spanish. In kindergarten it was more relaxed (teachers would speak English/Spanish and Catalan), while at school all teaching is in Catalan (although his teacher is fine if he replies in any language he wants). And the teacher does not think he needs support in Catalan as of now - (he has less of a vocabulary than some other kids, but there are also many kids like him who know only Spanish. Our son also speaks English and Italian well).  </p>

<p>How can we help him with this?</p>

<p>Should we bring him to school even if he breaks down and starts to cry on the way complaining about stomach pain?</p>

<p>I'm not sure, but I think his sense of pain is real, but I think it may be due a lot of factors that he is not himself aware of. I think he is not as aware of his feelings as she is. I think one of the factors is that he simply thinks school is not fun and he prefers to be home - but I also think that this is not the only factor.</p>

<p>Today, my wife brought him to school and it ended up with him laying down on the street refusing to go. So she took him home. I spoke with him and told him that he has to go to school - even if he has some stomach pain - that he will do fine and that school is important. I said eventually that he will go to school even if that means I will carry him to school. And so I did, I carried him to school. He cried for most of the way but once he had accepted it he stopped crying. Just when leaving him at school he wanted to hug a lot and he was sad but he did go to his classroom. </p>

<p>I think I did the right thing, but I'm not sure. Thoughts and suggestions are very welcome.</p>

"How structured does a child's life need to be?","<p>At home, our kids' lives (3 and 7 months) are fairly well-defined, in terms of when events happen. Waking up, meals, naps, bath, bedtime - except for a little slacking on the mornings on weekends (only for the 3yo! the infant still gets her milk on time), the times at which these things happen don't change much.</p>

<p>When I take the kids to visit my family, I find it hard to keep a consistent schedule - there's always something that we want to do, or someplace to go, that gets in the way. I also get the impression that they think I'm being overprotective, or anal-retentive, or something, because I try to keep to some sort of schedule.</p>

<p>There is one other boy my son's age, and the two of them are very good friends.  My son looks forward to going explicitly to play with the other boy, and when we ask him what he did at daycare on any given day, the answer is invariably a description of how the two of them played together, and what toys they played with.</p>

<p>My son frequently tells us that the other boy is his best friend, and the two of them apparently tell each other that throughout the day on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Unfortunately... we recently found out that the other boy will be leaving daycare next week.</p>

<p>We've made attempts to arrange for the two of them to get together outside of daycare in the past, and the boy's mother (a single mother who is apparently having a hard time right now) has been generally unresponsive.  It seems unlikely that we'd be able to maintain any sort of contact once he leaves daycare.</p>

<p>My son isn't yet aware that the other boy will be leaving, but when he does, I know my son will be very upset.</p>

<p>What can I do to help him through this?  Is there anything I should/can do to prepare him?  Should I tell him ahead of time, or wait until the other boy's last day?</p>

<p>Apparently the other boy is currently on a trip, and will return some time early next week, but then Friday is his last day.  They'll only have 3-4 days together before the other boy is gone for good.</p>

"How do I get my 4yo to stop repeating himself all the time, and to respect a quiet time?","<p>My 4 yo has been showing a rather annoying and obsessive behavior for the past 6 months or so, in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>he repeats himself all the time,</li>
<li>and won't take no for an answer in some circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe I should ask 2 different questions for this, but the 2 problems seem to go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Quick examples...</p>

<p>Say we're having lunch and talk together, and at some point he might say something and for some reason start repeating it (e.g. ""It's mommy who bought that salad, OK?""). He'll keep repeating for a while (it can really go on and on for 10-15 iterations), and he's starting to take too long to eat. If it's a question, like in this example, we can acknowledge it and agree with him, and it'll usually end there. However, if it's something where it's not correct (say, grand-ma bought the salad so we just tell him ""no, actually, grand-ma bought it for us"") or where he wasn't asking a question (""tomorrow we go to the school"" or ""baby is sleeping""), then we can't always find a way to make him accept the ""correction"" or to understand that we understand what he's saying and to stop repeating.</p>

<p>So we might at some point tell him ""Sorry, but now you have to stop talking and playing. Finish your plate and then we can talk."" He usually gets it, and knows he should go back to it and will do it to some extent, but will irremediably start saying the same thing again a bit later. Or, if at that time there's something he wants to say, he absolutely won't give up.</p>

<p>In another situation, if we happen to be near the door of his baby-sister's room when she takes a nap and he wants to tell us something, we'll ask him to be quiet and to wait to tell us something until we're out of ear-shot, and we start walking away from the door (he's quite loud and has that piercing voice - a 4 yo kid, basically). He won't respect that and will keep talking.</p>

<p>Even if very explicitly <strong>forbidden</strong> to (a clear ""Shhh, you need to be quiet now!"") for instance for one of the above scenarios and he keeps talking, or if he's in a time-out or a quiet relaxation time, he'll just keep trying to talk. Usually we reach a point where we just can't get out of it and just tell him we'll talk later and walk away, or that he can't talk right now, and he'll either get upset (which I can understand) or start pulling on my arm to ask the permission to talk right away (actually rather strange, as we don't really have a ""ask permission to talk"" thing going on, but maybe that's mimicking classroom behavior).</p>

<p>Another example would be when we go shopping. He may start saying in the supermarket ""I like these cookies"", or something like this, and you won't be able to make him stop.</p>

<p>I understand that at 4 yo, it's hard for him to know when it's appropriate to talk, and why silence is required under some circumstances. But there are situations he's familiar with (like his sister sleeping, being quite in time-outs, talking quietly in public places, etc...), and also it's really the one thing where we can't get him to snap out of it. It either ends with:</p>

<ul>
<li>we give up and tell him ""ok, what do you want to say?"" and he'll say it (usually quite a few times), but it's troublesome that we can't make him accept a rule;</li>
<li>or he'll get very upset and possibly cry, let himself fall on the floor and refuse to do anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course at first I thought we might be doing it wrong (well, we probably do), and he might feel like we don't listen to him, or don't give him enough importance, or it's an indirect/hidden message he's trying to send us. But not really. In the case of the ""salad"" scenario, it doesn't look like he wants anything but won't hear that the corrected fact is right; in the case of waking up his sister it's often about something trivial; and in the case of the supermarket, you could buy him the cookies and assure him they're his and his only and it wouldn't make a difference in the world. So it doesn't look like it's really linked to the content of what he says.</p>

<p>I thought it might be due about just wanting to be listened to, but acknowledging him and agreeing doesn't even always make him stop.</p>

<p>And then it could be more about the situation than about the discussion itself (it does happen often at lunch/dinner and when going out), but then I don't know why he'd feel attached to having to repeat things that don't even seem to matter to him that much at the time.
And in general I'm perfectly OK with taking a deep breath and letting him go through it for as long as he wants, and I just say ""ok"" and agree with him or try to steer the conversation and ask follow-ups (and it goes on a while!), but when we do need to make him snap out it it's really hard.</p>

<p>This is a bit confused and I hope someone can make sense of it and has a similar experience. I know young kids repeat things a lot, but it really looks like a strong fixation or obsession, and it's been driving us a bit nuts, but also his grand-parents, his uncle, our friends, and some care-takers at school (I don't think it happens with the teacher that often).</p>

"4 yr old has become very negative since starting school","<p>My 4 (and 4 months) year old son (i'm going to call him John here) started school in september, a couple of months ago.  (he's in what is called 'Reception' in England - it might be called pre-school in the USA).  In the last few weeks he has started showing some very troubling behaviour, characterised by:</p>

<ul>
<li>""doom and gloom"" - <em>""Nobody loves me""/""Nobody likes me""</em> etc.  </li>
<li>sadness about friends:  <em>""I'm going to be my own best friend""</em>, <em>""I don't want any friends""</em></li>
<li>insulting me and my wife: <em>""You're not good at anything, are you""</em>, <em>""None of your jokes are funny.""</em></li>
<li>insulting his 2 yr old sister: telling her she is stupid etc. </li>
<li>arguing with anything - <em>""Ooh look at that huge crane, isn't that cool.""</em> <em>""No it isn't!  Shut up!""</em></li>
<li>saying really dark stuff like <em>""When someone says they love you, that means that they hate you""</em> and <em>""If you say you hate me, that will make me happy.""</em>.  This is perhaps the most troubling.   </li>
</ul>

<p>I think that this might stem from him not having any good friends at school.   He kind of makes things hard for himself in this regard - I've seen other kids say hello to him and he just ignores them.  He's lacking in social skills really.  At a cinema screening at the school a couple of weeks ago he kept on turning to the other kids and shouting ""Did you see that!"" at them.  They ended up moving away from him, and I don't really blame them, even though it made me want to cry.    </p>

<p>I think he has an idea that he needs to have a ""best friend"", and he feels like he doesn't have one.  He sees other kids playing and sort of stands on the sidelines vicariously playing with them, but not really with them if you know what I mean.  </p>

<p>It's very difficult for me and my wife to deal with, because when we try to talk to him about it he gets really angry, leading to conversations like</p>

<p>""Nobody loves me""
""John, me and mummy love you very very much.""
""NO YOU DON'T!! SHUT UP! You're just an idiot.""</p>

<p>My wife has spoken to his teacher and she says she hasn't really seen anything worrying happening in the classroom, but obviously she can't be everywhere at once.  </p>

<p>If he was 13 and behaving like this I might write it off as moody teenager behaviour, and not worry so much.  But to have a four year old say ""When someone says they love you, that means that they hate you"" is quite frankly terrifying me and my wife.  </p>

<p>Can anyone advise?  Is this normal?  Should we speak to a child psychologist?</p>

"Effect of homeschool on college chances?","<p>I am the child not the parent - but it is still extremely relevant to my parents. My parents want to really think through what's the best option for my future. Me and my parents are considering home-school as an option and I think this decision is very dependant on the circumstances. The key reason for me taking home-school classes would be that I can't find any other options that allow the pace or level of learning that I'm at. I'm a senior and have a very low GPA (although I consistently get 4s on end of year tests) because I've tended to slack off at high-school since it felt so menial so I think that home-school could be advantageous because my GPA would not carry over. </p>

<p>I'm currently working my way through <em>The Handbook of Mathematical Logic</em> by John Barwise, a textbook in abstract algebra and category theory, and a graduate level textbook in theoretical physics. However my school is starting soon and I feel that in my case school is actually a massive detriment to my learning because it takes time away that I would be spending learning at a much more advanced level. I've also presented at one academic conference so far but I think without public school in the way it would give me time to do more.</p>

<p>In my case what are my chances of getting into college with a home-school degree, and in what ways can I improve my chances? How will it increase chances if I get high ACT or SAT scores and how will it increase my chances if I use the extra time to submit a few papers at academic conferences?</p>

"Do a parent's big expectations become a burden on the child?","<p>Recently, Haruki Murakami started an advice column on his personal website. One of the questions was about motivating kids. Here is what Murakami replied:</p>

  <p>When a parent's expectations for children are large, it becomes a burden for children.</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_word"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sight words, often also called high frequency sight words, are commonly used words that young children are encouraged to memorize as a whole by sight, so that they can automatically recognize these words in print without having to use any strategies to decode.</p>

"Should I allow my child to participate in dangerous sports?","<p>When should a child be allowed to take part in ""dangerous"" sports or activities?</p>

<p>I'm thinking of letting my son try motocross when he's ""old enough"" - but when is that, <strong>when is a child old enough to understand the risks involved?</strong> I've seen parents with children as young as 3-4 years old on small (50cc - circa 5-10mph) bikes, some with stabilisers some without. By the time they're in their teens, they typically ride much larger and faster bikes at potentially lethal speeds.</p>

<p>Ignoring the motor-sport context, whilst it's rare, I'm conscious that simply breaking bones can result in death (usually either from compound bleeding or infection etc.) so I'm very aware of the potential consequences - but my child may not be.</p>

<p>My main motivation is that I want my child to learn some life-skills that many less ""harmful"" activities often lack - elements of bravery, commitment, physical fitness and large components of risk (assessment) and ""face your fears"" experience that I want my son to learn, to make a mensch out of him. I want to instil a sense of grit and determination and the ability to keep pushing when things get tough. IMHO, too many parents avoid exposing their children to life's difficulties (risk, losing, physical effort etc.).</p>

<p>Additionally, from my own perspective, I'd very much enjoy being able to spend time riding with my son - but I don't feel very comfortable exposing him to danger (especially when he's too young to understand the consequences). By the same token, I'm conscious that if he isn't exposed to the sport young enough, he'll be unlikely to reach a professional standard, if that were to be something he chose to pursue.</p>

<p>Does anyone allow their child to participate in a dangerous (or contact) sport? When did they start and <strong>how did you mitigate against the risks?</strong></p>

<p>You can assume they'll be wearing all the best protective equipment and only riding in appropriate places (closed circuits, with riders of the same age) - never on public roads without a helmet etc...</p>

"Is it inappropriate for young teens to cuddle and sleep together if there is no sign of it being sexual?","<p>I'm trying to decide if I should intervene and would very much appreciate some feedback. I am Japanese btw and my English may not be perfect, sorry.</p>

<p>My son and his best friend are both 13 years of age. They have been best friends since a very young age of around 4. They have a good group of friends, but the two of them have been almost unseperatble for years. She is a very good influence on my son and he tends to do better in school, clean his room, etc, when she is around. So I want to be very careful about not hurting their relationship. Especially since he has been self reliant since a young age, like many Japanese children learn to be my our culture. They have always been lightly physical, wrestling, leaning on each other (I think normal healthy friend ways). But recently I went into his room one night because the light was on, and they were sleeping together (with clothes on) in a very intimate way.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MWdYG.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MWdYG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> Very much like picture I have posted. They looked very cute and peaceful like this, but I was little scared as it reminded me of lovers.</p>

<p>I have been watching them closely, and they are very comfortable together, and will cuddle on couch when watching tv, things like that, but I have seen no kissing and nothing sexual. My son gets embarrassed though if I get too nosy. I do not know if they are developing love or if they are just comfortable like siblings. I want to find what is best for them, and do not want to force them to stop if it will hurt their relationship.</p>

<p>Is this bad? Should I tell them to stop? Should I inform her mother that they are doing these things? Or should I tell them to be careful, or leave them alone? I plan to have a sex talk with my son, but I do not know if good enough.</p>

"How to handle a mother who is becoming unkind to the adult child?","<p>I am in the low 30s and my mother used to be very kind and caring but in the last decade she turned out almost the total opposite. She has a much better wealth then she used to but her attitude changed so much that I almost want to avoid her as much as I can.</p>

<p>For example, she accused me and my girlfriend of having stolen 150$. It is not so much the amount but just the fact that she accused us meaning her confidence in us is totally null. This would have NEVER happened in the good old days. I am trying to figure if we have done something that might have changed that and cannot come up with anything. This accusation was made because we took care of her house while they were on vacation, which leads to we will never do it again.</p>

<p>She also writes some weird things now like ""Thanks for your love for me"" (maybe bad translation but you get the point I'm sure) and every sentences she writes to us seems like we are indebted to her. She also is unable to spend one dinner without talking about money or how good she is or what exploit she has done.</p>

<p>Also my girlfriend is pregnant and my mother offered to help us (money wise) and we both agreed that we would not accept anything from her.</p>

<p>Now I will soon sit down with her and explain how we feel but when I will do that our relation will take a huge setback for many months. I really want to do that before new baby is born (few more months to go) to take some pressure of my girlfriends shoulders because she finds this situation much more difficult than I do.</p>

<ul>
<li>How would you handle this kind of situation if it happened to you?   </li>
<li>How can I make her realized she has changed that much?</li>

"Techniques for handling teenagers ""playing dumb"" about things","<p>It is hard to phrase this question, as it is an psychologically oblique problem.</p>

<p>My teenage son will often ask questions or make glib observations about things, he already knows the answer to, or understand at a deeper level. He does this to get attention and to get a reaction from me.</p>

<p>Now the attention part is easier to address. Obviously, he needs more of my undivided attention.</p>

<p>It's the getting a reaction from me that's not so easy. As a parent, a human being, I get worn down and my reserves of patience can become emptied, and so I snap or react. In this case I react, because I know he is intelligent and provoking me.</p>

<p>The essence of this question is not so much, how to change my behaviour (which is always a must), but </p>

"What should we do when our 15 year old wants sex with his 13 year old girlfriend?","<p>So the other day I walked in on our teenager and caught his girlfriend with her pants down. It is quite clear what they were intending to do. </p>

<p>Now he claims he had no intention of having sex with her, he was just ""taking a look"". However, we all know where such behaviour inevitably leads.</p>

<p>I am really not sure where how to proceed. </p>

<p>He is 15, she is 13. It is against the law to have sex at that age. In 9 months time he will be 16 and she will still be 13. It will be even more against the law then.</p>

<p>Also it is quite clear to me that this girl is quite vulnerable. She comes from a broken and quite possibly violent home. Our son is adamant he loves her and only wants the best for her.</p>

<p>Everything about the situation is just bad in my book. However, I don't really see that there is much I can do to prevent it. I can tell him he isn't allowed to see her anymore. But that will truly ruin the relationship I have with him and they will see each other at school. Right now he says he has gone over to a friends house, but I am sure he is probably with her. I can't stop this from happening.</p>

<p>Do I provide him with contraceptives? Thus sending him the message that it is ok to have sex. At least it avoids pregnancy, but it isn't going to prevent the possible emotional turmoil that can come with hugely underaged sex.</p>

<p>Should I let her come round to our house again? Do I let them up into his room with the door closed? Trying to prevent the inevitable would just mean they will find other places to do it. Is that any better? At least it would reduce the number of times they could have sex.. Is that preferable?</p>

<p>What do I need to explain to him / talk to him about to help him act as responsibly as possible in this situation?</p>

"12 year-old son doesn't want to move to a new city","<p>I was recently offered a job in another city on the other side of the country. I was attracted to it because it represents a new adventure for the family and my wife is excited by the prospect. Additionally, my current company is in some financial trouble and is currently in negotiations to be acquired by another company, so the future of my position here is a bit uncertain right now.</p>

<p>My son, however, is not happy about the idea of moving. Normally I'd say that kids can always make new friends, but my son has always had a hard time making new friends. He has one relationship in particular that I'd hesitate to take from him. Not only are they close, but he's a good influence on him and we're good friends with the family too.</p>

<p>Realistically speaking, the job itself is not much of an advancement career-wise. The pay is only marginally better and the responsibilities are largely the same. The excitement is mostly because we've lived in this area for 20 years and a change of scenery would be exciting and new. I can honestly say that I wouldn't be so interested in this new position if it were local.</p>

<p>So my question is, how much weight should I give to my son's objections? I'm not normally one to let a 12 year-old decide what's best for the family, but this would represent a huge change for him right at a time in his life where big changes are scary and confusing.</p>

"Balancing children's needs with a parent's own needs","<p>For me, as a new parent I found it difficult to find a balance between meeting the needs of my son and my own needs. I was inclined to view my own needs as being selfish and an inadequacy within me that equated to selfishness.</p>

<p>In my case, I grew up perceiving my mother to be very selfish, and as an older adult, I conclude that this was an accurate observation.

"How to stop my preschooler from constantly running away","<p>We have a very active 4-year-old.  She has a will of her own though with what she wants to do, and there's one thing in particular that I find I don't know what to do: <strong>she's constantly running away</strong>.</p>

<p>It's not that she's being mistreated or wants to ""get away"", she just wants to do her own thing.</p>

<p>We can be out for a walk, and we try letting her walk by herself instead of holding our hands, she's off running where she wants and won't listen to us to come back. Sometimes when doing this she'll find somewhere to hide, and think it's a game.</p>

<p>The new behavior (as of about a week ago): She can be playing in our fully fenced backyard, and on a whim, she'll <strong>climb over the fence</strong> and run over (and right into) a neighbor's house to play. So far it's consistently been one neighbor house that has children of a similar age, and they've started texting us when it happens.</p>

<p>When we catch her and ask her why, it's always ""because I wanted to"". We ask her ""are you allowed to run away / climb the fence / etc"", she always answers ""No, I get in trouble!"". We've tried explaining what the punishment will be next time (we ask her afterwards and she remembers) - it's ranged from no TV to no treats/desserts to favorite toys being taken away.  All have had no effect on her behavior.  She hears what we're saying and can paraphrase it back to us, but either she doesn't care, or constantly forgets when she's ""in the moment"", and then remembers when the punishment comes.</p>

<p>Short of constantly holding onto her and watching her like a hawk (to which she often ends up in a screaming fit), we are at our wits end.  <strong>What can we do?</strong> Has anyone else had children go through a phase like this and have possible options for addressing this problem?</p>

<p>(More context - she has an older brother (6) who did not go through this kind of phase; at 3 he understood he could go up ahead a bit, and on walks would always wait at the curb/lights. This is not our first child, but is our first time dealing with this problem.)</p>

<p>Since I have been on this site before she was born, I applied all the proper ways of talking and behaving with the child which are often advised here.</p>

<p>Now, the result is that this 4 year old is a very patient, quite hard working kid - when she's with me. She doesn't pay too much attention to her father's words many times because he doesn't act, just talks, doesn't follow up regularly.</p>

<p>Nearly zero tantrums.<br>
I have to tell her only once that she needs to keep all the blocks and toys that she threw around back in the box. She tells me to help which I do. She does her share of work very properly.<br>
She has empathy, says sorry when she needs to, helps to clean around the house when required, and has a great attention span too.</p>

<p>Goes to washroom herself, never has had accidents. We use diapers on her at night only because we don't want to bother ourselves. </p>

<p>Now, on such occasions, I say, <strong><em>""You cleaned the room properly by putting all the toys in the box. You worked hard. Thanks for that! You indeed have a great patience"".</em></strong> </p>

<p>Problem is that she <em>mostly</em> always behaves properly. Punishing her is rarely required. No bribes have been given till date.<br>
I am feeling that I am praising her too much because of the great amount of proper behavior from her side.</p>

<p>I think she ""deserves"" the praise because as I have seen on this site, almost all the parents have been complaining of improper behavior and several types of problems with their own children of the same age.<br>

"Time lapse between potty-training and poop-training?","<p>My three year old has been potty trained for about three months -he still wears pull-ups at night, but they are often dry, and during the day he wears underwear. However he will not yet poop in the potty. We have a good system where he lets me know he needs to poop and we switch out the underwear for a diaper and then he goes off by himself somewhere to do it, but he strongly resists trying first to go on the potty. He will come and sit if I ask, but he won't try to poop, he basically just sits there and fidgets for a couple of minutes and then says it isn't working and he needs a diaper. So a few questions, really:
1) about how long is the typical lapse between peeing in the potty and pooping in the potty?
2) is this a step that I can expect he will eventually choose to take on his own, or do I need to insist at some point that he do it?
3) what are ways in which I can encourage him to poop on the potty/what have others tried that has worked? We did stickers for peeing and that seemed to work really well, but the ""poop"" part of the chart has remained stubbornly blank. 
I would greatly appreciate any insights!

<p>In the spirit of keeping an open dialogue about anything with my kids, I'm keen to talk to him about it, and tell him what the word is (perhaps not what it means), why it's not very nice and that it's no big deal whether someone knows it or not, because ultimately it's not a word that should be used in every day life (avoiding the ""it's a grown up word"" thing for fear of further adding weight to it).</p>

<p>Obviously this approach carries risks (he tells other kids, joins the ""i know the word"" club, or even starts using it).</p>

<p>I should add that he has a very strong sense of right and wrong, and I think it's important to trust him with this kind of thing (if I don't show that trust his judgement, how will he ever learn to?), but is it too much too soon?</p>

"How do I deal with rude or uncooperative siblings?","<p>This is a bit of a tricky one but here goes:</p>

<p>I'm in my mid-twenties and (for various reasons) currently live at home with both parents, my 15 year old sister, and my 17 year old brother. I regularly help out with family stuff - morning/afternoon school runs and other ""taxi services"" in particular - and, especially as there is a bit of an age gap, feel like I'm in an 'authoritative' position a lot of the time.</p>

<p>My problem is that both siblings can be very uncooperative, unpleasant and (in my sister's case) even rude or abusive at times, and there's a lot of friction whenever they need to do something they don't enjoy.</p>

<p>I completely understand that they're not my children, I'm not their parent and it's not my job to discipline them. However, I do still feel responsible for them in some ways and I do try to act as a role model for them.</p>

<p>I also don't want to insult the effort my parents have put into their (and my) upbringing but I sometimes feel as though they get away with whatever they like and there are few to no repercussions for bad behaviour. This has been going on for as long as I can remember and it's really starting to cause me a lot of stress and upset. I cannot wait until I can leave home but financially I have no idea when that's going to be possible.</p>

<p>I'm often late for work in the mornings because they simply don't get ready for school in time (they're late regardless of who takes them in the mornings) and being the messenger for requests like ""come down for dinner"" or even ""it's time to wake up"" is usually met with aggressive arguments and sometimes swearing and vocal abuse from my sister.</p>

<p>A few examples of their typical behaviour:</p>

<ul>
<li>My sister rarely eats with the family at mealtimes and hasn't for several years now. If forced to she will be surly and uncommunicative, sometimes throwing tantrums, demanding to leave the table early, or simply storming off at some perceived insult. Usually she eats in her room or the sitting room and we put up with it because ""it's easier than having the argument"".</li>
<li>My brother seems incapable of getting up in the morning. I have found a half-way solution in that I go into his room and keep pestering him until he gets out of bed and starts getting ready. This isn't fool-proof though as he has been known to get back into bed and fall asleep again when dressed. Am I wrong in imagining a 17 year old should be responsible enough to get themselves up in the morning?</li>
<li>Both siblings are frequently unhappy, tired or feeling unwell. Unsurprisingly, when they feel like this they're more likely to snap or become aggressively argumentative.</li>
<li>After having read some of the questions on the site, it almost seems like my sister is displaying many signs of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. She <em>hates</em> school and her other brother, she's angry most of the time, is usually generally argumentative and can take offence at almost anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both siblings <em>can</em> be absolutely wonderful if they're in the right mood, but that is rare. I'm becoming increasingly concerned they have learned behaviours and attitudes that mean they will struggle in later life.</p>

<p>I would love to talk to my parents about this but I just don't know what to say or what suggestions to make. Especially without hurting their feelings or implying they're bad parents. Both of my parents are under a lot of pressure and stress at the moment and neither of them deal well with confrontational discussions about these sorts of things which makes things doubly difficult.</p>

<p>Hopefully this all makes sense!? I feel as though my siblings need to learn some self-discipline and become much more responsible for their actions and behaviours towards myself and others. However, I have no idea how to get them to cooperate and see this and getting my parents' help with this seems impossible. HELP! What can I do as a sibling to make everyone's life easier?</p>

"At what age should my child sleep in his or her own room to greatest decrease the risk of SIDS?","<p>At what age should my child sleep in his or her own room to greatest decrease the risk of SIDS? </p>

<p>It sounds like the risk for SIDS is greatest at age 2-3 months or 2-4 months,  and that it is no longer classified as SIDS if the baby is 1 year old. So would the answer be after the first birthday, or second best, at 5 months or any later time? </p>

<p>The child is not known to be at greater risk for SIDS. </p>

<p>Please note that the parents do have a video baby monitor. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I see why my question was ambiguous. I realize that moving the child to his/her own room does not seem to decrease the risk of SIDS. But if the chance of SIDS is reduced by having the child in the same room as the parents, when can I most safely move my child to his/her own room? I realize that this is likely a statistical probability question.</p>

"Which models / techniques could help me accelerate my child's intellectual development?","<p>this is my first question here, thanks for having me :)
Apologies if this question seems to be a little bit subjective, let me try and more clearly define what I'm asking.</p>

<p>My first child (daughter) is due March 2019. Like all parents I want to ensure I'm doing everything I can to create an environment wherein she can psychologically and intellectually (and physically in terms of motor function) flourish to the maximum of her ability. My issue is, I know very little about developmental psychology and even less about pedagogy.</p>

<p>Particularly in reference to early years (but right up to UK secondary school age would be interesting to hear about), <strong>what are the popular models, frameworks or techniques that I should be reading about and trying to put into practice as a parent?</strong></p>

<p>I am a fast reader and can handle in-depth explanations, but I'm aware that there is no <em>absolute</em> best way of doing things. I've read a LITTLE about John Piaget's work, which has led me to believe I should try and provide play activities that will encourage my daughter to investigate the properties of a range of objects and materials, but I guess I'm looking for guidance on any other leading theories with some practical advice on application.</p>

<p>I don't want to just keep buying meaningless 'toys' for my daughter, I want to know I'm doing my best to keep her ahead of (or at least not behind) the developmental curve. Obviously, I also realize that having general fun is part of being a child but I guess I want to make sure that fun is playing a part in her development as far as possible.</p>

<p>What should I be reading?</p>

<p>Thank you all so much and I look forward to your input.</p>

"What should I do when my parents drain all my energy?","<p>I'm 18, almost 19 and I've been dealing with my parents' negativity as far as I remember myself. I'm currently a game programmer, something that isn't from the easiest. Still I manage perfectly to cope with it.</p>

<p>(Long story short) of the power of infinity, my parents always moan about me not communcating enough with them and not contancting them very often. I completely understand them but here comes the funny part. Every time we talk, we loop over same things all over and over again, like how hard life is, they not having enough time to do the things they want(a note, my mam is all day long in front of the tv, washing her brains out every single second more and more). If you have heard about back pain or joints pain in general in your life, trust me it's not enough! You have to hear how my parents are talking! They have everything actually... pretty much enough money, free time, everything that a person needs to live perfectly. Still this isn't noticed. Only the negative, which sometimes isn't actually that negative, just the way they present it....</p>

<p>I know I shoudn't try to change people at all but what if these people are my family and I want to get the best of life? I guess you would say smth like ""well then don't pay so much attention to it"". Okay that simple. But what about the emotions I get from them, being so negative, after all they are my family I don't want them to feel bad at all. But like I mentioned above I'm in a very competitive industry, where you cannot afford to waste time on useless talks, especially negative ones, which not only don't have any pros but also have many cons.</p>

<p>Every time I talk with them I leave with my head down, tired and disguisted of all the negativity they've got or I get away very angry, thinking about the scandals for days after. I am so lucky to have an amazing gf, who supports me in everything I do, especially in these hard times I have with my parents but still sometimes I feel that I disassemble her with my problems. I.e. one day she wakes up, I've woken up before her, have talked with my parents and in order to avoid having arguments with her I share everything that happened with me and them. This way, despite the advantages of doing this, she gets part of the negative energy that flows in our family and I HATE THIS!
The worst thing of all I hate is their ""useful"" advices, even when I don't ask them for any. How I should be cautios about my diplomas and so on. How many cheaters in life there are, which is the reason why they haven't succeeded in life. haha because of the cheaters, this is so funny! They have excuses for every single failure of theirs. Still they manage to criticise me for doing the ""wrong"" thing every time my opinion doesn't match with theirs.</p>

<p>Another thing is GUILT. Many times I've tried just to ignore the things they tell me to do but then the next time we talk the following answers come along: Did you do this, did you do that? Why didn't you do it? Why did you do this? Why didn't you listen to us, don't you think we're right. They have smth like a desease for being the right people always... The problem is they never learn. I don't want to be offensive or rude or smth but they really have stopped growing since the age of 15 or so. They are almost 50 now. Or when I just don't call them because I don't want to get irritated and influenced with another bucnh of negative news, they are like ""hey you don't even think about us anymore"". Okkayyyy seriously totally understand them, but howwwww am I supposed to communcate with them??? I don't want to become like them. (Just a note I've been trying to listen to them, be patient and so on. This was the worst time in my life. I became exactly like them. Negative. Totally negative) So I ain't trying this no more....</p>

<p>Please help me out with this, I've never been feeling so confused in my life and drained! The problem, at least the main one, is that they have the attitude of knowing everything or enough to get the best out of their lives and do not try to improve at all. Also wanting me to change, to be like them, to live their lives, the way they would like to have lived them Long story short my family has always had everything needed to live happily but never have had! What should I do now?</p>

<ul>
<li>We give him the food that we think he should be eating</li>
<li>He refuses to try the new food</li>
<li>He cries because he wants the food he is comfortable with</li>
<li>We try to encourage him, give him different options, let him play with his utensils, etc</li>
<li>He keeps crying</li>
<li>Eventually, we give him the food that he wants to eat</li>

<p>Is it better to give him the food that he wants to eat or to hold firm and only offer him the food that he should be eating? We are currently caving and giving him bread / baby food. Are we encouraging bad habits? I'm a little concerned that he knows if he throws a big enough fit that he'll get the food he wants and can therefore get away with not eating the other food. If we were to hold firm, he would still get a bottle so he wouldn't go hungry...</p>

"How and when should I tell my son that his amazing father isn't his biological father?","<p>My son is going on 5 and starting to learn a lot about how we're created. I've been with my husband for 10 years, but nearly 6 years ago I had no other choice but to move 1000 miles away and after trying the long distance thing it didn't work so we split up. </p>

<p>I ended up going through a rough patch and started dating an abusive jerk. After a year I was pregnant. He threatened me trying to force me to have an abortion and I refused. His grandmother was chief of police and he scared me into moving back to Florida.</p>

<p>Eventually, when I was 4 months along in my pregnancy my husband and I picked up right where we left off. He loved me so much and accepted our son as if he was his own and has done an amazing job at raising him. </p>

<p>He enrolled in college while I was pregnant, got us a house and went above and beyond to care for us both (as after giving birth I became very ill due to rare brain and spine conditions). I've always tried to do right by my son. Since day one, even while with my husband, I tried to keep the sperm donor involved. But he wanted no part of his son.</p>

<p>My husband stepped up when the biological father refused. The biological father would pretend that he cared, only to tell me he never cared about him anyway and was just trying to manipulate me into stopping child support (which I did anyway after the first year: I felt it wasn't right to take his money when my son had a dad who loved, supported and wanted him from the beginning).</p>

<p>This is a very long story so I'll try and make it not so much of a novel. The sperm donor has made it very clear he wants nothing ever to do with my son. My husband has been Dad since the moment my son entered this world. I've always planned to tell my son as early as possible. I think now, or in a few years, it won't be as hard on him compared to us telling him when he's a teen and who knows how he'd handle it. </p>

<p>I just don't know what to do. We have an extremely happy loving family. My son adores his dad. We never argue, we have a very happy non-dysfunctional marriage. I just feel we have a very special family. But I refuse to lie to my son. What if we wait and someone else maliciously tells him? Or if, when he's older and finds out, he spirals out of control?</p>

We're planning on meeting with therapists and I guess child development specialists, if someone could also point me in the right direction for what type of doctor is best suited in this situation. </p>

I don't think it would change anything for him, if that makes sense. I've been worrying over this for 5 years and really need some answers!</p>

"How to deal with a teenager who wants his parents to buy him everything his friends have?","<p>How do I teach my son the value of money and to differentiate between a need and a want?</p>

<p>The problem I am facing is that he is 19 years old, not 5 years old. He is my youngest son and to be honest I do not get along well with him due to personality differences and his stubborness.</p>

<p>Whenever he sees his friends have something, he wants it also -- ranging from clothes, latest smartphones etc. Due to his exposure to friends from high school and university that come from high income families, he always tries to fit in and dress nicely like them, buying expensive clothing and accessories when my family is just a middle class family; we can occasionally pamper him a bit but his spending is just outrageous. He always pesters my wife for more money, her being too loving of a mother she always gives in to him and gives him additional pocket money.</p>

<p>Recently I had another arguement with him. He is in university now and he sees some people in his university driving cars to class (he takes public transport). He calls me up and asks me to buy him a car. His thinking is: If other families can buy their children cars to drive to university, if my parents can afford to get me a car, why can't I have a car?</p>

<p>I do not think that a car is necessary in a city that has a good public transport system and it is only a short ride from where he is staying to the university. I explained it to him, telling him it is spending money unnecessarily and what I have written above. He refuses to listen (showing his stubborness), getting angry on the phone and we will not be talking to each other for a few days.</p>

<p>This kind of situations have happened frequently whenever he does not get what he want. All the times I have denied him what he wants, is because it is for his own good and it is a want and not a need. And additionally, we are not rich as his friends are so we can't be splashing cash so freely. It fustrates me because his thinking and mindset is too ""straightforward"", he refuses to look at things in life from another angle.</p>

<p>How do I deal with him? Because I am always trying to talk some sense into him, but it seems like I am hitting a brick wall whenever I speak to him. I have four other kids and none of them caused me these problems before! I never really needed to educate them and they all know the value of money!</p>

The question I have about this is, what are we trying to protect in supporting the head/neck ? My wife and I have a few possible ideas about this but aren't sure which (if any) are accurate.</p>

<ul>
<li>You want to support the neck/head to prevent the head from moving in an uncontrolled way, which could damage the brain.</li>
<li>Neck support could prevent the neck from being injured somehow. For example, if the neck is tilted to one side and a sudden muscle spasm pulls the head in the other direction, the baby could pull a muscle or something like that.</li>

"Should I allow or forbid my son to visit the education of a religion that I do not share?","<p>I'm an Agnostic. When the topic comes to religion, I try to explain to my seven-year-old son what religious persons believe and why I don't share that belief. Until recently, he shared my scepticism.</p>

<p>Where we live (Germany), pupils in elementary school must visit two hours per week of either religious education (""Religion""), offered by the churches, or an alternative. For older children, the alternative is usually ethics, for elementary school children it is often a supervised quiet work time, where pupils are given more or less boring extra exercises that will keep them busy for the time the other kids are in their religious class. Common offerings for religious education are Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and Muslim.</p>

<p>Since most of my son's friends visit the Catholic class, and since the quiet work time is uninspiring, my son decided (without consulting his parents) to visit the Catholic class instead. The Catholic teacher allowed this, and I learned of my son's decision when he told me of it a week or two after this change had been implemented.</p>

<p>My son loves this class. The children sing a lot, and my son loves to sing these songs at home (""God loves all children..."" is his favourite). If they don't sing, the teacher tells wonderful stories that impress my son who is generally very enamored of fantastic stories: he loves <em>The Hobbit</em>, <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>LEGO Chima</em>, and somehow the Biblical tales seem like fantasy come real to him.</p>

<p>My son has given himself a broad education (his teachers and parents are only the facilitators that help him gain the knowledge he seeks, e.g. by reading to him what he cannot or by answering his questions). He is very interested in everything from the natural sciences to history. One of his favourite topics are the Romans (a context, in which I explained to him the formation and development of Christianity), another are the Vikings, Celts and Germanic tribes.</p>

<p>He has been visiting the Catholic class for about half a year now, and last week, after we had watched a documentary on how the Christian faith spread to the Viking north and I said something about how ""God does not exist"", he told me that their teacher had explained how ""during Roman times people understood that the other gods do not exist, but that only God does"". A short exchange ensuing from this statement gave me the impression that <strong>my son is slowly acquiring a Christian faith</strong>.</p>

<p>As I stated initially, I am an Agnostic. I do not know whether God exists. And I liked to believe that I was open to my son finding his own answers to this question. But this development bothers be. Not because my son might find faith. But because his immaturity and gullibility are exploited by an institution (the Catholic church in the person of my son's religion teacher) to indoctrinate my son. Studies have shown that belief is most prevalent and most strong in persons who have been taught that belief as children. A clear indication that what most people see as their ""belief"" is mostly unquestioned habituation.</p>

<p>I am open to my son educating himself and coming to a different conclusion that I did. But I actually feel violated by my son being ""made"" to believe by singing songs and listening to charming tales. What I feel is similar to a parent worrying about what watching pornography will do to their children's adult sexuality. Or what playing violent videogames will do to their anger management:</p>

<p>I feel that the freedom to decide is taken away from my son.</p>

<p>But at the same time it was my son who decided to go to that class. And he loves it. So who am I to take that freedom and joy away from him?</p>

<p>I certainly don't think that believing in God would in any way harm my son. I even know from numerous studies that religious faith is a strong factor in finding a happy life. So there seems to be nothing that I need to protect my son from. On the other hand, believing that the Earth is flat wouldn't harm my son either – but is that a reason to let him believe such nonsense? To me, religion is on the same level with any other superstition, from not stepping on the cracks between flagstones to Santa Claus. I cannot quite understand why any adult would believe in something so clearly made up as a god.</p>

<p>So what do you think I should do? I would greatly appreciate your feedback on this.</p>

<p>If you are a religious person, it might help you with finding an answer to my question if you would imagine your child visiting the religious education of <em>another</em>, fundamentally different religion, or avoiding religious education altogether and visiting an atheist or agnostic class instead. Would you let them, if they wanted to and enjoyed it? Or would you want to enforce your own faith or at least protect them from the indoctrination until they are old enough to separate the singing from the believing? And how would you argue for it (apart from your belief that you know the truth)?</p>

<hr>

<p>In response to some of the comments and answers, I'd like to add:</p>

<p>Intellectually, I'm an agnostic. Emotionally, I'm a torn atheist. Just like many religious people are filled with a painful doubt, or doubters with a secret belief, I <strong>don't know</strong> whether God exists, but <strong>believe, he doesn't</strong>. I'm only human, and it is difficult to refrain from believing anything. My stance is with Stanislaw Lem in this matter, who was open to be convinced, but hadn't yet encountered a convincing clue, and in the absence of evidence, chose not to believe. Also, despite my worried question, religion plays no role whatsoever in my day-to-day life. I don't usually think, much less worry, about the existence of God at all.</p>

<p>Reading your thought inspiring feedback has helped me become a bit more clear about what worries me.</p>

<p>What worries me is not that my son might come to believe in God. What worries me is that he is <em>made</em> to believe by habituation. But even that is not what I'm most afraid of. What worries me most is that my son will be taught those aspects of Christian morality that I find unwholesome (such as the concept of sin and the views on sexuality).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>This question is not about how or whether to teach my son about Christian or any other faith. It is about how to deal with a situation where my son wants to partake in schooling that he enjoys for social reasons (his friends are there) but that conflicts with my values.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Update [March 2015]</h2>

<p>From the large number of views, comments and answers this question has attracted, it is evident that many people share my concerns. This confirms my feeling that I should make a conscious decision and not just <em>laissez faire</em>.</p>

<p>After careful consideration of all the wonderful answers and comments you were so generous to share with me, and a lot of soul-searching to become clearer about what bothers me and what I would ideally wish, I have come to the following insights:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Religion does not play any role at all in my day to day life.</p></li>
<li><p>My son is in this class not because he is interested in religion, but because of his friends.</p>

<p>Or in other words, he did not currently ask about religion, and there is not need to force that explanation on him now.</p></li>
<li><p>A person can learn about anything at any time in life. There is no <em>need</em> to learn about religion at the age of seven.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>ergo</em></p>

<p><strong>I would prefer for my son to <em>not encounter religion at all</em>, unless he becomes curious <em>by himself</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Since he so enjoys this class, I will let him visit it until the end of this school year, as <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/18898/should-i-allow-or-forbid-my-son-to-visit-the-education-of-a-religion-that-i-do-n/18918#18918"">corsiKa suggested in her answer</a>. During these months I will complement his Catholic education in the manner suggested by <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/18898/should-i-allow-or-forbid-my-son-to-visit-the-education-of-a-religion-that-i-do-n/18919#18919"">Steve Jessop in his answer</a>.</p>

<p>Next year I will tell his teachers that I do not want him to visit the religion class and find something interesting for him to do during quiet work time, as <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/18898/should-i-allow-or-forbid-my-son-to-visit-the-education-of-a-religion-that-i-do-n/18934#18934"">suggested by user3791372</a>.</p>

<p>There were many other answers (e.g. by anongoodnurse, Kyle Strand, Joe, Guntram Blohm, CreationEdge, Marianne013, anonymous, and Cort Ammon) and comments that I found helpful and I have upvoted them all. I choose Steve Jessop's answer, because it addresses the aspect I am most concerned about.</p>

<h1>Second Update [August 2016]</h1>

<p>My son has visited Catholic religious class for two years now. Contrary to my intention I let him continue to visit this class, because he so loves to be with his friends, and the alternative is just too boring.</p>

<p>I did pick up a couple of books on ancient and world religions as well as philosophy for kids from the library, and I read to him from them for a few weeks and discussed what we read, until stuff began to repeat and we both got bored by it.</p>

<p>I will let my son continue to visit the religious class next year, but I plan to make him visit Ethics when it is offered in high school the year after that.</p>

<p>My impression is that visiting the religious education did not turn my son into a believer. There was a phase when all the singing and tales of a kind, loving God got to him, but he has grown and developed and I think that his basic curiosity and scepticism are keeping the upper hand in the long run.</p>

<p>Certainly some ideas will have taken root in him, but it is still too early to know how they will influence his life in the long run.</p>

<p>I don't know whether or not I should tell my son about sperm donor? He willingly signed his rights over a month after my son was born without ever meeting him. He moved in with his mother's next door neighbor and never paid for our divorce or nothing concerning my child. </p>

"How should parents handle disagreement over medicine?","<p>I don't believe in homeopathy<sup>1)</sup>, but my wife does. Regardless of your personal stance on this, I'd like to know <strong>what are good ways to resolve a disagreement on homeopathy?</strong></p>

<p>I know the underlying science is <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/search?q=homeopathy"">discussed over at Skeptics.SE</a> but I am not asking about the science -- I am asking how resolving the conflict between the parents.</p>

<p>My wife takes after her mother and gives our 2yo son homeopathic stuff when he's ill. I have two problems with that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Homeopathy is not medicine. It has no active ingredients.</em><br>
If my son is not <em>really</em> ill but in slight discomfort (e.g. mild coughing), then I let my wife do her thing to avoid unnecessary conflict and let any potential placebo effect work. But if he's ill enough to need actual medicine, then I make sure he gets it. I don't trust placebo to cure actual illnesses.</p></li>
<li><p><em>I see that my son cannot tell the difference between homeopathy and real medicine.</em><br>
I fear this might cause him to ingest real medicine at some point when we're not looking, because he hasn't understood that it might be dangerous. If I allow him to beg for homeopathy (essentially <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/75/3467"">small sugar pills</a>) and mommy gives in to the begging, then what's to stop him from doing the same with real medicine?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am particularly worried because our pediatrician prefers homeopathic treatments as a first step (which inexplicably seems to be legal where we live) and will only ramp up to ""real"" medicine if the condition gets worse. <em>That kind of thinking is what killed Steve Jobs.</em> I feel that Austria is kind of the Dark Ages of medicine and I'm the only one who's discovered modern science.</p>

"frustrated and confused- my 5 yr. old is acting out and nothing we do at home seems to help","<p>My daughter is 5 yrs old. She is a very sweet little girl who normally is very much a people pleaser- she likes to do things that make you happy. However recently she has has issues in school- she told a little boy that her daddy was going to come to school and shoot him (which from my understanding was completely out of the blue as they were not even talking or playing near each other) and today a few weeks later she went up and punched the same boy in the nose. </p>

<p>According to her teacher she is fine with all the other kids and her ""behavior in class has improved greatly over the last month or so (meaning following the rules, not talking, staying on task, etc...). My first thought was that there had to be something more to what happened the fist time because that is just not like my daughter to go up and threaten someone, she is a very sweet and loving little girl but now she has punched this kid in the nose for no reason and when I asked her about it she said ""I didn't want too, I just did""</p>

<p>I am 14 weeks pregnant and now freaking out that one of two things is going on, neither of which is acceptable- either I'm doing something wrong as a parent- too strict, not strict enough, too much freedom for not enough, not enough ""I love you""s or something or I am raising a bad egg and that I refuse to believe but I'm scared </p>

<p>""I didn't want too , I just did"".... is it because I'm pregnant? Is she not getting enough attention? Is it because she actually really likes this boy?  She is 5 years old and fixing to get herself kicked out of school.... </p>

<p>I swear she is not a malicious person and she knew right away that she messed up because she told the kid sorry immediately..... but she is doing things she knows are wrong and I am doing everything I can and trying to take every opportunity to point out good and bad/ right and wrong  but apparently it is not doing any good..... and I am at my wit's end on what to do or how to help this from happening again.</p>

"How to handle post traumatic stress with my 6yr old daughter?","<p>4 weeks ago some weirdo shot at my balcony (probably for fun) with a gun used for practice. Anyway, the glass of my balcony door broke. At the same time my daughter of 6 was sitting just next to it, having her dinner. Of course that scared her a lot. My wife was at home at that time and took care of her immediately. </p>

<p>Since then my daughter is generally scared to be alone. She wasn't before. Almost every night (she sleeps at 9pm), she wakes up at 3 or 4am (sometimes earlier) and comes to our bed and continues her sleep. She wasn't doing this before. Whenever something is suddenly heard (like the beep sound of the oven) in the house, she is startled. In general since then she is startled very easily.</p>

<p>I must mention that her social interactions haven't been affected that much (for example at school, her friends or her teachers see no difference in her behaviour whatsoever). </p>

"How much should a caretaker push for mannered greetings and farewells from a pre-schooler?","<p>I care for a three-year-old child that is generally very well mannered and a joy to care for.  He takes after his dad in his morning attitude though (both of them need a little time to ""wake-up"" even after they are awake.  Of course, his Dad still has good manners, but is self- admitting that his son takes after him in this realm). </p>

<p>I'm okay with giving the three-year-old a little time (after-all, he is three) before he has to greet me politely - I know he will once that little brain switches on and then it is go go go with all kinds of love and good manners until about half an hour before nap-time.</p>

<p>However, the boy's parents are (rightfully and I am thankful for this) very concerned that he exhibit good manners toward me as well as themselves even right at the time of waking.</p>

<p>Should he get 20-30 minutes grace period while transitioning from sleep to wake-fullness AND transitioning from mom and dad to me all at the same time?  All he does for this first thirty minutes after waking up is watch a cartoon and hug mommy and daddy good-bye (and on some mornings - though not consistently, argue with mom and dad about whether he should say good morning to any of us yet).  </p>

<p>I think it is important to understand - I get this kid, I set my alarm half an hour earlier than everyone else in the house, so I can have a little time to wake without having to talk to anyone as an adult (of course if someone is up, I can say good morning and still function politely, but I am also not a three-year-old boy).</p>

<p>Once it is time to have breakfast and get dressed, then of course it is down to business and I fully expect manners - I guess I see this cartoon 30 minutes as a sort of extension of his sleep and don't mind if he pretends I'm not there until the TV goes off and he is saying good-bye to mom and dad.</p>

<p>I have not contradicted the parents, but I also am choosing not to join in at this point either.  I feel like it is a losing battle, and it starts the morning with a bunch of stress for everyone.  I wind up awkwardly being there waiting for the ""good morning""  he just isn't ready to give.  Thoughts?</p>

"Bed gets wet nearly each night although diaper is worn","<p>Our 5 (nearly 6) year old son has had problems with potty training for a long time now.</p>

<p>When he sleeps at night, he wears diapers, as he is not aware of peeing during the night yet and does not wake up in time. So far that's ok, we've contacted a specialised doctor and it seems to be normal that some children take longer until they learn how to control that.</p>

<h3>The practical problem:</h3>

<p>Even though he wears diapers (slip type, which he can put on by himself) in the night, it happens very often (sometimes daily) that the bed is really wet when he awakes in the morning.</p>

<p>My question:</p>

<ul>
<li>might it be the wrong diapers?</li>
<li>can anything be wrong with how he puts on the diapers?<br>
(We've tought him to make sure that the penis does not point upwards and that seems not to be the case.)</li>
<li>did anyone else have a similar problem and has a solution that worked for them?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Remarks:</h3>

<ul>
<li>we already try to reduce the amount of drinking during the evening meal </li>
<li>we already send him to the toilet directly after the evening meal<br>
<strong>and</strong> a second time later before he really goes to bed. He sleeps about 11 hours.</li>
<li>sure we use water-proof layers to protect the mattress, but exchanging and washing this layer and the fitted sheet nearly each day is quite a lot of work. </li>
<li>waking him up in the night for going to the toilet is quite difficult. He normally sleeps very soundly and when I try to wake him up for going to toilet he is kind of confused and mostly angry/grumpy.</li>
<li>he is sleeping in a loft bed which makes both waking him up or replacing sheets quite difficult</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Important addendum: Toilet training for the night and medical aspects</h2>

<p>In case you're having the same problem, one more remark might be important:</p>

<p>For our problems with encopresis and enuresis, which do last for years already, we consulted a doctor, specialized in this topic and still are in regular contact with her. </p>

<p>Concerning <em>bed wetting in the night (and not at all waking up before to go to the toilet)</em> she said:</p>

<p><strong>Children do have to develop the hormonal processes which make them wake up if they need to urinate during their sleep.</strong> Some do earlier, some do later, but <strong>you definitely can not ""teach"" them to wake up in the night</strong>! That's why a solution with a sensor in his pants which gives an alarm to wake him up will most probably not make sense yet.</p>

<h3>Hormone therapy</h3>

<p>The <em>only working solution</em> here at this stage would be a <strong>hormone therapy</strong>, which
suppresses the production of urine during the night (if I am not mistaken) and therefore reduces the urge to urinate.  </p>

<ul>
<li>That would be working instantly </li>
<li>and could apparently also be used punctually, e. g. if the child is sleeping at a friend's house or at a school camp) </li>
<li>but <strong>she would not recommend to use it permanently at this age (6) without urgent reasons</strong> (!)   </li>
<li>and we also do prefer washing bed sheets over feeding our child hormones to avoid that. </li>
</ul>

<p>(So for the given reasons we did not try that medicament yet.)</p>

<hr>

<h2>(EDIT) 2 years later</h2>

<p>the situation has not changed. He is about 8.5 years now and still needs a diaper each night.<br>
To avoid an ""overload"" of the diaper, we wake him up and send him to the toilet once per night between midnight and 2 AM. That way, we can avoid the bed getting wet regularly and reduces the laundry dramatically.<br>
It is still difficult to wake him up, but he has become used to it and is cooperative most times (and only rarely reacts angrily).</p>

<p>And for sure he still goes to the bathroom again, directly before going to bed around 8 PM. </p>

<p>We could not find a fixed scheme, at which time in the night he urinates. Mostly, the diaper is still dry when we wake him up, but sometimes it is not. And mostly the diaper will then still be dry in the morning, but sometimes it isn't.<br>
I think the composition of diner and what/how much he has drunk in the evening has a major effect.</p>

"Framework for letting 9yo get access without hard time limits","<p>My 9-year-old is in this situation concerning media:</p>

<ul>
<li>She has limited access to a family PC (restricted account with a time limit of X minutes per day). She uses that for Youtube and Minecraft.</li>
<li>She has a Nintendo Switch (again, with a daily time limit and parental controls in place). She sometimes gets games as present, and has to buy further games from her pocket money. No trouble here - she does not have that many games, and does not really want anymore either. Minecraft+Mario more or less do it for her.</li>
<li>She plays appropriate co-op games together with me on the PC (e.g., Humans Fall Flat, Trine etc.), which does not count against her time limit. Games are not per se a bad thing in our family and there is no ""bad taste"" about them.</li>
<li>She has no online identity of any kind (i.e., no account with which she can chat etc., anywhere).</li>
<li>There is no TV (sure BlueRay/DVD, but no classical TV/Netflix/etc. except for Youtube); and she's not missing that - never experienced it.</li>
</ul>

<p>But right now, she's hitting that age where everybody else has ""everything"" (laptops, tablets, smartphones, YouTube accounts, ...) and she has ""nothing"". It is in fact true that she sees those devices all around her - her (almost adult) sibling obviously has an unlimited smartphone; I do; and most of her friends have some kind of device (usually consoles/tablets, and occasionally smartphones).</p>

<p>The issue is not so much the technology or even prices (yesterdays devices are cheap enough on ebay and would be more than sufficient), but about her getting very much frustrated by the fact that there are these limitations imposed upon her (time limits, parental controls...). It is also not about wanting to have longer time limits at all; it is about <em>owning</em> stuff (devices, accounts, the power to decide when and what to do).</p>

<p>The reason why I employ those controls are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do trust her completely that she would not knowingly do something ""bad"". I.e., she has earned this trust over and over again in the past in everything she does in the digital and analog world. But I also do know fully well that she still has the normal children naivete/gullibility and is not ready yet for, for example, social media; i.e., if she gets a friend request in some online game, she is exceedingly happy about having a friend; she cannot yet distinguish what that word means in an online setting from what a real friend is. I am not trusting her not to divulge sensitive information quite yet; and also I am just a bit loath to devalue the concept of friendship in any way - she is not having an easy time building friendship with same-old real-world acquaintances (she has one actual friend, but it's labour to keep it that way...). </li>
<li>I know from experience that when I do relinquish the time limits (e.g., during holidays), she will more or less be online full-time, and do nothing else anymore; with all associated effects (being irritable, ""down"" etc.). The pull of that medium is all to irresistible, and again, I know from own experience how that works. Frankly, I want to protect her from that as long as humanly possible.</li>
<li>Aside from being creative and tinkering around with all kinds of stuff (cardboard, ""slime"" etc.), she has no other hobbies (sports, instrument etc.). I want to give her some ""downtime"" from the stuff that would consumer her complete time so that there is some chance for her to develop an interest in a real-world skill, which, as we know, are easiest to obtain in the age bracket she is entering now. I would not force some hobby on her; I did and do offer her things regularly (i.e., encourage her to test out hobbies; go to trial days together with her etc.) and so far there was nothing which really sparked her interest. But I'm pretty sure from what I am seeing around me in other families that if her time is consumed by devices, there is little to no chance that something will develop.</li>
</ul>

<p>With her older sister, we were very happy with waiting until 13 years until she had her first PC (restricted), and 15 until the first unrestricted smartphone; and having all limits be mostly technical instead of constant ""manual"" fighting over time removed all cause of day-to-day conflict. That one was hardly interested in anything though, so there was really no problem to solve, at all.</p>

<p>But this time around, the world has moved on, and continuing like this for 4 more years seems counterproductive - she is getting the feeling right now that she is being suppressed compared to others, that we are intentionally ""mean"" to her etc. Yes, I do know that kids know how to ""play"" their parents, but there certainly is something more going on in her mind currently, and there would be a good point in time to grow, right now.</p>

<p>I would <em>love</em> her to have complete ownership and accountability/responsibility for her stuff, and it would be great for her development, I think. I'm more or less just looking for a kind of ""framework"" to get this up and running smoothly, without falling into the obvious parental traps...</p>

<p>How do you do that with your children? Did you have a good solution? Did it work? Do you just give them free access and manage all the issues that may or may not crop up in the old-fashioned way?</p>

"How do you investigate what's going on in the pre-kindergarten classroom?","<p>For some, seeing the kindergarten teacher have such remarkable control over 20 children seems astonishing.</p>

<p>But she doesn't get that without <em>doing something</em>.  And the children don't always tell you what injustices have occurred during the day, even if you ask them.</p>

<p>Now a child is <em>not</em> wanting to go to school.  1-2 hours of crying in the morning.  When you ask him, he says things like ""it goes on for a long, long, long time.""</p>

<p>So it's boring.</p>

<p>But it seems like it's more than that.  We suspected bullying, but answers to questions like ""who do you like to play with, and why?"" and ""who do you not like to play with, and why??"" have answers like ""Lloyd"", they don't seem to point to bullying.</p>

<p>So we kept assuming it had to do with the other children.  But the children <em>don't</em> seem to be bullying each other.  One time one of us observed an Science activity put on by the teacher, we observed <em>very</em> obedient, well behaved kids, who went and sat on the carpet when told, and put their hands on their head when told, and ate their lunches when told, and didn't talk or interact with each other much <em>at all</em>.  Like little robots.</p>

Each spoon feeding session quickly causes her to break down into a fit of hysterics. We aren't sure if this is because she does not like the taste or if she isn't ready for spoon feeding.</p>

<p>Other than working with her do we have other options for limiting her fit? Should we wait a few weeks and try again? Should we try adding rice cereal to her bottle to get her used to the taste?</p>

"How to simultaneously spoon feed twins?","<p>My wife and I are on different schedules which during the week leaves one parent alone with the twins.

"How do you help a seven year old navigate life and friendships in a region where your beliefs vastly differ from the beliefs of the larger community","<p><strong>A Little Background</strong></p>

<p>I was raised Christian, and still believe in God and Christ's message of love, but am estranged from most Christian Churches because I don't find them to be truly loving places (members are often quite judgmental - particularly in our area and certain platitudes are passed on in Sunday School Classes as well.  As a result, none of us attends church with any regularity).  My husband is agnostic. </p>

<p>My daughter is seven, home schooled, and living in a heavily conservative region both politically and religiously in the US. Yet, I have friends with Jewish as well as Christian backgrounds. One set of grandparents is vehemently Atheist while the other is loosely Christian. I am Christian but like my parents very liberally so (many Christians in our area would not consider me Christian at all). We have some gay and lesbian friends as well, so our household is what I would describe as one of love and acceptance for most (KKK members, nazis and the like not allowed).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for her to have friends, it seems many of them are Christians, that in my opinion would fall into that crowd of people that are unknowingly rubbing elbows with the KKK and the Nazis in their level of judgement toward others thankfully, they are no where near as violent.  </p>

<p>My daughter wants to consider herself Christian despite the fact that I have told her time and again, she can't really make that choice until she understands a lot more about the faith as well as other belief systems.  Many of her friends are Christian and so is half her family and at seven, life is all about fitting in.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong> </p>

<p>However, because we had a pumpkin carving party, she had a couple of ""friends"" at school turn her down and claim she isn't really a Christian because she celebrates a pagan holiday (Little do they know that most of what we do at ""Christmas"" and ""Easter"" are also quite ""pagan"")</p>

<p>My daughter is feeling horrible.</p>

<p>I explained that in their view we aren't true Christians because we don't believe what they think we are supposed to believe to be Christians. I talked to her about how Jesus taught us about love and forgiveness, so I don't believe their actions and words were Christian under my definition of the word either. I also told her I don't believe any of them are really old enough to truly have chosen a faith yet anyway. I reassured her that it was wonderful to be who she is with or without a faith-label and that there are plenty of good people that are not Christian (her Dad being one of them) as well as plenty of good people who are.</p>

<p>We also talked a lot about friendship and what it means to be a good friend and what kinds of friends we want in our lives anyway.</p>

<p>Of course, she is still feeling horrible, left out and judged harshly.</p>

<p>Any ideas about how to talk to her about this one?  </p>

<p>Also, any ideas about how to guide her in speaking with others about faith and belief when it comes up in a way that allows for her to ""save face"" with others while also standing true to ""the journey?""</p>

"Three year old gags when he tries new foods","<p>I spend a lot of time caring for a three-year-old that is a pretty picky eater.  However, the stuff he does eat is generally fairly healthy stuff.  Lately he has started gagging on food he isn't sure about before he tries them.  Normally, I'd just continue with the ""you need to try it"" thing (as would his mother - her parenting style is actually quite similar to mine which is REALLY nice!)  However, the thing about this one is that they are honest gags followed by coughing and sometimes even a little throw-up.  I think he just gets himself so worked up in his head about how it will be awful that then when he tries the thing it really is that awful.  </p>

<p>One example is at a party he gagged on peanut butter and ritz cracker sandwiches (one of his absolute favorites) because they were made to look like spiders with two raisin eyes (he loves raisins) and eight crunchy chow mien noodles (which his mom had picked off already).  That example alone isn't a big deal, but it definitely shows how it is really in his head and not about actual taste or texture.</p>

"Family stress due to unemployment, ways to help my family?","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>Dad's unemployment causing a lot of stress on my mum, who works a few part-time jobs and also manages the household. I want to offer help, but now sure how to. I want to know ways to alleviate my mum's stress, ways to make sure my sisters are not affected by the situation, and ways of persuading my dad to start looking for a job.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>My dad has been unemployed for almost 7 years. My mum has several small jobs so her income isn't very steady, and she is extremely busy, as she also takes care of family finances and she tries to do the housework - she's very worn out, and I'm worried about her health. Me and my sisters try to help out but we're students and we prioritise our studies. My dad helps too, but he housework isn't really his thing. He doesn't really do much. He doesn't mean to do this, I think, but he doesn't prioritise and doesn't notice that the housework needs to be done, and will only do tasks if we ask him a few times.</p>

<p>When I was still in school, my mum frequently vented to me how frustrated she was with my dad's unemployment, until I asked her not to, as it was hard for me to listen to her talk about my dad like this. I still don't like talking about it, but I feel like I should, as I want to understand how our family's finance is doing, and how I can help. Whenever I bring up fiances or my dad's unemployment or my mum working too much, though, she gets touchy and upset (and this makes me upset as well). My mum told me a couple of times that she's worried about their retirement, and this worries me too, since I'm not sure if I'll have a good enough job to support my parents as well as my sisters.</p>

<p>I plan on supporting my family as much as I can once I get a full-time job, but that won't be for another five, six years, as I'm studying for an undergrad part-time. At the moment, I only have a part time job, and I don't contribute to the family's financial needs. My mum doesn't like it when I offer to contribute to groceries, pay rent etc. My sisters are still in school and do not have jobs, and I know it costs an arm and a leg to raise kids. I want to help my mum, but I don't know what to do. I thought at least talking about it and trying to listen to her would help, but I'm not able to do this calmly, as my dad's unemployment is still a touchy subject and we always end up fighting.</p>

<p>How can I alleviate some of the stress my mum is under, how can I offer her help, and how do I ensure my sisters don't have to worry about this? How can I convince my dad to find a job, when my mum had not been able to do so for so long?</p>

<p>What can I do right now, and what can I think about doing in the future that will help my family?</p>

<p>Sorry about the length of this post, hoping someone has some wisdom.</p>

"Frequent night wakings - what can be done to help a mobile poor sleeper","<p>I am a sleep deprived mum of a 9 1/2 month old boy. He's otherwise a smiley, healthy and seems to be on the top percentile for both weight and height for his age. So he doesn't seem to be sleep deprived, grumpy and starving or obese.</p>

<p>He is also completely breastfed- fresh from the tap, not through choice but he simply refuses the bottle (which is another issue) but my plan is to wean him in 3-4 months. He also doesn't take the pacifier... he objects to anything artificial in his mouth and we have tried many things (except for starving him until he takes the bottle) and now we have simply given up. He's eating solid alright and basically enjoy eating, he has also cut his day feeds drastically. </p>

<p>Nighttime however is becoming more and more of a nightmare. He was never a good sleeper and I made the rookie mistake of letting him sleep on the breast. I never managed the put him down awake thing that everyone else seems to be able to do. We also co-sleep so that I wouldn't die from all the multiple wakings. </p>

<p>Recently things have gotten from bad to worse. He goes to sleep fairly easily but wakes up every hour up to midnight or 1 am, then he wakes up every 2 hours until he wakes up for the day between 0600 to 0630. He goes to bad between 1830 to 1930 depending on when he wakes up from his last nap but typically he is out by 1900. Then the hourly waking starts. </p>

<p>I have searched the Internet and it seems the sleep association is to blame, as he falls asleep on the breast he needs it to get back to sleep again. He can't connect the sleep cycles himself. These sounds most likely the most plausible reason, but what can I do about it save cry-it-out?? I think he also have a second sleep association- which is being close to me. Sometimes (but rarely) he does get off the breast and wiggles himself to sleep but usually stuck against me.</p>

<p>The reason why I would like to leave CIO until there are no options left are because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He wails and get more upset the longer he cries. He doesn't calm down easily once he starts.</p></li>
<li><p>He started crawling and few days later crusing and now he can go from furniture to furniture and climb down from the sofa, things actually started to worsen a month ago when he started turning in his sleep and got on all fours at night and started crying but he wasn't mobile until 2 weeks ago. </p></li>
<li><p>He is teething. His 3 teeth broke through in a week and one more on the way. I started giving him ibuprofen yesterday and he seemed to have slept better; will do it again tonight.</p></li>
<li><p>His separation anxiety seems to be getting worse. He was always clingy but now he wails when I leave the room and crawls to chase after me. He also clutches to be tightly after every feed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So with so much going on, I really don't want to make it harder for him.. but at the same time things are getting worse on the home front as dear husband is blaming me for fostering his bad habits, inhibiting his ability to be independent and basically being the reason why he can smooth himself to sleep.</p>

<p>What can I do to improve the situation? Should I wait it out, cry it out?</p>

I am really having trouble accepting any answer here.  Many people posted insightful comments giving good parenting advice.  I appreciate that.  Some provided other alternatives to news.  But most seem to say there is no good source, while I have found too many to research them all!  It seems like many people wanted to give parenting advice rather than answer the question.

"Should we leave our daughter at home with her uncle if she then cries?","<p>My daughter is 4+ years old. We used to take her with us wherever we went until recently when we had a doctor's appointment around 10PM. We wanted her to stay home with her uncle because taking her out at that time didn't seem good for her. She usually goes to bed around 10 to 11 PM. Her uncle leaves with us and loves/cares her a lot. But surprisingly she was extemely reluctant to let us go without her. We offered her all those things she usually craves for, like unlimited cartoons, games and what not, but all this stuff got completely worthless compared to our companionship. (My daughter complains less when my mom comes to visit us.)</p>

<p>On that day we eventually managed to leave without her. But later we got to know that she cried a lot, also vomited. But after like half an hour she stopped crying and started watching cartoons. Today we again have a doctor's appointment around the same time and we have already informed her about this. She again seems so sad and is crying from time to time.</p>

<li>Should I really listen to her and take with us wherever we go? Isn't she old enough to stay without us for a couple of hours?</li>
<li>Am I doing any harm to her by forcing her to stay back at home? Or is it good for her because she is learning how to handle such sadness?</li>
</ul>

<p>It's really hard for us to see her in this state, so unless we are really doing a favor to her, I don't want to let her cry. So please suggest.</p>

"What to do with a 7-year-old who just started stealing?","<p>My 7-year-old daughter is currently on vacation from school until this Monday.  Yesterday, she was in ""camp"" - a full-day version of the after-care program we usually send her to.  At some point, she went into the backpack of one of her friends, took out the friend's slime that they had both been playing with, and put it into her own backpack.  The friend told a counselor that our daughter had taken it.  The counselor called my wife who searched the backpack and found the missing items.  Our daughter at first vociferously denied taking them but finally owned up to it.  My wife made her apologize to the counselor for lying, and my wife and the other kid's mom came up with a plan for our daughter to ""make it right"" with the other girl.  </p>

<p>We had discussions with our daughter, about how stealing is bad, and that she was betraying her friend's trust.  The agreed-upon punishment was that my daughter would write a card to her friend, apologizing and telling her why she valued her as a friend.  I recommended that slime never be allowed in the house again, so that we'd know that if we saw it, it was stolen.  But, we made it clear that that was only something we were considering.  We asked her if we should mention this to all of the friends we'd see that night.  She really didn't like that idea (and neither did we, so we didn't do it).  I bring this up, because it implies to me that she knew that what she had done was wrong. My wife at some point that evening talked with her about trust and how important it is, and she seemed very contrite and sorry for her actions.</p>

<p>Today, we went to a store.  My daughter and her younger sister were not behaving perfectly, but not horribly.  They played with some toys in a small toy section with our permission.  I kept within earshot, but wasn't watching every minute of what they did.  At some point, my daughter found some slime she liked, that was apparently already removed from its outer packaging.  She put it under her shirt and successfully snuck out of the store with it.  We didn't find out until an hour or two later when my wife walked by her room and she tried hiding it.  When my wife saw what was in her hands, we recognized it from the store.  At first, we yelled a lot, about breaking trust, about how could she do something like that, especially after yesterday's events.  Then we called the store manager, brought our daughter in, had her apologize and do whatever the manager wanted.  The manager told her ""don't ever do it again.""  Then we had her pay for the product with her allowance money, and as soon as we left the store, we had her throw it out in a trash can.  We've also had someone we know who has worked retail loss prevention describe to our daughter what happened when she caught people stealing at her store.  </p>

<p>I very seriously considered contacting some police friends we have and asking them to put my daughter in handcuffs for an hour or at the very least talk with her about her actions.  We haven't done that yet.  We're being as careful as possible to describe her actions as bad, and refer to it as theft and stealing, but not overly refer to her as a thief.  We want to be sure to say that the actions were bad, but that she isn't.  We definitely don't want her to identify as a thief, but have no problem rubbing in that she's someone who committed theft.</p>

<p>After repeatedly asking her why she did it, she eventually said, ""Because I wanted the slime.""  She does have more than enough allowance and gift money to be able to pay for this $3.50 item (or even to pay for the $7.00 it said on it).  For a while she was not allowed to buy slime - she begged us to buy some for her in October and promised she wouldn't ask for any more for the rest of the year (her choice to do this, not us asking) but we did hold her to it.  She knew that her promise expired as of the first and we had even talked about her getting slime.  </p>

<p>My wife and I both feel betrayed by our daughter doing something that we feel is abhorrent.  My wife has been asking me, ""Where did we go wrong?""  I told her, ""We haven't.  She knows what's right and wrong.  She's exploring boundaries.""  I would really like to believe this, but I don't think I do.  What can we do to make sure these two incidents of stealing are all she does?</p>

"Is PediaSure okay for toddlers and if not how to get them off it?","<p>For several reasons my daughter had to be weaned off breast milk when she was around 14 months. At that point she was not eating well and lost a lot of weight. One pediatrician recommended we give her PediaSure, and that was the only food she drank consistently (she didn't even take regular milk). And by giving her 2-3 bottles of that a day we slowly brought her weight back up to almost normal for her age.</p>

<p>Now she is 20 months old and still drinks that amount, but recently I read some articles saying that stuff is full of sugar and chemicals and has been linked to food allergies (one of my younger brothers also has severe food allergies and drank that stuff at that age).</p>

<p>My best friend has two little girls (seriously, this is about my best friend.  Not me.).  Her oldest just turned five and, when it comes to eating, is a perfectly normal eater.  Actually, I consider her a very good eater.  She eats healthy foods, she doesn't over-eat, she eats a wide variety of foods, and she doesn't exhibit the normal eating issues I see with so many kids her age.</p>

<p>Her younger daughter will turn 3 at the beginning of April, and she has always been a BIG eater from the time she was a baby.  She was taking full 8-oz. bottles of formula by the time she was 3 months old every two hours, and this went on until she was almost a year old.  My best friend would have to carry around a can of formula wherever she went so she could always be prepared.  Rarely does she leave anything on her plate at mealtimes, and she will frequently finish off whatever is left on other's plates.  She's not necessarily overweight, though she's probably a little on the ""chunky"" side for her age.  We've all kind of just rolled our eyes in the past and said a little indulgently, ""Well, that's just Avery.""</p>

It seems that one morning, the babysitter was feeding another baby some oatmeal and Avery came over, plunged her hands into the bowl of oatmeal, and started shoveling handfuls of food into her mouth.  Later that afternoon, at lunchtime, another little boy left the table to visit the restroom, and while he was gone Avery ate the rest of the little boy's lunch before the babysitter could even jump in and stop her.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this has my friend worried.  She has worried about her daughter's eating habits since she was a baby.  My friend and I have both struggled with our weight most of our lives, so I sympathize with her and I understand her concern.</p>

<p>Anyone out there have any experience with this?  Any medical reasons anyone can think of that might be causing this?  I think we all assumed that this was something she would eventually grow out of, but this new behavior has us all thinking that there may be something more to it. </p>

<p>I realize this is not a specific question, but if you have experience with this condition, I would really like to hear about it.  How did your child react to the therapy?  How long did the therapy go on for?  How did it affect your child's long-term physical development?</p>

"What are some possible ways to deal with night-time tantrums","<p>My daughter, who is coming up for 3 years old has never been a good sleeper. She regularly wakes during the night, sometimes up to 3 or 4 times but more commonly once or twice.</p>

<p>More often than not she simply wants comforting from her mum, but all too often it turns into a full blown tantrum with the typical tantrum behaviour of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Screaming / Crying</li>
<li>Lashing out / Hitting</li>
<li>Head banging / Hair pulling</li>
</ul>

<p>During the day, tantrums are quite rare. She is a very well behaved child for the most part, with what I would consider to be a <em>very</em> good ability to communicate for her age (I mention this because most advice on tantrums says that the child is having trouble communicating). The problem is that at night she seems to be almost half asleep and totally unable to rationalise or communicate. I don't however think that this is a case of night-terror as she doesn't exhibit the typical behaviour of screaming whilst clearly still fully asleep.</p>

<p>I tend to deal with this by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Switching her bedroom light on (I <em>know</em> this is bad, but the only way i've found to end the tantrum is to wake her up fully, and the light as we know stimulates her awake)</li>
<li>Shut her door (She has a baby sister in the next room, I cant have her screaming in the hallway as it'll wake the baby)</li>
<li>Sit with her in her room (I hate the idea of shutting her in there on her own. Although this leads to other problems as she then gets violent with me for blocking her way out. Bit of a catch 22, if I dont sit in front of the door she'll run into the hall and scream. If I do, she lashes out at me).</li>
<li>Let the tantrum run its course (This sometimes takes up to 30 minutes, but typically 15. Once the tantrum is over she turns back into the well-behaved child I know. Has a cuddle, and goes straight back to bed without a fuss).</li>
</ul>

<p>So does anyone have any insight how to deal with this? Am I doing it all wrong? I'm sure she will grow out of it - they almost always all do, but I would like to hear others POV.</p>

<p>Often when she doesn't want to eat any more savoury food she is more than happy to have something sweet - fruit or yoghurt or sometimes even (I blame her mother!) a bit of cake. At this age she has not been influenced by advertising or other social factors and is acting out of instinct - some form of evolutionary impulse which has aided human development for a very long time. This leads me to think that maybe sugar may have some benefits for infants and is actually quite important for them to have some.</p>

I spent all AM and lunch there with her yesterday and today. It's a family based homecare and I've only heard very positive things so I'm not worried about the family or that anything bad happened while I'm gone. </p>

<p>So this morning I brought my LO to the group and felt things were well, she was playing with toys and happy to be there, so I decided to try a short 30 minutes 
separation. I went for a walk then hung in my car parked across the street. It was about 20 minutes or so when I started hearing her crying very loudly all the way outside. I waited a few minutes, hoping I could rejoin the group after she stops so she doesn't associate crying means mom comes back.</p>

<p>She seemed fairly distressed about the staircase. The teacher said her son came downstairs and forgot to close the gate. My LO is a climber and she wanted to go there when the teacher locked the gate.

<p>Her distress about the staircase went on and off for the remaining hour or so. It seemed to be better after lunch but I am wondering if we go back tomorrow, should I tend on avoiding the staircase a bit or having her face it but reassure her? What signs should I watch for?</p>

"How to teach new parents to apply early childhood education to improve cognitive outcomes in their children?","<p><strong>What are the most common ways for new parents to put in practice early childhood education?</strong></p>

"Relation of Multiple languages to (overall) development of child","<p>I have been to most questions related <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bilingual"">bilingual</a> aspects where whether and how should one introduce more than one language to child. This helps. </p>

<p>I am trying to find a bit broader opinion as to what is the relationship between development of the kids with their earlier exposure to multiple languages. </p>

<p>For specific in our case as well with my child just turned 4. We are in India. We usually speak in Gujarati at home, but since we were migrated to Hindi and English has been common with other kids, play group as well. (Much less outside people spoke to him in Gujarati). He has been a very late speaker (started almost after 2 and half years). And he is more natural with Hindi than Gujarati (our family language); though he now does speak all three languages. So does it look like a case that multiple language confusion is the real reason for late language development? </p>

<p>What is wanted to know is that if the situation persists, what are the likely areas of development (language, intellectual, reasoning, social or any other area) he could be lacking due to situation like this? Will he continue to lag further behind in development compared to other kids or will this not be a longer term issue?</p>

"What to do when a 6-year-old expresses suicidal thoughts?","<p>A mom at my daughter's school told me that her son told her that my 6-year-old daughter told him that she doesn't like herself and wants to kill herself.</p>

<p>I'm really not sure how to approach this with my daughter.  She definitely is the sort of person who will say things for attention, and of course the kindergarten gossip line is hardly reliable.  I suspect she wouldn't be saying something like that if she hadn't heard it somewhere before; I know she hasn't heard it from me.  Her mom and I are not together, and it's possible that she heard it at her mom's house, or on TV (again, not at my house.)</p>

<p>I have noticed that my daughter seems to be taking criticism very hard recently.  For instance, the other day I was showing her how to hold cheese so she could cut it with a cheese slicer without her fingers being in a position where they could get cut, and she burst into tears.  (I only let her slice cheese with a cheese slicer under supervision.)</p>

<p>It has occurred to me that she is at about the age when a real understanding of death can come, and that she may be processing that.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that if I bring up what she (supposedly) said to a kid a school, then she will feel like she's in trouble.  But I don't want to ignore the issue if she really needs help.  How should I respond to this?  How can I tell if she is depressed, and how can I help her if she is?</p>

"How do I manage my toddler's fear to use the potty?","<p>My LO is almost 15 months. She just started walking and has been really good at climbing on chairs for a while so I figured we'd buy a potty, no pressure, just to get her used to the idea. I sat her on it a few times and she seemed to enjoy it, and peed in it twice. So I taught her the word ""pee"" as well as the sign and got a potty training storybook out and she seemed thrilled. </p>

<p>The third time she peed on the potty, she seemed to notice she was ""leaking"" and got really distressed and crying uncontrollably. She then stood up from the potty, pooped on the floor and sat back on the potty, and started crying again. </p>

<p>So we reassured her and congratulated her, even about the poop and everything. But ever since, although she still loves the potty book, still says the word/sign, still likes the potty object, she will cry whenever she sits on it (even when fully dressed) and look down to see what's going on. So I put the potty away for now. </p>

<p>I've read that some toddlers feel like they are losing a part of themselves when going potty but nothing about how to better handle it.</p>

<p>I am wondering, will this pass on its own? Is she just ""not ready""? Should I keep engaging her with the story/leave the potty out? Should I show her that I'm fine while using the potty?</p>

<p>No colic occurs when we give her mother milk. Furthermore she can sleep 4.5 hours without interruption after she finished the bottle of mother milk. Probably she compensates for sleep she missed while suffering colic. </p>

Based on my own family's background and the community we live in, I don't anticipate this being a big issue for our child (now 1yo), but I know it will come up in some ways and I'd like ideas for what to be prepared for, and I think it's an worthwhile topic in general. At this point aspects of the question that apply to early childhood up through preschool/early-elementary are the most relevant to me, but I'd also like to hear ideas for later on.</p>

<p>In Egypt, daughters must carry the same name as the father, my name is different from my father's, hence the conclusion of being adopted.</p>

<p>On to the actual topic: I have been living in fear of my father since I was 6 years old. He left my mother and me when I was five and married another woman behind our backs. I have despised him ever since but my mother would have me spend every Friday with him and his family even though she hates it.</p>

"What to do when parents disagree over medical care?","<p>What can you do when parents disagree about medical care?</p>

<p>In this case (friends of mine), the mother is undiscriminating about medical care. She forms highly speculative ideas about what might be wrong with children and rushes them to the doctor on any medical concern. She accepts the recommendations of doctors completely uncritically. This has led to situations where the children have been prescribed medicine in an indiscriminate manner. For example, in one case a GP prescribed a powerful anti-protozoan with potentially serious effects without making any diagnosis (a simple urine test had come back negative). The GP stated, ""this will clean out the system"". We are talking country doctors here.</p>

<p>The father is the exact opposite. His impulse is self-treat and use doctors as a last resort. When going to a doctor he wants a positive and sure diagnosis to be made before drugs are administered, especially potentially dangerous drugs. In many cases he wants second opinions, or to take the children to specialist. So, he is measure nine times before cutting once.</p>

<p>This polarity is causing serious strife and arguments. Worse, the mother is taking the children secretly to doctors and trying to get the children to take medications secretly without the father knowing and tells the children not to tell their father what they are doing. Of course, the children inform him anyway.</p>

"How important is it for a mother to have help around the house when she has several young children?","<p>My wife is a stay at home mom and we have 3 daughters (ages 5, 20 months and 1 month old). How important is it for a woman in her situation to get help around the house providing child care for this many kids and doing the domestic duties like cooking and cleaning? I work full time and I try to help out in the evenings and weekends, and we often eat out so she doesn't have to cook. But that is about all I can do myself.</p>

<p>There is really no one we can ask for help. She says she is okay and that she can handle it. But I would like to do more for her (like paying someone to come and help, even though that would be expensive).</p>

<p>So is it in the ability of most women to handle this level of child care and domestic responsibilities or at this point do they really need help?</p>

<p><strong>Edited to add</strong>: </p>

<p>Thank you all for your input, the fact that it is a matter of opinion actually answers my question. I will defer to my wife's judgment then and leave the decision to her (which for the time being is that she doesn't need outside help).</p>

<p>I was just thinking that there is no way any woman can cope with this level of work and from the response here I see it is possible and since my wife says she can handle it and I don't see the children being neglected then I will just try my best to help and trust in her abilities and judgment of the situation.</p>

"Toddler ignoring dad and change in his attitude","<p>Our son is really a good boy listening the first time on everything and doesn’t cry, but recently he has been the opposite. I m not strict but his mom is strict and recently my wife started a part time job since 3-4 months and he stays that time with his grandma and uncle. </p>

<p>What I have noticed is that he started using mobile for games. When other relatives' kids come over they play on mobile. He cried that he wanted too, so grandma and his mom got him one which I oppose. He is also crying when coming back home from grandma, but his recent change in mood has worried me. </p>

<p>He won’t listen to me over and over even after repeating until I scare him that I will take away his iPad or turn off TV. In comparison he is quick to listen to his mom. even when we are in the same room, while playing games on mobile, he would rather tell me to wait and the same thing after 5-10 min. As for his cousins, their parents don't bother as they literally give the mobile or ""12 hours cartoon"" to get them busy and it is not until someone cries that any of the parents pays attention. He learned it from them, but you cannot tell another's child not to do something, because your own child is getting spoiled (i.e. to not use mobile).</p>

<p>My frustration is why the sudden change of me repeating over and over again but he is not listening or crying to his mom. What is going on? Why is my son so agitated?</p>

"2 year old rarely eats food, needs bottle and milk and drinks a lot of water","<p>My son completely refuses to eat food. If I forcefully insert it in his mouth, he tries to vomit and throws the food out of his mouth.<br>
He loves milk in his bottle, which we give him only when he is ready to sleep. He won't sleep unless we give him that bottle with milk.<br>
We try to give him food which we normally eat, we totally avoid sugary foods, chocolate, everything 'fancy' or 'junkfood' which is damageable.</p>

<p>Till now we could not understand what his favorite food is, except for his bottle and milk.<br>
He eats whenever he is extremely hungry and at that time also refuses to eat unless we forcefully put the first morsel in his mouth, then he continues for some time and when he gathers enough energy, tries to throw up and avoids and runs and cries.</p>

<p>Another thing is that he drinks a lot of water, a lot means a lot for his age.</p>

<p>How do we make him eat our food, is there any training or trick? And how to remove that bottle attachment?</p>

"5 yr old behavioral/anger problems","<p>My daughter, in the past 6 months has been displaying severe anger. When a toy doesn't come together, if she doesn't get her way... she throws herself on the floor and starts kicking and screaming. Now, they tell me that she is purposely going after the teachers to kick them. Before, the teachers would get hurt because they would attempt to physically remove her. To this, I thought... ""well leave her alone and eventually she'll stop"". Like in many articles I've read: ""Ignore the child when throwing a tantrum"". At her daycare they have worked with me in strategies to deal with these situations, to no avail.</p>

<p>At first, we decided that if she misbehaves at school then the consequences would be dealt with at school. Before, when they told me she had a ""bad day"", I would ground her. But it wasn't fair that she would be punished all day for it. I implemented the ""marble system""... that worked for a whole week. I had to include my 6yr old son, because he felt left out. Since he's 90% of the time good, she felt it was a competition... and when a marble would be taken away she would lightly punch her head and say ""I'm a dumb dumb"". I explained to her that she is not a dumb dumb, she just has to make better choices. I read her ""Sometimes I'm bumbaloo"", book about a turtle and another book about how it's ok to be angry, but stop and think.  I've told her to ""blow bubbles""...""squeeze her fists tight and stop and think.</p>

<p>We started w/spanking, then to taking away toys, to privileges being taken away... Now, I try to talk to her with a calm and loving manner. I've even cried in front of her when I'm frustrated... she expresses concern, guilt and regret, but come the next day she's back at it again. I've involved everyone and anyone in hopes of getting advice or direction, but nothing has worked yet. I've explained to her the importance of her good behavior and the consequences of bad behavior. I've broken it down for her.....for example: if you misbehave you will get kicked out of daycare, mommy will lose her job, we will lose our house, we will have no money, we'll have to give our dogs away and live off of nature...I made it real drastic to see if it had an impact... NOT!!! I've sat down w/her and asked why she has so much anger, why she hurts her teachers?? I've told her we don't hurt the people we love and used reverse psychology.... ""would you like it if your teachers kicked you?""... they keep giving you chances because they love you... and you hurt them.. why?? Silence is what I get w/sorry. I told her sorry doesn't cut it. I asked her ""if i cut your finger off and then say I'm sorry, does that make it better? No, right? Your finger is still cut off.... then that's the same with when you hurt your teachers... you can't take it back."" Any suggestions please....???</p>

"Should my 12-year son see, how I fail?","<p>I have a 12-year old son. I don't live with his mother, but I try to do as much as possible to help him grow up a happy and healthy adult.</p>

<p>Couple of months ago I learned he had problems with maths and started to investigate what the cause may be. Among other things, I asked him what cool stuff they did at school during the last 30 days. He couldn't answer.</p>

<p>Then I asked him, what cool stuff he would like to do, if it was possible.</p>

<p>The answer was ""something related to programming"".</p>

<p>Thereafter we (me and his mother) made him the following offer: If he manages to earn enough money with a legal, ethical job, me and his mother won't bother him with grades (""enough"" means ""enough to survive in his region in a place separate from his mom's"").</p>

<p>He said he'd like to learn everything it takes to make money with programming, but he doesn't want to give up on school.</p>

<p>Then I started to teach him programming (I'm a software developer myself). First couple of lessons were about the ways he can make a living programming (employment, freelancing, own company). We have been learning to program via Skype since then. Large part of the sessions runs like this: I explain a particular FreeCodeCamp lesson to him (both of us look at the same text), then he tries to do the exercise. I help him, if he has difficulties.</p>

<p>At other times I'm just talking with him, usually discussing some article I found on the Internet and which I consider useful for him.</p>

<p>My impression is that he does less than he could. Sometimes he does an exercise in less than five minutes, but doesn't want to do the next one. Also, right now he doesn't seem to do them in his leisure time.</p>

<p>I tried several motivation hacks. I sent him the ""Pirates of the Silicon Valley"" movie. I explained to him the principle of conditioning (the stuff with the Pavlovian dog) -- when he rewards himself by eating a small, sugar-free candy after every completed exercise, it's easier to keep going.</p>

<p>There is a big gun I could use: I'm also constantly testing business ideas (mostly tech-related) and could tell him, how I do it myself. Up to now I never told him about this because most of my ideas were bad (didn't pass the validation phase). There are pros and cons.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of telling the child about how I test my business ideas</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>He will learn, how to test ideas on low budget (i. e. in a safe way, without taking unreasonable risks).</li>
<li>He will see, what lean methodology looks in practice.</li>
<li>He may get motivated -- sometimes you can change a person's behavior by doing what you are preaching yourself. If he looks at me testing ideas, he may some day do the same himself.</li>
<li>He may learn, how to learn from feedback (the art and science of hypothesis testing).</li>
<li>He may learn, how to find out things that nobody can tell you (scientific method). When you have a new product, no authority on Earth can tell you whether or not it will be useful to somebody.</li>
<li>If a particular idea fails, he will see, how I get up and move on (pivot) to the next one (i. e. that failure does not need to destroy a person).</li>
<li>He could learn the economic common sense that most people lack and which you can acquire only by doing a lot of business planning (incl. basics of accounting). This common sense is useful regardless of whether or not a person wants to start a business. Acquired common sense like ""you can't spend more than you earn indefinitely"" allows you, among other things, to stay out of numerous traps that financial institutions put in front of you (e. g. ""fast and easy"" consumer credits; a big problem in the region where he lives).</li>
<li>In the ideal case, he will learn, how to build a company that is tailored to his personality.</li>
<li>Potentially, a better emotional bond. Building a business is the second most important thing in my life (first being the child). If I show him that big part, it could lead to a deeper and better connection between us.</li>
<li>I could argue that even if I continue to fail at business, it's better than not trying it. This activity keeps me alive and prevents me from drinking alcohol, starting unhealthy relationships, and making other suboptimal choices. There are women worth chasing even with zero chance of having a relationship with them (by ""chasing"" I mean primarily improving oneself to become worthier of her). I could argue that the same applies to my business-building activities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>

<p>My biggest concern is that he sees me trying and failing, he could make the wrong conclusion that he shouldn't even attempt entrepreneurship. A German business book says that many children of failed entrepreneurs are so traumatized that they don't even consider starting a business themselves.</p>

<p>All my ideas failed so far, but he didn't suffer because of those losses (I lost time and some non-catastrophic amounts of money).</p>

<p>Should I show and tell my son, how I'm trying to build the company of my dreams </p>

<ul>
<li>here and now, or </li>
<li>do it when and if I've made my first billion?</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any other risks I'm not aware of?</p>

"Should I be concerned about this poem?","<p>My daughter (11) chose this poem to take to school and present to her class:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes when I'm alone I cry because I'm on my own<br>
  The tears are bitter and warm<br>
  They flow with life, but take no form, I cry because my heart is torn.<br>
  I find it difficult to carry on. If I had an ear to confide in, I would cry among my treasured friend<br>
  But who do you know that stops that long, to help another carry on<br>
  The world moves fast and it would rather pass by<br>
  Than to stop and see what makes one cry, so painful and sad<br>
  And sometimes I cry and no one cares about why.</p>

"Can Prozac stunt a teenager's growth?","<p>I have a close friend whose son turned 14 last October. He started on 10mg of Prozac in September 2013, gradually increased to 60mg in July 2014, where he has remained.</p>

<p>My friend keeps regular records of her son's height, and he has not grown a single centimeter in the past eight months. His height was tracking slightly below average, but otherwise normal, prior to this.</p>

<p>His pediatrician did blood work in January and does not recommend any action at this time, so we assume his hormone levels are normal. (I have already suggested confirming this with the pediatrician.) But my friend is very worried. Just given the timing, the Prozac looks like a plausible culprit... But of course that could be random coincidence.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<p>1) Are there any reliable studies demonstrating or refuting a link between Prozac and stunted growth in teenagers? Simple Web searches turn up many pages, but they seem to be largely anecdotal.</p>

<p>2) What advice would you give to my friend?</p>

"Toddler misbehaves a lot less with dad, than with mom","<p>My 2-year-old is misbehaving a lot less with me, than with his mom. He goes to bed without issues, stops watching TV when it's time for bed, no tantrums in the super market (mostly), no problems with brushing teeth, when he is with me. With his mom, it's a very different story.</p>

<p>When he is with her there is constant tension, which is partly her reaction to his behaviour, but he does act up more with her, he insists on what he wants more, he cries far longer, when he doesn't get it. For example, when I go for a long subway drive with him, he starts to complain and revolt at some point, but it's manageable, whereas with her it's a lot worse. I definitley don't let him do as much in public, I tend to insist holding his hand for example, while she is more willing, to let him run around the super market for example.</p>

<p>I have suspected, that this is due to him feeling more close to his mom, and maybe because I am less prone to give in to his ""tactics"" and more likely to ignore the tantrums and make less compromises etc.</p>

<p>I have read, that a child will let out stronger emotions, when with mom, because of the closer relationship with her. Especially when she comes back from work, he will instantly go to her and start acting up, which I read is good for the child, as a way to vent or let it all out.</p>

<p>I have noticed, that when I start making more compromises, that he starts to act up more with me too. At least, that's what I think I noticed, anecdotally.</p>

<p>So I thought, maybe him not acting up with me is actually a sign of a feeling of distance? Maybe I should optimize for more acting up with me not less? On the other hand he seems perfectly fine and happy, knowing that there is no point arguing with me about brushing teeth and watching TV, since it's a hopeless cause. He seems to be calm and happy, knowing exactly what is going to happen next, etc. I also often spend time with him and he doesn't complain, most of the time, when his mother leaves and he falls asleep with only me present without issue.</p>

<p>So basically I am not sure, what would be better for him: Feeling more intimate with me, but acting up more. Or maybe feeling more distance to me, but being calmer and acting up less?</p>

<p>Is there any data on the subject?</p>

Every other weekend for a day, I have him over at my house where I live with my wife and 2 daughters (7 and 3). </p>

<p>There was a time when he would speak and play with my eldest daughter, but the past few months he has begun to ignore her (he would smile and say 'hello' but that is it). My daughter has asked me why her uncle is different now and I just told her that he prefers to be by himself (not sure how to explain his exact condition to her). He still talks with me though (and she has probably noticed this as well).</p>

<p>I don't want to ask him why his behavior changed because I learned a long time ago not to criticize anything he does (he always assumes that I am blaming him or trying to find fault with him).</p>

<p>So given that he is ignoring her now, is it better to keep him away from the house and my daughter? Should I just meet him outside or go over to his place?</p>

<p>For now my daughter seems to have figured out not to expect too much from him and she just plays by herself or with her younger sister when he is around (I play with her also when he leaves).</p>

"Should middle school students/high school students be able to choose their own bedtime?","<p>Sleeping is important, but do students have the right to choose when they do so? Or should they let their parents decide the bedtime? Students above the age 12 need over 8 hours of sleep. It's important or you'll be drowsy, moody, upset angry etc. You will also be refreshed every morning, and have the ability to stay up longer without a proper amount. </p>

<p>If a student above that age has the right to choose their own bed time, they can choose when they feel is right when to go to bed or wake up. They may not get this right at first, but students need their own arrangement to take breaks, do school work, and other. Though an arranged bedtime by your parents may be difficult to follow, maybe by 9 p.m. This may not give you enough time to complete the tasks you've been thinking about doing. </p>

"What to do when a child gets angry while trying to lead a group?","<p>On a children's camp we have a group of 4 boys (around 12 years old) with no appointed leader. One of the boys is naturally trying to lead the others, but they are lazy, so it's not easy for him. The problem is that one of them is not just lazy, but he's intentionally sabotaging games and other activities. This behaviour makes the one who's trying to be their leader very angry, to the point he gets a tantrum and we have to forcibly move him away and hold him till he calms down.</p>

<hr>

<p>Based on anongoodnurse's comment:</p>

<p>They have been together in their groups for about 11 days. Mostly, they spend together about 3-4 hours a day (during some games or other activities). Of course, we always try to explain the troublemaker that he should behave, but it's difficult because he isn't demonstrably doing anything wrong; it's just the way he ""unintentionally"" slows down the others etc. We haven't tried anything in order to prevent this problem yet; it only happened 2 times so now we're just begining to think what to do about it. The other boys take the ""leader""-in-the-making as an actual leader - they follow him, mostly; when he gets angry, they don't laugh, they take it quite seriously, although they don't do anything about it (they just stay back).</p>

"Handling a toddler at a hotel/hostel","<p>My parents asked if we'd like to go on a vacation with some of my extended family. The vacation will be spent almost entirely at a nice hostel; we mostly want to relax and spend quality family time together. In general I've enjoyed these vacations in past years, but the last two times we've tried to vacation with my daughter (now 1 year 10 months) have been extremely difficult. My two biggest problems are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It doesn't look like we can get something with more than one room. This means that whenever my daughter is asleep, somebody needs to be <em>in the room</em> with her, with the lights off, keeping pretty quiet. (She usually sleeps 2.5 hours in the early afternoon, and goes to sleep at 9pm.)</li>
<li>Meals are a central part of the vacation,  with all the family sitting round together. But with a toddler they become very difficult. At home I can let my daughter run around and play if she's not eating precisely when we are. But in any kind of lodging, the dining room is large and crowded with strangers. This means she needs constant supervision throughout meals - which means either me or my wife can't really participate in the ""main event.""</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to all this, there's all the usual hassle of taking care of a kid without our full homecourt arsenal of toys, food, etc. And, on the other hand, there's not much present for <em>her</em> to do and to enjoy, except general running around (and getting <em>kvelled</em> over by the entire family).</p>

<p>So the bottom line is, <strong>watching my daughter becomes such a hassle under these conditions,</strong> that I (and/or my wife) have little time to actually enjoy the vacation itself.</p>

<p>Are there ways to avoid these problems and actually enjoy what the vacation was originally meant for? Or should we pass on this particular gathering, in favor of spending family time without vacationing, and vacation time in more toddler-friendly (or toddler-free) circumstances?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This vacation is planned around a Jewish holiday, during which lots of normal everyday activities are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activities_prohibited_on_Shabbat"">forbidden</a> - including using computers, phones and TVs; driving (e.g. away from the hostel); listening to music. I'd appreciate answers that took this into consideration, though for the purposes of the FAQ-for-the-ages I also welcome suggestions that ignore this limitation.</p>

"Do we need an electronic breast pump?","<p>Since we plan that my wife is going to be a full-time/stay at home mom, do you think she will need an electronic breast pump? </p>

<p>We are first time parents. We do not sure if we need the electric one or the manual one. The thing that we worry the most is that manual pump can't give us enough stock for our newborn. We want to trade off between the cost and the usability.  We understand the benefit of electric pump such as using less time to do pumping. However, as we mention, if my wife is stay at home all the time, is it necessary? </p>

"Disadvantages of a single bedroom?","<p>Looking ahead to the future, me and my partner often discuss how we would raise children. In these conversations, recently, a theme of sleeping arrangements has emerged.</p>

<p>We appear to agree that a lot of teen and preteen isolationist tendencies could be curbed if we had a single communal bedroom. We also believe it would foster a tighter family bond, and would likely be cheaper to boot.</p>

<p>Now, it made us wonder why this is not the norm? Why do we give kids their own rooms? By extension, and in essence, what would be the disadvantages of such a communal bedroom arrangement?</p>

<p>Incidentally, but of note, we believe sex would not be an issue, as we have no intention of ever hiding that from children in the first place. We want it to be normalized before any questions need to be answered.</p>

<p>My family and I are going to the beach this July.  It will be the first trip to the beach for my son, my daughter, and my husband.  My daughter will be a few days shy of her second birthday when we go, and my husband insists that she needs a life jacket.  We obviously have no intention of letting her go near the water on her own, and when we do go in the water it will be shallow water and we'll be holding her the entire time.  </p>

<p>I see my husband's point.  Yes, there's the possibility that something <em>could</em> happen and she <em>could</em> sprint away from us and into the water without us, or we <em>could</em> lose our hold on her and drop her I guess.  With four adults (my parents are coming, too), I just don't think it's that much of a concern.</p>

<p>However, I agreed that I would post to the community and agree to the consensus.  So:  life jacket or no life jacket?  </p>

<p>If you recommend life jacket, could you point me towards a place where I can find a life jacket for a child who weighs &lt;25 lbs?  My daughter is VERY small for her age and we <em>might</em> hit 25 pounds by her birthday--maybe.  She's 21ish pounds right now.</p>

"Language Developmental Milestones of Children at higher stages?","<p>In the early stages of language development, children goes through milestones such as  </p>

<ul>
<li>Speech blurbs,</li>
<li>Single words, </li>
<li>double words, </li>
<li>Use of verbs </li>
<li>full sentence  etc.

</ul>

<p>Now by the age of 2.5 to 3 (and in case of my kid it is at 3.5 years) children do express themselves reasonably well. </p>

<p>However, there are many kids at four which are very clear in their expressions just like any other adult and are also comfortable expressing ideas at a bit more complex and abstract levels; where as in my kid (also observed in some kids) manage to speak only actionable (often not very fluent) or in other words their ideas are restricted. </p>

<p>My question is: what are the milestones of language (and if you consider it as cognitive) development of children <em>after</em> the are able to get basic speech? How do they evolve from there both in developing their languages and their understanding of details of the world? </p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: i don't know if cognition and language are two independent things. I, as a parent, only want to be knowledgeable about a typical growth path that children follow (or are expected to follow) after basic speech is achieved.</p>

"Should toddlers have learning goals?","<p>My two (almost 2-year old children) have started going to a day care centre a couple of days a week - they seem quite happy there and it's all going well. The centre has a learning framework for the early years and has asked us what our learning objectives and goals were for our children. The framework lays out goal areas such as developing a sense of well-being, showing confidence and independence, etc.</p>

<p>So I am simply wondering whether my kids should actually have goals at such a young age. If you have objectives, then you must also think about performance (are objectives being met?) and what you do with it (if objectives are not met, then what?). My instinct tells me this is all overcooked, that my children will soon enough be under scrutiny and required to perform (against standards, others, themselves, etc.), and for the rest of their life (at school, at work, outside, etc.). Doesn't putting objectives on them so early put unnecessary pressure on them (and us)? Am I missing something altogether?</p>

"Is it better to introduce formula while my daughter is still drinking breast milk? If so, how gradually should it be introduced?","<p>My wife was fortunate enough to produce a lot of breast milk (enough to feed our 7-month-old daughter and also pump a significant amount, which we froze).  In the first few months of our daughter's life, she was exclusively breast feeding, but now my wife is back to work and her supply is naturally dwindling and she's now at the point where she's no longer pumping.  We're guessing that on an average day, our daughter gets maybe 4-6 oz. per day from breast feeding, and about 22-24 oz. from our frozen supply.</p>

<p>We probably have about 6 weeks' worth of frozen milk left (2 months' worth at the most), and at that point, my wife probably won't be producing anything, so we'll have to transition to formula.  Note that the milk is in a deep freezer, and it's unlikely that any will be more than 6 months' old when she drinks it.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>It seems better to me that we should start feeding her formula while she's also drinking breast milk, so it's not a big shock (and so we have breast milk to feed her in case we need to try different formulas, etc.).  Is this true?</li>
<li>If so, is there an ideal time to start the formula (e.g. when we have 2 weeks' worth of breast milk left)?  At that point, how much formula vs. breast milk should we use?  Should we introduce the formula slowly (e.g. start with 1 bottle per day of formula vs. 4 of breast milk, and then work our way up to 5 formula?)</li>
<li>Should we mix the formula with breast milk (i.e. in the same bottle?)  If so, similar question to above - should we start with a low % of formula in each bottle and work our way up to 100% formula in a bottle as a way to ease her into it?</li>

"Is it possible to control iPad message language without my 10-year-old daughter hating me?","<p>A few weeks ago I found my 10-year-old daughter using inappropriate language on her iPad. As it was the first time I caught her swearing, and the message was more in her own defense of another's bullying, I didn't go too hard on her. We do not swear in our home. I let her know it was inappropriate and wouldn't be tolerated in the future.</p>

<p>Her time spent on her iPad (which she bought with her own money) has gotten out of control, and her attitude and disrespect towards me has gotten worse.

We effectively let her drop a year after the first year because she was so far behind the other children. We have effectively practised every single day during that period.</p>

<p>She now can play until the 8th song but again is falling behind.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verbally wants to stop, says that she never wanted to start</li>
<li>Never wants to practice, we have tried different times of the day, giving stars where she gets a gift after getting 10 stars</li>
<li>The violin school is a great place, it's a very friendly community that does everything together on a Saturday morning - there's nothing like it anywhere near us</li>
<li>She is ingraining bad habits - holding the bow, holding the violin, posture</li>
<li>She will do the absolute minimum in group lessons by just pretending to play with her fingers </li>
<li>We've been considering quitting for over a year</li>
<li>There does seem to be more of a problem than just motivation, she gets very confused with similar song structures and seems to forget what she has learned very quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>Going well:</p>

<ul>
<li>She can learn to sing the songs - and sing them very nicely</li>
<li>She has made it to song 8 and is slower than the other current students but not as bad as with the first year</li>

"How does a parent's misophonia impact the child?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Misophonia</a> is hatred of sound. The condition causes the individual to have a reaction of sudden rage and stress and the need to get away from the sound.

<p>I do not yet have a child. This is one of the deciding factors for which I will or will not have a child. </p>

<p>The reaction varies depending on the sound and source of the sound. I usually leave. Ear plugs and noise cancelling headphones, music do not work in most cases. I have above average hearing acuity ( has been tested).</p>

"What can I do to get my wife to be more involved?","<p>I'm writing this in the middle of the night, right after a bottle feed and a nappy change coupled with incessant wailing piercing through my ears. I've often tried to seek solace on the internet hoping that I'm not alone in this situation and that someone out there has some answers to offer or, at the very least, is able to say that I'm not alone in this trying times. </p>

<p>My daughter was delivered via c-section just over 3 weeks ago due to unforeseen birth complications that arose during labour. Upon seeing the amount of pain, discomfort and immobility my wife had to endure in the first few hours and days post-op, I offered to sleep on the couch with the cot by my side during the night so that I can tend to my daughter (change her nappies, bottle feed her and rock her back to sleep) without her jolting my wife up from sleep with her crying. I made it my goal to ensure that she had at least 6 - 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep before she gets up to breast feed at intervals in the day. My mother-in-law also chips in to help during the day so that my wife wouldn't have to move about too much. All I wanted for her was to have a speedier recovery so that we could look after our child to the best we can. </p>

<p>3 weeks on, I endured with only an hour or 2 of sleep in the night before throttling off to work. I usually knock off around 5 - 6pm and get back home in less than an hour. I try to have my dinner as quickly as possible before starting my shift around 8pm by helping my wife to bathe and then tending to my baby. My mother in law is usually exhausted by then so she usually turns in early. The last breast feed my wife gives is at around 11 or 12 before she turns in and leaves everything else to me.</p>

<p>3 weeks in with the lack of sleep accumulating and work piling up, I'm beginning to feel increasingly frustrated that:</p>

<p>1) Despite making such quick recovery and being able to move around without assistance (the Gynae has even remarked that she has recovered extremely well), my wife doesn't seem to be getting herself involved as much as I would like her to be. I'm still running the same night shifts and my mother in law is still doing the bulk of the work in the day. My wife does chip on a few rare occasions when neither of us are available, but that usually amounts up to 1 or 2 nappy changes.</p>

<p>2) No one in the household seems to recognize that I still have a job to do in the day in order to pay for all my family's necessities. Not once has there ever been an offer to lighten my burden; somehow it has just become an expectation that I have to fulfill by default. </p>

<p>Does anyone know how I can cope with this? I understand that it generally takes 6 weeks for c-sect mothers to fully recuperate but by the 2nd week or so, most are able to tend to basic things. </p>

<p>Does basic things constitute of just breast feeding or is there more that c-sect mothers can and should do 3 weeks in? </p>

<p>It seems that fathers traditionally make up the half of parents that do not contribute enough or are unable to properly fulfill parental duties. The internet has no lack of advices on how mothers can ""deal"" with this. Is there something that fathers can do if they find themselves in a reversed situation like mine?  </p>

<p>My night shifts are driving me nuts and it doesn't help that my daughter is showing signs of baby colic. </p>

<p>Can somebody point me in the right direction? </p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>I wish I could mark all the responses I've gotten so far as an answer because every single one has so much truth in it. </p>

<p>I took the time to speak with my wife a little about my frustrations and limitations today. Although we haven't really gotten into the motion of working things out just yet, I certainly felt a lot better speaking and talking about it. I could tell that my wife appreciates the honesty as well. How things pan out at the end of the day remains to be seen, but I'm definitely a lot more optimistic than I was yesterday. </p>

<p>A big thank you for all the support and advices that I have received thus far. I'll be accepting the first response as the answer not because it is any better or worse than the others but because I should at the very least mark this thread with an ""answered"". I hope that I'm not stepping on any toes by doing so; please be assured that every single response I have gotten has really provided me with valuable insights and support. </p>

"Am I losing control as a father and head of house?","<p>Our 3.5-year-old son just keep reacting: asking mom about all things. He doesn’t care if I am calling. if he is crying I am trying to console him. He would fight me to go to mother and I keep repeating his name but he wouldn’t listen. 
It has become very frustrating for me. It is like talking to a wall or a mean person. I know he is my son but I feel like I don’t have any respect like my words doesn’t matter. He do listen to a strict voice of his mom, when I get strict voice he would run for his mom and we end up having argument that I am not understanding him (TBH I give him my best) but she has a upper hand being strict even scaring him that he get spanked with shoes (Asian standard of locking in dark room).</p>

<p>Background: I work full time, my wife works part time. He is with his grandma. He got 4 uncles all under 30. I think they lack etiquette. There is yelling, loud laughter. My son got constipation and making him do potty is a HUGE issue which is all crying and screaming. He wants to see TV all day and want mobile while going to bed and wake up to ask mobile (the reason is my wife wake up late and he wake early so to make him busy she gives mobile) and lately we had a fight because he kept asking mobile.
At night and I kept saying no mobile in night, but he was constantly ignoring me and kept repeating to his mother during which I lost my cool. </p>

<p>Even in grandma's house it’s mobile or TV because she cannot take her out, her boys are either on TV, mobile or PS4. </p>

Again blame game). But I really want to take the things out which is making him so ignorant towards me. </p>

She has started solids but is not eating much so I'll be breastfeeding her. She is not a good sleeper though but loves going on walks and looking at people and the scenery. </p>

"Different discipline approaches by working mommy and stay-home daddy","<p>I work at home (although me being independent is almost a euphemism for being unemployed).  My wife is the primary breadwinner in our household.  My wife is also currently under a lot of stress, as her job responsibilities have increased in the lasts months, we have faced some unexpected payments, her mother died after a long deteriorating disease, etc.</p>

<p>We also have some disagreements in how to upbring our children.</p>

<p>I rather have the kids take responsibility of their acts (v.g. if you don't make your bed you have to sleep in an undone bed; if you don't to your homework you will get a bad grade) while, on the other hand, I am pretty relaxed on enforcing behavior. Probably too much relaxed.</p>

<p>My wife, on the other hand, prefers to watch them more tightly, giving orders and expecting orders to be followed, or else.  She rather prevents undesired consequences (v.g. living in a mess, getting bad grades, etc.) so if the kid does not follows an order, he or she will be punished but the chore will be made by someone else.</p>

<p>This leads to some conflicts, and while I attempt not to reverse her orders or decisions in-front of the kids, she is a little less reserved in criticizing my parenting, and pointing that bad behavior from our kids (particularly from the older boy, 8) is induced by my bad example.  She also accuses my relaxing parenting as just laziness.</p>

<p>While she might be right at some points, I do believe I am not always wrong.  When I try to point out some disagreement she usually feels attacked.  I do believe she should calm down, and having a more relaxed attitude that would even help her with her own stress.</p>

<p>But my main concern is how my kids are getting these mixed messages.  Too controlled by their mother, too relaxed by their father, and not having to deal with direct consequences of their behavior other than being grounded or having TV and gaming privileges revoked.</p>

<p>Am I right in this last concern?  How can I prevent giving these mixed messages?  How can I (we) mitigate the effects or how would I prepare to the consequences?</p>

"Father always wants to be right","<p>I am a 22 year old living with my parents. I'm currently in quite a bit of distress as my father has kicked me out. I assume my mom will talk with him when she gets back from her night shift but for now I'm not welcome. He assaulted me (tried to strangle me) before kicking me out. </p>

<p>The reason we had this argument is because he always wants to be right. My sister had insulted me minutes before because I had done something slightly wrong. I was aware of what I had done wrong and accepted that. I did not however accept the insult. My dad explained what I did wrong. In turn I explained I didn't like being insulted. He said ""You don't understand, you did X wrong."" It went on a bit like that. He just got more and more angry. I kept telling him I did understand, but I didn't like being insulted about it. I probably got angry too. Then he exploded and assaulted me. This happens more often. My sister and my boyfriend pulled him away from me, dad told me to leave, but I went all out on my sister. I told her I hate her and it was all her fault. I don't hate her, I said that in anger and frustration. </p>

<p>He has been angry before with me and it's always been because he says I don't listen or I (or my brother or sister) doesn't agree with him. I don't know what to do with this. How do I handle it when my father only wants to hear ""You are right"" and nothing else? He has argued with me and others over things that could be proven wrong. He once argued with me how a place looked that I had visited that day and he last visited 30 years ago. There were absolutely no stairs over there, he said. Now I even said he was right but he didn't accept that I felt insulted. </p>

<p>What can I do when my father always wants to be right? How can I speak to him about this?</p>

<p>I should probably mention both my father and I have been diagnosed with autism. And I don't want anything legally done. I love my father and understand why he does this. I need to know how to cope with it somehow. Excuse my ranty post. I'm fine with edits to the structure. </p>

"Drawing the line between abuse and ""roughhousing"" a teenager?","<p>While this is not anyone in my family, I witnessed a father at a party treating his adolescent daughter like crap. The daughter's kind of introverted and didn't socialize too much, but the father would frequently approach her, say something offensive, and when she would retaliate, he'd punch her in her arm and sort of wrestle with her, but she didn't enjoy it and wasn't having fun, often screaming for her mother to get him to stop, but the mother wouldn't do anything either. He would stop after she screamed for her mother though, but the fact of the matter is that if he's annoying and agonizing her this much in PUBLIC, he could be treating her even worse in private.</p>

<p>He seems to see her as a ""teenage punk"" and treats her rough because I guess he is either a jerk or also doesn't like the way that she treats him, but maybe she treats him distantly because he is treating her like crap? I don't know, but one time she stayed sleeping longer than usual, and she was in a  bad/annoyed mood, and I saw him grab her and start clapping really loudly in her face, and when she throw an arm in his direction, he twisted her arm behind her back and put her in a headlock and everyone was laughing but her face suggested that she didn't find it funny at all.</p>

<p>Basically, he yanks her by her arm, punches her (not as hard as he can, but still does it with some force to anger her), and is always roughhousing her, even though she doesn't like any of it and resents it/him despite lots of people laughing like it's ""father-daughter-time"" or such, but I feel that she's being negatively impacted by this by being the target of his behavior towards her.</p>

<p>He often doesn't do it out of visible anger like one would think, but laughs/finds it amusing to do. I do not tell anyone because he's my relative's boyfriend's sister's husband, and I don't want to start my trouble with everyone, including family members of my own by saying anything negative.</p>

"Are playpens (playards) physically or mentally damaging?","<p>I just cancelled my order for a playpen. The playpen that I ordered is 1.2 m x 2 m (we live in a city apartment). I read online that putting your baby in a playpen is akin to neglect. Babies placed in a playpen could grow up to be less intelligent than their peers because they are not free to explore their surroundings. Their curiosity and creativity will be dampened apparently. They could experience developmental delay because they can't access furniture to assist them to stand or walk. In addition, I read that it may cause depression because of the isolation. They could even experience language delay because of being left alone. What do you think? </p>

<p>Another thing I was thinking was, what if I sit in the playpen and play with her? Because one of the annoying things is having to contain her to stop her from hurting herself (we have tile floors so she gets hurt when she falls down). I was thinking I'd put a soft playmat inside the playpen. </p>

"How to spank in public without having everyone around you assume you're a child abuser?","<p>I believe corporal punishment to be a useful tool in the tool-shed when it comes to lovingly training my beautiful 3 year old boy.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

<p>For the purposes of this question, I'll just say that my style of corporal punishment is to stop what my child is doing, <em>calmly</em> tell them why I'm going to spank them, and then give them a strike on the rear or hand that is <em>just light enough to be uncomfortable</em>, then reiterate my expectation and give them a hug and a kiss.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<p>This method has been phenomenally effective for my wife and me and we have no qualms with doing it at home or in front of friends/family that we know implement the same style of parenting. I do not, however, <strong>ever</strong> spank my kid in public or in front of strangers.<sup>[3]</sup> Not even a flick on the hand. I don't want to embarrass him, but even more-so I'm petrified of having someone call Child Protective Services (CPS) on me because they may believe that all physical punishment points to heinous abuse back at home. I'm not ignorant to the fact that spanking has (for whatever reason) gained a bad reputation in the last decade, but I'm also not ignorant to the fact that many (most?) parents spank their kids too.</p>

<p>I live in a state that allows physical punishment so legally I should have no concerns, but I still find myself stuck when my child disobeys in public and I feel forced to do nothing about it until we get home (which by then it would be too late for them to associate their bad behavior with the spanking anyway). <strong>Is there a way to execute corporal punishment in public without triggering unknowing and irrational fears in strangers?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>[1] This is not an invitation to debate as to whether or not you agree with spanking. This is asking for a best-practice guide on spanking in public. I started my question with <em>""I believe corporal punishment to be a useful tool...""</em> to set the precedent for any expected answers (unlike <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/5170/how-to-avoid-corporal-punishment"">this question</a>) :)</p>

<p>[2] Note that he initiates 90% of these hugs, and I <em>never</em> force affection on him. The whole ""spank then hug"" thing was not a planned out disciplining strategy. It just sort of happened once and now it's routine. He expects it and I think it helps him to know that the issue is over and done and daddy isn't mad anymore.</p>

<p>[3] When I say ""in public"" I don't mean I hop on a table and shout ""<em>TIME FOR YUR SPANKIN!!1</em>"" and then whoop on him. I would still be as subtle and discreet as possible.</p>

"Dealing with the psychological consequences of punishment in parenting","<p>I'm 18 yo boy living pretty much an amazing life. Yet, I've been dealing with feeling of annoyance(sometimes anger but not as rough as the word sounds) every time(almost) I hear people talking very quitely or in a desperate way or unenthusiastically or unenergetically and so on. This has lead me to become an amazing personality in terms of productivity, achievements, attraction of people into my life or whatever you can think of related to progress. Anyway, there are some drawbacks I've noticed.</p>

<p>The way I was raised wasn't the kind that any child would like. Note that if you say I need to forgive my parents, do not worry I've already done this. The thing is that some memories have plunged so deep into my brain that somehwere along the line, the reactions I get from them have become just habits. <a href=""http://textuploader.com/mnbx"" rel=""nofollow"">Additional info</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently this isn't one of the best ways to raise a child. Despite all the positives I get from being annoyed from negative people, unenthusiastic and so on I'd like to stop getting agnry at these things. Stop paying attention to them. I'm really, really trying hard but at times it's just the stupid habit I've developed. Sometimes I talk with friends, very close ones and if I hear similar sounds to the mentioned above I get angry and this way I hurt them(not physycally but by stopping being responsive(not talking or answering with few words) and taking my time to calm down). So, please community give me all the advices you can that might help me deal with this. <strong>EDIT:</strong> How can I start to relate all these annoying sounds of the talks with something that would make me feel if not good at least nothing? How can I stop recalling all these memories from my childhood(note when I hear smb talking it's just happening on a subconscious level, I don't visualize anything in front of me or smth, it just happens under my lowest layers of my thought)?</p>

<p>P.S. And parents... please think before you punish your kid! With me things aren't that serious but if I didn't find the strength to deal with this, I'd have become very destructive by now. I'd say you can always find a way to make your child do smth by treats and making him/her interested in the certain activity. Never tend to punish them! Never shout at them, trust me although they might not show it, it kind of stays deep down burried in their minds.</p>

"When is corporal punishment abuse, really?","<p>My friend (who believes in corporal punishment delivered lovingly<sup>[1]</sup>) has cancelled two of her pediatrician appointments now because one or another of her (4) children have had bruises on their bottoms. I also know that some kids bruise more easily than others. Her pediatrician (who was also ours) does not object to corporal punishment in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>I know of, and witness, her deep love for her kids. She just really believes in corporal punishment. I've never seen her deliver it (it's always done in private), nor have I ever seen her really out of control with her kids, though some of the stuff she comes out with is pretty wild (she told her oldest, knowing he wasn't trying his hardest in an AP math course, ""I don't care how hard you try. What matters is that you get an A."" He got an A the next semester.) The kids don't seem to be afraid of their parents (indeed, the opposite is true; their relationship seems very positive); they seem to respect their kid's feelings (while at times differing with them, and it is clear that they believe in instilling their values - and only their values - in their kids), and the kids are very (but not robotically) polite with adults. Honestly, they are lively, intelligent, seemingly happy kids who get along beautifully. They are also all high-achievers (each of her kids are proficient in piano and are studying a second instrument of their choice.)</p>

<p>I have really mixed feelings about the fact that she's actually had to reschedule appointments to hide the fact that she does use corporal punishment. I have no mixed feelings about what the Pearls espouse; I detest it. Yet it seems to work <em>in this case</em>, and no, her kids are not frightened automatons.</p>

<p>I know what seems abusive to me, and that involves more not recognizing and respecting the rights of people to feel and believe the way they do (obviously barring mental illness where delusions are present.) Refusing to recognize boundaries, and that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Are there any studies that <em>don't</em> support the idea that all corporal punishment is abusive? Or that, at any event, not everyone suffers serious consequences from it?</p>

<p>I've read some of the previous posts on corporal punishment. I'm honestly kind of looking for an intelligent discussion of the subject that avoids knee-jerk responses, so to speak.</p>

<p>If this should be closed as a dupe, I can live with that quite well.</p>

<p>I never fully understood the details but my dad always said that the courts had ordered both him and my mom to give me money because I am young or was still in school or something like that. He claims that my mom didn't give me the money owed, and that he wants 4 years worth of financial records from me. My dad had given a series of post dated checks and made it clear this was his contribution. My mom seemed to haphazardly give me money. It was very confusing as I was covered by both of my parents extended medical and sometimes my mom would include these payments with the reimbursement from medical. Also she would sometimes direct transfer money into my bank account so I didn't know it was coming from her. For the record it wouldn't be unusual for my mom not to be fully honest and for my dad to be bad at explaining things.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to do. My dad basically wants income statements from the past 4 years, which I don't really have on hand. I guess a question I could ask him is if needs everything or would it help if I only had the info for some of my jobs and could guess the rest? (over the past 4 years I have worked at several different places)</p>

<p>How much work, if any should I put into this? Should I start trying to call up past employers and ask to speak to the pay roll department? Should I ignore my dad or say I'm not interested? I don't even know what's fair/moral. I'm an adult now so I guest the caned response is ""you're on you're own"" but I did find my parents seldom helped me (for example everyone beneath 30 I know had some help from their parents paying for school. Point is it's common in my area to get financial assistance from parents after 18).</p>

<p>My mom once helped me pay rent and latter said it was a gift and I didn't need to pay her back. So there's that. </p>

"What are healthy ways to help my 7-year-old in developing a thicker skin?","<p>I have an amazing 7-year-old daughter who is unbelievably empathetic.  Which, allows her to be a good friend, wonderful daughter and just a loving soul all around.  However, her emotions can also be very intense and along with the empathy a high level of sensitivity.  Really she isn't unlike me to be honest.  </p>

<p>To demonstrate her sympathy level, I'll reference reading <em>The Hobbit</em> together.  As a family we read the story in the last few months.  When Gollum loses his ring, Tolkien does a good job of making Gollum pathetic and sad and the reader is meant to feel for him a little, but he <strong>is</strong> also the bad guy.  My daughter burst into tears.  Why can't Golum and Bilbo both have the magic ring mom?  I know Golum is creepy but that doesn't mean he should have to be so sad!  A few minutes later she had taken a deep breath and was talking about how ""every good story has to have its story bumps, I know and I know it isn't real, but it is still so sad.""</p>

<p>I have always felt that just as every rose has its thorn and every cowboy sings a sad, sad song, (sorry, song reference - had to do it)  but seriously, <strong>every gift brings its curse</strong>.  Where the challenge lies for my little one, is helping her keep it all in balance.</p>

<p>She is an excellent reader, (A few months ago, she was tested again and has a 12th grade vocabulary, 8th grade comprehension, and spells like the second grade kid she is).  So, choosing literature for her school lessons is a challenge because she isn't emotionally ready for most of the stuff written at a level that would challenge her.  </p>

<p>She gets on really well with other kids of all ages including her own, but becomes sincerely hurt at the slightest hint another child doesn't like her.  To make matters worse, this last summer, three of my daughter's best friends all moved away and for completely separate reasons we had already changed school programs before we knew this was going to happen (she is partially home-schooled, but we have a coop and she goes to regular classes once/week as well).  She is needing to make an entirely new batch of friends at school, her best friend (and only girl her age) in Taekwondo classes is one of the three that moved, and she was moved into a higher belt class as well, and the theater (another social out-let for her) is not currently doing any plays that have parts available for her age.  She still has one or two great friends from the former school program we have set play dates with and she is doing well with meeting and making new friends at the new school too, but every little slight by any of the kids at the school sends her to tears (sometimes I think they are only perceived slights too).  I think the loss of her friends is making her even more sensitive than she already was.</p>

<p>How do I help her develp that thicker skin and just appreciate the friends she has made, move on and let it go?</p>

"How can I handle a situation with a faulty, cruel teacher that does not like me and takes it out on my child?","<p>Let me start by offering to explain my situation. It is a lot more challenging to handle than the title presents, so I should definitely elaborate, then I'll ask my question. </p>

<p>My child is in 1st grade, has always been a well-behaved student and works hard with me on his work. However, he has a speech issue that gives him trouble with articulation and it has slightly slowed his progress with learning to read, but with my help, I am keeping him at a satisfactory level.</p>

<p>His teacher shows clear signs of not liking me, and I would not care if it were not for the fact that she for some reason takes it out on my child. She does not allow him to play with other kids, misleads him in ways which cause him to come home to me crying and in distress. Rather than bringing up questions with me, she asks him, stating it in such a way that makes him think she does not like him or that he has done something wrong (ie. usually pertaining to an absence, tardy, or permission form of some sort). She forces my child to participate in activities that require a permission form that I did not approve. </p>

<p>His teacher also neglects to teach him properly. She does not work independently with him on things that she'll work with other students on or answer his questions. She will skip over him instead. I can correct him and teach him a concept at home properly, he will go to school, and have unlearned the entire thing, or be confused. In addition, his handwriting on in-school assignments is messy and rushed, he often tells me the teacher tells him he has to hurry or that other students are bothering him while his handwriting at home is very very neat and legible. </p>

<p>He (my child) has lost interest and confidence even though he loves school, and has told me he would would rather not go to school and learn at home.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, things were fine and his work and grades were good but the teacher has been excessively cruel and degrading towards him. She is taking extreme amounts of points off on simple classwork assignments, way more than necessary, just to fail him. I have a child in AP classes in high school whose teachers do not take 13 points off per question no matter how hard the assignment.</p>

<p>If you wonder where this sudden change in behavior from his teacher might stem from, I believe it is all related to his speech issues. In this district, in order to get a speech class for your child, your child must be registered within the Special Education program. I have had him in the Special Education program before, but they did not actually take him to speech and he did not receive assistance at all, so I took him out. But I believe her harsh grading, and lack of help for my child in class, as well as the cruel behavior might be to push me into putting him into Special Education because the district receives additional funding PER CHILD in Special Education. I sincerely hope this is not the situation, but I do believe it is possible. </p>

<p>I apologize in advance for all this writing but I am at a loss for what to do. Conferences with the teacher are difficult, she will not allow me for a ""walk-in conference,"" becomes irate over the phone, and attempts to talk over me and become irate.
Going to the principal has not proved successful, and I'm not sure about approaching the district just yet. </p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there ANY alternative for schooling for my child for the remaining 2-3 months of school?</li>
<li>How should I deal with this situation, in general? Should I try again with the principal, go to the district or should I seek higher (I am in the United States)? </li>
<li>How can I help my child? He has no friends in school, and is very upset because of the conditions he must deal with in school. </li>
</ol>

"How to continue with removing breastfeeding at night","<p>Our daughter is just two and a bit. My wife still breastfeeds a lot. Our nights aren't particularly great. </p>

<p>Our arrangement was that usually I sleep in one room and my wife and daughter in the other so that I can get up early after a good night's sleep to do the morning chores and take our daughter to nursery while my wife catches up on sleep.</p>

<p>I take night duty, too. Both when my wife is here and, especially, when she is away on work. My experience is that the first two nights are difficult with the daughter waking up often, sometimes having one crying fit for about 20 minutes asking for mother, and after that she sleeps through from night 3 on. Once my wife is back on duty our daughter wakes 2 (rarely) to 10 (often) times a night to »drink« (it really is more like a cigarette butt hanging from her lips now when she breastfeeds).</p>

<p>Two nights ago we explained that in order to sleep through the night, which was desirable for everyone, she would have to learn to go back to sleep without the breast. We did an enactment with her and she did understand that her mother would hold her tight and cuddle if she woke up, but that the night needed to be over before she could drink again.</p>

<p>The first night went ok, she went back to sleep without breastfeeding once. When she woke up a second time, she cried and yelled until my wife gave in.</p>

<p>The second night she went back to sleep without breastfeeding a few times, but all before midnight. After midnight she woke and cried angrily for over an hour before my wife relented. </p>

<p>Now we are unsure how to continue.</p>

<ul>
<li>Letting her cry for so long does not feel right, but it may be necessary. Is it?</li>
<li>Should I take the next night? It seems that our daughter is afraid of losing her mother/her mother's love, so we are unsure whether this would be the right kind of signal</li>
<li>Should we regard this as a failed attempt and next time have me start with 4 to 7 nights in a row before my wife tries?</li>
<li>Should we try to end co-sleeping first?</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to get this through soon because the way the nights work at the moment is not sustainable for us (mostly for my wife). </p>

<p>On a different forum (German language) we found a question by someone in a similar situation, but the angry crying fits had already continued for 4 weeks. This would be even less sustainable for us. <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/12530/how-to-increase-the-durations-of-sleep-between-awakenings-at-night"">This question</a> and <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/471/how-do-you-ween-a-toddler-off-of-breastfeeding?rq=1"">this</a> as well as <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/2345/how-can-we-end-nighttime-comfort-nursing?rq=1"">that</a> address a similar matter but deal with much younger children.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> She slept with me ever since and her sleeping pattern is much better. She wakes twice a night at most, often only once and for a few times not at all. She uses her own bed now and it helps. When she wakes up, she still wants to be with me, but that is ok for now. The biggest progress I think is that on several occasions she managed going back to sleep on her own with me not being there (we both woke, I said I needed a drink of water and asked if it was ok for her to wait and when I came back she was sound asleep again). </p>

<p>Our idea now is to slowly phase in mother nights, first one, then two etc.  </p>

"Does too much or too little exposure to infection affect long-term immune health?","<p>Every time our children spend time with a group of other kids, there's at least one with the sniffles or worse. It's tempting to shield them from such sources of infection, but (leaving aside the non-medical downsides of isolation) presumably they'd grow up with weak immune systems if they didn't have this early exposure.</p>

<p>Does frequent exposure to sick kids, such as in daycare or public school, have a negative impact on a child's later immune health? Positive? What about very minimal exposure? Is there a happy medium to which we should strive?</p>

<p>I'm specifically interested in exposure to other children, not so much to environmental sources (i.e., eating dirt).</p>

<p>Here's an article saying that yes, some exposure to infection is probably helpful: <a href=""https://www.parentmap.com/article/is-getting-sick-good-for-preschoolers"">https://www.parentmap.com/article/is-getting-sick-good-for-preschoolers</a> It references a study, but does not link it, and my Google-fu fails me.</p>

<p>Another article, suggesting that there is such an effect but perhaps only for babies and toddlers: www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/12/06/daycare.kids/ Also, this simply claims that children will be more resistant in elementary school if they're exposed in daycare; I'm more interested in the kids' eventual health as adults.</p>

"5 month old won't fall asleep because she always turns herself onto her stomach","<p>This question is related to <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/3808/1922"">How do dealing with infant flipping over during sleep training?</a>, but not exactly the same.</p>

<p>Our 5 month old daughter flips onto her stomach constantly. When you put her down on the play blanket, she immediately flips onto her stomach AND props herself up with her arms. This is okay during awake times when she can play with toys, etc.</p>

<p>This becomes an issue when we try to put her down in her crib. She loves to flip over onto her stomach and pushing up with her arms. So, when she's in the crib, she's not even resting her head to try to sleep. (This is the part that differs from the above question). So, we can't put her down, unless she's already drowsy.</p>

<p>When we co-sleep with her at night (bring her into bed in the middle of the night when my wife nurses and when she's done, she stays with us) she sleeps between my wife and I. Her head level with our pillows. I would put her close to my stiff foam pillow so that it acts as a barrier for her so that she can't flip. :)</p>

<p>Is the only way to put a physical object next to her to block her from flipping? Even when she is partially swaddled (i.e. only legs are swaddled) she still can flip. She bring her legs up and swings to the right!</p>

<p><strong>CLARIFICATION</strong></p>

<p>The issue is not that she is <em>sleeping</em> on her stomach, it's that she is propping herself up when she's on her stomach and can't put herself to sleep in that position. When we put her on her back, she returns to the propped up stomach position.</p>

"As a teenager, how do I communicate with my mom about her yelling?","<p>I am 17. I have been learning to drive for about a year and a half now. I must have a permit if I want to drive, unless it has been a year or unless I'm 18. After that time I can get a license, but we are waiting on that because it is cheaper after I'm 18. This means I can only drive if I have someone 21 or older in the passenger seat, and no one unrelated in the back seats. </p>

<p>I'm adequate, except for parking and backing up. When I drive with my dad he gives me pointers and advice, which I appreciate. When I am driving with my mom <em>and</em> dad, my dad sits in the front seat and gives me pointers as usual. My mom is nearly silent in the backseat. When I drive with my mom she yells at me when I do not follow her instruction or know things already.</p>

<p>Every chance there is for my mom and I to go somewhere together (open a bank account for me, go to school) she insists I drive, which is fine. The problem is she will yell when I go too slow, or turn too sharply, or accidentally drive through an <em>empty</em> turn lane (if it wasn't empty I would have crashed the car). If we are in a parking lot she will give me directions on how to turn around, and if I decide to turn around a different way she yells.</p>

<p>My mom will give me a direction, like ""turn right here"" and I will decide I can't slow down fast enough, so I turn right at the next intersection, and she gets very angry. We live at the end of a dead-end road, and people constantly park their cars right behind our drive way, making it difficult to get out. When I try to get out, slowly, my mom will yell at me every time I start moving.</p>

<p>I have tried telling her multiple times that yelling doesn't help, and that telling me over and over how to do something will not make me better at it. 
I have told her many times I will not tolerate her yelling. Whenever we are driving in a parking lot or a neighborhood and she starts yelling at me I stop the car and get out. This is never effective because she is stubborn and I get impatient. At home I refuse to drive but to no avail.</p>

<p><strong>How do I explain that I can't focus on learning when she's yelling?
How do I explain knowing how to drive and actually having the experience driving are different?</strong></p>

"Kids (ages 4 and 6) only listen when raising my voice, tried everything, what am I doing wrong?","<p>I hate to raise my voice, but there are certain situations where no matter how or what I say, my kids won't listen. I'm not talking about hearing what I say and deciding not to do it, they simply either willingly or non willingly ignore my voice as if I was talking to a wall. (boy almost 6, girl almost 4)</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with ADD, and I can relate when people tell me - you don't hear me? I was talking to you and you didn't hear a word I was saying (I was doing something in hyper focus, and literally didn't hear a word)</p>

<p>Is that what happens here with my kids too?</p>

<p>Here are a few situation where I can say something a million times in pleasant tones and will get complete ignoring from their side </p>

<ol>
<li><p>They are in the bath playing, I'm asking them to get out / wash their head etc.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the worst - the TV is on. Can't get ANYTHING out of them, it's like there are in a different universe. I can tell them that Santa is here and brought them all their wishlist and they will not even turn their eyes. They literally don't hear anything when the TV is on. </p></li>
<li><p>My son is drawing something / playing the Legos </p></li>
</ol>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>Now, I know they say ""don't yell, don't shout, they won't listen, it just making it worse, don't be emotional and take out your frustration with life on the kids"" </p>

<p>But I'm not doing it emotionally, it's done practically and without anger, without any frustration, just because the kids simply don't respond otherwise in these situation. </p>

<p>Is this ADD in play? I was like this as kid (And still sometimes, people can call me and I simply don't hear it if I'm hyper focused)</p>

<p>Or is this just normal kids behavior? </p>

<p>The doctor said that the kids are just fine, and they are doing very well in pre-K and kindergarten, (one teacher said something about my son regarding focus, but new school - new teacher - no problem, just at home)</p>

<p>So here is my question. If the only way I can get my kids to listen is either raise my voice, or do the ""one, two, three"" count (works every time) is that still wrong? I feel really bad with myself but otherwise my life will be just talking to myself, very nicely and respectfully and kids who don't take bath's / stay in it till midnight, eat only candy and never go to bed. </p>

<p>What should I do? I love my kids, I tell them that all the time, I hug them, I read them stories, I spend time with them and they show me a lot of love back. But there are times where the only way to get things around here is to just raise my voice. Not even yell, it's just increasing the volume so they will turn their heads to listen, not even the case of whether they want to do it or not, it's the mere event of them getting my words into their awareness, after that getting them to ""listen"" is even less hard to get them to just ""hear me"".</p>

<p>How do I get them to listen without raising my voice? Should I start wearing funny customs just to get their attention? should I use a funny voice? Should I use a clowns horn / stuffed animal? I'm open to ideas, but nothing worked until now... </p>

<p>(p.s. when shouting at them, they don't get scared or insulted or anything, they don't cry or stop running around the house at 9pm, or jumping on the bed, they just go like ""oh, dad, you were talking? sorry, what did you say? we were busy doing something much more important like jumping like monkeys on the bed while your were whispering something about going to sleep"" )</p>

<p>Is there a solution?</p>

Also available <a href=""http://www.bastaitalia.org/how-to-raise-polyglot-children-with-no-effort/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

  <p>After just one year of age, “E”, began to communicate with her father in Venetian and in Armenian language with his mother. The evening after supper, every single day, “E” has to see a cartoon or a movie for kids in FRENCH language for about an hour.

He's still not learned to go to the bathroom at night, he wets his bed instead and prefers to eat with his hands... </p>

<p>We haven't yet taken him to doctors because it's a scary thought that if he's diagnosed with autism, how will it affect everything? His future? Our life?</p>

"4.5 yr old not making friends","<p>A brief background. The kid in question is a bit naturally reserved. She has few friends. Her best friend moved to a different country recently. She now has one friend with whom she plays in park. And plays with no one else. Now things have come to such a pass that she sits in park and keeps waiting till her friend comes. Surrounded by kids who are playing. No matter how much parents coax, she does not play with anyone else. </p>

<p>It is becoming a bit of a bother since many times the friend does not turn up. Parents have not given up. They want to keep her around kids so that her social skills improve. But standing around with the kid sitting and doing nothing sometimes gets on the their nerves.</p>

<p>How to get the kid out of this rut? When she will be comfortable making new friends?</p>

"What to do when we are concerned about the sexualisation of our 20-month-old son?","<p>My baby is 20 months old.  He cannot talk that well, mostly only saying a few words clearly or baby speak.   He goes to nursery twice a week, for the rest of the time he is at home with his mother.  </p>

<p>We had some mild concern about him trying to kiss us on the lips - open mouthed, we don't do this with him, we kiss him on the head, or peck him on the check.  We mentioned this to his nursery caregiver, she advised it was pretty normal and I wasn't too concerned.  I'm providing this information for context.</p>

<p>Today, my wife called as we had a weird incident at home, he was laying in our bed in front of her, and he reached for her hand.  She thought initially that he just wanted a cuddle, but he pulled her hand towards his crotch.  She thought maybe he wanted to go to the toilet (we really want him to start vocalising about toilet needs more so we can start toilet training and getting him to use a potty) but instead he wanted her to rub him on the crotch (through his nappy) - she pulled away and said it was inappropriate but he pulled her hand back, she realised as well while hes doing this that he had a baby erection. </p>

<p>We are used to when changing him for him to grab himself down there a bit (but not excessively) which I always viewed as self exploration but this seemed different to her and has caused us both concern.</p>

<p>We know that we have no real evidence of anything, if we suggested anything to the nursery they would not admit anything and would probably be more concerned about covering themselves.  It's so incredibly frustrating when a child is not at a verbal stage to be able to tell you anything themselves and am at bit of a loss as to how to proceed.</p>

<p>I know babies/young children can play with themselves out of boredom or exploration - but my wife feels someone must have taught him this. We could take him out of nursery and try somewhere else, but it's concerning and we have no evidence/proof of anything bad, just a potential suspicion.</p>

<p><strong>Is this behavior normal? What should we/can we do? Has anyone had to deal with a situation like this?</strong></p>

"Why is it so hard teaching your own children and how to improve the process?","<p>I have two children, 6 and 9 years old. I find it very hard to teach them skills or school subjects and I wonder if there are any tricks or methods to it? It seems my children are much more eager to learn if it's an outsider teaching them.</p>

<p>When I or my wife try to teach them skills we are actually good at (I'm a ski instructor, my wife has many years of music school behind her) it invariably ends in the child giving up way too easily. When they <em>have</em> to learn something, like a new song for a performance, they work hard at the music school and they usually give their best at the actual performance, yet at home when we help it often ends up with arguments, sometimes bitter ones. </p>

<p>This dynamic is more pronounced with the older son, but is visible in both children to some extent. Now it's possible me and my wife are just bad teachers, but many of my friends say they noticed the same thing with their children. </p>

<p>I've started thinking that maybe it's hard for them to accept criticism and straight talk from somebody who is otherwise usually their emotional rock, quick to dismiss ""unpleasant"" things or turn them into a joke - which doesn't work when you have to understand a theorem, master a technique or learn the notes by heart.</p>

<p>Does anybody notice the same thing with their children? And is there a way to make this easier? </p>

"What can be done to encourage grandparents to be equitable between siblings?","<p>The short question is this. How can we as parents encourage our parents to be more equitable in their treatment of their grandchildren?</p>

<p>As background here is my situation. When my wife and I got married, we had made the decision that we weren't going to have children. This was devastating to my mother who really (read really really really) wanted to have grandchildren. Independent of her wished, a few years later we decided to try and our first son came along who is now 7. Grandma immediately bonded with him, showering him with love and attention (and stuff). Four years later our second boy came along (now 2 1/2 y.o.) and while grandma loves him, she is still very bonded to our oldest.</p>

<p>Up until now, it hasn't been a big deal because the baby hasn't had the mental maturity to understand the differences in their relationships but his behavior of late has indicated that he is starting to notice something... or at least wanting more.</p>

<p>An example would be something like recently we had made arrangements for grandma to spend the afternoon/evening with the toddler and then when they came back she was going to take the older one home for a sleep over. On the day of, she decided that she would take both boys for the afternoon and then keep the oldest one for sleep over. Ostensibly she says it's to give my wife and I some time alone, but my observation is that she often includes the older one in the time planned with the younger, but rarely (if ever I can think) alters plans with the older one to include the younger.</p>

<p>So what can I do to encourage her to spend time and develop a relationship with my younger son?</p>

<p>Should I point out what I observe or how I interpret her interactions? </p>

<p>Am I making too much out of nothing? Do I need to get over it?</p>

"Fear developing in three year old","<p>I have a three and a half year old boy. We have been going to this theme park for years, he has gone on all of the rides which are age appropriate since a little more than one without any sign of fear. Today he has been completely different. He won't do anything, he breaks down into uncontrollable screaming when we get close. He won't even walk by the adult rides, he says they are ""too scary"". He doesn't want to watch the Sesame Street characters. Is this the normal way fear develops in children, or is it possibly a sensory issue? (There were children yelling excitedly, maybe too much stimulation?)</p>

<p>And, what should I do or not do?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>We were able to distract him in line by keeping him busy, and he went on some of the ride he was on last year. Afterwards we asked him if they were scary and he said ""no"". We didn't push the issue with the rides he has never been on before, because we didn't know how he would react. When approaching the adult ride (one in particular) we would wait till it stopped before walking past. On many occasions he asked for his headphones (which we provided). It was a jarring experience for us because his reaction was so different to when he was younger, in fact he has done the same things at a younger age with absolutely no sign of fear, and we were scared of pushing him too hard and introducing significant stress. </p>

"Should we always ask to have urine tested when we go to urgent care?","<p>Went to the urgent care the other day because of a high temp over a few days, lots of fussiness, lack of eating and when she does eat she would vomit. They did all the normal things like checking weight, temp, looking in ears and throat. The conclusion was ""take fever reducers and here is a prescription for medicine to help with nausea"". </p>

<p>My wife asked about any infections, specifically, UTI's, because she was playing in sand in Florida for the past few days. The doctor said they don't like to do the urine test, because, well, it means a catheter to get the urine and they only do it if there was a past UTI.</p>

<p>Long story short we opted for the urine test and she did have an infection and it was probably the cause for the fever. And it's only by luck that we know.

"Does separating necessarily cause damage?","<p>Me and my (ex)girlfriend have a 3 years old child.
He is an accidental child from a one night stand (where I was completely drunk and she was sober), but I didn't want to leave them alone, so I gave up my former life (I was living in a different country with a life set) and moved up together with them. We were living together for a year and a half.</p>

<p>BUT things are just didn't work out well between my GF and me. We had some arguments and different standards (in parenting and other things as well). Basically she is kind and wants good for our son, but on a different way than me, hence we couldn't get along.</p>

<p>Beside this, she thinks everything is my fault in our relationship, she did only one thing wrong, let me into her life...</p>

<p>So, long story for short, we separated  in peace, we didn't want these arguments evolving to fight and shouting and stuff and thought better if a child has two separated, balanced parents instead of together, but hate each other.</p>

<p>We have not experienced any changed in our son's behavior. He still likes singing, active, playing on the playground and kindergarten as before. Still curious about everything just as before. He really likes me and the mother also. No anger or blaming in him at all.</p>

<p>Obviously, he has questions: ""When will we sleep together again (three of us)"" or ""Where are you living now, dad?"" or ""What home are we going to go now?"" or ""Do I still have my room?"" ""Why mom is not here?"".
We are trying to give him clear and ""process-able"" answer, but obviously he can not get the truth, but we are not lying at all.</p>

<p>I'm trying to spend as much time with him as I can (every other weekend and trying to get 1-2 days during the week), but basically he lives with his mother.
(on top of this we often skyping, even though we are in the same city, but sometimes he just wants to talk with me, specially before going to sleep)</p>

<p>Does a child necessarily needs to be hurt or has to have a sign because of the separation? Is it not strange that he has not, beside those question?
Any idea how to maintain this situation and keep this up in him?
Or  what do you think of this situation at all?</p>
"
"Kids in multicultural, multi-generational household","<p>My wife is Chinese and I am an American guy. We live in the US and have a 4.5 y/o and 18 m/o. My wife's parents, in very traditional Chinese fashion (I guess it's common among many Asian cultures), come every 6 months for a 6-month period (i.e. 6 on, 6 off) to help us cook, clean, raise the children, yell at and complain incessantly about all of us and tell my wife and I specifically what good-for-nothing, incompetent, ungrateful, scum-of-the-earth people we are. And that's just in a morning.</p>

<p>My question comes down to, what will the children's development be like in this situation? Specifically, if anyone has any experience w/ this kind of thing, I'd like to know how your kids turned out; particularly in terms of emotional adjustment, anxiety, patience, etc. I have met few people living regularly in this kind of multi-generational household and fewer still with a multicultural and multi-generational household.</p>

<p>My in-laws are very nice in their thought to come over and never let us lift a finger to do any housework ever again for the remainder of their lives. However, I do worry about the anxiety and stress this places on my children (not to mention the in-laws). To give some perspective, my in-laws grew up in Maoist Beijing. What we in the US would consider less than trivial (e.g. using a paper towel to wipe up a spill), can be a major transgression in their eyes. Obviously, when you've got 2 young boys tearing through the house, breaking things to watch them break, throwing food -- in other words, being kids -- this creates a lot of tension. In addition, my wife and I frequently clash with what we see as my in-laws' overbearing behavior. Over things like career, money, raising our children and just generally what godless sacks of Satanshit my wife and I are. So those are the cons...</p>

<p>The pros that I see: my kids are really bilingual. My Mandarin isn't great and so my wife and I communicate in English. When the in laws are away, I can tell my kid's Chinese deteriorates. Dinner is on the table every night at 6pm (convenient for us but I think more importantly for the kids). Thanks to the Chinese belief that a child without a mouth stuffed with food is a child on the verge of starvation, my younger one has really thrived (whereas before he was underweight). Free childcare is also a bonus and they do provide better care for a young child than any nanny or childcare center. But I also have been trying to think about this more long-term as well. My in laws expect to be taken care of when they're old and my wife has pretty much committed to that. Although I don't know what that means for me (I'll probably be participating in that somehow), I do think it's good for kids to see multiple generations taking care of one another; in fact, that's one of the major criticisms I have of US culture, which I see as a general disregard for the well-being of families and caring for our vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>So anyone with experience in this kind of situation, your advice and feedback are much appreciated. As my post denotes, my wife and I clearly have our own issues with her parents. I'd wager Those who have lived in this kind of culture (natively or otherwise) would agree with me that asking my in-laws to ""compromise"" -- at least in the US/Western context -- is not going to happen. Given that our situation will probably continue into the foreseeable future, should I just try to shield my kids from some of the craziness? I do try to counterbalance our incompatibility by being a (relatively) calm(er) but firm force in the house, in a meager attempt to arbitrate some peace and sanity.</p>

<p>NOTE: I do make some generalizations about cultures here and I don't mean to offend anyone. I realize that I'm coming at this from my own cultural perspective and I carry my own biases. And yes, I know ""they're like that because they love you so try to understand blah blah blah"". I'm also aware that we can tell them not to come back; but that is not something my wife, and to a lesser extent I, want. My question, very specifically, is what are children's developmental outcomes when raised in this kind of environment and what can I/we do to optimize our situation.</p>

"Trouble with parent who pushes the envelope in every argument","<p>I Live with my father during the summer, and I do my best to make sure that I leave the smallest footprint possible. Doing my own laundry, dishes, food, etc. I think I do a good job.</p>

<p>My father and I will argue about things, and when I try and end the argument, he just keeps egging it on, and then later he complains that it's a shame that we have to argue ""like this"". To me, he's being a drama queen.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Father</strong>: [<strong>tuskiomi</strong>], Do the dishes.<br>
  <strong>Me</strong>: Aww, I didn't make dirty any of them, though.<br>
  <strong>Father</strong> (very simplified and shortened)<strong>:</strong> Everyone has to help out and do chores.<br>
  <strong>Me</strong> (realising that I've dug myself a hole) <strong>:</strong> Okay, fine I'll do them.<br>
  <strong>Father</strong>: [<strong>tuskiomi</strong>], why do you always complain about things?<br>
  <strong>Me</strong>: I'm not complaining; I'm doing the dishes.<br>
  <strong>Father</strong>: I don't hear anyone else giving me any lip. It's just a part of living here..<br>
  <strong>Me</strong>: I'm doing the dishes. you can stop lecturing me.<br>
  <strong>Father</strong>: (more lecturing about how it's simply expected of me to do chores)<br>
  [some hour or two later]<br>
  <strong>Father</strong>: You know, I don't like arguing with you..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have anything against chores, and I do every one that my father asks me to. I don't egg the conversation on, and I admit, I do complain, but I'm not the only one, and It's more of a vent than objection. I've told him that I'm going to do what I ask him, and that he shouldn't take the complaining personally. He took that personally as well.</p>

<p>Now, I'm willing to change, and I'm willing to lay terms with my father. Open to the both. </p>

<p>Other example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TB: Hey TG, are you ok?</p>
  
  <p>TG will not answer because she pouts due to sensitiveness over different topics</p>

<p>My aim is to get minimal peace of mind when I'm arriving at home, but if I want that minimal peace of mind, I have to intervene (or I think I do). One of my belief is I should intervene only if their behaviour are going out of hands and that they should find a way to deal with their issues or simply to be able to behave properly, despite the tiredness/emotional upheaval.</p>

<p>I'm bit at loss between strict authoritarian rule and too much laissez faire. I know the limit is between the two but I could not find my balance yet. I know that their mum should be doing the discpline but she has more of a friend's attitude toward them and sometimes just sometimes, she has a all or nothing attitude, yell or unconditional love.</p>

<p>I'm also a bit at loss because, well , it is a teenage boy and also a teenage girl</p>

<p>Most likely, my question will be very much opinion based but to be honest, your insights are more than welcome as I'm learning parenthood and hopefully, becoming a decent one.</p>

"How can I help my preschooler develop empathy?","<p>My 3.5-year-old preschooler is pretty book-smart, but is quite emotionally immature for his age.  This has led to a frequent, difficult situation for us.</p>

<p>He'll be acting out a bit - say, not wanting to get out of his carseat at preschool.  Mommy will start to pick him up, and in the process, hit her head on the car a bit, saying 'Ow' and clearly being a bit hurt.  Or, he'll be having a hard time going to bed, and hit or bite Mommy, and she'll again be hurt and express that.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to laugh, quite a bit.  This is pretty frustrating, if you've just hurt yourself because he was acting out, or been hurt <em>by</em> him, and then the reaction is laughter.  </p>

<p>Dealing with this on our side we largely understand; it's hard to actually <em>do</em>, mind you, but we know what we need to do.  Take a time out, go somewhere else, have the other parent take over, whatever to get us out of the situation so we don't get any more angry.</p>

<p>But, how do we help him deal with this?  We've tried explaining to him that he's hurt us or we're hurt, and talking about how he'd feel.  When he's entirely calm he understands this.  But it clearly doesn't carry through when he's not entirely calm - even when he's mostly calm, just acting like a normal three year old.</p>

<p>The only thing that seems to work (to get him to stop laughing and understand it's serious) is yelling at him, which isn't what we want to do (and not something we do on purpose - just when we lose control).  Then, he cries and is quite shocked (presumably as we very rarely yell), and apologizes; so he clearly knows what's going on, but we can't find a better way to get through.</p>

<p>What is the expectation of a 3-4 year old in terms of empathy, here?  Is it unfair for us to expect him to show empathy when he's not 100% calm?  <a href=""http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/topics/getalong/getalong01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This page</a> seems to suggest at 2-3 they should understand happy/sad, and certainly at times he does, but at more important times he doesn't seem to.</p>

"What are the stages of child speech and language development?","<p>What are the distinct stages or landmarks or milestones in speech in language development, in the order they're <em>typically</em> reached, and why is it that order?</p>

<p>For instance, I know that certain types of phonemes are learned at different times. Vowels are usually learned early, and different types of consonants are learned later.</p>

<p>As well as phonetic mastery, there is also grammatical mastery. An example is expressed in: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/11559/i-am-vs-my-is-when-do-children-develop-this-bit-of-language"">I am vs my is - when do children develop this bit of language?</a> </p>

<p>I'm asking primarily about English pronunciation and grammar.</p>

<p>Please feel comfortable using technical terms, such as those found in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Articulatory Phonetics</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occlusive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Occlusives</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manner_of_articulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Manners of Articulation</a> and linguistic/grammatical terminology. I have access to resources about these areas of interest.</p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in the <em>why</em> of these developmental stages. Phoneme acquisition charts are easily found, but they don't discuss why certain phonemes are learned before others. A list of sounds/grammar rules and comparative ages isn't as useful to me as understanding the physiological or cognitive underpinnings of those milestones.</p>

<p>Age range can be assumed to be from start of speech until ""mastery"" of all landmarks. I'm not just interested in a single age, but the full breadth of development. (Unfortunately, I have to be this broad. Since I don't <em>know</em> the individual stages, I can't right now ask about them individually).</p>

<p>If necessary, I can separate phonemes from grammar for two separate questions.</p>

"Daughter and school dress code","<p>I have a daughter who will be starting high school next year. Because the public schools in our area are <em>terrible</em>, and because I want to try to get her to become an engineer (I'm a civil engineer/architect), I'm enrolling her in a private school for the coming school year. All of our family loves it and we feel that it's the perfect choice (she got a good scholarship, which helps too). The only thing that concerns me is the dress code.</p>

<p>This is a rather ""preppy"" school, and while there isn't a uniform, there is a strict dress code (for example, boys wear dress or chino pants and a collared, button-up shirt). What concerns me is that this dress code <em>requires</em> that girls wear a skirt, skorts, or something similar, along with a collared top or a modest sweater. Here's the relevant lines from the dress code passage that they sent us as part of admission materials:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Appropriate bottoms include skirts, skorts and collared dresses, all of knee length and worn at the waist line (jeans are appropriate only on approved ""out of dress code"" days)</p></li>
  <li><p>Tops are to be collared casual or dress shirts including polo shirts, blouses and turtlenecks. Shirts which are made to be tucked in shall be worn tucked in.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>My concern is that my daughter is 14, and having her wear a skirt every day to class makes me a little nervous, especially because it's a co-ed school and there are bound to be boys there with sex on the mind, and I don't want my daughter to be the target. What can I do to be sure that she is prepared? I know that every girl will be dressed similarly to how she will be dressed (<em>any</em> knee-length skirt and <em>any</em> blouse is okay, within limits; it is not a uniform), and the boys will be dressed nicely as well, but this does concern me.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I have no objections with a skirt being a part of the dress code; after all, one of the points of a dress code is to teach students how to dress in a professional environment. I just want to make sure that my daughter will be okay and will be able to meet the dress code while at the same time not being made a target by overzealous boys.</p>

<p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

"What do we do when timeouts are not effective?","<p>We have a three year old toddler, and he has just seemed to realize that timeouts are nothing more than him sitting in a corner for a few minutes.  He has recently started doing a whole suite of bad actions (throwing things at people, hitting people, etc), and when caught, gets an impish grin because he believes that all that will happen to him is a timeout.</p>

<p>How do I make these things stick?  Or, if there is a point where they don't, what's the escalation move?  I'd rather not go towards spanking (pretty sure that will just let him think that hitting people is ok rather than a bad thing).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks for all the replies.  I can see responses vary wildly depending on parenting style, so we'll be looking into these things.  I can't give a check until I see which one works for my son, and even then, it'll just be for my son and another child may respond differently.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> We've tried a number of things from these suggestions, but so far, the idea with the most effect appears to be a) find a particular, specific spot for timeouts (in this case, standing on a subwoofer facing the corner) and b) fighting the battles to stay in timeout until he stays in timeout.  He still does naughty things, mostly in an effort to get our attention when we're really too exhausted to play with him at the end of the day, but he understands that he will get the timeout and he doesn't fight it.  Instead, he seems to be getting the 'mommy and daddy are worn out, I'll just color by myself' idea pretty nicely.</p>

<p>We tried the charts with stickers idea, but that didn't work as we found ourselves not being consistent.  Without our own consistency, he just ignored the chart too.  We found that to be the case with most ideas, that our own inconsistencies leads to an idea not working.  It's only by paying attention to everything that we noticed it.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone!</p>

"Boy defending himself from sister, or fight back?","<p>I've read <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/24008/how-should-my-8-year-old-son-deal-with-a-girl-who-hits-him"">this question</a>, but I don't think that is the solution for my situation.</p>

<p>My son is 6 years old, and has a 5 year old step sister. The sister is able to get under his skin very quickly - either being annoying, hitting him, or screaming/singing random sounds. My son has learned from a very young age to just walk away if asking the person to stop does not fix it.</p>

<p>This all sounds good in theory, right?</p>

<p>My issue is, she will follow him, and eventually an argument breaks out, and my son starts crying because his mom (who lives in a different household than I do) told him ""Boys are stronger, girls are smarter. You can't hit girls back"". He simply doesn't know what to do, so looked to me for advice.</p>

<p>The advice I gave him was, ""You know you are stronger than . You know you have more maturity and intelligence than she does. If asking her to stop, and walking away are not working, and she hits you, you can hit her back. You cannot hit her harder than she hits you, and you cannot load up and keep hitting her over and over.""</p>

<p>My thought process was ""If a girl is going to be a bully, why does it matter that she's a girl"". I've seen my son, time and time again, walk away or ask her (or others) to stop doing whatever it was that was bugging him. I've also seen where he gets egged on, and it frustrates me as the parent as well.</p>

<p>I explained this to my partner in private, and she said it was the wrong lesson to teach. I asked what should happen then when he tries the other methods and they fail - neither of us could come up with anything better.</p>

<p>I want my son to be able to stand up for himself, and not fear being in a different room than I am since he ""shouldn't hit girls"". He is a confident boy, and is very polite, even to his step sister.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>am I right in how he should defend himself after exhausting non-physical responses</strong>? If not, <strong>what would be a better way of dealing with this situation in the future?</strong></p>

"What's the motivation behind school uniforms {or} Why can't my daughter wear a dang princess on her shirt?","<p>I just registered our daughter for Kindergarten at a school that has amazing ratings online - Great Schools ranks it at a 10/10 (for whatever that's actually worth, I'm not really sure). So I'm super excited that she'll apparently be in an excellent learning environment.</p>

<p>My concern is the dress code. Details aren't necessary but suffice it to say it's entirely boring (limited solid color, no-design polos, etc.). I value education, but I also equally value individuality.</p>

<p>Can someone help me understand the benefits of discouraging 5-year-olds from wearing their favorite princess or super hero shirts at school? I'm aware of what's <em>attempted</em> to be achieved (distracting from competing in dress, focusing on academics, etc.), but are there any real data to support the claim that such policies actually produce the expected benefits?

"My newborn won't sleep","<p>Yet another sleep-related question. </p>

<p>My baby is five weeks old. He sleeps like a champ at night - he'll go down around 10 or 11 pm, wake up for a feeding or two (and sometimes we even have to wake him), and will usually be up again around 6 or 7 am. Recently we've had success in putting him back to bed if he gets his last feed no later than by 6 am (starting time), and then he'll sleep until around 8 am or 8:30. We'll either put him down awake or drowsy or asleep, depending on the state he's in - it doesn't seem to matter too much.</p>

<p>Napping during day, however, is a complete other business. Starting in his second week, he'd simply refuse to go to sleep. If we attempt to put him to bed, he'll cry hysterically until we take him out of bed again; shushing and rocking and what have you not won't help. He will (mostly) sleep when carried around in a baby carrier or in his pram. This means that he'll get about 8-12 hours of sleep per day at most. </p>

<p>I would expect him to be overtired; but actually, he seems quite happy to be awake, and he's not fussy or cranky unless we attempt to put him to bed. He also has no problem at all staying awake for long stretches of time like an eight hour stretch. I've tried swaddling, to no avail (he enjoys sleeping with his arms above his shoulders, so I can see why would hate swaddling); I've asked the local children's services, who basically responded by saying 'well, if he's thriving and seems to be happy, then there's no reason to worry' - but I can't imagine that sleeping this little is healthy for him, and I also worry what this means for his future sleeping habits (and honestly, I could use a break as well).</p>

<p>We fed him on demand within 3 - 4 hours until last week; we then decided to introduce a fixed three hour schedule. We noticed that after three hours he isn't really hungry enough, so we just started stretching that to a four hour schedule. He seems to do fine health-wise - he was born with 3 kg, and gained 1.2 kg within four weeks.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Anything that I'm missing?</p>

"How much of my prior drug use should I disclose to my tween daughter?","<p>My daughter started middle school this year (she is 11) and tonight at dinner she told me that during an assembly some teachers had shared tragic stories about friends and family members who abused drugs and/or alcohol. One story involved a teen who drank until he passed out and then died from choking on his own vomit.  </p>

<p>Our conversation evolved into us talking about the kinds of situations she might be exposed to as she is getting older and how she might act in those situations. We talked about what she could do if she was at a party where kids were drinking and/or passing out. I wanted to emphasize ways that she can stay safe, help her friends stay safe and most importantly that she can always call her parents if she's in a dicey situation and needs help. </p>

<p>She assured me there was nothing to worry about because she would never drink or touch drugs. I told her I think it's great that she feels that way now, but that should things change I would rather have her talk to me about it than feel that she can't because she once promised she would never do those things. </p>

<p>At the end of our talk, she asked me if I drank alcohol in high school and if I smoked pot before I was 18 (where we live recreational cannabis is legal for 21 &amp; up). I told her that I did experiment a bit and gave her some context around that and told her I wished I had waited until I was older. She seemed satisfied with that for now, but I know these questions will come up again. </p>

<p>My early teen years were traumatic and I was rebellious and self-destructive. My later teen years and 20's were pretty colorful as well. How do I balance honesty and open communication with keeping communications age-appropriate and constructive? Do I just edit out large parts of my life experience? </p>

"Threat of internet predators -- how significant is it?","<p>There is a lot of talk about securing your children's access to electronic devices, the web, etc. There are lots of scary stories about terrible things happening, no doubt many terrible things have happened.</p>

<p>However, what I have not been able to find is any solid statistical data. Data showing for example a dramatic rise in non parent abduction or internet facilitated child molestation, or some of the other terrible things.</p>

<p>Is there data to support this? What is the realistic risk for kids from this? Is it different for different ages and sexes? How does it compare to the other risks and channels for children to be abused in this way?</p>

<p>I might be naive but it seems a seriously overblown threat compared to the many other dangers our children face. It strikes me as something that sells a lot of books and lectures and makes scary TV shows rather than actually being a significant threat to children. However, I would be happy to be disabused of my complacency by hard data.</p>

<p>Anybody know of source?</p>

<p>And of course, if it is just one child it is terrible -- but we as parents have to carefully marshal our resources to protect our children from the serious threats while allowing them the liberty to grow and thrive and take risks on their own. When I was a kid I had free reign on a computer and it allowed me huge vistas of intellectual growth and enjoyment. Of course things were different back then, but I want my kids to have as much of that same experience as it is safe for them to have.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of using dessert as a motivation for kids to work hard?","<p>We have a kindergartener whom we homeschool.
We also send our child for once-a-week violin lessons,
which requires us to practice with our child every day.</p>

<p>Most of the times, our child is motivated to work hard
at her writing, math, and violin practice.
At other times, our child just has a bad attitude
towards homeschool and violin practice.</p>

<p>We are thinking of making after-dinner dessert
conditional on good behavior during her ""work time"".
In our minds, dessert seems like a natural consequence of working hard.
After all, if our child were an adult, and did not work hard,
our child would only be able to afford basic food,
and not the very tasty desserts our child would want to buy.
FYI: Our dessert is generally healthy but is sweeter than other foods,
usually clementines, apples, frozen berries but sometimes ice cream.</p>

"Boy Crazy at Seven","<p>My seven year old daughter is fascinated with boys already and has 28 of them lined up to ""marry"" her.  She flirts like crazy and frankly, it is amazing to watch how she can get these boys to do just about anything she asks - and I don't think she even realizes how wrapped around her finger she has them.  I think the fact that they ""fall in line"" so easily makes her believe she can marry them if she wants that much more - maybe she will marry one of them one day (one never knows really), but for now, I wish she'd just give it a rest.</p>

<p>Just the other day she also told me, ""I think I've got boobs coming mom.  How long til I can actually get married?""  She doesn't really, but she is excited about the idea of it so believes it anyway.</p>

I've been staying with my wife in her family's home for couple of months. </p>

<p>My brother-in-law is under 18 years old, let's just call him ""Jimmy"". I've noticed my father-in-law is not strict at all with Jimmy. I've never heard him scolded Jimmy even though Jimmy stays out late and usually gets home at 11:00PM - 12:00AM. We don't have any idea where he stays during his late nights. Jimmy skips his classes without a reasonable excuse and I've never heard my father-in-law say anything to motivate Jimmy to attend classes even though Jimmy has a very poor academic history (it took him 10 years to complete his primary education, instead of the usual 6).</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed is that when Jimmy asks for something (buy a new phone or shoes) my father-in-law never says no. He also gives Jimmy soda daily, which is not really good for his health. It seems to me that he's spoiling Jimmy too much. I feel that there's supposed to be a reward system to motivate Jimmy to strive harder in school and teach him the value of education. I've never seen Jimmy working on homework assignments, thus I believe he is not serious in his studies though he just reached the secondary education this year.</p>

<p>I'm concerned about Jimmy. I have two younger brothers and we've grown up with our parents putting a strong emphasis on the importance of our education, which motivated us to study hard and do well academically.</p>

Sorry if I really missed one point. Yes, we do talk about it with my wife, of course I do open up to her, we've been in a relationship for 8 years before we get married. What I usually ask her ""Why your father is too kind? and explained what I noticed.."", and she will just respond ""because that's what my father is"", and if I talked about Jimmy to her. She would usually respond to me ""We (with my mother-in-law) already tried to correct Jimmy a lot of times, but it looks like that is what he is."". I really appreciate all the response. Though I might just pre-judge Jimmy's action that would affect his future (that is where my concern is). Glad I have not talk about it yet to my father-in-law,</p>

<p>I'm wondering what effect this will have on my son and <em>his</em> sleep quality, and how it may affect him during the day.</p>

<p>Some facts:</p>

<ul>
<li>We live in a very small apartment. The bedrooms share a wall. Noise travels easily: We can hear our son <em>breathing</em> when everyone is in bed.</li>
<li>The new baby will start off in our room, but may have to share a room with our other son once we switch from a bassinet to the crib, because we have no other free space.</li>
<li>Our son is 2, and will be about 27 months when his brother arrives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything that we can do to help make this transition easier on our son? It doesn't have to necessarily be <em>before</em> the baby arrives, so suggestions for what to do afterwards are acceptable.</p>

Where I live has no professional sitter services at all, you just have to find someone you personally trust.  I have recently started to interview some candidates for ""as needed"" babysitting (just the occasional evening/weekend).  I am not finding anyone I am <em>completely</em> happy with as so far none seem to have taken any actual health/safety training.  </p>

<p>I am trying to sort if it's reasonable to ask someone to take first aid and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CPR</a> training.  I am willing to pay for the training I want them to have, but I can admit I am a <em>little</em> concerned that I will pay and they would end up not finishing it/showing up and/or perhaps not babysit for me enough after to warrant the fees. If however it worked out and they were able to fill in here and there for a few years, I find it an absolutely worthwhile investment.  </p>

<p>Is this a weird thing for me to offer?  Might I scare someone off or can I suggest it without it being too odd?  Should I expect to also pay them for their time to attend the class if I offer this?  I really don't know what is typical as I haven't had to look for anyone before as I had people I knew who also were well qualified (like one was a registered nurse, so she obviously had plenty of training).</p>

<hr>

<p>I am sorry if this seems obvious to others, but I have some anxiety about how to ask and if this is overstepping.

I took that training prior to ever watching children, so I personally find it a necessary step and I have actually used my training while caring for kids.  </p>

"When do girls usually start shaving?","<p>Since my heritage includes a few of the more hairy ethnicities from Europe, my family is quite hairy and always has been, (you should see my hobbit feet in winter when I haven't shaved them for example - at least they aren't as bad as my father's but still. . . )</p>

<p>When I was young, I had hairy legs before my legs became truly hairy because of adolescence.  Early in fourth grade, a then-girlfriend of mine ""dumped me"" because I had hairy legs and wasn't shaving yet.</p>

<p>My daughter has my genes and though she, thankfully, has a lighter hair color than I, she too already has quite a bit of hair on her legs.  I don't plan on pointing it out or anything - I figure she'll let me know when she has noticed and wants to do something about it.  However, I was wondering approximately when I am likely to recieve this information/request from her, as most of the kids I have dealt with were students and I didn't pay much attention to whether their legs were shaved or not, or they were way too young.  Is there an average age young girls start this practice?  It does seem to me, it is fairly likely a lot of girls begin before sixth grade - am I correct on that count?</p>

"Is this bullying? Are we overreacting/under-reacting?","<p>My happy, positive, loving, open-minded, outgoing teenage daughter gets along with other people very easily. She's kind by nature and cares deeply about the feelings of others. She's mature for her age and doesn't usually experience drama with people, which is why I'm concerned about a recent situation.</p>

<p>Her best friends for many years is a boy who lives across the street. He always seemed like a very nice boy. Their friendship is strictly platonic.</p>

<p>My daughter dated a boy from school for a week or two, but broke up with him because his behavior seemed abusive (I agreed). She told her best friend because she was hoping for emotional support. He told her that it was impossible that her ex had been abusive, that he knew women who were really being abused and my daughter wasn't one of them. My daughter stopped talking to him. It took him a month to apologize. </p>

<p>Our family is spiritual, but not religious. My daughter reads sacred texts from every religion. She shared her excitement about new things she's been learning with her best friend and he told her that she couldn't possibly believe in the existence of God. He then told her if she talked about God or her beliefs that he'd give her the silent treatment. She stood up for herself. She told him that she felt it was arrogant of him to tell her what she did or didn't think, feel, or believe and even more so since he'd threatened to give her the silent treatment for talking about something that he'd never in the past had any problem with. She ignored him for about a month and he eventually apologized. </p>

<p>My daughter (almost 18) watched Game of Thrones, but she found the show too violent (it gave her nightmares.) She told her best friend this. He sent her taunting text messages and Game of Thrones-themed porn. She showed me the messages he sent her. I thought them creepy and disturbing.</p>

<p>My daughter wants to block his number, email address and social media profiles. I agree that she should do that. However, being that my daughter is a decent person, she at least wants to send him one last email stating that they've grown apart as friends rather than just severing all contact without saying something to him. His behavior has her feeling distressed and upset.</p>

<p>Does he even deserve an email from her saying that they've grown apart as friends before she blocks him? Should she block him, especially being that since this type of behavior began it hasn't stopped? What would have caused him to change so radically? Could he be mentally ill, a bully, a coward and insecure? Might he be drinking or using drugs? Should I speak with his parents since they live right across the street?</p>

<p>My daughter just informed me that her best friend recently told her that all of his ex-girlfriends ended up in therapy following dumping him, but he didn't elaborate. He might just be an abusive individual and it took a long time for the mask to come off.</p>

"How can I get others to respect our toy/parenting choices?","<p>Let me explain as this sounds weird. So my wife and I are foster parents, and one of the very few things you do differently for foster children than you do your bio-children is a kind of screening of their toys (and other things but lets focus on toys). </p>

<p>For example if you have a child in your care that is, due to abuse, sensitive to loud sounds, you avoid loud toys. If you have a child that is, due to past occurrences, prone to play with dolls in a sexual manner, you avoid dolls. Some of the things you ""filter out"" may seem odd from an outside perspective. </p>

<p>Another great example are toys that encourage expression, creativity, and interaction are favored over toys that are ""one player"" in many contexts as it gives foster parents a way to interact on their level. At the same time, toys that are for group play may not be the right choice for children that are currently having behavioral problems in groups. </p>

<p>Lastly, at least my wife and I take co-parenting very seriously, and use every opportunity to involve the bio-parents in the decision process. Sometimes, for one reason or another, they request we avoid certain toys. When it seems reasonable, we try very hard to comply. When it's not reasonable we try to be flexible and comply anyway, but the concept of reasonable is objective, and sometimes we're not able to. For example, we provide nook tables to kids of all ages. If the bio-parents don't like that (none have had an issue so far) then I don't know what we would do, as it's the primary way the children would read, watch ""TV"", and many other things.</p>

<p>At the same time if the bio parents recommend certain toys, as long as we feel they're safe, then we try to get them. This has never been a problem for us. No one has ever tried to recommend we get a 4 year old a chain saw. But it could be a problem, for example if a parent recommended the entire Disney VHS collection. First because we don't think kids should watch that much TV, second because we don't have a VCR (or anything to hook one up to).</p>

<p>So toy choices (in this example) can seem unusual. </p>

<p><strong>How do you get others to accept your rules for toy choices?</strong></p>

<p>We have a large problem with ""others"" getting what they think will be fun.  For example a neighbor getting a toy for our foster child that would normally be perfectly fine, but for this case, it's not ok. </p>

<p>This usually falls into two categories. </p>

<p><strong>Ignorance</strong> the neighbor just doesn't know that something as ""normal"" as a play dough play set is a trigger for this child.</p>

<p><strong>Being Ignored</strong> usually not neighbors and friends but ""grandparents"", just going - ""It's ok, you liked playing with it when you were a kid"" (or similar). And just ignoring our rules as unimportant or wrong.</p>

<p>So, back to the question, how do you enforce your toy choices, when other people may not understand or respect the boundaries. And failing that, how do you  ""take away"" a gift because it is a trigger, even though the child may not understand that? </p>

Me and his dad have had a volatile relationship, we were both young and eventually fell apart shortly after our son was born. Since then he was in and out of his life until shortly before his third birthday. I can now see he wasn't ready for the responsabilities of being a full time dad. He would often cut all contact for months (and when he did have him he would just leave him at his parents whilst he went out). He never actually showed interest in his son. I was always the one to make the first step to get back in touch. I usually did that by contacting his family, who were a bit difficult to deal with due to religious choices, but always happy to see their grandson nethertheless.</p>

<p>I got into a new relationship and this didn't go down well with my sons dad. It was causing alot of aggrevation to everyone including his family who were the ones looking after my son on the weekends that he was supposed to be with his dad. Often when he was meant to drop our son back he would disappear to his friends' house. Because his family had religious beleifs, I would have to stand outside for hours until they finished praying. I would often be driving home at 10pm when both me and my son would have an early start the next day. This was obviously causing grief to everyone especially my son. That's when I told his dad that I would go to court to get a contact order that he has to stick to, if he does wish to be a part of our sons life. That was the last time I ever heard from him.

"Are ""Potty Parties"" generally effective?","<p>A couple I know recently threw a ""potty party"" for their three-year-old son.  The general idea is outlined <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=2029062&amp;page=1#.T3M9Z2ES3Uc"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and is that you dedicate a day to intensive potty training.</p>

<p>Some of the main ideas are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is a full, intensive one-on-one day with no (or minimal) distractions</li>
<li>The child is encouraged to drink a lot and eat lots of salty snacks, to maximize how many potty attempts there will be.</li>
<li>A doll is used to model the desired behavior. Instruction is given to the doll, rather than the child, and the child is encouraged to help ""train"" the doll.</li>
<li>Presents and a general celebration are held to make the child excited about the concept.</li>
</ul>

<p>Quite frankly, the whole thing sounds rather silly to me, and I worry that such a plan might put too much pressure on the child to ""succeed"" immediately (the goal is to complete potty training in a single day, and the author of the book referenced in that article claims that this is a reasonable expectation).</p>

<p>Is this an effective technique?  Does anyone has experience with it?  Does a child need to reach a certain level on their own before this technique becomes effective (beyond being developed enough to physically ""hold it in"" long enough to make it to the potty)?</p>

"Raising a bilingual kid. When should we introduce the majority language?","<p>We are a family living in an English speaking country with a 3-year-old. My wife and I speak both French and English and we are committed to raise our kid bilingual in both languages. So far our approach has been to expose him only to French since he will eventually pick up English from the outside world. So his daycare is in French, we (and our family) only speak to him in French and the cartoons he watches are in French…  as a result he only understands and speaks French right now. We are happy about this, but are starting to be concerned that he does not understand/speak English, especially when we have playdates with other kids who only speak English, we don't want him to feel that he is different from them.</p>

<p>Our long term plan for us is to follow a strict one-parent, one-language (OPOL) approach (my wife will only speak English and I will speak French to him). Should we start the OPOL approach now? Or Should we continue with only French for a few more years? Also we are planning on sending him to a bilingual school English/French, so I am not concerned about him feeling different at school. My concern is mostly with our friends' kids and other family members who don't speak French. I also have the irrational fear that he will not learn English well… which I know is very irrational, since English is the main and only language where we live. </p>

"Breaking my rejection of christianity to my parents","<p>I know this isn't exactly appropriate for this site -- I'm not a parent, I'm a son -- but I think it's still applicable to the community here. I would prefer feedback from actual parents concerned about other parents, not people who theorize about child-parent relationships, but if there's a better q/a site for me to migrate this question to, please let me know.</p>

<p>I am 20 years old, third year in college. I went to church about every Sunday for the first 18 years of my life, with my parents. When I moved out to go to college, I stopped going to church all together. My Mom still tells me every time I see her (whenever I go home, about twice a semester) that she's praying for me. I go with my parents to church every time I'm home, sing the songs, pray the prayers at dinner, the whole deal. Both my parents ask me if I've found a church yet, how often I go looking, etc. but I always manage to give them the excuse that I've been really busy with school (which is true, but of course irrelevant). </p>

<p>The truth is, I haven't self-identified as a christian since I was 16. I've avoided telling my parents this because... well, it would be very difficult. My Mom would probably get really upset and my Dad would probably just try to get in a huge theological argument with me, but it wouldn't change my mind, it would distress them further, and lead to a large divide between us. At the same time, it feels wrong to outright deceive them all the time. I'm definitely willing to continue whatever traditional religious stuff I would otherwise do to please them, even though it all means nothing (other than family tradition) to me. </p>

<p>As a parent, can you give me some advice on what to do? Should I have the talk and break it to them? If so, what's the best way to do that? How can I avoid religion causing a divide between us?</p>

"How high should I put bathroom stuff dangerous to young children (cleaning agents, razors etc.)?","<p>We have a very small bathroom. Currently cleaning agents stand on the floor and we have a little bath cart for razors, cosmetics, sanitary napkins and so on.</p>

<p>Both cannot stay that way because our child will become mobile and want to explore everything at some point. (It is not born yet but will be soon.)</p>

<p>So we want to build a shelf, hang it onto the wall and put all that stuff into it. The idea is that the child cannot reach the stuff in the shelf until it is old enough to understand that the content is to be handled with caution (1: no licking/drinking! 2: be careful that you don't cut yourself! 3:...).</p>

<p>Since the bathroom is so small, we want to hang it as low as possible - the lower it hangs the more space we have to store everything (we will use more boards then). Otherwise we would need to store stuff outside of the bathroom, which we want to avoid if possible.</p>

<p>Also, if it hangs low, the child may later use the lowest board to put its own stuff there (after reaching a certain age - which age?).</p>

<p>So the question is, what is a good minimum height? I read that the mouthing phase usually ends around age 2, and in that age the child will be between 80cm and 93cm. But I don't know how high they can reach at this age, and I also don't know about the probability that the child will have its mouthing phase until age 4 (which seems to be not uncommon)...</p>

"Should I wake my 8.5 month old for feeding at night?","<p>Our little one is 8 and a half months old, has started on solids at least twice a day, and is mostly breastfed. We are also slowing converting her to formula feeds to help my wife transition back to work.</p>

"Babies and math concepts","<p>Does anybody know what are the logical basic concepts that a baby could understand?
For example regarding numbers, I think until the age of 1 they cannot distinguish between the concepts of <em>one</em> and <em>many</em>. 
And until the age of two they cannot distinguish between <em>two</em> and <em>three</em>. </p>

<p>Furthermore, what about the logical connectives, like <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>, <em>not</em> and more...
With my daughter it seems (20 months) that there is no problem with <em>and</em>, but she still seems to not understand the <em>or</em>. </p>

<p>I know that at that age every single baby follows his own way. But, I know also that they learn according the external incentives.</p>

<p>Regarding logical and mathematical concepts, there are three different levels of understanding:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Knowing the difference between numbers</em>,</li>
<li><em>The ability of managing numbers</em> (at different levels depending on the age).</li>
<li><em>To be fascinated by the beauty of math</em> (and in particular of numbers).</li>
</ol>

<p>Just in trying to explain the differences between these three levels, let me give one example.</p>

<p>If my family (me, my wife and my daughter) goes to an art museum, I would be the one who would enjoy it the least. Also if technically I'm better than my daughter (translating I'm better in level one and two), I'm not at all able to understand (especially with abstract art) the essence of a painting (I'm lower in level three).</p>

<p>Resuming three different levels of understanding means three different types of external incentives. </p>

<p>It seem to me (but I didn't already see the links) that the good answers of balanced mama and Valkyrie cover, almost completely, the first two types. But what about the last level?</p>

<p>Some years ago I read a book of  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Tammet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daniel Tammet</a>. He is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_savant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">autistic savant</a> with particular talent in remembering numbers. What is his strategy? He associates to numbers' surfaces, colours and objects. This is quite common among mathematicians: a demonstration could become a story, where the logical passages became landscapes and objects became characters.</p>

<p>In general I think that, starting with numbers, our brain  makes, for a certain point of view, completely irrational connections. Moreover I think that our brain starts to make these connections really early. </p>

<p>I would like that my daughter will appreciate mathematics from this point of view. The question now is: </p>

<p>what kind of external stimuli accomplish to this task? Does somebody know more about that?  </p>

"Advice for carrying out the ""Stay in Bed"" technique with our 2-year-old","<p>My two-year old has always had trouble settling and sleeping through the night, but recently the problem seems to have become an awful lot worse. It all came to a head one night a few weeks ago after he woke at midnight and didn't drop off again till 4am, despite our best efforts with the ""controlled crying"" technique. That was when we knew we had to do <em>something</em> proactively, and soon.</p>

<p>After seeking advice from various different sources (<a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/4600/getting-a-2-year-old-back-to-sleep-in-the-middle-of-the-night"">including this forum</a>), we opted to try Supernanny's ""Stay in Bed"" technique. She describes it in her book and there are various clips of it on the TV show (e.g. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DO3DuBKXqoM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this clip~ 24 mins &amp; 29mins </a>). She says it is the best approach for a child of his age. </p>

<p>Basically it involves making sure your child has eaten and drunk well and carrying out a calming bed-time routine, putting your child in bed and sitting in the room with them, sitting side-on and without making eye-contact. The first time he gets out, you say ""It's bedtime."" and put him back. The second time, you say ""Bedtime"". Any subsequent times, you say <strong>NOTHING</strong>- ignore the screams, the questions, the begging for food, drink, etc- just lift him up and put him back.</p>

<p>It's all very well. But I've been doing it for almost a week, and so far the number of times I have had to put him back to bed (in chronological order) have been: 40,23,21,4,8,18. Last night he woke at 3am and (despite me sitting silently in his room after he woke) would not settle till 5am.</p>

<p>On the TV show, the technique always works <em>very</em> quickly and effectively when done correctly. But as far as I can see, I have followed everything <em>to the letter</em>, and I certainly have not once said a word to him when I shouldn't. The only doubt I have is that sometimes I lie down, rather than sit when I come in after he's woken in the middle of the night (can you blame me?)- don't know if that's important.</p>

<p>Has anyone got any advice on what I may be doing wrong, or maybe just some encouragement that it can take a long time?</p>

<p>One last point- I know there are loads of contrasting techniques out there, and I'm sure each has its merits. But I'd really rather stick with this technique now I've started, rather than start trying another one. Simply because changing it is distressing and confusing for him.</p>

"How to remain unaffected by my 10-year-old son's angry outbursts?","<p>My son is ten years old now and I feel that over the past year or so he has become increasingly irritable and prone to angry outbursts. He is easily frustrated by the smallest things and tears up and gets into a rage over what I perceive as nothing.</p>

<p>The problem in all of this is that I find it increasingly difficult to remain unaffected by my son's negative emotions. He gets over his fits of temper quickly and returns to a happy mood after a few minutes or half hour, but I feel that his rages destroy my mood irreparably. For example, we might start an afternoon in a good mood, I'm looking forward to what we have planned, and then something doesn't go as he wanted and he gets angry and stomps off to his room. After half an hour his good humor has returned, but now I am sad or angry or both and cannot get out of my funk for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The worst of these situations happened two weeks ago. My son had an outburst, which wasn't even extremely bad, but it got to me so that I went to bed and cried and couldn't bring myself to get up again for the next few hours. I just lay there, thinking that I didn't want his anger to have happened, and unable to let go of no longer wanting to experience his moods.</p>

<p>By now, I look forward to the afternoons or weekends with my son with extreme apprehension, and I live in almost constant fear of his outbursts. When I am alone with my son, this apprehension and my attempts at not provoking him (while at the same time not bending to his wishes for more candy, more TV, or later bed time) is so stressful, that after a few hours I am so tired as if I hadn't slept for two nights.</p>

<p>I understand that it will take time to teach my son to deal with his emotions, and I sort of know how to go about it, but I don't know how to deal with my own emotions. All I want is to have the happy, easy-going, and fun child back that I had until about two years ago, and I am mortally afraid of his puberty.</p>

"How to deal with teen self-destructive behavior and complete lack of sense of responsibility?","<p>A 18-year-old who is in the final year of high school is exhibiting certain patterns of behavior that seem very troubling. He is currently <em>doing well</em> in school, but I'm afraid that these patterns of behavior will soon enough lead him to disaster (academically and otherwise).</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of deep interest in most activities, apart from watching sports or playing video games.</li>
<li>Lack of interest in any specific academic topics.</li>
<li><p>Avoidance of any responsibility or school duty until the last possible moment before the (homework/exam) deadline -- to be precise, he does in the end do the job, but goes about doing it in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>he asks for help from his parents and does it in a way as to imply that it is <em>their</em> responsibility to insure that the task is completed;</li>
<li>he refuses to go the extra mile in performing any academic task. What is more, he is always ready to cut corners that do not affect ""too much"" the performance -- one of his favorite saying is ""I don't want to do useless extra work"" (while actually talking about work whose avoidance will not make him fail, but will avoid him truly going beyond mediocrity).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Complete abdication of responsibility for any aspect of his life, from trivial decisions to more important life-changing ones -- e. g. he has not yet even thought about his college major (or job perspective) after finishing school (to clarify, in my country you have to decide a fixed major before applying to university).</p></li>
<li><p>Complete lack of skills and awkwardness in the most trivial/easiest manual activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Refusal to complete even the most trivial tasks (even when pressed) -- including showering, brushing his teeth, set his room in (the tiniest amount of) order. This kind of lack of self-care is consistent with depression symptoms, but, in my experience, being forced by an external force to complete such tasks is ralely met with active defiance in depression cases (in those cases it is more of a ""letting oneself go"" rather than actively resisting an external push towards self-care). </p></li>
<li><p>Severe misbehavior and lack of respect towards parents (or adults in general), sometimes to the point of threats of violence or simulated acts of violence. In some cases, I can see where his frustration comes from, but it is still unacceptable. </p></li>
<li><p>Unwillingness to learn (in many contexts) from others (even school teachers -- for example  one phrase he uses often is ""Why does teacher X go on blabbing about this useless stuff, can't he just assign pages from the textbook and be done with it?""). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I must say that these things have been a problem with him for many years, but recently have become more and more severe. </p>

<p>One approach to try to deal with this kind of behavior would be to let him be until reality sets him straight. However, I'd really rather not have him suffer the consequences of his actions, because in my estimation they will surely be permanent and disastrous. </p>

<p>I cannot figure out the causes of this situation and when it is brought up for discussion his reaction is mosty avoidance (one phrase that he comes up with a lot in these circumstances is ""Don't stress me out"" -- which is also used when he engages in procrastination about school or other activities). </p>

"How to help a tomboy not dread puberty","<p>She's ten and mostly plays with the boys, fitting in well due to her easy-going nature, outstanding athleticism, strong sense of fair play, and wild and crazy sense of humor.  She's super competitive, one of the leaders of the pack in terms of ability, while still stopping to help the kids who need rules/strategies explained.  The problem is, from her point of view there's nothing on the other side of puberty to look forward to. The boys will be getting stronger; she will be getting breasts.  Not fair!  She's miserable about this and it hasn't even started yet.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Since a large part of the community are also members of sites like StackOverflow, I’ll try translating this question to, say, mathematics.</p>

<p>Say you are ten and you are good at math.  You and your good friends all go to math camp, have started learning various programming languages, have Raspberry Pi on your Christmas list.  You in particular sometimes help the non-math kids with their math homework. You’re very compettive and love to compete in Math Olympiad, and if your score isn’t <em>always</em> the highest for your grade, you’re generally in the top three.</p>

<p>Recently you found out that over the next four years, most of your friends’ math intelligence is going to get a four-fold boost.  Even some of the kids you help with math will get this boost.  You, on the other hand, will get a two-fold boost. Period.  Plus, you are going to have a French accent whenever you talk about math.  Not an ugly French acent – it will be pleasant, but it will be very, very noticeable.</p>

<p>So, how comforted would you be if someone said to you, “That’s okay, you don’t have to be any less mathematical, just because everyone else is going to be better!  It’s not <em>only</em> about being the best.  While other kids are doing calculus or even multivariable calculus in a few  years, you can still have fun with trigonometry!  Or, why don’t you learn to cook?  You get to use math to measure things in cooking, right? Besides, don’t a lot of cooks have a French accent?”</p>

<p>Yes, this is over-simplified.  My daughter is more than just a jock (another “label” for you).  She’s one of the top math students in her grade and one of the best creative writers… <em>and</em> she’s the class cut-up (even the teacher laughs... sometimes especially the teacher).  She's kind.  She likes to draw manga; she single-handedly bakes a mean apple pie (crust ""from scratch,"" of course); <em>and</em> she’s currently trying to memorize the periodic table of elements  (don’t ask me why).</p>

<p>She has some girl friends, not all of them into sports.  But she won’t wear dresses, and she finds makeup and what she calls “fashion lady stuff” ludicrous.  She generally prefers the straightforward friendship of boys to the drama of girl friendships. And <strong>sports are <em>her favorite thing</em>.</strong></p>

<p>It’s not that she won’t live through puberty, but I'm hoping to find something positive for her on the other side of it, so that she won’t be so depressed about it.

"How to deal with children when parents are caught in the act?","<p>A near relative discussed this issue with me. They have 2 sons and 2 daughters and everyone sleeps in the same room. They cannot afford as of now to live in a large apartment with separate room for kids.</p>

<p>So, it seems that one night after the kids slept, the parents were doing the special cuddling, to put it neatly. After the act, they came to knew that one of their son who is 6 years old was awake and pretending to be asleep.</p>

<p>He was pretending because of strict rules of bedtime and the kid had to get up early the next day for school.</p>

<p>The parents are concerned that they did a mistake and should have thoroughly checked if everyone was asleep. This is the first time it happened to them and they are clueless.</p>

<p>The mother told the child the next day that she was applying some sort of balm to the father as he had some pain and asked the child if he was awake. The child told that he didn't see anything as it was dark but heard 'noises' and then 'smiled'.</p>

<p><strong>How to deal with children in such situations and what could be the psychological impact on them? Is it too early for them to understand about intimacy? What if they get more curious and want to experiment?</strong> </p>

"What is normal for 4.5 month old sleep patterns?","<p>My son was doing really well up through 3months with sleeping. We would put him down at 8 and he would not wake up until 3am for his first feeding, then 6am for second and then be up for the day around 8am.  Each feeding he'd go right back to bed.  When our pediatrician told us at our 3month visit to start training him to self soothe and fall asleep on his own, things have changed and I want to know if it's normal or not. </p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it normal that at 4.5 months, his naps are still only 30 minutes long? Sometimes he wakes up happy, other times crying. We wait 10 minutes when he wakes but he won't fall back asleep. His wake time is only 1.5 hours between naps.  He still takes 4-5 naps a day and I'm concerned that these short naps are what's causing the frequent nightwakings (see question 2). are these short naps normal and will they naturally consolidate and become longer?</p></li>
<li><p>He knows how to self soothe back to sleep because he does it on his own for naps and bedtime. Even when he stirs in the middle of the night after a short period of time, he's usually able to go back on his own. The question is, he now wakes up every 2 hours and since we have the baby monitor near us, we also wake up every 2 hours and lay there listening to him fuss!  We moved his bedtime up to 730 in hopes that it would solve the issue but even then he's still waking every two hours! Is this normal? We do not have to go in to get him to sleep usually (except every now and again in rare instances) so I think we've successfully trained him to self soothe but is it normal that he wakes up so often?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please tell me that this will end? Is it the 4 month sleep regression and if so when does it end?
Thank you!</p>

"I don't want to be a father","<p>I feel awful about this, but I can't keep my silence about it anymore.</p>

<p>I'm a 25 year old man. I am a piano teacher and have a lot of entrepreneurial/artistic dreams and goals.</p>

<p>I met a girl about two years ago, in the spring of 2013. We began dating seriously and I moved in with her in the June/July of 2013. Before this I had been living with my parents.</p>

<p>Beginning that winter, of 2013/2014, I began to lose interest in the relationship. I didn't find her mentally stimulating anymore, and I had been introduced to the concept of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory"">polyamory</a> when I read a book on the subject. It was world changing. I had been unknowingly searching for that philosophy for years, and I so completely identified with it that I couldn't believe I had been living any other way.</p>

<p>However, I've always had a weakness with feelings of irrational guilt and obligation, and it's always been pretty easy for people to sway me to do what they want if they have those things on their side, and in this situation I felt extremely guilty and obligated to her. I didn't want to be with her anymore for a variety of reasons, but I felt awful and didn't break up with her like I should have. I also felt financially afraid to strike out truly on my own. I had been living with my parents before this. I also felt like I would be abandoning her to financially rely on her (awful) family. Lots of guilt.</p>

<p>I didn't do anything about it at all for literally months as I waffled about what to do, and eventually told her about the polyamory. She is pretty much the definition of a completely monogamous person, so she was completely horrified by the idea and not open to it at all. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, since I ultimately didn't want <em>any</em> relationship with her, polyamorous or otherwise.</p>

<p>We sometimes argued about the polyamory, but I continued to not act on it and not break up with her, feeling paralyzed by my various feelings. Time passed, and finally, this last September of 2014, I tried to break up with her. It was a huge ordeal, and despite the fact that I don't want a relationship with her and don't really like her, I'm still in love with and attached to her. It was very difficult for both of us, but in the end, her frightening statements about attempting suicide if I left (she's attempted before in her life, before I met her) were what ultimately kept me there. I also of course felt afraid and in emotional pain and guilty, etc etc.</p>

<p>About a month after this whole ordeal, we found out she was pregnant. She had been using birth control pills our entire relationship, and I really don't know what on earth happened. It ultimately doesn't matter.</p>

<p>She is completely anti-abortion, and she desperately wanted to keep the baby. Again, in the flurry of guilt and obligation I agreed to marry her (she had been hinting and pushing since at least the 6 month mark), and we got married in November of 2014.</p>

<p>She's now 7 months pregnant with a boy. Our relationship continued as normal (you know, considering the circumstances) and on the surface appears strong.</p>

<p>I however have never been more miserably unhappy. I was deeply unhappy even before the pregnancy, but now I'm basically a zombie. I trudge through my daily life, and have that intense feeling of heaviness and tightness in my chest, all of the time. I never really wanted to be a father. I always have placed more personal importance on projects and accomplishments and friendships than romance. I want to be important and powerful and change the world. I can't imagine a more miserable life than to be a monogamous family man. I realize that some people achieve great happiness with that life, but I simply don't feel that's who I am. My now wife has always been lovingly but overbearingly suffocating, and my ambitions and other friendships have all completely stagnated in the two years I've been with her. I hate the lack of freedom, I hate the sense that all my time is spoken for, I hate every second of my life. I want out intensely.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do. I'm so completely lost. Would my son be better off with a father who doesn't want to be around but is putting on a smiling face, or a father who was divorced early on? How do I handle my situation? What's the right thing to do? Am I defective? Am I a bad person?</p>

"When my 5-year-old is throwing a tantrum, should I leave her alone or stay?","<p>My 5-year-old daughter is generally a pleasant and balanced girl, but sometimes she will get really, really mad and throw a major tantrum. This usually happens when something does not go her way (even something trivial) while she is tired or otherwise in a bad mood. Sometimes it is because I refuse to give her something (such as watching a video when it's already bedtime), sometimes something else which annoys her (such as bad weather or a friend who cannot come to play).</p>

<p>Then she will sit down somewhere, or even lie on the ground, be angry, cry without pause and generally look quite miserable. She will not accept being touched, held, comforted or sometimes even being spoken to. This can go on for over twenty minutes before she calms down.</p>

<p>I am still a bit unsure how to best handle this. I don't want to punish her for the tantrum, as I think she does it because she cannot (yet) control her emotions. At the same time, I do want it to stop, both for my sanity and for hers.</p>

<p>In particular, I tried leaving her alone and going to a different room, so she can cool off. However, it seems to me the tantrums take even longer then. On the other hand, she refuses to interact with me even if I am there, and it feels silly to sit there, watch and do nothing.</p>

<p>Should I stay and wait for the tantrum to go away? Should I leave her alone? Sometimes when I tell her I will go away, she objects, sometimes she does not react at all.</p>

"7yo step-son runs away when he thinks he's in trouble","<p>The child in this case is 7 years old. Just as an example; maybe he breaks his own toy, clearly by accident, but right after I asked him not to do whatever caused the breaking.</p>

<p>I would like to calmly tell him that's why I asked him to stop, and to pick up the toy. I figure the breaking of his own stuff would be a punishment in itself.</p>

<p>Instead, he runs - thinking he's in trouble. If I follow, to explain I'm not mad or anything, he gets more ""desperate"" to get away from me and ignore anything I say. So I don't chase him.</p>

<p>But, rather than this example, say he does something he knows is wrong but also warrants a consequence such as time-out or taking away a privilege like game-time. He runs, and I'm not sure what to do.</p>

<p>I could chase him down, I did once - but during the explanation of what happened and why he is being punished he just looked angry, like he was ignoring everything and internally blaming someone or something else. I don't think anything got through that running doesn't help but rather hurts his situation.</p>

<p>I tried waiting until he has calmed down but he just attempts to avoid me for prolonged periods of time - eventually I go to him and again, it seems like he is making excuses to himself and blaming others, seemingly me, though he doesn't voice it - I'm just going by the anger he shows towards me when he's in trouble.</p>

<p>He is my step-son, I have started having a larger impact on his life about half a year ago. I don't ever discipline him in a physical manner, and neither does his mother. I'm not sure where the running comes from. I also usually let his mother do any disciplining, it just seems more effective. I personally have only had to do it less than a handful of times.</p>

<p>What is the correct way to handle this, both for the case where he's not really in trouble and the one where he is? Should I let him calm down or give chase for immediate consequences of his actions? Is he actually hearing me, or do I need to use a different strategy to reach him?</p>

"How can I get involved in the parenting of my girlfriend's sister's 5-year-old who spends too much time on screens etc.?","<p>I am a 30ish years old man, living at my girlfriend's parents place for 4 months. It's been 2 months already, 2 more to go. I don't have kids (yet, but want to).
With us is my girlfriend's sister and her 5-year-old daughter. </p>

<p>She is a single mom, not working and taking care 24/7 of her child. She is vegan, and so is her girl. She is breastfeeding. She is using non violent communication with her child, and has that education principle where she is letting her do whatever she wants, whenever she wants, with as little restraints as possible. So, no schooling at all (where we live there is nothing mandatory until the child is 6), it is all driven by her child's wishes. There are no limits apart from the limits of physics, and finances, because the mother doesn't have lots of money.
Basically the mother considers her child like an adult making her own choices, capable of knowing what's best for her. 
This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eating what she wants when she wants.</li>
<li>Spending all day long, all night long on a smartphone or computer, either playing games or watching videos (of people playing games, mostly).</li>
<li>Going to sleep between 3 and 8 in the morning, depending on the days, then waking up in the early afternoon.</li>
<li>Crying and yelling until she gets what she wants.</li>
<li>Throwing things at people, hitting people (mostly her mother) when she is angry (she gets angry very easily).</li>
<li>Ordering people (mostly her mother) to do things. For example, her mother needs to ask for permission to go pee.</li>
<li>The child has no regular friends, they go out sometimes and she can play with other kids, maybe once or twice a week, nothing regular.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am very worried about the child:</p>

<ul>
<li>She looks like a video-game addict. I know because I've been there when I was 18-20, and with her character it's hard to cope with. For example, when she loses at a game, she starts crying/yelling (she is not throwing the phone away anymore since the time she broke it, yay) loudly, only getting calmed down when she's at her mother's breast. Also I've read a lot about screens being bad for kids and she spends easily 2/3 of her awake time on them!</li>
<li>The sleeping hours!</li>
<li>The education. The principle looks nice, learning things you're interested in, but in this case I feel it is only creating an addict with a horrible character, and I don't see how she's going to learn anything like this.</li>
<li>The social skills. Her only friend is her mother, and she is also her slave.</li>
<li>She also looks very skinny, compared to all other children that age I know. She eats mostly rice and fruits/veggies, and her mother's milk.</li>
</ul>

<p>The grandparents are worried as well but they support their daughter's decision of choosing this type of education, and they are quite passive with the child.</p>

<p>Here is what I have tried to do until now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speak to the mother. I told her how concerned I was about her child, especially the sleeping hours and the screen-addict thing. She seems concerned too, but I didn't see any changes since I spoke with her. She thinks the freedom of her child is more important than anything else.</li>
<li>I also insisted that the mother should express her needs more to make the child understand that other people have needs too.</li>
<li>With respect to the education principles (using NVC, etc), I try to make the child think about consequences, about putting herself in other's shoes. Like, when we were on the beach and she threw sand at my girlfriend's face, asking (the calmest I could) why she did it and if she would like someone to throw sand at her face. Same when she forbids her mother to do things. Or asking why she continues playing games if it makes her cry so often. But I have very few interactions with the child so I don't think it's making much of a difference.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Being not related to the child, how can you have an impact on a child's education? What can you do concretely in this kind of situation through interaction with the child?</strong></p>

"How much time is too much time playing educational computer games?","<p>I recently bought an iPad primarily for my 3-year-old daughter. I put nothing on it but educational apps and children's books.

"Explaining the concept of underwear to our toddler","<p>Our 21 month old toddler will use the potty when we leave her bottom bare - she has been successfully doing this for a month. Tired of cleaning stinky diapers, we leave her bottom bare when she is home. </p>

<p>She doesn't particularly enjoy wearing diapers, and when we put one on her, she doesn't take the initiative to tell us that she has to use the potty. However, when we have company over, we put a diaper on her.</p>

<p>We are trying to transition her into wearing panties; however, she is very opposed to them. She equates them with pants and doesn't want to wear them. While she is fully capable of dressing herself in pants, she hasn't mastered taking her pants off yet. </p>

<p>How do you introduce underwear to your child? When do people normally introduce underwear to their child? How do I explain the concept of having to take her panties off before using the potty?</p>

<p>We in no way want to discourage her use of the potty, as she seems to really enjoy pooing/peeing outside (she claps for herself whenever she uses the potty). But if she is interested in potty training herself, I do want to show her the concept of an underwear.</p>

"What do I do to get my daughter interested in presenting her science experiments at the science competition(fair)?","<p>In my state we get the primary school aged kids (8-12) to enter a State Science competition. (In other states and countries - the equivalent may be a school science fair.)</p>

<p>My daughter (9) has some interests in science. She has:</p>

<ul>
<li>tried lots of different slime recipes to get the best results</li>
<li>built a pair of unicorn slippers with lights programmable by Arduino for dancing in. </li>
</ul>

<p>When I ask her about entering these in the competition - she goes quiet and mumbles. She hints that the teacher that runs the competition puts her off. </p>

<p>When I asked her last year about bringing in science experiments to her teacher (whom she loved) she was reluctant. (She would take in the lego compressed air steam engine, but not the slime experiments). </p>

<p>My mother's feeling about the situation is that my daughter feels that teachers take all the fun out of a perfectly good thing to play with and talk to your friends about. </p>

<p>My question is: <strong>What do I do to get my daughter interested in presenting her science experiments at the science competition (fair)?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: Why put an entry in a science competition? A couple of reasons:</p>

<p>(1) because she has pushed beyond what looked easy before (voluntary State Maths and English competitions) and done much better than she thought. (Not to say that underperforming grows you because you learn how to do better and how to be a good sport in that situation)</p>

<p>(2) because this is a way to get recognition for what she is already interested in</p>

<p>(3) because science competitions are a factor in private school scholarships </p>

<p>(4) because science is amazing. Since the enlightenment we have questioned and measured our world and this has lead to longer and more comfortable, and more enjoyable lives. </p>

<p>Note: I need to put this up due to the rules of this site. I’m fine with answers that disagree with the premise of this question.</p>

"How to handle my 9-year-old's uncontrollable raging fits?","<p>We have four kids: a 9-year-old boy, a 6-year-old girl, a 4-year-old boy and a 20-month-old girl. </p>

<p>The 9-year-old boy is in general a delightful, well-behaved, kind and considerate boy. Sometimes he becomes so overwhelmed by his emotions that he spirals out of control and becomes inconsolable.  </p>

<p>It sometimes begins with some kind of mild but disrespectful remark which my partner or I let him know is not tolerated.  This often escalates immediately into him being flung into a rage complete with stomping, etc. In other cases the raging fit is triggered by one of his siblings pestering him.  </p>

<p>In either case we normally send him to his room until the rage turns into crying.  That usually signals that he has become consolable. Because it seems so obvious to us that he is having feelings that are just beyond his capacity to handle we try to let him know he's not in trouble it's just that the rest of us aren't going to be around the raging fit.</p>

<p>This happens a couple of times per week, and has been for some years. His teachers do not report this behavior at school.  His report cards and conferences indicate positive behavior.</p>

<p>Can I stop this and should I? How do I get to the bottom of it? Should I do something differently? Does anyone have a magical spell that will fix this?      </p>

"How to help a 6-month-old who won't soothe in the crib?","<h3>TL;DR Version</h3>

<p>How do people get a 6-month-old to soothe without picking them up? Has this actually ever worked for anyone? We are on baby #2 and it seems like a myth?</p>

<h3>Long Form Version</h3>

<p>We are on baby #2 and have hit an issue that I feel like is reasonably common: the kid can almost never soothe himself to sleep in a crib, regardless of how drowsy he is. He's breastfed, no co-sleeping, consistent night time routine (feed, wash, quick-book+dim lights, crib, music, white noise+dark).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he's a negative sleep trajectory. After being relatively normal to about 4 months (naps ~45-1.5h, night: 3h then 1.5h after), he had a sleep regression and blew up his naps to 45m and first night cycle to 1.5h+a mix of 45m. He returned to the original better night sleep for almost a week (3h+1.5h blocks). He is now on 45m blocks... for all naps and in the night. For those in the back row, that means 10-15 wake ups each night, depending on how quickly he soothes back down. Even tag-teaming, this is a WW1 style trench warfare existence.</p>

<p>His typical pattern is to wake up not immediately startled/crying but with an escalating grunting and barking vocalization that eventually turns into uncontrollable crying if you wait long enough (5-10 minutes). We're taking a full court press on this issue to knock out possible physical causes (e.g., reflux meds, cutting out dairy, tried some tylenol at times where physical discomfort seemed possible). Related to this is an issue: the kid just can't be comforted without picking him up and holding/bouncing him (depending on where in his waking cycle you catch him).</p>

<p>Spread across hundreds of pieces of literature is this concept of ""Oh, just put your baby down drowsy but awake! If they get upset, soothe them in place!"" With no apparent backup plan when they are <em>not</em> soothable without holding them. Methods tried so far, with the level of success noted from ""some"" :-\ to ""makes things worse"" :-( </p>

<ul>
<li>Audio:

<ul>
<li>Shushing :-\</li>
<li>Singing lullabies :-(</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Physical Pressure:

<ul>
<li>Patting :-(</li>
<li>""Holding"" with hands on sides but without lifting out of the crib :-\</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Motion:

<ul>
<li>Vibrating hands gently on the sides :-(</li>
<li>""Rocking"" by bouncing baby gently in place without removing from crib :-\</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sucking:

<ul>
<li>Finger :-\</li>
<li>Baby hand :-\</li>
<li>Pacifier N/A (couldn't keep it in well enough, preferred his hand)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Feeding): We haven't fiddled with this much, but the kid is chunky and eats great. Only about ~2 wake ups seem to have much hunger cues, and we just feed him then.</li>
<li>Props (haven't tried much on this):

<ul>
<li>Stuffed animal N/A (haven't tried much due to choking/smothering risk)</li>
<li>Tube socks filled w/ warm rice/grain N/A (considered, but he is in a Merlin suit so unclear if it would give much pressure/comfort)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>We have found only a handful of wins where the baby falls back asleep through some combination of these methods. Ones with mixed results typically cause some temporary soothing, but the baby staying up so long they are no longer tired and then there's a 40 minute <em>waking</em> cycle or otherwise need serious bouncing/nursing to settle. Given that it has only worked maybe 3 times ever, the ""critical failure rate"" is about 5-10 times more likely than the success rate. </p>

<p>Worse, the successes don't mean the baby sleeps any longer. We recently had our first ""put baby down in crib, leave room, it falls asleep."" They then woke up 40 minutes later, and every 40 minutes thereafter until 4 AM (where a 1.5h double-cycle happened by pure luck).</p>

<p>Breaking down this question into actionable bits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Additional Methods: Anybody has soothing methods not on the above list?</li>
<li>Baby-Gone-Good Stories: Is there anybody who had a baby that consistently escalated in a crib, but then got better at it (in the 6 month area)?</li>
<li>Wins?: Was it even useful to help a baby soothe with less intervention? This seems to be a common wisdom, yet are not seeing that less assistance in sleeping results in the baby stringing more cycles together.</li>

"When the length of a commute can be recognized as not acceptable for a kindergartner?","<p>I have learned of kids with crazy long commutes in their school bus for public schools. I'm surprised of having such longs commutes (1 hour) for a 4-to-5 year old starting kindergarten.</p>

<p>I understand that sometimes a long commute might be the only option to get a child to school, but I think that a long commute, along with an early starting time, could be counterproductive in the academic performance of kids, and much worse in kindergartners, who might be having their first school experience ever.</p>

<p>In the state of Massachusetts (USA) a child can only be on the bus for an hour, but authorities can decide than an even longer bus ride is OK if needed.</p>

<p>I guess that that is the rule for all children, but obviously is going to affect some more than others.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any research or documentation about when the length of a commute can be recognized as not acceptable for a kindergartner?</strong> (in the sense of, ""longer than this is counterproductive for the child to have a productive school day and can cause mood issues, attention or performance problems or the like, and should be avoided if possible""). </p>

<hr>

<p>While it may not directly answer the question I would really appreciate additional information (via comment maybe) about similar regulations in different States (do all states thin that one hour is the longest a child should be on the bus?), or even different parts of the world. That could help comparing specific rules and understand what is adequate for a kindergartner (4 to 5 years) and what is not.</p>

"How can I get my strong-willed daughter to stop being so lazy when it comes to chores?","<p>I have two daughters, age 8 and 10.  My 10 year old is very diligent and responsible and has always done her homework, chores, etc. without any reminders or coaxing.  So we have had a hard time adapting to our 8 yo daughter, who needs to be dragged/coaxed through every step of even the simplest and quickest of chores (clean the cat litter, put your dishes away, bring down your laundry, whatever).  </p>

<p>She is very stubborn (very close to being diagnosed Oppositional defiant disorder) and efforts to impose consequences (taking TV/computer time away, canceling playdates or dessert, etc) generally result in huge tantrums and dragging out the process for far longer than reasonable.  We almost never give in and let her off the hook, unless there are serious time/safety constraints involved -- which is rare since we have evolved to anticipate this behavior.  We've also tried incentives in terms of allowance schemes, earning TV/computer time, etc, which seems to have <em>zero</em> effect on her motivation.</p>

<p>The flip side of this stubbornness is that she is <em>really</em> diligent for any task she's bought into on her own - she will get her homework done immediately after school, works hard in sports, will feed the pets in a heartbeat, loves gardening work, etc.</p>

<p>I want to make it clear that other than this one issue, this daughter is a delight in almost every way who makes us proud every day (poetry?) -- I'm not calling her ""lazy"" to be demeaning, she just is actually lazy in this one area.</p>

"My son is being hit by a friend, and we need to discuss the situation with his mom","<p>I have two kids, an 8-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter--second grade and first grade, respectively. They are both tiny. My son is only 46 pounds.</p>

<p>A child entered my daughter's first-grade class. Let's call the boy Joe. He's big, maybe 60 pounds. He's had behavioral problems his whole life, and his mom chose to homeschool him for kindergarten after he was removed from preschool. </p>

<p>Joe gets overstimulated easily and hits impulsively. He doesn't understand what he's doing is wrong. Dozens of teachers, social workers, and parents have urged the boy's mother to seek professional help, but she refuses. A petition to have Joe removed from the school was quashed in favor of an IEP (Individualized Education Program), which sometimes works.</p>

<p>We are (were) his only friends. As a family, we are compassionate and forgiving. Joe hit my daughter twice, but that was months ago, and she is willing to be his friend (they are in the same class). However, she is extremely sensitive to aggression; we don't even watch Disney movies.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Joe hit my son in the park and hurt him pretty bad. My son doesn't want to be friends anymore which I agree with. Joe's mom wants my daughter to still be his friend; he has no others.</p>

<p>The boy's mom asks if Joe and my daughter can have a play date at her house without my son present.</p>

<p>I have not responded to this request. Also, my daughter's birthday is coming up, and my son requests Joe not be invited.  Joe is aggressive towards my son in almost every social setting, but we do better in small play date situations.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<p>1) What can I tell the mom about Joe and my daughter having a play date (without me? of course not). My instinct is to say when he gets professional help, we can try again, but that seems too pushy.</p>

<p>2) What is your feeling about my daughter's birthday party? My instinct is to not invite him because it would definitely harm my son's experience.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: 4/20/17</strong></p>

<p>The situation was resolved--mostly. We simply cut off contact. Joe's parents didn't object in any way; they've been through it before. He wasn't invited to my daughters party, but his mom and he briefly crashed to give a card. Joe invited us to his birthday. I dropped by with a card and $10 at the beginning without my kids. Nobody else came.</p>

<p>My son wants to do Scouts. Joe's in Scouts. Perfect. At the introductory meeting, I saw Joe hit 4 kids including my son, and I wasn't even paying attention to him for the most part. I'm going to ask his parents to keep Joe away from my son, or I'm just going to start calling the police. (His dad is one of the scout leaders.)</p>

<p>Update 8/2019</p>

<p>Joe has slowly gotten better with his aggression. However, I had to take a knife away from him at a Cub Scout event (in now the Pack leader). I talked with a classmate of his. I mentioned Joe seems to be hitting kids less. The boy responded, ""Yeah, but he wants to."" Great. Joe and my son actually shared a tent at a Scout campout, and it went fine. It was out of desperation in frigid conditions. (May and October are not safe for consistent weather in the US's Upper Midwest.) We invited Joe to my daughter's 10-yo birthday, but we haven't had any play dates.</p>

"Dealing with overprotective parents - is there anything I can do?","<p>I have been tutoring a child, and over the past months I have come to the conclusion that the parents allow the child to stop when things are getting hard. The child has from my view only little willpower, persistence, and discipline, and instead of dealing with difficult situations and working through them, the attitude is to drop the situation. Also I don't see the child having much self confidence, in terms of ""he doesn't believe in himself"".</p>

<p>I hate to make conclusions like this, especially because I can't say that I see everything that goes on every day, but there have been a large number of incidents and stories that I heard, that lead me to believe this.</p>

<p>I just came across a paragraph in <a href=""http://www.karikampakis.com/2013/11/10-common-mistakes-parents-today-make-me-included/#sthash.vvrHGdph.dpuf"">a blog article</a> that describes very well what I see is in the making:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a record number of 20-somethings who are depressed and don’t know why.
  These young adults claim they had magical childhoods. Their parents
  are their best friends. They never experienced tragedy or anything
  more than normal disappointments. Yet for some reason, they’re
  unhappy.</p>
  
  <p>...parents today are too quick to swoop in. We don’t want our children to fall, so instead of letting them experience adversity, we clear the path. We remove obstacles to make their life easy. But adversity is a part of life, and only by facing it can our children build life-coping skills they’ll need down the road.      </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>“<strong>Many parents will go to do anything to protect their kids from even
    mild discomfort, anxiety, or disappointment—’anything less than
    pleasant’</strong>—with the result that when, as adults, they experience the
    normal frustrations of life, they think something must be terribly
    wrong.” - psychiatrist Dr. Paul Bohn  </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>While I find it great that today’s parents are more invested in their children’s lives than previous generations, our involvement can go overboard. ...Unless we’re mindful of that, it’s easy to handicap them by making their lives too easy.</p>
  
  <p>As my favorite parenting philosophy goes: <strong>“Prepare your child for the road, not the road for your child.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see this issue manifested in quite a few ways, and I feel there has to be a line drawn somewhere.</p>

<p>My question is: </p>

<p>Is there any way that I could communicate this to the parents? Plant a seed in their head, at least give them perspective, make them think about it?</p>

<p>Or what else would be a good way for me to deal with this and put closure to it, at least so that I stop worrying about the child. I get very passionate about this, and feel many things should be handled differently, but obviously I am not in a place to have much say.</p>

However, the parent of this child has never liked our child and at that time was trying to get him removed from the childcare.

I know they invite each other over to play etc.</p>

<p>Should I encourage my boy to move onto other friends? How can I stop my son from being pushed out even though he won't realize? My boy will be starting school 2 months before this other boy however they are in the same sports team at the moment. There is a possibility I could get my child moved to another team so they aren't together?</p>

<p>To date I have only encouraged and been friendly as I was always of the understanding that you shouldn't force your kids away from friends. However, when it's the parent of the other child who is doing things that will isolate mine I'm not sure what to do.</p>

"How should I handle a little boy who likes girls' toys?","<p>I have a 5-year-old boy who likes to play with girl stuff. He doesn't like to dress up or anything like that, he just loves to dress up the Barbies, and he will even help me with my clothes by telling me which ones he thinks are ugly and so forth. His dad has been absent from his life most of the time, and I guess this has led him to like more girl toys than boys but I don't know --I'm just a scared mom. He also plays with boys' toys and when we go to shopping he always runs to the boys' section and picks up the clothes he likes, and they are always boys' clothes. </p>

<p>The thing is that I took him to his dad's house to spend a week with his dad, and his dad called me and told me about the situation. I told him I already knew it and that for me it was something normal, that he was a child and kids like different things. His dad told me that he ""wasn't raisin a faggot"" and that he should have our son living with him so he can teach him how to be a man. I won't agree to this because he is my only child. I really don't care what my son will be in the future as I will always have him and he will always be my son.</p>

<p>But my question is: Is it normal that he likes girl toys? And does that means that he will be gay? And I am handling the situation right? What can I do to help him out? Please help me.</p>

"Does extended looping improve student outcomes in elementary school?","<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>I'm a parent of a preschool-aged child in an urban region of the US. He'll be entering kindergarten in a year or two and we have a number of options for primary schools in the area, offering various programs and curricula (e.g., GATE, Waldorf, Montessori).</p>

<p>Some of these programs follow the practice of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(education)"">looping</a>, where students have the same primary instructor from year to year, potentially for as much as the first nine years of their classroom education. I have no direct experience with looping; when I was in elementary school, I attended what I consider to be a more traditional program, with teachers assigned to particular grade levels and students changing classrooms and teachers each year upon moving up a grade.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>I'm not sure how to evaluate looping as a component of the programs available to my son starting in kindergarten. Kids can have better and worse relationships with their teachers—and so can parents. It seems obvious that looping would provide very different experiences, when the student and teacher are together for many years, based on whether these relationships are particularly good or bad.</p>

<p>The potential benefits of an extended positive relationship seem attractive but I had more than one negative experience with a teacher when I was young, where I felt like I just had to survive and cope with the bad relationship until the year or semester ended and we could both move on. Not having the option to do that, short of changing schools (definitely undesirable), seems alarming to me, especially in the first few years of a kid's education.</p>

<p>Looping is particularly emphasized in the Waldorf approach, where students may stay with the same primary instructor for 6 to 12 years. (From what I've read, the latter extreme seems more common in European than in American Waldorf schools.) There's some quantitative research around the effectiveness of Waldorf methods (e.g., examining student creativity<sup>1</sup>, science education<sup>2</sup> or implementation in a public setting<sup>3</sup>) but, while looping is suggested as an area for further research<sup>4</sup>, the papers coming up on a <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=education%20looping"">Google Scholar search for ""education looping""</a> haven't been helpful. Most are not available to me to read and/or focus exclusively on the minimal version of looping, where the term of the student-teacher (and -parent) relationship is extended only to two years total. In our case, there is no real middle option of only looping for two years; either we can choose a traditional program with new teachers every year, or programs with what I'll call ""extended"" looping of six or more years with the same teacher (à la Waldorf).</p>

<p><strong>How are educational outcomes for primary schoolchildren affected by this practice of extended looping?</strong></p>

<p>My spouse and I consider the cost of changing schools outside of the normal transition years between primary and secondary schools to be very high, based on our own experiences as children. This makes where to start school a particularly important choice we're making on behalf of our child, so we need to consider evidence-based implications for any and all areas of development (not purely academics).</p>

"Are these strange communication habits of urban teenagers normal?","<p>Being a teenager now, unlike when I was young, has some differences regarding communication regarding mobile phones / internet.</p>

<p>I have noticed some strange behavior in teenagers (around 15), which I find a bit baffling.</p>

<p>It's a mix of small things, so will list in dot point.</p>

<ul>
<li>Plans for meeting/catching up are often very vague/unknown, right up until the event.</li>
<li>Counterintuitively, contacting others seems to be quite hit-and-miss. When an event is disorganized - suggesting <em>""Why don't you call them to find out whats going on""</em>, often gets some reply like...<br>
<em>""he doesn't check his phone""</em> or <em>""she's lost her phone""</em>.</li>
<li>A related issue, after-school classes, younger staff there may - for example, post on facebook when the stating times for the class change (with very little notice).<br>
<em>Not considerate of people who have to travel a long way, or plan lifts ahead of time!</em>.</li>
<li>Teenagers often don't know each other's home-phone numbers <em>(of course it's increasingly common not to have a land-line)</em>,<br>
nevertheless - if they do, there may be anxiety associated to calling them...<br>
(had calls where they person who called did not feel comfortable to talk so just hung up). Later I was told a friend called but was <em>'too shy'</em> to speak.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, my impression is that many teenagers accept fluid <em>(read haphazard)</em> plans where they don't like to commit to activities and instead choose to <em>""play it by ear""</em>, since this is now an option; further, there are so many forms of communication <em>(phone, text, email, multiple social-media sites)</em>, that ignoring them is accepted too.</p>

<p>I'm told by my teenager that this is ""normal"".</p>

<p>So my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this change in behavior normal/common, have others noticed this?</li>
<li>Is this something that parents should try to prevent/mitigate?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Phone calls are just one way to communicate, and I get that there are all sorts of apps... however the result seems to be that young people <em>(in my anecdotal experience)</em> have problems contacting each other reliably/effectively.</li>
<li>The teenagers otherwise seem fairly well adjusted and outgoing (involved in theater, sports, music).</li>
<li>This seems to be the case for both boys and girls.</li>
<li>Not sure how this question comes across, but this isn't about being a <em>control freak</em>, knowing if someone is/isn't visiting (e.g., should we get extra food, or tidy the the house :), isn't so unreasonable).</li>
</ul>

"Problems with my son's friend","<p>My son's 11 year old (male) friend, whom I will call Mike for the sake of discussion, is loud and rude. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the school year, Mike asked me if I was willing to drive him home occasionally because he was left to walk 4 miles home (alone!) if I didn't drive him on the days his Mom couldn't drive him herself. It felt manipulative, but he lives close to me so driving him occasionally wasn't really a big deal. </p>

<p>I recently fell and hurt my back (herniated disk, torn muscle). My son asked if Mike could come over to our house to play. I was in so much pain, and unable to take pain killers because I had the carpool. I told them both I was in a tremendous amount of pain and just really needed to focus on resting, so, no, coming over was not a great idea at the time. Mike asked, ""come on, why not?"" Again, Mike is a loud kid. I told them I needed quiet time to recover. Mike said, ""what, like the sound waves are really going to hurt your back?"" How rude!</p>

<p>Mike's Mom has yet to ever reciprocate and take the carpool. She didn't even help when I hurt my back. She expects me to drive her son, and even got miffed when my son was absent and Mike needed a ride. Like I was supposed to go get him anyway?</p>

<p>How do I deal with Mike?</p>

<ul>
<li>I don't want to tell my son who he can and can't be friends with.</li>
<li>I don't believe it's my place to correct Mike's behavior.</li>
<li>I just need to know how to deal with a rude 11 year old.</li>

"How to start a new feeding/sleep schedule for a 6 month old?","<p>My 6 month old grandson has no feeding / sleep schedule. He was born 3 weeks early, weighing 5 lbs. My daughter in law, Liz, is breastfeeding. The Dr. told her to feed as often as possible to get his weight up. He weighs now 14 lbs. Healthy, perfect, no problems.  </p>

<p>I think the problem is that he only nurses for a couple of minutes each feeding, so eats whenever he whimpers. A tiny bit a time, every 30 minutes or so, so he never really gets full, never is really hungry enough to eat a whole meal. Even all night long he is up every hour. Mom is exhausted and gets up to feed him every time he stirs. She thinks he still needs to eat every few minutes. At 6 months old.  </p>

<p>I am worried about my son and daughter in law. They are getting no rest.  Still. She has the baby sleeping in her room so she can get to him easliy every hour! She has no idea how to get him to eat more each time, so less frequently. Her Dr. told them to look up ideas in books!?  </p>

"How to help our 3-year-old deal with continuously missing clothes and bad behavior from another kid in the nursery?","<p>My 3-year-old daughter has been going to nursery for a year now. We live in Denmark.</p>

<p>Her clothes began disappearing in the day care (first a dress, then a jacket). And she was saying the name of one of the kids. This kid also behaves very weird towards my daughter. I observed it while leaving my daughter in the morning. Even I am 20 cm away from my daughter she was trying to pinch her. My wife told me the same. </p>

<p>Like 3 weeks ago our shoes disappeared. My daughter said it is the same kid again. We asked some of the teachers to ask this kid if she knows anything, but for privacy reasons the teachers didn't talk with the kid. They looked around the nursery for 1 week and finally today we asked another teacher who talked with the kid. And it turns out our shoes were in her home confirmed by her mother. I suspect that other missing stuff is also in their place.   </p>

<p>What I worry about is that my daughter is having a hard time in the nursery. Today, the same kid also poured sand from a big box all over her hair. Even she is 3 since she is multilingual (my wife and I are from different countries and we are living in another country) and can't speak yet, I am worried that makes her an easy target since she can't explain it to her teachers yet. What I am trying to teach my daughter is to say ""stop"" loudly. And if it still goes on, I want her to tell her teachers. </p>

<p>Do you have any suggestions about how I can be sure my daughter is not having some hard time in nursery? Or and any suggestion I how to ask for other missing clothes? Should I speak with teachers specifically about this particular child and their relation with my daughter?</p>

<p>What are some age-appropriate ways to keep her busy, encourage exploration, and foster development?</p>

<p>Her memory is incredibly good. In addition, she knows the lyrics to several Queen songs and several Beatles songs, a Kansas song...those are the ones I can think of; for certain musicals (like Les Miserables or Hamilton), she can recognize when a song is from that musical, even if she isn't familiar with or hasn't heard the song. When listening to <em>What's This?</em> from Nightmare Before Christmas, she recognized it as the same voice as <em>Jack's Lament</em>; these are two entirely different musical styles and tempos. She's also capable of making a non-squeaking sound on an alto saxophone (with plenty of squeaking sounds as well, mind you) and she can buzz her lips to play a trombone.</p>

<p>These are just the things that I can think of off the top of my head.</p>

"Ego-centric kid or control-freaked mum?","<p>Apparently, I'm doing something wrong or I don't know how to connect with my child properly... </p>

<p>I have a lovely 5,5 years old daughter, who is an absolutely cute and non-problematic girl at a kindergarten, with my boyfriend, with my parents, but not with me. 
As soon as I appear, she becomes very whiny, ego-centric and defiant. She wants something, she wants it now, and she keeps repeating it constantly. She can't accept that something is not like SHE wants it to be. No matter what form we choose to deliver our decision, doesn't accept it. </p>

<p>When I ask her to do something or remind her that soon it's time to do something, she refuses. 
I have tried everything:</p>

<ul>
<li>listening and mirroring her feelings -> she just keeps saying ""but I want this"" or refuses to do what she's asked (""No, I won't clean my toys)</li>
<li>removing the privileges and explaining why they are removed and how she can get them back -> she calms down, does what she is asked, promises not to do so and after some time misbehaves again</li>
<li>give her warnings and timeout -> she throws a tantrum, hits the door, yells, then does the same as in 'removing the privileges' point</li>
<li>spanking -> I guess, no additional commentary on the efficiency of this method is needed</li>
<li>asking how she would feel if I behaved the same way -> she says she wouldn't like it and it's not good to behave that way but still does it after some time passes</li>
<li>giving her choices -> she simply chooses what is not listed, e.g. I ask ""will you clean your toys before lunch or after?"" and the answer is ""I won't clean them, I don't want to"". And if I say that such an answer wasn't among the offered options, she will respond something like ""But I don't want to do it anyway"". </li>
<li>explaining the consequences in various situations, even the consequences of her own choices (and letting those consequences become real) -> no effect whatsoever</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a feeling that she simply doesn't listen to me and literally doesn't hear me (though her hearing is ok, because unwrapping the candy or chips pack gets her attention even from another room). If I ask her what did I just say, she can't answer to me, she stares silently or says she doesn't remember or says something completely different. </p>

<p>She also likes to be in control of everything, when we are doing something together and I try to correct her even in a very mild manner or simply say that this should be done differently, she acts very emotionally and wants that we do it her way. Same goes with role-playing or any games that have certain rules, she doesn't want to follow those rules.</p>

<p>We are not able to go out with her anywhere, because every time it's a horrible experience for everyone - she doesn't listen, she keeps repeating what she wants and it drives me nuts. 
I am seriously thinking if I need to be checked, because I get very angry with this behavior. Sometimes I even don't want to come home from work, it feels like battlefield for simple routine things like eating, cleaning her room, going out, etc. </p>

<p>I understand that I am a control freak myself and I have worked on that to be softer with her and not to demand so much, to lower my expectations but is it too much to expect if I say ""Please walk slower, you're running and the dog gets too aroused"" or ""I can't play with you now, I'm busy, we'll play when I finish"" and want her to understand that I really mean it and I need this behavior at this particular moment? </p>

"When to transition to letting the baby fall asleep on its own? Is my baby ready for sleep training?","<p>Our daughter is 2 months old. As of right now, we have a pretty well working routine of putting the baby to sleep. Bath, lights out, long feeding, then falling asleep on our hands, then falling asleep on us when we sit/lay, then being put to bed. It all takes about 2 hours, which is acceptable.</p>

<p>The problem is that this routine involves a lot - about ~20 minutes - of carrying and another 20 minutes laying on us falling into deep sleep. It will become more difficult and tiresome as the baby grows, so we would like to change the routine and eliminate those two parts.</p>

<p><strong>When should we start trying to lull her to sleep in her bed?</strong> Is it already time to start sleep training? On one hand, we would like to start it as soon as possible, but on the other - the current routine is working well and we wouldn't like to rid ourselves of a few hours of sleep per day.</p>

<p>Up till now, she has managed to fall asleep on her own only three times - two of them in the last week. Is it some kind of hint that we should start trying to let her fall asleep on her own?</p>

<p>I live in Europe, but my wife has Russian/Asian roots and and tends to eat somewhat spicier foods. I have found, that atm she likes soups and oven cooked foods.</p>

<p>I have guidelines like :</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use any citrus *(orange, mandarin, lemon) - she is hyper allergic</li>
<li>Do not use any nuts - she is hyper allergic to some </li>
<li>Do not use fatty, fried, and greasy foods - she avoids them </li>
<li>Do not use any unpasteurized milk products - they may cause Listeria infection</li>
<li>Do not use fish -

"How to break the cycle of lies?","<p>My six year-old son has recently started lying almost constantly.  This is somewhat puzzling to us, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>He almost <em>never</em> gets away with it.  Fortunately for us, he isn't very good at it yet, but he is getting better.</li>
<li>It causes him to lose the activity or object he was lying to obtain, and then some.  This is the consequence we use most often, because it is the closest to the natural consequence.  For example, if he lies about being done eating, so he can go play, the consequence is not only does he not get to play now, he has to wait longer to play than it would have taken him just to finish eating.</li>
<li>He lies even when it hurts his case.  For example, he will lie to try to get a cookie, in situations where he could have gotten one just for asking.</li>
<li>His untrustworthiness causes us to check up on him more, which ironically makes it harder for him to get away with stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's gotten to the point where he is constantly lying to try to stay out of trouble, but the biggest reason he's getting in trouble is because of the lying.  <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/a/3925/644"">My answer to this related question</a> isn't working anymore, partially because he tells the truth so infrequently now that there are no opportunities to reward him for it, and partially because he has started taking advantage of the rare leniency to try getting away with even more.  </p>

<p>My question is different from <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/3907/644"">What are appropriate methods for disciplining a primary schooler for lying?</a> because typical rewards and consequences both seem to be setting up a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">perverse incentive</a> in his case.

"How to resolve blocked milk ducts after weaning","<p>Our 1-year-old has been weaned off breast milk for a little over a week now, which was completely her doing. My wife has been dealing with the engorgement since then, which she says has subsided. However she noticed a hard lump in her breast. We think it's a blocked milk duct and not mastitis. From reading about mastitis, she thinks it should be much more painful, and she isn't presenting with a fever or chills or anything like that.</p>

<p>Most of the treatment for blocked ducts or mastitis involves making sure you continue to breastfeed in order to drain. Of course, our problem is our daughter is weaned. My wife doesn't want to express her milk, as this will set her back as far as stopping milk production... we think.</p>

"How can I tell if my toddler is truly gifted or just bright?","<p>I'm the father of a 2 years and 4 months old daughter. I can't understand if she's gifted or just very bright. We live in Italy, <strong>where giftedness is not recognized by law and there are no special programs for gifted people</strong>. I'm gifted myself and going through school was extremely painful for me. My parents never realized that I was gifted therefore they never took action or did something to help me. </p>

<p>I never failed anything in school but I was always extremely bored and sometimes I skipped entire months and stayed at home instead. <strong>This was really painful for me, and I'm afraid that my daughter might experience the same thing.</strong>
She can do a lot of things, but a the same time we taught her all of that and we spend a lot of time with her just playing, talking, reading or teaching something.</p>

<ul>
<li>She can read about 100 words and the amount of words she's learning grows at an exponential rate (We actually measure this).</li>
<li>She can count up to 10 both in Italian and English and she can do simple arithmetics.</li>
<li>She can understand both Italian and English with ease, she only has troubles with abstract things like the idea of space, but after a little while she even got that.</li>
<li>She's pretty good with puzzles and problem solving in general. She can type words with a computer and use a mouse with some patience.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I understand that all of this stuff is what a gifted kid can do BUT, and I can't stress this enough, we spend A LOT of time with her.</strong> I don't get if she's just very good at learning (and she usually enjoys that) or if there's some kind of internal process that actually gives her additional insights on the world. Here in Italy we have no possibility to test her, I'm trying to create some metrics to understand that, but I feel like I'm a little biased (I feel that she's not gifted). My issue is that being gifted is not necessarily different from having a problem. Gifted kids need a specific treatment and because of the lack of support here in Italy it is crucial to me to understand that. I'm not worried about her being successful or anything else, that is not the reason why I need to understand this! So, if she's bright I'm ok, if she's gifted I need to find a way to help her. </p>

<p><strong>What can I do to better understand the situation?</strong> How can I help her if she's gifted for real?</p>

"Grandparents want our three year old daughter to throw tantrums like her cousin did","<p>When my nephew was a toddler/pre-schooler, he had major separation anxiety issues and tantrums. Specifically, whenever his grandparents or we (his aunt and uncle) visited him, he'd never let us leave in peace. He'd cry, follow us out of the house, throw tantrums - the entire production. It'd always delay our plans by half hour to one hour. His parents never objected to this behaviour, in fact, I think they even supported it because they found it adorable and/or amusing.</p>

<p>Around 4 years later, we have a 3 year old daughter. She loves it when her extended family comes over, and has a lot of fun with them. But doesn't throw a tantrum when its time to leave. (I think we've raised a sensible and well balanced child) She sometimes asks once or twice if they (or we) could stay for a little while more, and if we say they (or we) can't, she understands.</p>

<p>The grandparents though, seem to misinterpret this as lack of attachment. They told my daughter that when her cousin was her age, he loved them so much, he'd never let them go so easily, that he'd really miss them if they went away, and that he'd often ask for them in the night if he wasn't able to sleep. (That, according to me, was just lack of discipline and sleep training!) I assured them later that she misses them just as much, but just understands that they have to leave. I don't know if I convinced them, but that's the least of my concerns.</p>

<p>When our daughter spoke to us after they left, we found out that they've said things along these lines a couple times before too. She feels really hurt that they think she doesn't love them as much as her cousin.  A tearful ""Does [bob] love them more, daddy?"" broke my heart. I told her everyone loves everyone else the same amount, but have different ways of showing it. I thought that was that, but she seems to have learnt the lesson that the way her cousin showed his love was better. And she actually did cry a lot and told her grandparents not to leave the next time they visited! This has never happened, I've never had more than a pouty face, and nothing I couldn't fix with some explanation and some distraction. But this time she didn't stop crying till the grandparents agreed to stay for 1 more hour.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss now, how do I handle this new development? I don't want to tell her that its her cousin's and his parent's behaviour which was wrong until I absolutely have to. I don't want her to ""learn"" separation anxiety, nor get her way with her grandparents by crying. I could convince them not to stay back just because she's crying, but would that confuse her more? Would she feel that she can't win their favour no matter what she does?</p>

<p>She goes to my mom and dad if I yell at her or if I say ""No."" Then I get in trouble. But that's not the point. </p>

"My dad still yells at me as an adult and I don't know how to react because he's my dad","<p>My dad has always been a ""mad person"". Recently I was talking with my mom and she said a large reason she divorced with him was because he was always mad. </p>

<p>Now, the following is a onetime example but similar things keep happening and I don't know how to get it to stop. Also, some details I consider irrelevant, but others may not so I'll try to give as much info as possible.</p>

<p>My dad had offered to do me a favor and give me a ride somewhere. We met at his place. While at his place I had some work related notes I had to read. Now, I thought it was pretty obvious I needed to focus but he kept talking to me and distracting me and I snapped ""be quiet!"" (I may have said it in a loud voice but I didn't yell at him). He started yelling his head off at me for the next 15 minutes. He was saying things like ""I'm allowed to speak! This is my house and I make the rules!"" He also acts threatening when he's yelling and is very animated.</p>

<p>One thing I don't get is what my dad want? At my job I deal with lots of angry people, but they're angry because they're not getting something they want. I realize it was rude for me to say be quiet, but him yelling for a long time is ridiculous. In fact, I'm sure if he conducts himself at work the same way he would get fired (and to my knowledge he has never been fired).</p>

<p>I don't know what to do about it. At work if a colleague yells at me I would wait for them to calm down and tell them yelling doesn't help the problem. If a stranger yelled at me I'd ignore them. If a friend yelled at me, we wouldn't be friends if it happened as frequently as it does with my dad.</p>

<p>He seems to always do this when he has an advantage over me, like how he offered to give me a ride and I was already at his place. I keep forgetting not to trust him. I made my self a note on Google Calendar not to trust my dad with help and I have it set to remind me each day, but this kind of gives me a bad gut feeling.</p>

<p>I admit he's good at manipulating me. For example his text message said ""I have lunch for you here. How about I come pick you up in 10 minutes?""</p>

<p>Also, I've considered it might be a mental illness on his part. But I sometimes don't see what difference this makes. I used to work for a company where someone got away with breaking all the rules and being a jerk because he was diagnosed with alcoholism. In the same way, if my dad has anger management I can't just decide not to be bothered by him yelling at me.</p>

<p>EDIT: he also gets mad and yells at other people (including strangers and family) but he seems to do it the most to me. </p>

We are all Finnish, and the adults speak good English, some Swedish and a smattering of other languages; we do intend to learn as much as Danish as we can, also. This is a short academic job, so it is possible we will continue in Finland, Denmark, or some other country after this. (Germany and Japan seem probable countries, for example.)</p>

<p>It is likely that daycare in Danish, English and maybe even Finnish are available. I might find colleagues of various nationalities with children of roughly the same age, or maybe not.</p>

<p>Our first priority, language-wise, is for the child to speak fluent Finnish. Our second priority is for they to have children to play with. Our third priority is for them to learn an additional language or two, preferably as well as possible.</p>

<p>The question <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/4965/"">Moving to a foreign country with a 2.5 years old child</a> addresses a longer stay (I guess) and involves only two languages.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Which language should we speak at home and with each other? I'm guessing Finnish, so that she will master it.</li>
<li>What should be the language of the daycare?</li>

"How to make sure my 7-year-old daughter doesn't go outside alone, without scaring her or impacting her confidence?","<p>I have a 7-year-old daughter who sometimes likes to go out without me or her mom. Last week we had an incident that she went out of the school premises and got herself in trouble. In my opinion, she is not old enough to be on her own <strong>yet</strong>. She doesn't know about the dangers of the world out there. </p>

<p>A few yeas ago, I saw the movie <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380510/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Lovely Bones</a> that greatly touched me. I was wondering if it is a right thing to have her watch this film? My concern is that the damage might be greater than the benefit. Do you have other suggestions to teach her to stay with us, e. g. at the mall, that do not scare her or impact her confidence? </p>

"Putting a toddler to sleep and have him continue to sleep","<p>We have a 2 year old son.  He's wonderful and we love him very much.  There are two problems that we have...</p>

<p>1 - I am his father.  I have very rarely put him to sleep by myself.  I'd like to help my wife by putting him to bed.  The thing is, whenever I try, he throws a tantrum and calls for mom.  How can I learn to better put him to sleep and have him be OK with it and fall asleep?</p>

<p>2 - At least 3 to 5 times a night, he wakes up in the middle of the night and goes to my wife to nurse.  This disturbs our sleep and wears my wife out.  How can we put him to sleep (preferably I would do it half the time) and have him continue to sleep?</p>

<p>Honestly, if we were to fall asleep and wake up just once to snuggle, that wouldn't be so bad (as long as we can put him back into his bed and he can continue to sleep there.)</p>

"How do you respond to your pre-schooler when they tell you that you're on Santa's Naughty List?","<p>My three-year-old son really enjoyed Christmas.</p>

<p>My son is still talking about how Santa came to our house to fill our stockings <strong>two</strong> times (my wife put treats in one night, and I put some in two days later), and loves to tell everyone about all the presents he got.</p>

<p>We haven't really pushed the whole ""Santa only gives presents to good girls and boys"" thing (I'm not a fan of using threats of withholding rewards as a motivation).  However, he's watched a lot of Christmas movies, and definitely knows the theme.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this has led to him telling his mother or I that we're ""on Santa's Naughty List, and aren't going to get any presents"", usually when we're enforcing common rules that he has broken (e.g. ""don't leave the dinner table until everyone has eaten"").</p>

<p>I'm mostly concerned with explaining that enforcing the rules isn't ""naughty"", but I'm not certain that, at three, he's developmentally ready to really understand this.  Is he?
What is the best way to respond to this?</p>

<p>I'm reading the <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7489.The_Optimistic_Child"" rel=""noreferrer"">Optimistic Child</a>, which stresses to explain failure as temporary and caused by circumstances (i.e. I failed this test because I did not practice) and not as some personal trait (i.e. I failed because I'm stupid). </p>

We were reading a story the other day where one person loses a competition and gets nasty, he noted that he is also a sore loser. I quickly replied that he never behaved as nasty as the person in the story.</p>

"How to encourage our 11 month old to walk alone?","<p>Since about 3 month, our little one can walk and stand, when both her hands are being held or she can hold onto something. As soon as we retract our hands and she realizes it, she will sit down.</p>

<p>Since about 1.5 months now, she decided that she can nicely hop on her knees. So when she needs to use her hands, she does not crawl but ""walk"" or hop on her knees. She also does that if she is in an especially good mood.</p>

<p>No ""accidents"" happened to her while walking with help and also learning to stand by herself went without anything more than the usual(?) minor drops. In general shes a brave one and likes to explore new things and areas - in those cases even crawling/rushing away from the parents. But shes very clingy in areas she already knows (e.g. she plays by herself on the floor sitting next to me, if i get up and sit onto the couch she will shortly after stand next to me). She still sleeps with us in the room and usually after waking up after 8h sleep around 4 o'clock in the morning is allowed to sleep another 2-3h with us in the big bed.</p>

<p>Did we -somehow- fail in giving her enough self-confidence? Failed to give her the proper incentive? Maybe shes just lazy and we skip her and try our luck with a new one (<em>joking</em>)? What might be our mistake?</p>

"How to stop our 2-year-old's bedtime tantrums and make her sleep through the night?","<p>Our daughter is approaching 2 and has consistently had issues with bedtime.</p>

<p>At the mention of bedtime, she will regularly start crying (but still follows me upstairs to bed). In general, one of us takes her upstairs at 7:30 pm, changes her into pajamas, turns off the lights, and turns on her nightlight. Our daughter usually helps with all of these behaviors. We then sing some songs in the dark and I pray that she's fallen asleep.</p>

<p>This always seems to be crap shoot. Either she's conked out and fallen asleep, in which case I can put her down and leave; the whole process taking maybe 30 minutes (out at 8:00 pm). Or she's not asleep at all, and the suggestion of leaving causes her to throw a tantrum that one of us has to mitigate or we have to endure for something in the range of 2 hours plus (she won't fall asleep until 10:00 or later).</p>

<p>If we let her do as she pleases, she would play around downstairs until about 10 pm and then fall asleep on the floor. This isn't acceptable to us for a litany of reasons.</p>

<p>Furthermore, her nighttime sleep pattern is not consistent. She's often prone to waking up at any hour of the night between 1:00 am and 7:00 am.</p>

<p>Is there something we should be doing to break these tantrums? Is there anything we can be doing different to keep her sleeping through the night?</p>

"Bringing babies to bar?","<p>Full disclosure: I'm not a parent.</p>

I don't mean a small toddler, I mean a <em>infant</em>. He looked like he was at most three or four months old.</p>

"Is a swim spa safe for a 5-year-old?","<p>My 5-year-old daughter loves to swim. She’s like a fish and always gets in the water whenever we give her the opportunity. We want to nurture her love of swimming wherever possible as it’s a great way to exercise.</p>

<p>This is where the problems start. We live very far away from the nearest public pool (over 3 hours drive). Our schedules allow us to take her there once or twice a month, but as you can imagine it takes up the entire day. For her the 6 hour round trip is no problem (she is excited on the way there and sleeps on the way back), but for us it’s a little less enjoyable.</p>

<p>We have looked into open water (natural) swimming options near us and to be honest there is nothing suitable at all. There’s a river that adults swim in, but it's fast flowing and far too dangerous for a child learning to swim.</p>

<p>We have looked into the possibility of getting a swimming pool in our home, but we just don’t have the space. It would be big enough for her to swim in for a while, but it would be unusable for me and my partner. We love our little girl, but paying $5,000 to $10,000 for a pool we can’t really use isn’t really an option for us.</p>

<p>A friend of ours suggested a swim spa as a possible alternative. They seem to be a compact way to allow us and her to swim in our back yard. However, I know nothing about them. I can’t even find how much they cost accurately (there are no price lists online for any swim spa manufacturer and the only pricing information I have found ranges all the way from $8,000 to $60,000).</p>

<p>Even the lower end of that price bracket isn’t a small investment for us, so we want to make sure it’s going to be suitable for our daughter before we actually even consider the prospect. </p>

<p><strong>Are swim spas safe for young kids?</strong> </p>

<p>Obviously me or my partner will be closely supervising but I’m a little bit worried about accidents. Have any of you heard of a young child (5 / 6 years old) swimming in a swim spa? Are the water jets too powerful for them or can they be turned down really low?</p>

<p>The various swim spa manufacturers websites all say that they are totally safe and kids love them, but they don't give any ages (and they would say that wouldn't they).</p>

"When to start looking for a new nanny if our 11-month-old does not accept her?","<p>We have an 11-month-old son which so far has stayed during the day with either us, the parents, or his grandparents. He is our first child and we basically cared for his every little need up to the point where he might seem spoiled. In reward he is very happy and laughs a lot and he is very playful.</p>

<p>He is not sleep trained, he is still breastfed plus solids, but for naps we kind of have to rock him a bit. At night he goes to sleep on his own but still wakes up frequently. He is very curious and wants to see and touch everything in the room and he is full of energy.</p>

<p>We hired a nanny to take care of him while we are at work and we have 3 weeks of overlap when one parent is at home with the nanny and the baby, hoping to make the transition smoother.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the baby does not seem to accept her. Rarely he plays with her but cries a lot and wants for the parent to pick him up. If we leave him alone with the nanny he starts crying and he stops only when a parent picks him up. She was able to put him to sleep once because he was really tired but today he wouldn’t even stay with her. He refuses to eat from her also. It’s true that she is not extremely entertaining for the baby.</p>

"What to do about a 4 year old abusing animals?","<p><em>I am extremely distraught, so please forgive my rambling and errors. Edits are welcome.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday, before I got home, my wife called to tell me that she found our son choking our kitten that we've had for about 3 months now. The cat seemed to be almost passed out, but recovered after being let go (although it was coughing continually for some time after).</p>

<p>This is the second time something like this has happened, but neither of us witnessed the first time, we only heard the cat yelping, and when we rushed to see what was happening, our son claimed that he was choking the cat. We made it very clear that the cat could die and that if this ever happened again, we would have to give the cat away to keep him safe.</p>

<p>There is already a similar-sounding question that was answered <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/29739/4-year-old-unconcerned-about-pending-death-of-pet"">here</a>, but there are several reasons I think that the top voted and accepted answer does not apply to my case:</p>

<p>It quotes Child Bereavement UK, saying children 2 to 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often struggle with abstract concepts like ‘forever’ and find it
  difficult to grasp that death is permanent. Their limited
  understanding may lead to an apparent lack of reaction when told about
  a death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not at all plausible, given that my son's little brother passed away shortly before his due date because of medical complications. He only got to see his little brother once at the hospital. He still remembers this event and talks about it occasionally. He completely understands that his brother's death is permanent, and does not expect him to come back.</p>

<p>Secondly, in the past year, both my grandmother and uncle have passed away. It is the same with both of them. He understands perfectly well what death means in these cases, so why wouldn't he understand death in the case of an animal?</p>

<p>Thirdly, his mental development is extremely advanced for his age. His vocabulary, understanding of the internals of mechanical objects, and even of social norms is far beyond his age. We receive comments from other parents about this routinely.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I reject the idea that he doesn't know what he's doing. He said that he did it because he was mad, but according to my wife, <s>he didn't seem mad about anything leading up to the incident, or even afterward</s>. EDIT: Either I misunderstood the first time, or my wife changed her story, but he may have been angry before the incident due to my wife yelling at him to stop chasing the cat around the house.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be anywhere near as upset as I am without this additional piece of context: after this incident with our son yesterday, my wife admitted that she herself killed a cat previously (while we were already married) and lied about it, telling me that it had fallen asleep in the open washing machine, and that she turned it on not knowing it was inside. In reality, she choked it to death with her foot against the floor, and covered it up before I got home.</p>

<p>She claims that she doesn't know why she did it, but that she had an irrational hatred for the cat at that moment, and has felt extreme guilt about what happened. This occurred 6 years ago (2 years before either of our sons were born). My wife has no criminal record, nor have I ever experienced her being violent towards people or animals, so this is a complete shock to me.</p>

<p>Her admission only came about because she fears our son has somehow inherited something from her that has caused this terrible behavior.</p>

<p>My own marriage problems (which I didn't think I had only a day ago) are obviously outside the scope of this question, but what should I do in the near term about my son?</p>

"How to wean a parent from co-sleeping?","<p>We have been co-sleeping since my daughter was a newborn until last month when we finally converted a small room to be her room. She is 32 months old. She has her own Twin bed now. The problem is: I can't sleep without being next to her. I have always been a terrible sleeper - taking an hour or two laying there to fall asleep. When we had the baby, I couldn't sleep when we put her in the crib because I was paranoid not hearing her breathe even though she was in the same room. So we co-slept and my mind was at ease.</p>

<p>As a result I have become an incredibly light sleeper. I was never a deep sleeper to start but because of co-sleeping, the tiniest movements or sounds could wake me. Now when I try to sleep in the next room, I feel like I am just waiting for her to call me in the middle of the night and I go and sleep with her. </p>

I think she figured out that if she does this, a punishment if any gets thrown away and she gets coddled by a grandparent. </p>

<p>Is it too young to have her try to handle her own social situations? These are situations with her younger brother who is 2 years old and her cousin (my daughter) 2.75 years old and at home. So I figure this is good practice for the playground? She does not go to day-care/school yet. When she asks me for help, I tell her that she and the other kid need to figure out a solution together (not in those exact words). Sometimes they do come up with a solution. If she doesn't get the compromise she wants, she gets another adult to help. I am in the same room to hear what they come up with but not obviously observing just listening in.</p>

<li>Should I ease up and just intervene when she asks me to because of her age? </li>

<p>Last week, he said he hated living in ""the city"" and had to leave. I was blindsided. Now my son has basically lost two daddies. </p>

<p>My son is smart and articulate. I don't need to talk to him about his bio dad since he never knew him, but how am I to approach him about the daddy he knows now that he's gone? Right now, I'm pretty sure he thinks he's just at work. He talks about him but hasn't asked where he is yet. He lives with me, my mom, his adult sister, including our next door neighbor, and numerous family members that visit. So he has lots of love around. No abuse. Normal, for us, family life. </p>

<p>What to do? How to tell him?</p>

"Is my pediatrician missing something about my 3 month old's gas pain?","<p>My 3 month old has cried out at between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m. for hours in gas pain almost every night for the past 6 weeks or so.  There have been 2 or 3 nights in this time where she did not have an issue.  She usually nurses right before bedtime around 6:45 p.m., between 12 and 2 a.m. (depending on how she sleeps), and then again sometime during the gassy episodes at around 5 a.m.  The nights when she has not had pain have usually happened because she had an unusually good first stretch of sleep and did not nurse until after 3:30 a.m.  I know it is gas pain because she is scrunching her legs up and crying very shrilly.  Unfortunately feeding her at 5 does not usually help to release gas or a bowel movement.  It does sometimes put her in a deep enough sleep that she doesn't notice the pain.  To help soothe her I usually give her a pacifier to suck on and put a gently warmed rice sock on her tummy.  I'm loathe to try more invasive things because she's usually half asleep crying.  However my spouse and I are getting exhausted from the 4 a.m. morning and I can't imagine baby is getting good quality sleep either!</p>

<p>I've talked to either a nurse or doctor at my pediatrician's several times describing the fact that the episodes can last up to 2 hours, basically until Baby's usual wake-up and feeding (when she often does release gas and a bowel movement because she's finally wide awake - during the day she rarely has gassy episodes and usually about 3 dirty diapers, all loose to very loose).  All I ever get is ""that's normal for her age.""  One nurse did advise the rice sock, and it does seem to help her feel better.</p>

<p>I've seen online all the suggestions for Mom to avoid dairy or ""gassy"" foods, but I'm loathe to complicate life with an infant further without real medical cause and I don't know of any doctor who routinely advises a breastfeeding mother to avoid certain foods unless an allergy really is suspected.  My baby doesn't spit up much that we can see but does seem to occasionally spit up and then swallow it back down.  She's pretty cheerful, though, so I don't suspect reflux.  It's just this night time episode when she's been lying still for hours after a feeding, hits light sleep, and then notices the pain.</p>

<p>I've heard that 4 months is the magic time when the usual gas pain will go away.  I've been planning on gritting my teeth about this whole issue until my baby's 4 month check-up and bringing it up yet again if it's still happening.  What should I say when I do, or should I try calling in yet again with other information?  Could the pediatrician be missing something?</p>

"Is there an effective method for cleaning butts?","<p>When bathing a child (particularly a baby under or around 1 year old, who can not stand on their own yet) is there an effective way to clean all of their body parts that are usually submerged under water? What I mean by this, is that regardless of the type of bathtub you use (or sink), the bottom parts of their body (their butt, legs and privates) will be submerged under water. This makes them complicated to clean. You can try lifting them up out of the water to clean those parts, and all around them, but this is difficult to do on your own, and if the child squirms you are at risk of dropping them in the water face first. You can also hold them against you, but then you have to be ready to get soaked yourself. You can simply resort to leaving them where they are, but then you are just wiping them with a wet rag (all of the soap gets diluted once the rag goes in the water) and plus its still difficult to get into all the rolls/cracks/crevices this way. When they are an infant its a little bit easier, since they move less, and you can put them on the slanted portion of the bath, but the difficulty still holds there too.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

"What is the role of parents in conflicts between adult siblings?","<p>Trying to keep this short, the main question is really in the title..</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My sister and I have a conflict which began about eight months ago, and I am currently not talking to her. We're both in our 20's, financially independent and have our own apartments away from home.</p>

<p>I don't have a great relationship with my parents at the moment. On several occasions my parents have expressed support for her on this issue and ... not-support for me. (For what it's worth, I feel that most of the disapproval comes from incomplete information on their side and the fact that, unlike my sister, I no longer follow their religion - not because my choices are objectively wrong.)</p>

<p>Recently there was an attempt at a family get-together and both my sister and I cancelled (independently of each other, but at least on my end as a result of this conflict). When I told my mother she gave me a lecture. She's told me several times I need to talk to my sister and ""figure it out"". (I tried, it didn't end well, which is why I'm not talking to her now.)</p>

<p><strong>Main question</strong></p>

<p>As a kid, it seems reasonable to bring your parents in as mediators. <em>""Mooom, she's being mean!""</em> and then mom says who's right and makes you apologize and make up.</p>

<p>As an adult, I've avoided the subject with them. It seems gossipy at best. For instance I wouldn't involve a mutual friend, because I'm sure it would make them uncomfortable and it's not fair to throw them in the middle of it. So why would I do that to my parents! In contrast, from what my mother has told me, my sister confides in her and has talked to her about her side of this conflict.</p>

<p>So my question is what is a parent's role in sibling conflicts, when the siblings are independent adults? What's appropriate to talk to them about? How do I deal with my sibling telling them all about their side of it?</p>

"Can feeding bottles harm our infant?","<p>Here in south India, most of PDs are not suggesting the parents to take feeding bottles for their infants; the main reason is that feeding bottles are made up of plastics.</p>

<p>Though we affirmed that we’re using only <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BPA</a> free bottles, the PDs are not happy; they suggest to use only ‘paladai-or-sangu’ to give milk or medicines.</p>

<p>Herewith, I’ve attached the photograph of paladai for reference <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gpz6D.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gpz6D.jpg"" alt=""paladai-or-sangu-for-babies""></a></p>

<p>– it is usually made up of aluminium or silver.</p>

<p>As far as I know, our elders used this mainly because it is bacteria-free, non-toxic, boosts immunity and cools the body - mainly, it will retain and restore the freshness of water and liquids.</p>

<p>My son was okay (not all the time), when we gave him medicines using this paladai, however it is really, really tricky and hard to give formula milk using this – he is taking formula milk from 2 months old and now he is 4 months old.</p>

<p>I even sterilize my son’s feeding bottles after every feeding - sterilize the bottles with running water and hot boiling water; can someone advice what is really harmful about using feeding bottles? </p>

<p>What type of feeding bottles can we use then? As confirmed, we’re using only BPA free bottles – not tried with Glass bottles yet.</p>

"How should I address daycare reports of misbehaving 4.5-year-old?","<p>Our 4.5-year-old has been in daycare since three months, and at the same daycare for nearly four years. His behavior at daycare has generally been a little up and down, mostly good days with some bad days (as reported by his teachers). The usual toddler stuff; hitting, pushing, name calling (he was never much of a biter).</p>

<p>Lately, he's been in a class with 4 or 5 other rambunctious boys and we frequently hear of him (and them) getting into ""trouble"". My impression is this consists of a lot of roughhousing and play fighting that gets out of hand, some biting (seems to be all of them at one time or another). My understanding is at least one of the boys may have behavioral problems. The daycare doesn't do anything to discipline, no time outs for example.</p>

<p>So pretty much every day for the past month plus, whenever we pick up our son, we hear that he's had a bad day; i. e. hit his friends, wouldn't follow directions, running around at nap time. What are we supposed to do at home to address this? Usually, he has 'bad mornings' and does well at lunch and after nap. So by the time we get him, the bad behavior is ancient history. We haven't been asked to address it, seems like the reports are a mix of my wife or I asking, and them volunteering if it was a particularly bad day. I personally get the sense they expect us to do something because one of the teachers was asking us if we did timeouts at home.</p>

<p>We've talked to him about staying away from kids who get him trouble, we've talked to him about being kind, patient, and listening to his teachers, not hitting or kicking, etc. We've been talking to him about these things since he was two actually. We do timeouts at home which are pretty effective with him, one minute per year, one warning then timeout. At home his behavior is fine 95% of the time. He has a younger sister he gets along with well for the most part.</p>

<p>About the daycare, I will say they have (what seems to me) to be fairly high turn over. His most recent teacher was let go for not being able to manage his class. Now his class has a variety of teachers from day to day, the same four or five women. My expectation is that they manage this stuff, separate these boys if they can't get along. The last thing I want to do is be down on my kid in the evening for stuff that happens during the day. So how should we handle this at home?</p>

"Between parents and marijuana smoking sister","<p>I live in the UK with my sister, who has been smoking marijuana for about a year now. I have known for a large part of that time. She smokes relatively often, however not enough that it's a major risk (health or legal).</p>

<p>Now the dilemma begins. A few months ago, my parents found out through friends of theirs. They reacted reasonably and tried to discourage my sister from smoking. They asked me if I had known and I said yes, but I did not think ratting out my sister would have been the right thing to do.</p>

<p>A week or two later, my sister starts smoking again. I'm very confident that if my parents try to make her stop again, it will only result in her continuing and hiding it more. It's also likely (for emotional and cultural reasons), that they will never accept her smoking (any amount) and could never acknowledge that she does to their friends or relatives. Currently, they don't know that she has started again. Since my sister now knows I know, she doesn't even try to hide it from me any more.</p>

<p>I don't want to lose my sisters trust by ratting her out to my parents. I don't want to have my parents worry about her smoking, while I know she does. To be brutally honest and selfish, the daily stress of this situation on me is also a major factor. What ways out are there? What are the moral and emotional consequences for everyone involved?</p>

"Dad makes little effort to see his daughter - to what degree should I encourage contact?","<p>I have a three year old with my ex. When we separated he moved back in with his mom ( he didn't have a job, bad credit, etc... I know, I was an idiot ). These issues were a big part of our separation. </p>

<p>So, he now says he cannot bring the child to his moms' because she ""won't let him"". He sometimes pays a small amount of child support from his newly acquired part time job. This is the other reason he is unable to see her. Because he's working. Most parents work, I don't really see this as a valid reason.</p>

<p>Since his mother wont allow her there, he says he can only see his daughter by coming to our home. We tried this a few times, but it always resulted in him putting the moves on me and basically just causing more tension. So I said he would no longer be able to stay here to see her. If he wanted to see her, he could pick her up and take her with him.</p>

<p>So now he just doesn't really see her. At first I was very encouraging to him and offered to and did drive him to work as this allowed an opportunity for them to see each other.</p>

<p>He rarely calls to talk her, we always call him. Hes seen her for a couple of hours maybe in the past three weeks. I always thought they were very close, but he's making very little effort. I find myself listing her virtues on the phone with him like I'm trying to convince him of the merits of being involved with her. He says he wants to see her, but is not actually doing that.</p>

<p>Now she asks less and less about her dad. The past few times that she dId  see him she was upset because she couldn't go with him and it turned into does my daddy love me? Why can't I see him etc...  It obvious to me that it was very challenging for her. After a couple of days she settled back down and is happy.</p>

<p>So I am now beginning to think it may be better if she doesn't see him at all. Less stressful and confusing for her.</p>

<p>Am I obligated as a parent to try to foster a relationship between the two of them? If so, to what degree? Maybe she's just better off without the uncertainty. I would not hinder him from seeing her, but I am beginning to be reminded of "" you can lead a horse to water, but can't make it drink. </p>

<p>One of my parents is very negative. She gets very personal at times and 
uses language like ""You always mess things up, that's why you're the mess that you are"" instead of something like ""what you did wasn't right. It caused these problems. Don't do it again."" She doesn't realize that her approach doesn't work to influence a person as much as she would like to believe.</p>

<p>Now, let me explain a bit about myself. I'm the kind of person who believes in being great, and reading books that inspire, such as <em>Goals!</em> or <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>, <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> etc., and I feel that I  could learn valuable lessons from these books. I have my own style of gleaning knowledge, and a firm belief that what I'm doing is in my interest.<br>
It so happened that I didn't have a great college life. I didn't make use of peer-to-peer bonding and teamwork, and so my grades were lower than they could be. I had a great 2 years in a job after that and I am looking to switch to a new one. My bosses are happy about my performance in the job.</p>

<p>In the parts of the world we live in, society is such that there is a lot of comparison with other people's children. ""What's your child doing these days? Which college did he get admission in? What company does your son work in?"", etc etc. My parents, are very sensitive to this kind of societal comparison, and it has its toll on me. Also, this has led in them always telling me what to do, what not to do, whether or not(mostly not) it matches with my ideals.</p>

<p>Just once, I feel like clearing the air. I want to say something like ""look guys, my life is my life. I don't give a damn what the uncle next door thinks about me, so just stop telling me to get this degree or that certificate or that job, ok? I'll handle things fine on my own.""</p>

<p>The problem is that this isn't very good in itself and doesn't help, because of my poor ""record"". I have the power to change my own life, but no power to influence them. What can I do?</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I have a negative and dominating parent. She feels I'm not doing a good job with my life based on some metrics, so she tries to influence me; but what she's saying isn't of much help. On the other hand, I have a good idea of what I want, but I want to get there on my own. So I just want to tell them to stop offering to ""help"".</p>

"Helping a Tension Increaser Sleep at Night without Feeding","<p>My husband and I will be traveling overseas for a wedding separate from our 10-month-old when he is around 11.5 months; baby will be with my parents. At the time we made the decision, he was sleeping great through the night. For the past 2.5 months, although he goes down relatively easy (just a little walking for ~5 minutes), he wakes 3-5 times a night and will only nurse back to sleep. We have been very careful about not putting him down for bed anytime soon after nursing, and he goes down for naps without nursing, so the middle-of-the-night nursing puzzles us; he is a champion eater during the day, and our doctor has given us the OK to no longer nurse at night. Ordinarily, I think we would be OK with this and just ride it out, but the impending travel means we need to figure something out. It seems that our options are training him to go back to bed at night with something else (e.g., walking, rocking), or sleep train him. Is trying to modify his night behavior without sleep training him possible? Any suggestions on how to do it? Anytime I've tried to even cut him off from nursing early, he immediately cries and pushes away such that trying to rock him is a challenge.

"How to teach tolerance?","<p>A little background: this question came to my mind because I come from a country where most of the population is caucasian and most of the population is of the same religion. Racism is not really existent because there is no racial diversity, but there is a great part of the population that is not tolerant(to various degrees), be it on religious, sexual orientation matters or sometimes even nationality. Some do not afford travelling to places with greater diversity and most of the media is sharing conservative views.</p>

<p>An example of this behaviour happened recently:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were having lunch together, he was sitting next to me while his
  mother was in front of him. He said that he was going on a trip
  with his school next Friday to see an important book (let's call it ""X
  Book"") at the town hall. I didn't know what it was so I asked him
  like this:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>What is the X Book, Luke? </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Then, after him not responding for a second, his mother asked him
  the same question, only phrased differently, like this:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Yeah Luke, tell us all what the book is about and why it's so important.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><em>Something close to a teacher proudly asking a question of their most advanced student.</em></p>
  
  <p>What happened next was him feeling shy as he was suddenly the centre of attention and then leaving the table without saying a word.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's really hard to explain by writing but I guess some of you may have experienced this as well and know what it looks/feels like.</p>

<p>So, the question is, why don't parents treat their children normally instead of doing this?</p>

"How can I help my 7 year old overcome his fear of playground equipment?","<p>My 7 year old seems to be afraid of a lot of playground equipment. It's not the height so much as I believe that he's afraid of falling and getting hurt. (He'll climb up tall stairs and go down tall slides, run across high bridges...) We were at a playground recently where they had a wall climb, monkey bars, a mini zipline, hand over hand bars (I never learned what those were called, a twisty metal pole to climb and one of those rolling logs with the bar to hand on to. He wouldn't do ANY of it. He'd go to each thing like he was going to start, then he'd say that he was afraid and what if he fell??  I tried to reassure him that I was right there and would catch him and help him, but he was still really freaked out. How do I help him acclimate and learn to overcome his fear? He WANTS to, and I can see that he's very frustrated by his own feelings. </p>

"How to address a child having a racist friend?","<p>I have a son who is 10.  He plays online games with a small group of other kids of very similar ages.  I know who they are, and I know the parents, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that we are friends.  I don't even have phone numbers for most of them.  </p>

<p>Within the games there is a side chat.  I do not always read it daily, but I scroll back and read up to current every day or so.  I have realized tonight that there is a kid in there that is racist.  What he has said in the past wasn't really certain to me, as kid speak can be a little odd anyway, but the chat today definitely had some racist tones, to anyone familiar with those terms/words/phrases.  I can promise you, my son missed it completely, in chat he even asked for clarification, as it was unfamiliar to him, and the other child said ""nevermind, went over your head"".  No other children seemed to join in or grasp what he was meaning either as far as I could tell (age range is 9-11 in this group of about 8 kids in total, 6 were on tonight).  </p>

<p>I <em>know</em> I need to inform my son what it meant and to explain that what has been said is troubling and inappropriate.</p>

<p>I am thinking, that if a child of this age knows these references, there is a very good chance he has learned it at home, so I am unsure if I should even bother trying to address the parents of this child.  I am equally unsure if other parents are monitoring the chatting, and not sure what the ethical/moral/social expectations are regarding alerting the other parents of children chatting in there.</p>

<p>I would appreciate input and thoughts on this type of situation, particularly if you have ever dealt with it in your own kids.  I am sure if I think longer on it I will have clearer thoughts too.  Right now I am just upset and haven't had a lot of time to think and I was hoping that some outside perspectives might assist in clearer ideas on the best way to handle it.</p>

<hr>

<p>So recap / TL;DR:</p>

<p>My kid (10 years old) is in a game chat with 7 other kids he knows. I know who the other parents are but we don't know one another well.  One kid has made racist remarks which I think the other children were confused by and didn't understand the reference based on the reaction.</p>

<p>Ideas on how best to talk to my son &amp; explain the situation?</p>

<p>Do I have any obligation to tell other parents with kids in that group what I read?</p>

<p>Do I bother attempting to talk to his parents and make sure they are aware?</p>

"How to identify whether a 7 months old baby is waking for a feed out of habit or need?","<p>I am subscribed to a newsletter from babycenter.com.
Just now I received a letter containing the following content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sleep solutions:<br>
   Once she reaches the age of six months or so, your
  baby will not need to feed so often at night and if you can manage to
  persuade her to drop those night-time feeds, it can be a real boost to
  you all as a family. Unfortunately, this is not always easy. One
  method that many parents use is ""controlled crying"", also called sleep
  training. <strong><em>The idea behind it is that a baby of this age is waking for
  a feed out of habit rather than need,</em></strong> and the aim is to break that
  habit. At the same time, the method aims to reassure both you and your
  baby that she is still all right but that nights are definitely for
  sleeping.</p>

"How to explain addition vs. place values to a 4½-year-old?","<p>My 4½-year-old son has had some questions recently about numbers. On and off for months, he's been asking questions along the lines of ""What does four and two make"" or ""What is a four and a two""? At first, it was unclear whether he was asking about 4+2 or 42. Eventually it seemed to be that he was asking about what the two numbers written side by side meant, so that's how I started answering him.</p>

<p>More specifically, he asked one recent morning about 5 and 5 and I told him that would be fifty five. He said in response, ""But Grandma said it was ten."" I did my best on the spur of the moment to explain place values but my explanation was lacking.</p>

<p>I mentioned all this to the guides at his Montessori school prior to the end of the spring semester, but I didn’t revisit it with them before the summer break. The questions are persisting over the break and his summer camp is mostly play-based.</p>

<p>At the very least, I’d like to clear up any confusion that might have been introduced by having him pose the same question to various people in slightly different or ambiguous ways. Plus, I’d like to get him on the right track about the difference between addition vs. place values. Any tips or ideas for at-home activities, resources, games, etc. that might help him differentiate between addition and place values and otherwise reinforce each concept?</p>

"How to react when a child is in a dangerous situation which requires immediate reaction?","<p>As with all children my son (16 months old) frequently gets himself in dangerous situations</p>

<p>There is no problem with somewhat ""static"" situations, like trying to climb on a chair or slowly reaching for a knife. There's always time to react quickly and calmly.</p>

<p>But sometimes the danger is much more acute, for instance (past experiences):</p>

<ul>
<li>He is running through the zoo, aiming towards a crack in a fence where he could drop in a pond. (Small enough so he fits, but large enough to prevent me jumping after him, also I was still 3 meters behind him) </li>
<li>He took a glass someone carelessly left under the couch and started to bang it on the wall. (I was 5 meters away sitting on a chair behind a desk)</li>
<li>Someone opend the door and he ran out aiming for the stairs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What to do in these situations where danger is acute and may become a matter of life and death or at least serious injury?</strong></p>

<p>What I did:</p>

<p>In the first and last example where there was really grave danger, I yelled really loud. In both cases my son was startled and froze immediately, but will this work every time?</p>

<p>In the second situation he actually knew he wasn't allow to bang stuff against the wall and he was testing my reaction. Which each reaction I provided (starting from a calm 'no' to getting up to actually yelling and running) he was banging the glass even harder and faster against the wall, so what worked in the other situations actually escalated this situation.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To clarify my question:</p>

<p>The existing answers focus on <em>prevention</em>, but IMHO that goes without saying. The problem with prevention is it often fails when other persons are involved.</p>

<ul>
<li>Situation 1: The fences in the zoo are specifically designed to protect small children, but someone broke a part of the fence which was not yet repaired. (At least that situation teached be to never believe someone who says something is child-proof without inspecting it myself :) )</li>
<li>Situation 2: Of course I would never give a glass to my child. Someone else put it there the day before where I couldn't see it, but my son did. (Different perspective :) ) So using plastic cups is no use unless even the adults use them.</li>
<li>Situation 3: The room was perfectly safe, until someone else who wasn't aware a child was in the room opened the door and didn't react fast enough to shut the door or hold my son. So closing the door or putting a gate before the stairs is no use, if someone leaves it open. </li>
</ul>

<p>Because of that I'm asking specifically what to do in such dangerous situations - if they happen. I just want to be prepared for such a bad situation instead of just resting on a sense of security.</p>

"How much water is too much?","<p>My 12 1/2 month old loves water. He will drink it whenever it's offered. He is currently being nursed 2-3 times a day, having 3 solid meals and 1 or 2 small snacks, and occasionally gets an ounce or 2 of milk with his meals. He has recently mastered his sippy cup, and I offer him water at meals and occasionally throughout the day. If I leave a sippy cup near him as he plays, he drinks from it often. </p>

<p>It's hot, so increased thirst is understandable. I was just wondering what's a normal amount of water for this age? Especially since he has started leaking through his diaper every single night :) Would there be any reason to limit his water intake, or can I let him drink as much  as he wants?</p>

"Should I report the mother of my children to the social services?","<p>My partner has ADHD, she has stopped taking her medication for almost two years. As a result she developed a very selfish behaviour and our relationship has ended apart from the fact that we still live under the same roof with our two children.</p>

<p>I have agreed to let her stay (my house and I am the working one) because I don't want me to children to suffer. If I kick her out she would drag the children with her and go seek help from housing section of a city where her sister lives. She refused to give up on the children because she wants the benefits money. She wants to be close to her sister because her sister lives a (free) life on drug and has no responsibilities  after she abandoned her 4 children.</p>

<p>To summarize it I accepted my partner under my roof because if she takes the children with her they will suffer lots and end up in a very unpleasant environment.  </p>

<p><strong>The options I have:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Kicker her out, keep the children with me. Not an option as I can't take of the children, I work for long hours, can't afford a nanny.</li>
<li>Let her leave with the children. Not an option as she wants to take them to a very bad environment. </li>
<li>Let her leave then report her to the social services, the children might end up in a foster and I cant have them</li>
<li>Report her to the doctor and inform them that she stopped her medication, the GP will contact the social services and they might take the children</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The solution I came up with:</strong></p>

<p>I let her stay, she takes care of the children and I pretend not to notice that she is sexting when she is in and cheating when she is out</p>

<p><strong>The problem I am having:</strong></p>

<p>She isn't doing her duties towards the children, she is on the phone and playing Xbox almost 18 hours a day
Children aren't getting fed properly, they are dirty all the time, the house is extremely dirty.
She does not beat the children but they are severely neglected.
She refuse to take her medication, she becomes violent some time with me NOT with the children.
Some of her ADHD problems: she thinks it's normal to ignore all her duties, she blames everything on anybody but herself, she is very selfish as in using the children's TV or having their food.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong></p>

<p>Should I report her to the social services? what that help in anyway other than having my children taken away from me and staying in foster care?
Or should I just live the solution I came up with? the children are not in foster care but neglected.</p>

<p><strong>Some facts to consider:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The children are 4 and 2 years old, a boy a girl</li>
<li>My partner had a very bad life of neglect in her childhood and she has been raped by her biological father.</li>
<li>Her sister is a very bad influence.</li>
<li>My partner is very known to the social services as she has abandoned other children she had from other relationships 5 times.</li>
<li>One of my children is disabled.</li>
<li>We live in the UK</li>

"Why does my toddler cry when I try to put her down for bed, but not when my wife does it?","<p>So my 2 year old is undeniably a Daddy's girl. She's always clingy when I'm home and only wants Daddy when Daddy is around. At bed time we have a routine that we follow before putting her down, but for some reason she will only settle with Mommy. When Mommy puts her to bed she will usually lay down and go to sleep, but if I do it, she'll be happy while I'm rocking her to sleep, but even if she's almost out when I go to lay her in bed, she'll say anything to keep me there with her, ""Rub my back?; Play with my hair?; Sing a song?; Kiss my Hand? Kiss my 'nother hand?"" And without fail, when I stop indulging her requests and leave the room, screaming and crying and out of bed she comes. Yet, if Mommy goes in right after me, she can settle her and put her down. We have a newborn, so it's a little inconvenient for poor Mommy if she has to deal with nursing and putting the toddler down at the same time, and this behaviour seems to have started since the baby, so I've been putting her down more than I used to. What am I doing wrong here?</p>

"Two year old indecisiveness","<p>My younger son, who just turned two a month ago, is going through one of those common stages in toddlerhood (that I remember the older one going through - but less roughly - at the same time).  His brain development skyrocketed, but it's come at a cost: he can't decide <em>anything</em> right now.</p>

<p>This is a bit complicated by his cold (which probably makes food harder to taste -> harder to decide on), but it's not just food: clothes, toys, what he wants to do.  Any time he'd normally have a choice, he sits there, says ""don't know"" for a while, then sometimes makes a choice - and then regrets it almost instantly.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Picking out clothes, he often would pick out a specific shirt, and if not, I could give him a choice of two and he'd pick one reliably.  Now, all we get is ""don't know"" and when I offer anything, ""I don't like that"".  Not a specific objection to getting dressed (we do now and always have had some of those, but I know what those look like).  Once I pick for him and put it on he's fine.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting breakfast this morning, he really struggled.  I gave him his choices - fruit, yogurt, some cereal - nada.  I narrowed it down to two choices that he loves both of - ""don't know"".  Finally I got myself a bowl of cereal (of a cereal he likes) and told him I was going to eat and he could tell me when he was ready to decide; he said ""I want that"" pointing to my cereal.  Okay, fine, went over to get a bowl; he picked the bowl he and his brother fight over because they both love it (a dip bowl that has a christmas train on it!).  I said ""Excellent"", picked it up, immediate ""I don't want that"" cry.  He picks another bowl, okay, great. I pour the raisin bran in, he immediately says ""I don't want that, I want wheaties"" (which was on offer earlier, but wasn't what he'd said).  At this point I'd already put milk in it so it wasn't going to change, so we sat down and after some crying he finally ate a few bites, was fine, and ended up eating three (small- 1 c rice bowl size) bowls of it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We had thought this might be hunger related at times (or head cold related), but it seems to be all the time with no stopping.  His brother had something like this for a week or two, but nothing like this - it was more that he became <em>more</em> opinionated and objected to everything we did out of principle.  I don't think that's what's going on here directly: I think he's probably too aware of decisions and is being indecisive.</p>

<p>What can we do to help him out here, other than just power through?  Is it better to make decisions for him, like I did with the clothes above, or to let him muddle around for a while?  My wife and I are both not great 'deciders', so we'd like to give him the best shot at learning how to be decisive: but we'd also like to not have him too sad because of this.  </p>

<p>Is it a good idea to let him change his mind until he finds what he wants?  Or does that lead to a child who always changes his mind and never is happy with anything?  I'm generally happy to let him (or his brother) change his mind prior to a hard cutoff, which is usually the point when some waste would occur (milk in cereal for example).</p>

"Possibly long-lasting trauma as a newborn?","<p>Do you know of any <strong>studies on effects of traumatic events on newborns</strong>? Can they be long-lasting? If yes, when would it make sense to think of some help (e.g., therapy)?</p>

<p>Situation:
Three days after birth, while still in the hospital, my daughter showed signs of an infection (e.g., fever, accelerated breathing). It followed that she was put on intravenous antibiotics, a 10 day treatment. During these 10 days, a number of doctors and nurses made many attempts (sometimes even several times a day) to poke her blood vessels for the IV, while <em>holding her still on a table</em>, accompanied by baby's uninterrupted cry. Depending on the skill of the nurse, it would even take them 1 hour to manage. In addition, they took blood samples every day. Mom and dad were always there, talking to her, and trying to comfort her, but it was nevertheless painful (for us to watch, and surely for her to experience, at least physically, but we think also and mentally). </p>

<p>At 3 weeks old, baby gets fever, and she has the same bacterial infection again. Same process: 10 days IV antibiotics in the hospital, plus several other tests that required her to be still (i.e., be held still), accompanied by terrible cries. Note: She was never left alone with the health carers.</p>

<p>Ever since, I have noticed her distress, to say the least, when putting her on a changing table (except for when at home), on a scale (at the child health center), or similar, even if it is just me doing that, and constantly talking/singing to her to keep her distracted from the context. To the point that between 3 and 5 months I refused to weigh her at the child health center, following a 2 hour long inconsolable cry at her previous weigh in. She is now 9 months old, and although her reactions seem to have improved, they are still there. (No such reactions if she just lies on the bed, or on the floor).</p>

<p>I should mention that she is otherwise a happy, joyful, unproblematic baby, who seldom cries during the day. She is normally developed for her age. However, there have been periods with frequent hysterical cries in her sleep, but that seems to be related to babies' development (although I do not know if my baby has significantly more such episodes than what is considered normal).</p>

<p><strong>Update at 18 months</strong>: Around 1 y.o. we couldn't notice any negative reaction to being put horizontally on changing tables anymore. She also does not seem to have any other negative behaviour that is not simply age-specific and her development is normal. So hopefully no long-lasting effects.</p>

"How can I ensure that my daughter is not excessively attached to me?","<p>I have been a single father to my two children- a sixteen year old girl and a fourteen year old boy- ever since my wife separated from me eight years ago and married another man. I have had extremely anxious moments balancing my work and my family life, but I appeared to be doing it quite successfully until I noticed that my daughter hated associating with boys in her class.This was quite surprising to me because she spends a lot of time with me at home and never seems to be uncomfortable in the presence of a male. In fact, she hangs out with me far more often than she does with her younger brother.</p>

<p>All the friends she brings home are girls and I have never heard her talk about the boys in high-school. I interrogated one of my daughter's friends and came to know that the boys in her school find my daughter extremely good looking but my daughter absolutely ""hates"" these boys and calls them ""stalkers"".</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, we were watching a cricket match. I was rooting for England but my daughter had a presentiment that Australia would win. When I disagreed, she promptly bet me a kiss to a box of her favourite chocolate that she was right. Without giving the stakes a second thought, I accepted the wager. As it turned out, I won my bet with her. She was a bit disappointed to be honest, but proceeded to kiss me on my lips. I had expected a kiss on the cheek and found my daughter's behaviour greatly disturbing.</p>

<p>I have tried to convince my daughter that at this age, she should get over her attachment to her father and look for young boys to give her company, but she never seems to understand my concerns. She responds by telling me that I am the only ""boy"" who loves her for something more than her good looks. I have a feeling that the boys in school objectify her. I do my best to ensure that she isn't persecuted by such boys but I do not think a few boys can represent the entire population of males in the world.</p>

<p>When I expressed my discomfort about the kiss, she wanted to know why the loser kisses the winner in tennis matches? I rarely watch tennis so I couldn't reply of course. </p>

<p>I often have heart to heart talks with my daughter. She did tell me about her aversion towards boys but I interrogated her friends just to be extra sure she wasn't being harassed. I have found it difficult to bring up the topic of sexuality as it is considered a taboo subject here in India. Also, I haven't been able to explain to her the difference between a kiss on the lips and a kiss on the cheek. I expected her to learn from her friends but she probably hasn't.</p>

"Why is my 3 month old waking up 10+ times a night?","<p>My 3 month old went from starting on a good sleep trajectory (a five hour and 3 hour stretch at 8 weeks regularly) to waking between every 15 minutes and every 2 hours. What I'm trying to figure out is what causes the frequent night wakings. She was fighting her arms out of her swaddle and getting the fabric over her face in the process, so for her safety we taught her to sleep without it.  Plus she started sleep crying for gas pain or some other cause in the very early morning nearly every morning that we rushed to comfort.  With all that her sleep habits deteriorated.  They have been getting worse and worse since 9 weeks and at 14 weeks I am at my wits end with the double digit number of night wakings.  Reading that some people consider 4 bad was hardly comforting.</p>

<p>I've seen Marc Weissbluth's <a href=""http://sorensmom-ivil.tripod.com/earlybedtime.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">theory that the frequent waking issue is from some form of overtiredness</a> in <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0345486455"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child</a>.  I've tried his solution, too, which is <em>invariably</em> to move bedtime earlier.  Well Her bedtime has consistently been earlier than 6:30 for well over a week with no changes.  I'm sure the completely fragmented sleep is making her overtired, but earlier bedtimes are doing <em>nothing</em> to help.   Her naps are not yet organized (I'm despairing that they ever will be at this rate) and so she takes 4 to 5 30-45 minute naps - if she'll take them - that I offer whenever she starts yawning, looking glazed-eyed, or rubbing her eyes.</p>

<p><a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/3899/how-do-i-help-my-3-month-old-sleep-better-through-the-night"">This question's accepted answer</a> suggests hunger as one possible cause.  My little girl is skyrocketing up the growth chart and eats every 1-2 hours during the day on demand.  I feed her 2-3 times at night, but not at every waking.  I sincerely doubt she's hungry, but I'm open to being wrong.</p>

<p>Baby does have a pacifier, and popping it back in often soothes her back to sleep.  Would trying to wean her off of it at this early age perhaps help her learn to self-soothe, or would it just make sleep worse?  I am totally fine if she wants to suck on her fingers or thumb and get us all a little sleep, but so far every time she finds her thumb it does nothing to help her go back to sleep.  She's not really coordinated enough to keep it in her mouth.</p>

"My son's friends suddenly prefer to play without him. Should I get involved or let the kids sort this out?","<p>My son is eight and is in third form of elementary school. He is friendly, social, generous, fun, and popular among both his class mates and their parents. But recently there is a saddening development among his friends.</p>

<p>When my son invites friends to his home, he is always open to other kids coming, too. When he plays with ""Tom"", and ""John"" calls and asks if he can come, my son always answers: ""Of course."" He loves <em>all</em> his friends, and wants all of them around him all the time. We used to have three to five kids in the house on many afternoons.</p>

<p>My son's friends on the other hand usually have one other favourite friend. They play with everyone as a group, while in school, but at home they are content with having their one single best friend over and since a few weeks they have begun to prefer to be alone with that friend. So what has been happening for almost two months now is that whenever my son wants to play with ""Tom"" and/or ""John"", the two have always already agreed to meet, and they tell my son that they want to be among themselves and that he cannot come. And this not only happens with ""Tom"" and ""John"", but with several of my son's other friends also. Most of his class mates, and unfortunately all of his – former – closest friends, have currently formed ""couples"", leaving my son the proverbial fifth (or, in this case, third) wheel.</p>

<p>I don't completely understand this, and my son has no explanation either. For a few weeks now he has spent most of his afternoons alone. Only when one ""partner"" from one of the ""couples"" is otherwise occupied (usually with sports or family events), the remaining kid is open to play with my son. My son is visibly sad and hurt by the ongoing rejection, but as yet he remains true to his friends.</p>

<p>I'm not sure wether or not I should talk to the other kids or their parents. I don't think forced friendships work, so I hesitate to get involved, but rather hope that this is a phase and will pass.</p>

<p>But then, there is an additional complication. I'm the coach in a climbing group for kids from 7 to 10. My son is in that group. We have a long waiting list of kids that want into that group, and some kids have been on that list for two years.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks back, before the rejections started, ""Tom"" asked my son if he could join the group, and my son asked me. ""Tom"" didn't know about the waiting list. I decided to let ""Tom"" skip the waiting list and allowed him to join. I did this for my son, because ""Tom"" is one of his closest friends and it made my son happy to have him in the group. And ""Tom"" and his family will move away at the end of the school year, so his position in the group will become vacant again soon and the kid at the top of the waiting list can join, albeit a few months later than if I hadn't privileged my son's friend.</p>

<p>Now, at the beginning of this week, a day after telling my son that they wanted to play without him, ""John"" asked my son if he could join the climbing group, too. He and ""Tom"" allowed my son to play with them on that day.</p>

<p>Basically, I don't feel too good about letting a second kid jump the waiting list. I was making an exception for ""Tom"", based on the fact that he would leave the group again soon, and my infringement would not be permanent. But I must admit that if ""John"" was my son's best friend and they were playing together every day, I would probably make a second, and permanent, exception, for the sake of my son.</p>

<p>But now, I feel that ""John"" is taking advantage of my son's friendship towards him, while at the same time he does not reciprocate the feeling and isn't a friend to my son. Today, as usual, ""Tom"" and ""John"" rejected my son's attempts to make a date with them.</p>

<p>So I wonder. Disregarding the waiting list for the moment, should I invite ""John"" to the group, too, because this would please my son and might actually bring the kids together again? Or does it only bring ""John"" and ""Tom"" together, who are then both part of the group? Or should I tell ""John"" that he needs to decide wether he wants to be friends with my son, or not, and not use his friendship, if he doesn't want it? Or should I just tell him that it is not possible, using the waiting list as an excuse? Or what?</p>

<p>I want my son to have friends. I want to facilitate these friendships, where I can. But I also want to ""deflect"" those friendships that are, in my opinion, not good for my son (in this case, because his friendship is being used to gain access to something, not out of ""love"").</p>

<p>What is the right thing to do?</p>

<p>(Again, please disregard the problem of the waiting list. I might not admit ""John"" to the group regardless of what would be right for my son and their currently deteriorating friendship. The waiting list is a different problem, and not what I'm asking about here. I'll solve that problem with my conscience and my co-coach.)</p>

"What should I be teaching my two year old?","<p>My two year old daughter has never been to a daycare, so everything she knows is something that me, my husband, or her grandparents have taught her. She sees very little interaction with other kids her age, well, except for her 8 month old sister. </p>

<p>I am wondering what people, or even day care centers, teach two year olds. What do they do all day long? Presently, our daughter draws a lot - she has bathtub crayons, wax crayons for paper, and chalk for the driveway/sidewalk. She attempts to draw circles and lines. We try to teach her shapes and colors, and she has a rough idea of what they are. She plays with sand in the sandbox a lot, dumping sand all over her and her sister's head. She goes to her playhouse and uses the slide and the swing. </p>

<p>We sing songs together - the alphabet song or the numbers song. She is able to say the correct word when I say the phonic (i.e. if I say B, she'll say ball; if I say H, she'll say hat). She tries counting, but is still learning (she goes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8...). She enjoys building and destroying towers. We read books and I sing some nursery rhymes. She plays a toy piano and dances around to it. She plays with playdough, but most of the time it just ends up in crumbs everywhere.</p>

<p>She also watches TV - something I know most parents object to. She enjoys watching Dora, Finding Nemo, and Cinderella. She will sometimes watch LeapFrog phonics videos for alphabet and numbers. </p>

<p>I am not trying to give a resume for my daughter, but merely wondering is there something more that kids her age do? Is there something else that I should be teaching her? What do kids her age do at a daycare? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"5-year-old tantrums and misbehavior - what am I doing wrong?","<p>My two boys are 4-years-old and 11 months; they will be 5 and 1 next month.</p>

<p>My oldest is exceedingly stubborn, and he's displaying strong leadership traits. When he has his mind set on something, his single focus is achieving it. He is determined to be accepted and treated as an adult, and he often lands in trouble for trying to be the parent in a given situation. He's also very smart and mischievously sneaky at times. He's a good kid, but I've struggled with bad behavior, repeatedly going against what he's told, and now mistreating his little brother by hitting and biting.</p>

<p>My first approach when he misbehaved was to consistently sit him in a time out. I devised a three step time out, where he had to ""climb"" the stairs to exit time out. First, he would explain why he was in time out. Second, he would brainstorm ways to avoid said behavior in the future. Third, he would sit quietly in time out for 10 minutes to think about our talk. This worked for a few months. Then, he started ignoring me and the time outs.</p>

<p>My next approach was to take something away when he ignored time out. This went on for three months, until I had effectively confiscated everything from favorite toys to his coveted game time on PBS. He still acted out and began melting down instead of communicating, to which I helped him learn how to breathe deeply, calm down, and then talk. He stopped doing this a month or so later.</p>

<p>My next, and most unpleasant, approach was to talk through his behavior, ensuring he understood why what he did was wrong and why be was being punished before being smacked on the butt twice. This seemed to work, and we had a few weeks of calm before it all began again.</p>

<p>I have a terrible time getting him to nap and eat well. Thinking this was a contributing factor, I began focusing on sleeping and eating habits, trying to improve them. He said he didn't want to sleep because of ""ghosts in [his] room"" before saying he was making it up so he could stay up. I was so proud of him for telling me this, especially since we've been talking about the importance of not lying or making things up. Then, he said there were monsters in his room. He seemed to firmly believe there was a monster that came out when he went to bed. So, he and I ""chased"" the monster out and set up a ""protective barrier"" to keep it and all others out. A week later, he was back to tantrum throwing at every nap and bed time because he didn't want to go to bed.</p>

<p>He's not a picky eater, but he refuses to eat a good meal. His reasoning ranges from not being hungry to wanting to do other things first. He's starting school in the fall, and I'm trying to help him understand he needs to eat and sleep when it's time to eat and sleep. I've tried everything from a reward system to taking things away for doing or not doing as instructed.</p>

<p>He's never had an issue with his little brother. And he's usually a phenomenal big brother. He was excited to have his little brother move into his room. He acts very good outside of the house, and he only acts out when he's comfortable in a place that isn't home (like Grandma's or a close friend's).</p>

<p>But he's constantly doing things he shouldn't and now hitting and biting his little brother. He's also suddenly having a <strong>lot</strong> of accidents in his clothes and bed, sometimes several times in one day. I'm trying so hard to stay consistent, but when it seems like nothing is working and he's constantly misbehaving, throwing tantrums, and melting down, I'm not sure what to keep doing and what to change.</p>

<p>His physical is in June and I intend to speak to his pediatrician about all of this. But in the meantime, is there anything I'm missing? Is there something else I can try?</p>

<p>I've tried digging deeper to see if there is a deeper problem or issue to address, but his answers and conversations are sporadic at best. It's very hard to tell if he's being truthful or spinning a story. And I'm worried he'll be behind in school because he doesn't apply himself. He can read, but he acts like he can't. He is super smart, but he continually downplays his abilities, and I don't know why when he's always been encouraged.</p>

<p>Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, from one burnt out, frazzled, and worried mum! </p>

"In which language to speak to third parties when following the OPOL approach?","<p>I am a native english speaker settled in the Netherlands; I speak fluent (but not very grammatical) Dutch. I now have a granddaughter Rosie of two months and her mother (my step-daughter) has suggested that I speak only English to her, so that she will grow up bilingual (a variant on the One Parent One Language (OPOL) approach). They live close by and we see them almost daily.  </p>

<p>This sounds like a good idea to me, but <strong>which language should I use with third parties</strong> (typically the mother and the grandmother, my wife) in Rosie's presence? Should I answer their Dutch questions in Dutch or English? All parties involved (family and friends) speak enough English to handle both languages. My automatic reaction would be Dutch, but I think I can train myself to always use English in Rosie's presence.  </p>

<p>Conversely, <strong>how important is it that the Dutch people speak Dutch?</strong> For example, I recently said to Rosie: ""That was a nice big burp"" and my wife echoed me with ""Another big burp then"" instead of the Dutch equivalent ""<em>Nog een grote boer dan</em>"" which she would have otherwise said. Will Rosie get confused in such situations?  </p>

<p>Fortunately we have a few months before Rosie will actually begin to recognise words, but I'd appreciate advice, both for me and the other parties.  </p>

<p>Extra information if it's relevant: the father is absent but visits occasionally, is Dutch-speaking. Rosie will have very little other exposure to English apart from TV and adverts (English is very trendy in Dutch adverts). Rosie's biological grandfather died in a car accident, I married his widow and have excellent relations with the children (Rosie's mother and uncle).  </p>

"At what point does confidence become obnoxious over-confidence?","<p>My 5 year old has just started primary school, and for the most part he's taking the change from Kindergarten very well. He was a little shocked by the fact that he had to sit and learn instead of playing all day but he's always taken to new experiences very well.</p>

<p>His teacher has commented on his surprisingly high confidence levels (something my wife and I have always tried to nurture as we are both very shy/quiet people) stating that, while most new students will not venture far from their classroom for the first few months, within two days they had to go looking for him after lunch and found him at the other end of the school playing ""tackle"" rugby with the 12 year olds.</p>

<p>My wife and I thought that was great. However the other side to this confidence is an increasing lack of respect for authority figures. My wife went to pick him up last week and found him in a Mexican standoff with the teacher and assistant teacher, refusing to pack his bag for home time because he had lost his water bottle and they wouldn't let him wander the school looking for it. The situation itself was (and still is) hilarious, and while I want him to stand up for himself I don't want to encourage him to defy teachers/authority figures so aggressively in the future.</p>

"Should I call my sad, almost 5-year-old on holidays with grandparents and his sister?","<p>I have an almost 5-year-old son and an almost 3-year-old daughter. My children are on holidays with grandparents far away for a week. They had the same holidays last year and it went smoothly, but this year my son cried during and after the travel there (with grandparents). He knows his grandparents well and is always happy to meet them, He sees them up to 8 times/25 days a year, and we also have been there recently. I would say they are comforting - they hug for a soothing. </p>

<p>I did not talk to him since I do not know if I make it worse or not. Grandparents say it was ""just sadness"" and after ""cry out"" he is fine. They also suggested it is OK for me to call, and they will probably Skype us today evening. In general my son is not overly attached to us, he can spend a day with relatives/friends just fine. I think he is sad because of being separated from us. </p>

<p>My question is spurred by the fact that recently I let her use my phone on a video chat with Grandma and I had it locked completely down so she couldn't do anything.  This was the first time we had tried this, and after the call ended she carried my phone around for a half an hour refusing to part with it.

She could not manipulate the phone so to speak as all the controls were off, including the touchscreen.</p>

<p>She sees her parents, other adults, and some kids with electronics that she is not allowed to see or hold, though she desperately wants to.

"Can children be educated without a family by professionals?","<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> This will seem a very odd question to most of you, but it fits the topics of this site and I don't know anywhere else to ask it. In case you are wondering, what follows is perfectly serious. I am not trying to troll you.</p>

<p>I would like to ask if there is a place where a child can be fostered by <strong>professional education experts</strong>, in a community, <strong>family-less institution</strong>, with high standards and <strong>without second purposes</strong> such as pushing a specific religion or a way of life onto them.</p>

<p><strong>Why not an orphanage?</strong> Something like an orphanage is a first approximation, but orphanages are usually a last choice for children, in terms of quality. Educators try to do their best with a high share of problematic, traumatized children. Since they do not have parents to answer to, they are not strictly controlled for the quality of their job. They are not the best paedagogy experts the market can offer, but a last resort for children who have no other alternatives. Moreover, orphanages are often run by religious institutes, which have their own beliefs to advance. Think something more like a <strong>permanent non-religious boarding school</strong> which goes from 0 to 18 years than an orphanage.</p>

<p><strong>Why not a step-family?</strong> Step- and foster-parents are also universally seen as a second choice. The child would still grow up in a family-like environment, not with professionals, with all the inefficiencies I perceive in the family model. Foster-parents are not experts in any sense of the meaning, and may feel less emotional attachment to the step-child (especially if they have other children of their own). The child would know that they are in an ""inferior"" arrangement than their school friends. To sum up, for the child, a step-family has all the cons of a biological family, and less pros.</p>

<p><strong>Why not a commune?</strong> Mostly, because of the people. People in communes often have their own peculiar view of life and personal beliefs to advance. The leading principle is ""we grow up our children, together, our way""; not ""we have professionals grow up our children in the best possible way"". If I were to join a commune as a parent, I'd have to take my share of the burden of educating and caring after children, probably in equal shares with the other members, and I don't feel qualified. I could fit a role in which I teach them lectures in my area of expertise, but I don't think I am the right person for taking care of a child 24/7.</p>

<p><strong>Why am I asking this?</strong> This is a theoretical question; I have no children and I am not expecting any. But the answer is <em>for my own child, potentially</em>. I do not believe in the traditional family model. I find it inefficient and dangerous for the children: most parents are not well qualified to grow a child, in my opinion, and I am no better than them. I would like to try a more centralized institution, an alternative to the family model in which children grow up as their parent wish. I realize that this may be costly, but raising a child in any other possible way is expensive, too.</p>

<p><strong>Have I read too many science-fiction books?</strong> Perhaps. This is completely different from the traditional view of family. But with 6 billion people in the world, I would be  surprised if no one ever tried something like this.</p>

<p>So, my question is if such a place/institute exists.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any institution that does this in the world?</p>

"How do you respond to minor injuries?","<p>I have a 21-month-old daughter. Sometimes (not always), if she bumps her head, or stubs her toe, or whatever, this results in crying and asking to be held (and not wanting to be put down once the crying has stopped).</p>

<p>My current response to this is to</p>

<ul>
<li>accept her request: she's upset, and I don't want to withhold support</li>
<li>make a show out of examining the hurt spot, giving it a kiss, telling her that she's OK</li>
<li>try to draw her attention elsewhere (""hey, look at this!"", ""what's mommy doing?"", etc), hopefully hooking her onto it so that she forgets about being upset and lets me put her down (and hopefully also teaching her something about how to deal with pain)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, recently a family member visited. When one such scene happened, this person's immediate response was to sort of smirk at my daughter (daring her to be upset? haughtiness because she's seen this before? I don't know), and to mock her crying by saying things like ""oooh, it hurts sooooooo much!"" (Incidentally, this seemed to make the crying last longer, in spite of me trying to comfort her.) This person had raised her own daughter pretty much by sending her to her room whenever she cried; after the crying was over, the child could come out and talk about it.</p>

<p>I used to agree with this method, but now I find it a little harsh (seems like it denies emotional support when requested, thereby creating a situation where the child isn't automatically accepted - and of course the mocking is bad). However, I do worry that I may be ""spoiling"" my own daughter, or teaching her to whine over nothing, or whatever.</p>

<p>Am I being too ""soft"", or am I falling for a dangerous cliché? It seems like this sort of ""it's only a big deal if somebody's watching"" behavior is normal, but is there a risk that it will continue (and if so, what causes it)?</p>

"How to make a 3.5-year-old stop deliberately waking up her 1-year-old sister?","<p>We've got two daughters of 3.5 (B) and 1 (L) years, respectively. B's behaviour is sometimes a bit reminiscent of what was described in <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/10694/24587"">someone else's earlier question</a>.</p>

<p>The particular issue/situation that I would like to inquire about is that, for the past six months, virtually every time L is on a good way to enter one of her afternoon naps<sup>1</sup>, <em>just</em> when she seems like she's falling asleep, B will deliberately make some noise to wake her up.</p>

<p>Similarly to the linked question, I suspect B sometimes resents L for taking away everyone's focus on her. This is what makes this situation particularly frustrating to us - L's nap (can be one or two hours) would be the one time where B could get our full attention. I'm personally looking forward to playing with B<sup>2</sup>, but somehow, B manages to sabotage that opportunity herself. As a result, L is awake again, and she'll take up a part of our attention again.</p>

<p>My question, thus, is two-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why does B do this and how do we encourage her to stop it?</strong> I'd like to let B notice the advantage of having our attention while L is napping, but B prevents that from happening in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>How should we react right when the issue occurs?</strong> We have tried some ways of stopping the noise (most straightforwardly, telling her to be quiet for a moment, or firmly covering her mouth with a hand ...), but that just makes her playfully find other ways to keep up the noise level (humming loudly, clapping, ...).</li>
</ul>

<p>Some more data points:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the children are in the same room when this happens, this plays out as described, and B is successful in her quest before we can bring L out of the room.</li>
<li>If we bring L elsewhere in time, but B realizes L is about to sleep, B will start walking through the house, yelling ""L, wheere aaare youuuu?"" ... or B will immediately state she's tired, as well, and wants to sleep where L sleeps, promising to be quiet. Either, we grant that wish, and she'll noisily join L, waking her up, or we deny it, in which case B will throw a noisy tantrum, waking L up even through a couple of doors/walls.</li>
<li>When we ask B why she does what she does, she'll state ""L isn't allowed to sleep."" (""... isn't allowed to ..."", without any further explanation, is her favourite complaint when she doesn't like something the way it is, anyway.)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup>: It's somewhat hard to achieve, she easily feels disturbed by noises, and if the attempt for a nap fails, she might easily stay awake throughout the day, ending up cranky in the evening. At the same time, spending 20 to 30 minutes to make L sleep <em>several times a day</em> eats away non-negligibly from our time, as well.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>: Admittedly also because, well, toys compatible with a 3.5 year old are still a bit more interesting for an adult than those compatible with a 1 year old.</p>

"Should you teach your children to identify letters or write letters first?","<p>My oldest daughter is 3. I'm trying to teach her how to read and write (in English). </p>

<p>My daughter can recite the alphabet A-Z, but cannot identify the letters. She can trace over letters that I write very lightly in pencil, but can't write letters on her own.</p>

<p>In the old-fashioned rote way of learning, if you want to learn a quotation, for example, you write it 100 times. So perhaps she would be better at identifying letters if she could write them. </p>

<p>Should I focus on having her identify the letters first? Or should I focus on having her write the letters on the page as a way to identify them? Which method is more effective at introducing literacy; or some other introductory method that I am not using?</p>

"How can parents avoid their child becoming a ""whiner""?","<p>Inspired from my <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/5317/how-do-you-respond-to-minor-injuries"">previous question</a>, but distilled to be more specific:</p>

<p>What types of parenting would cause a child to become a ""whiner?"" By this, I mean that the child becomes someone who tends to use complaining to authority figures (exaggerating the difficulties s/he is facing) as the first choice for resolving problems.</p>

<p>Where I come from, the ""common wisdom"" seems to be that comforting a child for things that ""shouldn't"" require comfort (like minor pain from bumping one's head) encourages this behavior, and that the preferred method is to not ""give in"" to the child's cries for attention. Is this true?</p>

"Strong-willed child? What am I missing?","<p>My 6, almost 7 year old is so strong-willed that it's crushing me and destroying our relationship, as I'm getting to the point that I dread being around her. She can be so fun and nice one minute but then turn on you and be downright hateful at times. Most of the time I can handle the fits to my no's, it's the non-compliance on things that must get done that I'm really struggling with.</p>

<p>Two of her biggest issues are getting dressed in the morning and now homework. Getting dressed has been an on and off issue since she was 3. I have at times wondered if she could have a sensory disorder but she can go months at a time wearing pretty much whatever then suddenly go back into the daily fits where she will pull almost everything from her drawers, trying on a few things here and there, and end up in a fit on the floor. You would think this might only be a problem when she has to go somewhere she doesn't want to but there are many times where we can't get her dressed to go to a birthday party or the beach or a movie. She will lay on the floor and scream that she really wants to go but doesn't want to get dressed. This can last for 2+ hours. </p>

<p>This year for school she has picked out one outfit she wants to wear and has worn it everyday so far (17 days). She puts it on, no problem. One morning it was in the washer (it was a weekend) and she melted down and waited for it to be dry before she would get dressed to go play outside.</p>

<p>Our other issue is homework. She is only in first grade but has had homework since last year. It became an issue for her at the end of the kindergarten school year. It wasn't difficult, some of it was a dot-to-dot for example, but she just didn't want to do it; the same with nightly reading. We pushed through and I was determined to get into a better routine this year knowing that there would be more difficult work this year. We are already having battles. Yesterday it took an hour to complete her homework. 20 minutes of actual work, and 40 minutes of whining. Tonight it consumed our entire evening 2-7pm. Granted we had a snack and dinner in that time but nothing else fun until the work was done. She went to bed with it still not completed. I do think it's too much work for first grade and I'm going to speak with her teacher tomorrow after school but even if she can get by with not doing it this year, I'm worried that it's giving in to her thinking that if she doesn't want to do something she doesn't have to.</p>

<p>I see 1-2-3 Magic suggested here and we already do something similar to that, ignore undesirable behavior etc., but what do you do when your child won't comply with things that must be done, like getting dressed, hygiene, and homework? I am stressed to the max and while ignoring her behavior today she continued to follow me around and at one point sat on top of me and said ""I'm just sitting here enjoying watching my mommy be frustrated"". Psycho?</p>

<p>I should also mention that while her behavior has generally been contained to our house, her recent behavior during two separate playdates was horrendous. She was so bossy, mean, and rude that both playmates (mind you, this is two separate occasions) asked to go home. While she wanted them to stay she was in no way remorseful for her behavior. She is also complaining that her friends from kindergarten won't let her play. I imagine it's because this behavior is starting to rear outside the house. </p>

<p>Btw. I feel like I have tried everything... bribing, yelling, begging, giving choices, limiting choices, threatening, sticker charts, praise. It all falls on deaf ears. I honestly feel like if my daughter doesn't want to do it, she won't. Is there something I'm missing?</p>

"Answering questions about why words are pronounced/spelled as they are","<p>This question is based on English, but many other languages might have equivalent issues (if, perhaps, less frequent).</p>

<p>My almost-five year old is learning to read (has learnt, really), and is a very bright guy.  He's picked up on the various basic rules of phonetics fairly well, and is roughly at the Easy Reader Level 2-3 level.</p>

<p>When sounding out words with me, he'll often ask me why a particular word is spelled or pronounced the way it is, pointing out that it doesn't have X characteristic that it normally would - something as simple as why the y in ""by"" is a long y sound, while in ""blobby"" it is a long e sound, often (vowel sounds in English being some of the most confusing).  I'm not someone who is an expert on pronunciation, so my answer is often ""I don't know, it just is.""  I try to give tips for recognizing other similar words (such as, when it's a ""short"" word it's more likely to be long, like by or be, while if it's in a longer word it's more likely to be shorter), but I definitely don't know the <em>why</em> about most of it.</p>

<p><a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/329151/why-are-the-vowels-in-christ-and-christmas-different-and-other-strange-diphtho"">Reading this question</a> made me realize that the why often <em>is</em> determinable, but of course I'm not going to become an expert in english pronunciation fast enough for my son (probably not for my 3 year old, at the rate I learn these things).  </p>

<p>This leads me to my question:</p>

<p><strong>How can I answer my son's questions about why syllables are spelled and pronounced as they are in a way that both helps him learn, and stokes his curiosity to continue learning?  What elements are most helpful to cover, both for myself (to be able to answer his questions) and for him?</strong></p>

<p>In particular, I imagine there are several approaches I could take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language of origin (Greek, Latinate, Germanic, etc.)</li>
<li>Word construction ('c' is hard when followed by 'o' or 'a', soft before 'i' or 'e')</li>
<li>Rhythm/spoken language reasons (the example question, as to why ""christ"" is long but ""christmas"" is short)</li>
</ul>

<p>Are any of these better to focus on, given I cannot learn all of any of them not to mention all of all of them?  For a young child, in particular, which will be more effective (or other approaches I have not listed)?  He does understand other languages exist (and knows some Spanish) and has some concept of other countries and cultures.</p>

"How to avoid food waste while not forbidding experiments with food?","<p>To give a bit context: We are quite relaxed with food and eating. Our daughter (3 years old) is free to decide many things about eating. Most of the time she may decide what to eat (as long as she does not get too excessive with chocolate spread and the like), we would never force her to eat up and we'd like to not endorse, but at least tolerate experimenting with food, for we believe that it's kind of important to experience the world around you with all senses.</p>

<p>However, there are some restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>She will not get another of the same kind if she still has some</li>
<li>She will not get more when she has already requested about 2 or 3 different foods</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, we'd like to avoid wasting food, too. It's not that much of a problem with not eating up, since <em>we</em> can eat it up, but a bit more with the experimenting part. Generally speaking we have the rule, that if she experiments with the food she should eat up, for she usually leaves the food in a condition that nobody of us would like to eat it. Anyway, we still do not want to force her to eat up, hence we're kind of stuck to tell her (determined, but still calm), that we are angry about it, but there are no real consequences. </p>

<p>Sometimes it works giving her a bit of her food to experiment with and the rest will remain ""untouched"", but she can be very quick pouring her whole glass of milk in the bowl, at least rendering the milk undrinkeable.</p>

<p>Are there better strategies to avoid food waste while not forbidding experimeting with the food? How could we explain the whole matter to her, better?  </p>

"Is my 4-year-old too dependent on over-the-counter medication?","<p>I have been concerned about a particular behavior from my 4-year-old and am hoping it is just unnecessary worry.</p>

<p>We are not by any means big on giving our children over-the-counter medication. We use antibiotics when they are necessary and only provide Tylenol when fevers are high. Lately, we have noticed that when our 6-year-old is sick and receives medicine, our 4-year-old will immediately claim to be sick and want the same medication, even if he feels fine. As expected, we decline that request. When he actually does have a fever and receives Tylenol, he consistently spends the next several hours requesting the medicine again. I can't help but feel like this is an indication of an addictive personality. </p>

<p>Is there anything that can done to help this situation, or is this simply a child who likes the taste of Tylenol? Does anyone recall their children exhibiting this trait and seeing it develop into something more serious?   </p>

<p>Some say that it is simply an association with being sick. This might be true if we gave him medication every time he is sick, but we do not. It might also be true if the correlated special behavior was something he wants. Instead, we do not allow TV when a child is home from school so it does not become a reason to be sick. Instead, the pattern I see is he feels better after taking medication and then tends to want it more (as any normal person would). My concern is because he <strong>keeps</strong> wanting it after the fever has dropped, as though he correlates it with the reason he feels better overall. Hope that clears it up.</p>

"How to encourage our 6-month-old baby to play on his own?","<p>My baby is 6 month old (8.4 kg). He has a fancy play gym with plenty of lots of toys. We also have plenty of books to read to him. We make him play with our dog (poor doggy!). He also loves playing with leaves outside while we hold him in our arms.</p>

<p><strong>Baby playing in the early morning</strong></p>

<p>In the morning, in the first hour of awake time, just before his first nap, he is generally quite able to play on his own. He can turn on his side to catch toys and play with them. When I try to interact with him, he mainly shows interest in his toys.</p>

<p>He is not very good at turning from his tummy to his back yet (he is usually in ""airplane mode"" when on his tummy) and he sometimes complained to be turned back on his back. During tummy time, he is sometimes playing with whatever toy we put in between his arms (or some other toy that is nearby at the moment he flips over on his tummy). He sometimes looks at himself in a small mirror that is by the side of his play gym or just looks around a little bit. Often, he goes airplane mode and starts fussing though.</p>

<p><strong>Baby playing during the rest of the day</strong></p>

<p>During the rest of the day, however, things are very different. He refuses to play on his own. He does not really try to reach for toys, he accepts when we put one in his hands but starts fussing just 5-10 seconds later. During the whole day, we either directly play with him, often read him stories, walk him outside to allow him to grab leaves and things. If we play in a given position (say, sitting together in our bed), then he is good to play for about 15 minutes and then he needs to change activity. He refuses to be lying down and he does not enjoy to be in the carrier if he cannot reach for things to play with.</p>

<p>I would tend to think that his fussing behaviour is unrelated to the developmental of object permanence as he complains just as much if we are present but don't actively do things with him.</p>

<p><strong>Parent-specific behaviour</strong></p>

<p>In the morning, he typically is with me and during the day, he is with my wife (hence she gets most of the fussing). When I am present during the day (I stay at home about 4 days a week), he fusses just as much as when he is only with my wife. I am unsure as to whether our behaviour affects our son's envy to play on his own and whether we can do anything to make our son more at ease with playing on his own.</p>

(It started when we once gave him an off-brand formula, but then continued with our regular brand and we also tried a non-dairy variety.

"How to help my 5-year-old when other children don't want to play with him?","<p>My 5-year-old is in Kindergarten.  I work at home and I pick him up from the bus stop every day.</p>

<p>Everyday, the first thing out of his mouth after school is, ""Can I have a play date with so and so (person varies)?""</p>

<p>I really really want him to play with friends for multiple reasons - not the least of which being that I need to work, and I get less done if he's around - and so in spirit, I'm more than glad to grant his request.</p>

<p>In practice though it ends up being extremely painful.  </p>

<p>First of all, I don't think we've ever had somebody come to our door asking to play with him.  But, he's young, I don't know if that means too much.  </p>

<p>More importantly though, I watch him play with kids and attempt to play with kids, and it seems like they don't want to play with him.  I also watch the way he behaves around them, and for lack of a better word; he behaves ""<em>weird</em>"".  Other words that may fit are ""<em>annoying</em>"" or ""<em>socially awkward</em>"".</p>

<p>Today, I watched him follow a girl who's his age asking her if she wanted to have a play  date, while she literally ran away.  It seems like he's not quite present with people and not responding well to social cues (I don't know what I should expect here - but he seems not to be doing well).</p>

<p>This general sentiment is echoed by his Kindergarten teacher.  She says that he is often ""<em>annoying</em>"" to others, and often seems oblivious to social cues.</p>

<p>He has been evaluated by a psychologist who after watching a video of him interact with an intern for an hour decided to diagnose him with <em>OCD</em>, <em>mild Autism Spectrum Disorder</em>, and <em>ADHD</em>.  I don't entirely disagree with her conclusion, but if it's that easy to diagnose complicated physiological brain issues then it seems like the diagnosis is the same as no diagnosis.   </p>

<p>Regardless of what diagnosis he has, I still need to deal with this in real time.   I don't want to suppress him, and I also suspect that anything I do will make it worse (I'm not saying this is true - that's just how it occurs to me), but it's now becoming too painful for me.  I need to find a way to approach this situation more effectively - right now I find myself almost resentful of my child for <em>""making""</em> me deal with this.</p>

<p>I love my kid; and this post is probably less about him than it is about me.  He's great.  I find myself wanting so badly to help him avoid the discomfort that can follow social difficulties; and I am way too close to see clearly; but I want to find a way to interact with this so that I have peace <strong><em>and</em></strong> he develops appropriate social skills.</p>

<p><strong>Addendum</strong> - I forgot to mention that we have already begun work with the school, and in my opinion (though I lack any basis for comparison), we have some extraordinary individuals working in our school district who really seem to be competent and caring.  Also, we are sending him to <a href=""https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/treatment/applied-behavior-analysis-aba"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""ABA on Autism Speaks Website"">ABA</a> this summer for some of the time.  </p>

<p>I suppose my real question is - what do I do <em>now</em> - in the moment - as this is happening?   How do I interact with him about it?  Should I offer correction?  Should I just try to stop being so attached to how it looks, and let him work it out on his own? (Not that I am certain that I am capable of this). </p>

<p>I don't want to punish him; like he can't play with his friends - he has done nothing that deserves punishment - but at the same time, I don't want to just say, sure, go play with <em>so and so</em>; even though it seems clear to me that <em>so and so</em> doesn't want to play.</p>

<p>Or, maybe I'm trying to hard to protect him.  I've always considered myself to have a degree of skill with thinking things like this through, and finding a sane and empowering place to come from - and if it were someone else coming to me for advice about a similar situation, I'm certain I'd know exactly what guidance to offer; but with my own kid, I feel completely helpless.</p>

She's a Ph.d. in immunology, and is a very gifted researcher; so she plans to spend a lot of time searching for fun activities and strategies for working with our children to keep them active and learning while having fun.</p>

<p>However, we're both relatively asocial people who do very little with others outside of the workplace (or school).  We don't go to parties or have nights out with other people, and don't really even know our neighbors very well (they're all very nice, but we're just not chatty people).  We're naturally worried about our childrens' social development as it is; our 2.5 year old, who's been in daycare since he was 4 months old, is not exactly a loner but certainly tends to play on his own more than the other kids, and doesn't talk to other kids very much.  We live in the suburbs of a major city, so we have a lot of events we can potentially attend (story times and such), but the one time we tried story time, the then-2 year old did not enjoy it at all (although of course we're going to try again).</p>

<p>What are some strategies for not-very-social people can take to ensure their children receive a sufficient education in the social side of things?  How can we help them (particularly the 2.5 year old) start to make friends in our area?</p>

"What are some healthy ways to control the speech of a child when parents are absent?","<p>In Pakistan, according to Wikipedia, there are blasphemy laws which can even result in death.</p>

<p>In the USA, where I am, we have a constitutional right of free speech, which does extend to children (all constitutional rights extend to every citizen). Although there is some political and legal confusion around these rights, generally children can say nearly anything without any response from authorities.</p>

<p><strong>The question is:</strong> <strong>""What (and why) are some healthy ways to control the actions of a child (young adult), when parents are not present (e.g. at school) and the child may not completely internalize the seriousness of 
the matter at hand?""</strong></p>

<p>This question is a rephrasing of an original question, which is linked at the end of this post. The following is my consideration of the question.</p>

<p>If a young child is playing with something dangerous and they do not comprehend the danger, as a guardian, it's easy to overreact and cause an emotionally painful event.</p>

<p>One does not desire to foul a young person's fire (no matter if it is personal, political, religious, or ... in nature) with unnecessarily harsh or restrictive conditions. However, it is important that this vigour be realistic in nature. If it isn't real, it is in fact <em>pretend</em> and does not need to be respected.</p>

<p>If it is real, your child may be someone who is unafraid to speak his mind and seek real answers when presented with, in his mind, an insufficient explanation, and might be very successful in his adult life due to this.</p>

<p>Since the original question is a serious matter where the mother is concerned about the Pakistani law, I would suggest keeping the child at home / homeschooling until his life is no longer at risk.</p>

<p>I thought this was a very well formed and appropriate question, but it was closed, apparently without consideration to the seriousness of the subject.

"Should I trust the dogs instincts?","<p>There is a neighbor boy who is 6. I have a 4 and a 2 year old. The boys mom is nice, the boy seems nice (I can tell he's a coddled only child, but whatever). He's been over to play a few times with the kids but my dog (a friendly mutt terrior mix) and a different neighbor's dogs both don't like the kid. My dog who wouldn't snap or bite my kids if they were hurting her snaps at the kid for seemingly no reason. The other dogs (a chow and a st bernard) both act like they will break through the fence and attack the kid. My kids have gone in and played with the chow and st. bernard and they've not so much as turned an eye at my kids. This boy has a German shepard dog which is a nice dog (no evidence of abuse that is to say). So I'm at a loss. My parenting instinct says something is up as 3 dogs don't like this boy for seemingly no reason. I super-supervise when the kids play but nothing seems out of ordinary. So I dunno. Do I tell the kid never come back? Do I let my kids continue to play and just keep supervising? (A side note, when I speak to this boy he listens and respects my authority)? Or should i not really give this more thought?</p>

"How to handle a 10 year-old's scary imaginings?","<p>Our daughter has always been easily frightened, but a few days ago she ""saw a face"" in a bundle of blankets (in the middle of the day in a well-lit room) and became so scared that she couldn't bring herself to enter the room again.</p>

<p>We calmed her and told her that she was safe. My wife and I explained to her that her that our brains are very good at finding and processing patterns, especially faces. We told her how important it was for our minds (especially when we lived in the wild) to make us scared of things we can't explain so that we would flee from danger. She seemed consoled and appeared to understand.</p>

<p>Last night she woke up screaming and crying around midnight after seeing a disembodied face in her dream. My wife and I calmed her down and reiterated what we told her before. She was consolable, but it took some time. Eventually she went back to sleep.</p>

<p>Today she was cleaning out under her bed and saw another face, this one she described to my wife as far more graphic and gory. Now she's scared to enter her own bedroom.</p>

<p>She's always been the most emotional (extremely caring, very empathetic) of our children. She's the oldest of three. She shares a bedroom with her younger sister (5). She was really scared by a game she watched videos of online (Five Nights at Freddy's), but it hasn't been much of an issue for almost a year now.</p>

<p>Both my wife and I were very easily scared as children (and still are sometimes), so we know how she feels and what she is going through. My parents told me to ""suck it up"" when I was scared. My wife's parents told her that ""the monsters are real"" (demons) and put a bible under her pillow (which helped at the time, though we are no longer religious).</p>

<p>Edit 1: Today she confided in us that the spark that ignited her recent fears was a YouTube video, though she's been unable to recollect which one specifically. She says it wasn't a scary video, just one that happened to feature a disembodied face which her imagination ran with.</p>

<p>Edit 2: She let us know today that once her initial terror subsides she is able to investigate and confirm that there is nothing there. We're so very proud of her for this.</p>

<p>Any advice to get her through this? Does this kind of recurring issue seem likely to require professional attention / therapy?</p>

"At what age do childen develop empathy?","<p>My son is 18 months old.  He finds it hilarious to make our cats howl by pulling their tails.  I try to discourage this by firmly saying ""no"" and ""do not pull tails"" until he stops (which he quickly does), then reminding him that it gives the kitties an ""owie"" (a word I think he understands) and that we love our kitties and do not want to hurt them.

<p>I didn't catch the hair part, but I did see the roar out of the corner of my eye.  At the time all I managed to do was give the parents a brief ""WTF?"" look.  They didn't seem to care.

"Why do some parents have a favorite (or least favorite) child? How can this be avoided?","<p>Playing favorites with one's children is clearly a moral grey area at best...so why do we do it when should be treating all our children equally?</p>

<p>I'm a personality psychologist by training, and particularly well-exposed to <a href=""https://mctfr.psych.umn.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">heritability research through my alma mater</a>, so I can appreciate the power of genetic variation and individual experience on personality.

"Setting boundaries with parents regarding topics of conversation","<p>My mom is very upset with me about how little money I make at my job. She's mad because I recently finished school and have a large student loan to pay off. I've asked her not to talk about these things as it's never constructive and always leads to a bad argument. She always finds way to tangent into the subject from a related subject, for example she says ""I  think you should get a new job"" and I say ""why?"" and she says ""because you're not making enough money"". I've tried telling her I don't want to talk about work but then she says ""well if I don't know which days your working, how do I know if you're available to visit or not?"".</p>

<p>Things she says that upset me are ""I know a librarian who is making twice as much as you!"" or ""it's going to take you 20 years to pay off your loan at this rate"" (which isn't true). </p>

"Should I seek a diagnosis for dyslexia for my daughter?","<p>My daughter just finished second grade and will start third grade in the fall.  She was diagnosed with ADHD when she was 3 and a half.  We started her in pre-school at age 4 with an IEP, and she has had an IEP every year since.  She has always struggled in school.  Her handwriting is horrible, even now, and she can not spell even the simplest words like ""and"", ""let"", ""that"".  We have always just attributed it to the ADHD.  We hired a private tutor to work with her over the summer to try to get her caught up.  After a few sessions with the tutor, she suspected that my daughter may have dyslexia.  I took an online survey and gave her an online assessment, and both indicated she should be tested.</p>

<p>So I started reading on how dyslexia is diagnosed and treated.  It seems that the diagnosis process is complex and requires several tests and various specialists, etc.  And the treatment is basically an IEP with the same accommodations she already gets for her ADHD.  So my question is; should I bother with getting an official diagnosis?  Would having a dyslexia diagnosis be treated any differently than what we are already doing for her ADHD?  I ask because I have been through several of these diagnosis processes ,and they are expensive (high deductible insurance) and usually take several appointments spread out over several months.  If the end result is just another label for why she does poorly in school ,and no real treatment options, I'd rather not waste the time and money.</p>

"Do we NEED to help a baby learn how to self-sooth? And how long can it take?","<p>Before our girls were born, I told my husband that I didn't want to go through ""crying it out"" because I knew I wouldn't be comfortable with it. At the time he agreed with me.</p>

<p>However, after close to 8 months of sleep deprivation, and friends of my husband telling us about sleep training, my husband wants us to let one of the girls cry out.
He claims that she NEEDS to learn how to fall asleep by herself and that she won't learn if we don't help her.</p>

<p>I thought that babies/kids would learn at some point to fall asleep on their own, even if parents have been helping them the whole time (picking them up when they really cry).</p>

<p>Am I wrong thinking that with time, she'll learn? And is it something that can last for YEARS or is it more a matter of MONTHS?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> 
I'm mostly talking about the part where they fall asleep without crying at the beginning of the night, not so much about night wakings. My husband thinks that one of the girls can't learn by herself since she doesn't calm down with patting/singing/rocking, but only with nursing, which means we always have to pick her up (otherwise she'll wake her sister up).</p>

<hr>

<p>Context:
We have 2 baby girls of almost 8 months old, one of them sleeps ok(ish) during the night, the other one started refusing sleeping in her own crib about a month ago. We've been co-sleeping with this one, allowing her to nurse back to sleep more easily.</p>

<p>We have a bedtime routine such as: I come home and nurse them, we play/sing/read, daddy comes home and we give a bath, then pjs, some solid food (usually fruit+oat cereal), then we go to their bedroom, I nurse them again while we put some rain sound, we dim the lights and we read ""Goodnight moon"", we give a kiss/cuddle/say ""goodnight, we love you"" and put them down.
When we put them down, they are unfortunately sleeping and not drowsy (it hasn't worked AT ALL for us), and the bad sleeper just starts screaming as soon as she lands!</p>

<p>(Quick note: only nursing usually calms her down, when she starts crying and we pick her up, she's escalate even in our arms to a raging point that is pretty impressive :().</p>

<p>I did ask my parents, my brother, close friends how they got their babies to sleep and if they ever let their babies cry to sleep ; all of them said they would just pick up the baby and rock/cuddle/sing ... and that they didn't let their baby cry more than 5-10 minutes. However, all these babies were sleeping in their cribs / through the night (or at least a good chunk of the night) before they reached 6 month old.</p>

<p>I really would like to show my husband that she'll learn at some point to fall asleep by herself (I mean, teenagers don't have to be rocked to sleep, right? :)), and that letting her cry it out is not the only solution.</p>

"Tips for helping my 4-year old daughter transition classes at daycare?","<p>We've been sending our daughters to the same daycare for a couple of years now. Our oldest just turned 4, and is 13 months ahead of her sister. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, our daycare moved kids ""up"" in a facility wide transition (Two A -> Two B, Threes -> Four A, etc.) -- my oldest daughter had a hard time getting used to her old class (Threes), but absolutely fell in love with one of the teachers in that class, which by and large served as a type of security blanket for her. If Miss Daisy was out for some reason, my daughter was extremely reluctant to let me leave. She and Miss Daisy developed a great bond, which helped my daughter feel more comfortable in her classroom.</p>

<p>Now, she's been moved up to a pre-k style class, and her sister is in Miss Daisy's class. My oldest daughter is always <em>super</em> excited to go to daycare to ""see Miss Daisy"", even though it's only for a few minutes while we drop off her sister. The class that Miss Daisy helps in is very playful and creative -- when we walk in, kids are playing in dirt, doing crafts at the table, playing with instruments, playing with toys, just being kids for the most part. This is where the trouble starts though... because we leave Miss Daisy's class, and my older daughter is still <em>super</em> happy, all the way up until we open the door to her new classroom (across the facility). </p>

<p>Her new classroom is a stark contrast. This is Pre-K, not ""daycare"" I suppose. But, biasedly, I can see why she doesn't like it. It's incredibly quiet, no kids running around, no kids playing. Usually, it's a group of kids sitting at tables with a notebook, practicing writing with one teacher walking around helping; another group is siting in the floor in a quiet group, listening to the other teacher go through the days, months, etc. It's nothing like any class she's been in over the past two years. The class is legit ""school"", not just ""daycare"" like she's been used to (pre-k doesn't officially start until August, but I presume they're getting a head start since the kids are already in the class for the summer).</p>

<p>Anyway, I know I can't change the style of the class, and I know this transition is expected as she starts getting older. My question is, how can I <em>help</em> her with this transition? How can I reassure her that this class could actually be pretty fun too? When we walk into the class, she will hold onto me, telling me she misses me and doesn't like daycare (she used to), and refuses to go participate in the class until I carry her, or a teach comes and gets her, either way with her full of tears begging me to not leave her there.</p>

<p>What have been your strategies for consoling a tearful toddler in these sorts of scenarios? I <em>know</em> this is for the best, but how do I convey that to a 4 year old girl who doesn't understand why daddy is leaving her in this new class for 10 hours (2-3 times a week)?</p>

"What order should my child watch Baby Einstein?","<p>I just got the 26 DVD Baby Einstein collection for my little one and I'm a little surprised that there is no recommended viewing order.</p>

<p>I can't imagine that learning numbers, colors, sounds, etc. are all equally recommended to start with. There is no numbering on the disks, but there is something like a color code... at least my observation is such that the disks have labels printed monochromatically, some are blue, green, red, or brown.</p>

<p>The one called ""Baby's First Sounds"" has no language selection feature, but appears to be teaching baby how to make sounds like ""aah"" or ""buh"" but is associating these sounds with English French and Spanish words equally. For example ""ba ba baaaby"", ""ah ah los abeha"", ""ah ah anyu"". What am I missing here? Is it teaching multiple languages? That doesn't seem very primary.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the ""Baby Van Gogh"" teaches colors at a very primary level, as expected.</p>

<p>What order should these be viewed in?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1</strong></p>

<p>I did some more research. The color coding is to denote volume.
Volume 1 has a recommended age range of 0 to 24 months.
Volume 2 has a recommended age range of 6 to 18 months.
I don't know about the others.</p>

<p>Baby's First Sounds, the DVD I started with is the black sheep of the series. Widely recognized as a terrible product for teaching baby's first sounds with 5 different languages mixed in a random.</p>

<p>Thus far the viewing order appears to be: Volume 1, Volume 2, the other volumes at random minus ""Baby's First Sounds"". Baby's First Sounds goes in the trash.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>

<p>Assume my child is whatever age is appropriate for watching TV, that's the purpose of this question.</p>

<p>Feel free to recommend an order that specifically omits disks of questionable quality, or even omitting the video/sound of other disks, etc.</p>

<p>Much like most popular Star Wars viewing orders omit Episode 1, my incomplete ""so far"" viewing order would be:<br>
1. Anything with focus on music. Possibly only with sound.<br>
2. ?????<br>
...<br>
Specifically Omit: Baby's First Sounds, as it is garbage.<br></p>

"How to approach my little brother's addiction to TV and computer?","<p>I'm 26, my younger brother is 13. He is spending almost all of his day on TV and computer. Common problem, but I am really worried about him. </p>

<p>I came back to live in my parents' house since it's close to my school. </p>

<p>He is a younger son, our parents are getting close to their 60s, and they don't really have any educational agenda, nor the discipline to apply one. They are tired of fighting with him. They have consulted with a psychologist which insists they have to let him do anything he wants, so he won't feel an urge to rebel. I think this is super-stupid and can prove it with my own life. Even his school has a stupid ""democratic"" approach which says all kids have to do only what they feel like doing.</p>

<p>He is an artistic kid, he can enjoy playing guitar, woodcraft, board games, hiking, climbing, etc. But it's getting harder and harder to make him participate in those activities. It's also hard because we don't have enough discipline as family. I've decided lots of time to make sure we go out of the house together at least once a week but found it really difficult to follow.</p>

<p>What I need is a plan. A well planned change, involving our parents. We need a long-term change. My main problems are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How do I tell my parents about this? I want to get them alert, so they'll be motivated to make a real change, but I don't want to make them too worried. I thought of telling them everything, so they'll know they can't keep the situation as it is.</p></li>
<li><p>How can we restrict his TV and computer usage? I want to create alternatives but it won't work if he has totally free, unlimited access to TV and computer. I thought of a technical solution, but wouldn't it make him feel we don't trust him? (well, I don't..)
And what is a reasonable, non harmful time for screen activity?</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatives: I can think of plenty activities, but how can we make him participate? I find rewarding systems problematic - at a certain time in your life you have to be able to do stuff only because you choose to, not because you look for the reward. Is there a way of creating an intense, committing activities agenda without using power or rewards?</p></li>
<li><p>Discipline - How can we make sure it won't be a few-weeks change, but a long-term change that will last for the rest of his youth? Knowing that we have a discipline problem as a family..</p></li>

"Options when you feel your child is unsafe around another child?","<p>We are in the awkward situation where new neighbors have moved in and it would seem they have a very different parenting style to our own, which in our opinion has begun to affect the safety and well being of our children, I am wondering the best way to approach this situation as obviously it's very delicate and high emotions are involved.   </p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>

<p>We are fortunate enough to have a communal garden area that all the houses face into, where no cars etc can come through creating a great space for the kids from the area to play. </p>

<p>Our first child is now 4, and for the past 4 years, we have been able to take him out on the front and experience the pleasure of the other neighbor's kids playing with him and including him in games despite age differences. In the last year, we have built up to and began to feel comfortable to let him play outside on his own, providing he stays within a certain area and that he checks in roughly every 10 minutes (handily we can also see roughly the whole area from our landing window :) ). Many kids now ""knock on"" and ask him to come out :) </p>

<p><strong>The Change</strong></p>

<p>The first problem is the new parents seem to treat the area as a front garden i.e. a lack of understanding that it is used by other children/adults and therefore it is a place of potential confrontation, confusion, and danger. </p>

<p>Their children are 7 and 2, they put both outside the front, without any supervision for long periods of time, I don't know if they believe other neighbors are watching or their 7-year-old is capable of looking after the 2yr old. This concerns me but it has started to become a problem because the 2yr old has very little understanding of sharing or frankly danger. </p>

<p>On multiple occasions he has pushed my child off / snatched their toy, hit other children/animals, been found playing on the nearest road and running around with a Phillips screwdriver (real &amp; pointy). All this means I no longer feel comfortable to let my child play out on his own, I also no longer feel comfortable leaving my front porch open as the young child keeps removing toys/items from our front porch &amp; garden.   </p>

<p>Around 2 months ago, the young child would listen to me, and I was able to make some progress on the snatching and the front porch (I play with my child outside often, sometimes in games with their child, so I found myself present in times of bad behaviour), but recently he has to started to simply screech ""daaaaa""/run home/both, whenever I try and speak to him. This has to lead me to situations where I am trying to talk to him in the presence of his parents, to which they often say some variation of ""he doesn't understand what you're saying, he is only 2, you can't use words"", most recently this statement was delivered in a somewhat confrontational way. Disappointingly this often ends with the other parents ""snatching"" the item off the child and handing it to me I have to bite my tongue to stop me saying ""I wish you wouldn't do that"".</p>

<p><strong>Resolving the conflict?</strong>   </p>

<p>Obviously, this is a conflict of parenting styles, and every parent feels their own style is the best way and I feel quite horrible and snobby writing this but the way I see it, something has to change so either:</p>

<ul>
<li>I tell our child to play in the back garden more (and put lockable gate on our front)</li>
<li>I tell my child to stay away from their child (and put lockable  gate our front)</li>
<li>I have an conversation with the parents</li>
</ul>

<p>The first seems like simple cowardice and denying my child something he has earned the right to do (he built up to playing outside, follows/ed the rules and plays nicely). </p>

<p>The second seems like it would eventually lead to confrontation, kids are very honest and I could easily see him saying to their child ""my daddy says I can't play with you"", it would also be a shame, their child in my eyes is not a ""bad kid"" he can actually be very sweet and I have successfully played nice games with him, my son and my 1 year old. It really is just a lack of understanding. </p>

<p>Now the last seems the correct thing to do, but despite some efforts, we haven't really established a relationship with the neighbors (we are at the 'hello, how are u', 'not the come over for dinner' stage), so it would be quite hard to initiate the already difficult conversation. This almost seems like an interpersonal question, but does anyone else have experience of this situation, advice or tips? </p>

<p>I had one attempt at it last week, not sure how it went down. We went outside to play on my child's balance bike, but it was missing from the porch. It turned out that it had been left outside, and another neighbor was kind enough to keep it safe at theirs. Now I know 100% that when we put the kids to bed, that bike was inside the front porch. I do not know 100% who took it, but so far only one child has ever taken something from the front porch. So while playing with my child and his child, the father became interested in the game, and I tested my luck:
<strong>me</strong>: ""Small thing, his bike was left out last night, and I know we brought it in, I don't know how it got out. I know *** sometimes takes it from our front porch so could you talk to him about it and help me keep an eye out anyone else who might be doing it?"" </p>

<p><strong>him</strong>: ""It wasn't ****, i know, I saw another kid riding around on it""</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: ""oh, ok, do you know who?""</p>

<p><strong>him</strong>: ""no, didn't recognize them""</p>

<p><strong>me</strong>: ""Well, could you still speak to **** about not taking it""</p>

<p><strong>him</strong>: ""come on ****, [walks away with child]""</p>

<p>Its difficult to interpret the outcome, but I would say the problem got worse, not better. </p>

"How to inspire more creativity in play?","<p>My six year-old son got a Lego&reg; set for Christmas, his first because we finally don't have choking hazard age children in the house, but we've always had blocks and other building toys around.</p>

<p>I've always heard that children are naturally creative, and all you have to do is give them the tools and get out of their way.  However, although my son loves the Legos, he only makes the same thing over and over:  cars.  And it's not like he makes lots of different kinds of cars.  He makes nearly identical cars, and gets excited about extremely minor variations, like adding a single brick to the back.</p>

<p>I'm unsure how to respond to his excitement.  On one hand, I want to encourage creativity.  On the other hand, what he is doing isn't exactly creative.</p>

<p>When we encourage him to make something else, he insists this Lego set is only for cars (it's what was pictured on the box).  When we play with him and make something else, he says something like, ""Cool house Dad!  I'm going to make a car!""</p>

<p>How should I respond to his excitement over repetitive creations?  Should I even be concerned about them at this point?  Should we force him to try something else?  He almost certainly has ADHD, and possibly also something like Asperger's, if that affects the answer.  We are working on getting a diagnosis and professional advice.  </p>

"Coping and overcoming a rational fear","<p>On Friday my daughter was hit by a car while crossing the crosswalk to school.  (Side note: she was released from the hospital and appears to be doing OK, but taking her to a Dr for a full eval tomorrow.)</p>

<p>Now, this is obviously very traumatic!  The thing is that she comes to work with me in the morning and hangs out for about 30 minutes before walking the 2 blocks to school (and only one street with a light to cross).  She is 14yo and is reasonably fearful of having to cross that crosswalk again.  Also, I am unable to take time off of work everyday to take her fully to school.  It is a fear she must overcome in time and since she sees a therapist every 2 months (for ADHD, OCD, and a couple of other things I don't recall right now), she'll discuss this with the therapist.</p>

<p>My question is how do I as a parent (her pseudo-therapist) help her to cope and conquer this fear?  I know it will take time and that there is no substitute for that and the experience of the therapist should prove invaluable, but none of that substitutes for my responsibility as a loving father to help her.  What are your suggestions?</p>

<p>To be clear, I am not asking for medical, therapeutical, or any other form of professional advice -- only your suggestions as to what a loving parent can and should do.</p>

<p>Since this is clearly a matter of opinion and we are in a question-answer format, I'll be sure to choose someone whose advice seems most contributive in my subjective decision as the ""answer"", though I will value everyone's contribution!</p>

"Our 6 month old baby moans continuously","<p>Apologies if this is a duplicate, it searched for the question terms but found nothing similar.</p>

<p>Our baby is nearly 7 months old, and after being left to do anything for over 5 minutes, just starts to moan.  Toys, bouncers, TV, anything we give her won't amuse her for more than five minutes before she starts moaning and groaning with discontent.  The only thing that pacifies her seems to be us carrying her around.</p>

<p>My poor wife is going nuts at the moment.  I looked around and see <a href=""http://community.babycentre.co.uk/post/a21936345/baby_fussy_and_moaning_all_the_time_am_i_alone?cpg=2&amp;csi=2090691427&amp;pd=1"" rel=""nofollow"">other people having the same issues</a> for babies this age, but the forum posts lack any sense of solution!  While I know social interaction is very important, she's not lacking that I promise!</p>

<p>So I need to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this just a phase?  She's been like this for about 3 weeks now</li>
<li>Are her toys not ""interesting"" enough?  Should we provide 9-month toys?</li>
<li>Should we just leave her to moan?  We tried this but it was very hard with all the noise she makes</li>
</ul>

<p>Or anything else?  I don't have much hair left to pull out.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Well, what an emotional weekend it was.  On Saturday my wife and I got so frustrated with the noises we both had to take time off to calm down.  </p>

<p>Then on Monday, she woke up and instead of the usual moaning, began making the cutest noises; part ""boo"", part <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowing_a_raspberry"" rel=""nofollow"">raspberry-blowing</a>, part shriek of joy with a massive smile, part trying to say words (as close as she can figure!).  She's also suddenly starting moving her arms and legs as if trying to crawl, and I suddenly feel some serious bumps under those gums.  </p>

<p>I also bought some 9-12 month toys.  Although she doesn't realise what a plastic steering wheel is for, she seems content to try moving it and pressing buttons, so I guess that's helped as well.</p>

<p>While this may not be the end of the moaning per-se, it <em>does</em> obviously subside, and the reward as a parent listening to the result has been worth every minute of the previous grief.</p>

"Fake driver's license discovered -- how to deal with situation?","<p>My 17-year-old daughter leaves her purse in the car, even at night. This is really unsafe, even for the city we live in. I wanted to teach her a lesson about the dangers of leaving valuables in a car and unfortunately chose to look through her purse so that I could say something like ""Imagine if someone had a hold of your wallet/money/valuable etc."" The reason I said unfortunately is that because of this route I took, I ended up discovering a fake out-of-state license; and clearly my daughter isn't of legal drinking age (21 in our state).</p>

<p>Now I'm stuck in a rut. I know I shouldn't say ""I searched through your stuff, etc., and found this, what do you make of this..."" because this is a breach of trust, and I regret it, but at the same time I'm so deeply concerned that she's underage and using this ""license"" as a way to bypass legal requirements.</p>

<p>What should I do? How do I ""confront"", albeit not the right word, but how do I deal with this?</p>

<hr>

<p>After reading through the answers here I went for a diplomatic approach instead of trying to aggressively force the issue. She told me the license was only used to bypass the age 21 limit at some concerts which I could see making sense but she was clear she had not used any alcohol although that was my assumption initially. Overall things were cleared up smoothly and I have all of you to thank for the advice!</p>
"
"Toddler has a strong preference for one parent","<p>Our almost 2 year old toddler has developed a strong preference for me. In mild doses, this was acceptable but it is getting pretty out of hand. She cries when my husband, her father, tries to hug her, kiss her, put her to bed, etc. He literally has to bribe her to spend time with her - bribing with TV, or going to look at flowers, etc. But if he just wants a hug from her - she cries and runs towards me.</p>

<p>This behaviour is causing problems both of us: for me, it's just tiring. And for my thick-skin husband - well, he is still human and craves his daughter's love. </p>

<p>Now, there are some things she will go to him for. For example, usually, my husband is the one who replaces all the batteries in the toys, turns the TV on, etc. So if she needs something done - i.e. a toy is broken because the batteries are dead, she'll readily say ""Dada fix"" and take the toy to him for fixing. If he insists that she hug him before he fixes, she'll just drop the toy and move onto something else.</p>

<p>My husband and I both work full-time; however, I work from home (we have a separate caregiver) so she does see me more. On a day-to-day basis I probably spend an hour more with her than my husband (no commuting :)). I spend time with her by drawing, reading books, singing nursery rhymes, swimming, etc. My husband spends time by taking her gardening with him, playing in the sandbox, building blocks, going on walks, watching TV, etc. My husband and I alternate waking up in the morning for the kids (and feeding them breakfast), as well as cooking dinner (which our daughter ""helps"" us with). </p>

<p>Suffice to say, I don't think it is the issue of how much time we spend with the kids - I think we are fairly equal in quality and quantity of activities. </p>

<p>Did other parents have this issue? How did you resolve it? Is it something they grow out of?</p>

<p>There are more as you go further back. There are also other questions not explicitly about gender that mention gender roles in their answers.</p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in gender-equality, and I want to avoid, as best I can, reinforcing gender stereotypes. In order to accomplish this, it would help me to be aware of <em>when</em> children begin to be affected by bias.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> that it's likely that different types of bias will begin to affect children at different stages of development. Interaction with nuclear family may influence a child much earlier than, say, the fact that you usually only see super-buff males on comic book covers or fit, airbrushed models on fashion magazine covers. </p>

<p><strong>At what ages or stages of development are children able to be influenced by cultural gender roles, biases, and stereotypes in their varying forms?</strong></p>

<p>If all forms begin influence at the same age, that's fine. That just means I'll have to begin being aware of them all-at-once and strive a little harder to be balance out external forces (including my own habits).</p>

"How to handle a defiant 2-year old when he takes something he shouldn't?","<p>My very strong-willed 2 yr 10 mo. old son is curious about everything in his environment, which crops up as a problem now and then if something delicate, expensive, or dangerous comes into it.  Eye glasses, cell phones, computer electronics, tools...</p>

<p>He'll take the item and start examining it; sometimes this .  Invariably an adult will cry out, ""Put that down!"" or similar, but rather than obey his instinct is to hide the object behind his back and/or run away.  Then, if chased, he <strong>throws</strong> the item (discarding the evidence of his misdeed?)</p>

<p>I'd like to hear if other parents have had this problem, how they dealt with it effectively?</p>

<p>[Update]
So what I've taken to doing these past couple days when he takes something is, ""Oh! , do you know what that is called?""  This gives him pause.  ""What?""  Then I tell him the name as I move closer to him.  ""Do you want to know where that goes?""  I put my hand on his shoulder or back (just in case).  ""Yeah!""  Then with my other hand I point to a specific spot on a table or desk.  ""That goes right <strong>here</strong>.""  Then when he puts it down I give him a ""Good job!"" or ""Thank you!"" and either pick him up or give him a hug.  This has been working well so far.</p>

<p>As per some of the suggested answers, when new things come into the house I'm also going to try to proactively give them to him to look while I can supervise him, on the theory that once his curiosity is satisfied the danger will lessen.</p>

<p>[Update #2]
He's now nearly 8 years old and has a little sister a couple years younger.  The technique I described in Update #1 mostly worked (as long as we didn't freak out and directed him elsewhere, he'd lose interest in the item).</p>

<p>HOWEVER, this same behavior still crops up used with his sister.  He'll snatch some random item she's interested in - a toy, blanket, article of clothes, whatever - and run off with it chortling as she chases, screams, and cries.  (And she in turn has learned to do the same to him.)  I'd actually forgotten about this earlier behavior but in hindsight it's probably the same thing.  We've had to just instill in him that the ""Snatch Game"" is one of the worst misbehaviors he can do with a very stern talking to, that police throw people in jail for doing it, etc.; I can now just ask, ""You're not playing the snatch game again, are you?"" and he immediately hands the item back to his sister.</p>

<p>All in all, this was a tricky behavior to punish because half the motivation is to stir up a reaction, and a harsh punishment (or threat thereof) is an acceptably exciting reaction to get.  </p>

"Should I encourage siblings to compromise and collaborate?","<p>Often when there's a chance to do something special as a family -- say, watch a movie together, or bake some cookies -- we let the three kids decide exactly what we are going to do.

I try to put guidelines in place so obvious poor choices are ruled out (one kid hates peanuts, so peanut butter cookies aren't a choice for group baking).</p>

<p>The preschooler is pretty happy to go along with whatever. However, his older siblings (7 and 11) tend to make a choice and then dig in their heels rather than look for an option they would both enjoy. Once the youngest gets older, he'll doubtless start to form his own opinions and make the situation even worse.</p>

<li>Attempt to choose between them (and attempt to keep track of who ""won"" last time)</li>
<li>Refuse to proceed with the activity until they agree on something (which seems to encourage the most stubbornness, rather than be the sibling who gives in first)</li>
<li>Let everybody have their way (we end up making 3x too many cookies and watching 3x too much TV!)</li>

"How to get toddler to eat eggs?","<p>A long while ago my 2 yr 9 mo old son decided he did not like eggs.  He was good enough to taste them (and re-tasted them on a couple later occasions), but he made up his mind he just does not like them.  If we even put a little on his plate he'll pick them up and put them on our plate, and remind us ""I not like eggs!""</p>

<p>The problem is we frequently have eggs for breakfast, so he's missing out on half the protein (he'll eat sausage just fine so I'm not really worried).  My 1 yr old daughter <strong>loves</strong> eggs and will gladly scarf down his share.</p>

<p>He's a picky eater in general, it's not just eggs.  But I've read <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/102/how-do-you-feed-a-picky-eater"">How To Feed A Picky Eater</a> and some of the other questions on this site and it gives us some ideas.  But I'd like to focus a question specifically on eggs since we eat them almost daily, which both makes them an important staple and a useful thing to experiment with.  </p>

<p>Anyone have good tricks for getting their kids to eat eggs?  Would fixing them differently be worth trying, or would continued pushing just turn him off eggs permanently?  How common is it that kids don't like eggs, and then like them when they get older?</p>

<p>[Update]
My son is now a 4 year-old, and still the most picky eater you can imagine.  We've tried all the ideas people have suggested; mostly it just turns into a big power struggle (he's quite a strong-willed kid), so we don't bother.  Eggs are the least of our concern now - anything we fix he'll look at and declare he doesn't like it, even though he's never tasted it.  At Easter we did find that he likes the whites from hard boiled eggs, but only a nibble, and only if the shell's been dyed green.</p>

<p>We've instituted a rule that when we have dinner, we're all going to eat what's fixed, and if he doesn't want it, he can have something different only after mama's done eating.  Unfortunately, he's fine with that; he just goes off and plays.  But at least mama gets to eat with the rest of us rather than doing speciality catering.</p>

<p>This last weekend I started working on helping him learn about money, buying things, and earning money for doing jobs.  On a whim I said I'd give him a nickel for each thing he tasted that he'd never eaten before.</p>

<p>And goodness, this has worked.  The first time, he held his nose took a taste of my spoon and rushed to the sink to spit it out.  Okay, well he tried it at least.  But then he returned; ""Daddy, can I taste that again?  Mmm, can you put that in a bowl for me?""  He learned he loves mama's stew.  Last night he discovered that pot pie is actually quite yummy.  Corn chips are great too, but not salsa.  And... he voluntarily tasted scrambled eggs (twice!); just not his cup of tea.  This whole other world of taste is opening up for him, at the low low cost of 35 cents.  :-)</p>

"Is it okay to raise a child by teaching them numbers in base 16?","<p>Would it be child abuse to raise your child by teaching them numbers in base 16, so by the time they reach school they can count to twenty, but only in base 16? Would this stunt their growth? Just to clarify for all the people that don't know what this means, it means that they would count like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11... 18,19,1A,1B,1C....</p>

"When and for how long should a baby and one-year-olds be allowed to cry?","<p>So, this question is inspired somewhat by <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/11288/2876"">Do we Need to help a baby learn to soothe itself?</a> as well as my own experience with other people's children and my own.</p>

<p>Many mothers are reluctant to let their children cry at all, but there are times when a child just isn't consolable, there is sleep training that includes letting them cry and a host of times when a parent might just need to take a deep breath and a minute or two in order to regain patience for listening to a baby cry such as a colicky baby and step away for a bit to calm themselves.  I generally felt that it was my job to teach my baby I was there for her and that meant responding in some way when she cried - even if my response didn't always stop the crying, but I don't remember reading anything that made me ""know"" that.</p>

<p>It seems to me there are a lot of beliefs around how much crying a baby should be allowed to do, or not.  While I don't buy into this line specifically (considering it an old wife's tale), I've even heard, ""let her cry, it'll help her lungs develop"" from my mother in law.  </p>

<p>What is actually <strong>known</strong> about when babies should be allowed to cry without consoling (I know sleep training methods all pretty much agree never before six months - but why six months and not seven?  What is the developmental sign they are ready to cry a little without consoling?).  Even then, for how long should they be allowed to cry?  Are there <strong>scientific studies</strong> that show certain lengths of time at certain ages to either be helpful or harmful?  What can a mother of a child that just can't be soothed be told in regard to how much crying is okay and how much is too much?</p>

"How to lessen a depressed teenager's absences?","<h1>Some context</h1>

<p>Dad died unexpectedly on 2014 and mom was murdered on 2017. This has caused a myriad of problems for us. It's just me (26) and my brother (16) left so I have to to be a parent figure to him. Due to these events, I was diagnosed with mixed depression and anxiety and my brother was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Due to the symptoms of this disorder (mostly suicidal thoughts), he was forced out of an exclusive scholarship school on grade 9 (but still passed), and dropped out on grade 10 from a private school that I chose. He is now continuing grade 10 on a public school. If it matters, he is living with my aunt and only visits me on weekends so I am mostly managing him remotely.</p>

<p>Currently his teachers report that he is capable and intelligent and gets high marks in his tests so far. He was previously a consistent honor student before the diagnosis.</p>

<p>It is the last of my mom's unfulfilled dreams to have us complete our education. So the pressure is on us to accomplish it.</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>He is absent 1 to 3 times a week with any of a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Health issues: Stomach aches, headaches</li>
<li>The most prevalent: Dark days. He describes this as mentally unable to do anything and physically fatigued.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although teachers have expressed concerns on his absence, it is likely that he will graduate junior high but I am worried that this behavior is carried over to senior high and college which might be more strict.</p>

<p>I am trying to balance how not to stress him out (esp. to the point of having suicidal thoughts) but still being able discipline him.</p>

<h1>What I tried</h1>

<ul>
<li>We are both seeing a therapist (separate) and a psychiatrist (shared). We are assessed to be doing well since there are lesser suicidal thoughts and we are in the process of tapering off our meds. His therapist has given him techniques to survive dark days like grounding and joining. Both doctors agree that he should not stop school even temporarily as doing so will be detrimental to his mental health.</li>
<li>I have offered incentives. (e.g. ""If you have no absences for a month, I will buy you that headset that you wanted."") No incentives have been claimed so far. Harsh ultimatums/negative reinforcement (e.g. ""If you are absent one more day this week, I will have you delete Mobile Legends forever."") has worked but I'd like to avoid it if I can.</li>
<li>We have an agreement where he has to go to school even if it is a dark day and just go to the clinic to rest if it becomes unbearable. The therapist agrees that this deal is reasonable. He is sometimes able to do this.</li>
<li>Since I am also experiencing dark days myself and am working full-time, we have an agreement where we limit both of our absences to once a week then slowly work it down to once a month. Based on his performance, I will decide whether or not to fund his college education. He will instead go to college on his own pace, terms, and resources. My logic is 1) some colleges are attendance-based. You will be dropped if you don't attend your classes regularly. 2) I refuse to invest my money in an uncertainty and 3) having no college education is not the end of the world. There are lots of successful people that are not college graduates. My brother has failed to uphold his end of the bargain so far. Therapist says that this might cause too much stress and I must dial it down.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>What other ways could I lessen his absences? What am I doing wrong? </p>

"What to do with an adult child with a mental illness and drug taking","<p><strong>Family history</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We have a strong family history of suicide, mental illness and drug addiction.  </li>
<li>My brother had died (the coroner stated suicide) two years after my husband died. He was a crystal meth addict and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.  </li>
<li>My husband's sister committed suicide many years ago.    </li>
<li>My cousin committed suicide a couple of years ago. He had been a heroin addict and struggled with drugs his whole life.  </li>
<li>My sister attempted suicide and was in ICU in an induced coma for many days. She has bipolar.  </li>
<li>Another cousin has schizophrenia, and is a chronic drug addict.   </li>
<li>Other sisters of my late husband have attempted suicide and so has his mother.  </li>
<li>I've attempted suicide in years gone, I suffer from depression and a complex PTSD. I'm on medication and am strict about it, and combined with health issues which make it difficult for me to do things physically, it's put strain on everyone in the family. </li>
<li>My son is 23, his father committed suicide when he was 9. Something he's never really come to terms with. </li>
<li>He has a younger brother and sister,aged 17 and 16, respectively.  They seem less affected by their dad's death, maybe because they cannot remember him. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>There was a lot of stress in our home when he was aged 14. My mentally ill sister was living with us and my mother. My sister was psychotic much of the time and would try to kill herself if I tried to get her to find another place to live. Finally I got her removed by the police. It was a difficult decision, as I was petrified she would commit suicide, but I was torn and distressed by the affect it was having on my children.  </p>

<p>We had always been close, until he left home and went to live with his aunt (his dad's sister), who hated me and still does. She refers to me as a murderess and blames me for my husbands death. She also has no boundaries and would rubbish me in front of my son without any care to the damage she may have been doing. </p>

<p>She actually tried to get me arrested for murder, even though he gassed himself in his car, was sober and drug free and his fingerprints were on the tape and he left a note.</p>

<p>I know this as my son has since told me. I couldn't do anything to get him back, despite being locked in the court system for over a year, as he was too old.</p>

<p>His siblings and I didn't see him (maybe twice) until he turned 18. </p>

<p>By the time he came back into our lives, we had moved to a 3 bedroom home. There's only room for him if someone shares a bedroom. We had discussed him moving back in, and he's been reluctant. Although we've become close again and see him regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>By the time I saw him again he was smoking marijuana daily and has done ever since. He has also experimented with drugs and cannot stay away from them. Ecstasy, acid, some other designer drugs, crystal meth occasionally and cocaine.</p>

<p>He had a full blown psychotic/manic episode when he was 21 and was hospitalized. He came off the medication earlier than he was supposed to. He is still supposed to be on Lithium. He doesn't see a doctor about any of this. </p>

<p>He is in danger of losing his job and cannot return until his mental health has improved. He is now on indefinite unpaid leave. </p>

<p>He's bingeing on drugs and is not well, though sometimes he will be quite lucid and sound ok. I think this may be the drug taking. </p>

<p>He's moved into a dump, where he hasn't paid any rent yet and it's killing me to watch it. I find it difficult to talk about. Easier to write about. It's very draining.</p>

<p>His brother and sister are so supportive and help to keep an eye on him.  </p>

<p>I don't know what to do. When I broach the subject with him, he always has a surprisingly and disarming logical argument for everything and I find myself even doubting he has a mental health issue. When I spent a few hours with him, it was clear he was unwell. He's a bit like a young child, it's really sad. </p>

<p>He is wary of me and anyone who confronts him about his mental health. He reacts badly to what he perceives as a betrayal, which in fact is an attempt to get him health care. My mother is talking to him and trying to get him to visit her.</p>

<p>I've called help lines. We've been through this, literally, dozens of times with my sister (and late brother) and she has been turned away from hospital many times, unwell. We have to wait until the person is past the point of no return in terms of psychosis.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do. He's not acute enough for an ambulance. I'm reluctant to call the mental health team. They will probably visit, but they're unlikely do anything at this point, which will cause another drama. I don't want to make the situation worse. </p>

<p><strong>What I'm looking for</strong></p>

<p>As a parent, how can I best help him? Is there anything I can do that will help? What can I do to help myself and my other children cope?  </p>

<p><strong>I know professional help is what is needed, but here I'm looking for emotional coping and parenting skills, rather than medical advice.</strong></p>

"Should we add a team sport (soccer) specifically to an already pretty full schedule?","<p>My child (7, nearly 8 and going on 16 - yes, all one child) is involved in Theater, Children's Choir, takes piano lessons, and has Tae Kwon Do (TKD) 4 days a week (she is in the black belt club and working hard at moving through the advanced belts) <strong>and</strong> takes 30 minutes of swimming two nights per week.  She also does 45 minutes of playing tennis with her Dad at least once/week and sometimes twice per week.  She loves all of these activities.</p>

<p>Since we home school, having such a full schedule isn't as bad as it would be if she also had to do homework in the evenings and is, at this point do-able.  However, she would like to add <strong>more</strong> theater <strong>and</strong> participate in beauty pageants.  She is also interested in trying soccer.  The idea of adding soccer to her agenda intrigues me as she does not currently have a team sport and I'm sure there is a lot to be gained from participating in one.  </p>

<p>Theater really requires a lot of team effort though too so I'm not sure how critical it is to add a team sport since our plate is already so full of activities.  I've already told her she can't do pageants, choir <strong>and</strong> theater though and would have to choose one to let go in order to add in pageants. (Piano actually counts as a music class for her schooling.  </p>

<p>TKD is already paid for in full for the entire next two years.  She is in the ""Black Belt Club which means she has set a goal to attain Black Belt status within the next two years and can start doing weapons classes which she is really excited about.  Giving up TKD at this point is simply not a realistic option.  The swimming is important to me so that she can safely swim and float if ever in a situation around water where these skills are needed (I grew up on an island and my parents still live there so we are on boats and around the water a lot).  The Tennis is important time with Daddy.  </p>

<p>I have been putting off starting soccer until I am comfortable allowing her to drop the swimming lessons, but she still can't float confidently on her own or swim across the pool without assistance.  At the same time, I am concerned that if we wait too long, it may be hard for her to get on a team as a beginner with the other kids having had years of practice she will have missed out on.  </p>

<p>How important is it for her to have the opportunity to play specifically in a team sport?  She is obviously getting a lot of athletic activity as well as opportunities to practice working well with others.  Even things like learning to pass the ball (in the sense of sharing the spotlight, not the actual physical skill) are addressed in theater as who gets the focus or spotlight shifts and changes throughout a scene and has some parallel skills and thinking that is required.  Should I make her choose between theater and soccer?  Should we choose to drop something else to make room for soccer because there are things she can get from being a member of an athletic team she is not getting elsewhere?  Or should I continue as I am and hope she gets to a satisfactory skill level with Swimming this year before the soccer season begins in full?</p>

"At What age does a child generally recognize their shadow is their shadow and will do what they do?","<p>This question was inspired by <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/11348/2876"">At What age does a baby recognize themself in a mirror?</a> and the memory it brought up for me of the day we were on a family ""hike"" at a local botanical garden and my daughter (age two?) looked down and started flapping her arms.

"How to make my 5-year-old niece understand that I try very hard to be honest with her and wouldn't lie, when she implies I do?","<p>My 'honorary' niece is 5 years old.  The other day I made a comment about how she was lucky to have a mommy who is always honest to her (referring to the fact that her mother was upfront and honest about things some parents are afraid to touch on, such as where babies come from, who her biological father was, or the truth about Santa Claus etc.).  She responded to my statement about her mother never lying by asking ""like you lie?"", implying she thought I would lie to her.</p>

<p>This is the second time something like this has happened.  In both cases it was a very honest sounding statement, I don't think she was trying to be mean or imply anything, she just honestly thought that I would lie to her.  This upsets me precisely because I go out of my way to be very honest with her like her mom.  I always give honest answers to important questions and never try to avoid answering them.  I also try to never tell little white lies to her.  In general I believe I'm far more honest with her than most adults would be as it's been a very intentional commitment to be upfront with her.</p>

<p>My only explanation for why she would think I would lie to her is because I will play games or make believe with her.  For instance I'll pretend to have fallen asleep, so she can jokingly 'wake me up'.  I may also do something like pretend to eat a piece of plastic food and jokingly insist it was yummy when she asks what I did with it, even though she knows I couldn't have eaten it and will find where I hid it (or I'll show her if she didn't).  I'll make up games and jokes along these lines often, but I've always believed she was at the developmental level where she could clearly understand the difference between this sort of make believe playing/joking and serious situations where I would always tell the truth.</p>

<p>I've also occasionally given her some mini logic puzzles to challenge her, such as betting her I could walk on water and asking her if she knew how (by waiting for it to freeze).  In these sort of situations I'm using some poetic license with the truth for the sake of challenging her (i. e., ice is technically a different state then water), but I haven't done that sort of thing often and I always explain what I meant to her if she couldn't figure it out.  Again I wouldn't have thought she would consider that to be lying.</p>

<p>Why would she consider me capable of lying to her when I go out of my way to be extra honest with her?  If my games are confusing her how do I help her to understand the difference between make believe games and joking and serious answers so she knows when I'm being honest?  </p>

<p>I have told her that sometimes I exaggerate when were playing, but that I'd never lie to her in reality.  I've also always told her that if I promise something is true then it is, that I'll never joke about a promise.  Is there anything else I can do?</p>

"Mastering a foreign language without staying in a country to which the language is native","<p>I am not a native English speaker. What I would like to understand is - if a non native speaker who’s got a fairly decent command on the language (in this case say English) speaks to his or her kid in English, would it increase their kids grasp on English and the ability to comprehend the language better. In essence, does interacting with kids in a foreign language increase the kid’s grasp on a foreign language? I understand accent, pronunciation, modulation, intonation all these aspects play an important role but my question is primarily about the usage, and by that I mean the usage of words, grammar, phrases, idioms.</p>

<p>I would like to add one more parameter, If the family is not resident in a native English speaking country, and in future if the kid travels to an English speaking country would they be able to seamlessly integrate into the English speaking community (nothing to do with cultural values, in this context), and would their ability to comprehend, read, write and speak be as good OR nearly as good as the native speakers.

"What is the best approach for teaching toddlers not to drop items off the table at meals?","<p>During discussions with friends about our children (2 years and 16 months old) I discovered that some parents give their children ""normal"" (and thus breakable) plates and glasses. The reason is because in this way they learn that dropping them to the ground is bad (since they break).</p>

<p>I know also that some parents simply do not return objects if their children drop them down. </p>

<p>In my family, generally we use plastic plates and we return everything, trying to explain that is not good to knock these objects off the table. </p>

<p>I have some doubts regarding these three different approaches. I know that children have to respect some rules (and not dropping items off the table is one of these), but sometime they have to test their parents' reactions (both of them have to agree and to be consistent). </p>

<p>So on the one hand you have an efficient method in which the child plays a small role; on the other you have a less efficient method, but that constitutes many ""tests"".</p>

<p>I suppose what I want is some time with them away from home, where they can experience some of world with a little more freedom than normal, but not too much.  I hope (again, this is my pipe dream) that these experiences give us the opportunity to talk about what is out there in the world, both good and bad.  I dream that this would be both a bonding time between they and I, and also a time for them to take a small step into the adult world.</p>

<p>Travel always leaves me feeling a sense of wonder about the world.  Sometimes, I've felt maybe a bit threatened too - after all, it's not the home I know so much about.  But when I think about the confidence I've gained from travel, and the enrichment it's provided towards my understanding of the world, I can hardly think of anything more worthwhile to do.</p>

<p>This would obviously cost a lot of money.  So I am thinking like 7-11 years in advance here...  What do you think?  If this is a good idea, at what age would such an experience be best for a young woman?  How about a young man?</p>

"Does using antibiotics increase the risk of a child getting recurrent ear infections?","<p>My son, thankfully, went about 18-20 months without getting an ear infection. His first one cleared up naturally.</p>

<p>The second one didn't seem so bad, but he was given antibiotics for it. I wasn't keen on the use, because I'd heard that treating a child's ear infection with antibiotics can increase their chances of getting recurrent ear infections.</p>

<p>Since then, he had another ear infection necessitating antibiotics. It was much more severe than the previous times, and I do agree medicine was needed. He's now currently suffering from <em>another</em> ear infection (and a URI, and the combo meant a late-night ER visit last night).</p>

<p>Of course, my son has been getting more colds/illness in general lately, which I largely attribute to his increased exposure to other children -- more playdates, and more active play at parks.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm just wondering about the continued use of antibiotics to clear up ear infections. They seem to clear up the symptoms well enough, at least short-term, but he hasn't been not sick long enough for me to make any other determinations.</p>

<p><strong>Does using antibiotics for ear infections really increase the chances of getting recurrent ear infections?</strong></p>

<p>Could the earlier doses we gave to my child have caused antibiotic-resistant bacteria that keeps growing back? Or is this just a common way ear infections occur in children--low to no incidence followed by high incidence?</p>

<p>Here are some sites that mention the risks, although they're not where I first heard it:
<a href=""http://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/oral-antibiotics-for-ear-infections/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Choosing Wisely: Oral Antibiotics of for Ear Infections</a> and <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/antibiotics-for-middle-ear-infection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebMD: Antibiotics for Middle Ear Infections</a></p>

<p>From WebMD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Doctors sometimes prescribe antibiotics to prevent infections in children who are prone to repeated ear infections (recurrent otitis media). But experts disagree on how helpful this is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use of antibiotics to treat ear infections increases the risk for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p>

<p>I've seen and heard the claim that resistant-bacteria don't get fully eradicated, so the ""same"" infection comes back. I'll try to find sources when I can, but I think I've mostly heard this in passing (and not as the main point of an article or discussion).</p>

"When will my boy be able to tell me about his day?","<p>At what age could your kids reliably tell you about what went on in your absence? And how did you know it's reliable?</p>

<p>I have an almost three year old, and although he is quite talkative, it's still difficult to find out what he did when we weren't around. We prompt him with questions, but partly he might answer yes if he likes the answer (""Did you go on the swing?""), and partly he doesn't understand the concept of today (he'll tell me he had eggs for lunch, but that was last week). I'm curious at what point we'll be able to ask him what went on in daycare, and know that he's telling us accurate and recent stuff. I know that each child is different, but I'm curious about children in general.</p>

"How to get a 2-year old to take prednisolone","<p>My 2 &frac12; year old daughter has come down with <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001955/"" rel=""nofollow"">croup</a>. She has been prescribed <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0001486/"" rel=""nofollow"">prednisolone</a> which from previous experience is a bitter tasting and therefore difficult medicine to get children to take. Typically our twins take medicine easily but this is not the case with prednisolone.</p>

<p>I discussed this with the pharmacist who indicated the medicine could be ""hidden"" in juice etc. Unfortunately, the flavor of the prednisolone is overpowering the taste of the apple juice I mixed it with. She is slowly getting through it, but I hope someone might have a better idea.</p>

<p>How can I ensure my daughter takes her medication? Is there something I can hide it in that might cover its bitter flavor?</p>

"When (if ever) is it appropriate to spy on your teenager's texts?","<p>I'm an active member of <a href=""https://android.stackexchange.com/"">Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange</a> and recently came across <a href=""https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/62967/track-republic-wireless-texts-over-wifi"">this question</a> by a parent, asking for advice on spying on his teenage (I'm assuming) son's texts without getting caught. I suggested a few services which claim to do what he's asking for.</p>

<p>But it made me think. I'm not a parent, but I'm engaged and excited about parenthood in my future.</p>

<p>The first thing that came to my mind is that if I distrusted my teenage son to that extent, I wouldn't let him <em>own</em> a phone in the first place. And if I made the choice to entrust him with a cell phone, I wouldn't want to undermine <em>his</em> trust by discreetly reading his private conversations.</p>

<p>I personally support the ideas of open communication and privacy, and I'm thus <em>against</em> censorship and invasion of that privacy.</p>

<p>I would want my son to see me as a trusting and trustworthy authority - and I feel that reading private communications could disrupt that effort on two fronts:</p>

<ul>
<li>If he finds out that I'm spying on him, I could lose some of his trust .</li>
<li>If I find out too much of his personal life, it could affect my judgment and demeanor toward him.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I suspected my son was into something dangerous or illegal, wouldn't it be best to be open with him and try to be a source of support, rather than an antagonist?</p>

<p>Am I being unrealistic here? Is my pre-parenthood naivete combining with my open-source mindset?</p>

"What role do imaginary friends play in a child's development?","<p>My son, currently three-and-a-half, has taken to making constant references to his ""brother,"" who is apparently a wealthy businessman and property owner (he apparently owns several stores that sell whatever my son might imagine we need, such as a ""remote control space station that flies up and down"").  He also sometimes talks about his ""other grandmother"" (not my mother nor my wife's mother, both of whom my son sees on a regular basis).</p>

<p>While we're not really concerned about <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/2432/should-imaginary-friends-be-accepted-or-discouraged"">discouraging this imaginative play</a>, I do find myself wondering <em>why</em> imaginary friends like this are created.</p>

"Occasional Gift or Daily Reward?","<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a valid argument for not giving a child a present/reward daily or am I thinking to hard about this and it is perfectly fine to give a child a daily present/reward?</li>
</ul>

<p>So my daughter recently has really gotten into Pokemon cards and she just turned four a week ago. The other day I picked up a small $5 pack of her first cards and she was beyond happy. The entire way home she was even examining every detail of the pack and completely zoned out...</p>

<p>Anyways, I am trying to decide the best option to give her more. There are some Ebay lots that I am thinking of bidding on to get a good deal on some old, used cards for her. Some have upwards of 300 cards and are going for like $20-$30 or so. Given that she does not really know how to play the game at this point or anything I feel like this would be a way to give her a new card every day, after she correctly writes her daily alphabet letter, does something without me asking, etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand however I am also thinking that buying and giving her such a large or constant reward might... dull the effect?</p>

<p>I'm also worried that it might get her into the mindset that she deserves something everyday?... I would appreciate any thoughts from anyone that has been in this type of a situation and made the wrong choice or knows a reason why I should or should not be so worried, etc. <strong>Any ideas on different approaches to giving them to her?</strong></p>

"I'm losing it, with a talkative toddler, a colicky baby, chores, work, and lack of sleep","<p>I have a daughter who's 3 and a half, she's bright but <strong><em>always</em></strong> talking and is now at that ""why everything"" age.</p>

<p>I have another daughter who's now 4 months old. For the first 3 months she had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_colic"" rel=""noreferrer"">colic</a> which is now ""getting better"" but she's only ever learned to scream her bloody head off (think Nazgul from Lord of the Rings, literally, except way, way louder) -- so now, <em>if</em> she makes any sound at all, that's the sound she'll make. Hungry? Eeeee! Bored? Eeeee! Happy? Eeeee! Incessant screaming for no discernible reason, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. My wife, at least, can breast feed her which will shut her up for a while ... but (if my wife has any milk) she will throw most of it up again, and we'll have to clean her, her clothes, and whatever she managed to hit. It's come to the point where any sound from here will make me think ""shut up, shut up, shut up...""</p>

<p>Big sis a morning person, up at 6 at the latest. Little sis is a night owl, wanting her last meal at 10 or 11, and occasionally at 4, too, so we are getting very little opportunity for sleep or, you know, all the other stuff that goes into a household, a relationship, an adult life.</p>

<p>We're getting zero (quality) sleep, we're exhausted and we're breaking down, both of us.</p>

<p>Right now I'm home alone, typing this while listening to Run DMC at full blast (which is nowhere near loud enough), after my wife took the kids to the playground because I was sobbing  uncontrollably over yet another batch of dirty baby clothes.</p>

<p>My wife is at home, has been since before birth, and will be for another two months. Then she will start working again. She's totally not ready for that. No sleep, no energy, no milk, no quiet, no sleep, repeat.</p>

<p>I have been working all along, but will reduce my hours in two months. Honestly, work (especially the commute) is a haven: people are behaving like grown-ups (mostly), not (much) screaming, but I dread going home. At the same time, I feel bad for leaving my wife alone with that noise machine.</p>

<p>On top of that we have all the ""grown up stuff"", too. Dishes, shopping, replacing the washing machine before it breaks down, finding a replacement pc backup service (our old one is shutting down, and backups are import). Fortunately money is not an issue, but we we have zero time, zero energy, and don't have room for a nanny.</p>

<p>I'm supposed to be the lucky one, or the strong one, because I'm not dealing with that havoc all day long, because I get to go to work. Yet I'm breaking down after ""only a few hours"" so my wife does not dare to take a (much-needed) retreat somewhere not-home.</p>

<p>How the hell do you guys stay sane?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>We are paying for house cleaning. We <em>could</em> also pay for groceries, but don't even have the time to figure out available options. Similar for other ""grown up stuff"", we find it difficult to ""out-source"".</p>

<p>We have some family nearby; they're either seniors, or busy same-age-as-us-folks who have, on occasion, taken the older one in for an overnight stay (and a fun time before/after). <em>Once</em> she stayed for two nights, but this brings me to my next point: The minute my wife is not <em>with</em> her children, she misses them so terribly (I think I could go a few days without seeing my kids, if I can say that without sounding like a horrible dad). I have not sought therapy or professional advice (yet, perhaps I should look into that).</p>

<p>Edit the 2nd:</p>

<p>Thanks for all your nice responses, and the edits to this post. I am going to respond to answers as comments to those answers.</p>

<p>Edit, 3rd edition! Ah, look at that. Little sis is teething! That surely explains some of the hollering. Well, thanks to your responses, and some thinking and growing on my part, things are a bit better now.</p>

"How to discuss art which includes mild adult content with a child (around 8 years old)?","<p>I recently started to give English lessons to my niece, who is nearly eight. My main method for learning vocabulary and pronunciation is listening to songs and discussing them. </p>

<p>So far we have been listening songs like ""twinkle, twinkle..."", and today I promised her that we will soon move to more difficult and interesting ones. She asked me, what kind of, and as I started saying, probably,  Disney, she interrupted me by: ""Can we do Lady Gaga's Bad romance?"" I said, if the grammar is accessible, we can and we finished our lesson.</p>

<p>Then I actually listened to the song. And here comes the question:</p>

<p><strong>How do I discuss the lyrics of ""Bad romance"" with a child?</strong></p>

<p>First I doubted whether I should do it at all. My general approach is that if the child is interested in something she should get the explanations. Also it creates a great motivation to learn language, since we follow her interests. She is really excited about this song and tries to play it on the piano.</p>

<p>But I would really like to hear advice on how to do it and how much understanding I should expect. Moreover, what exactly is unhealthy for a child with regard to sexual content?  </p>

"What to do with my spoil (GROWN) children","<p>When my children (2 boys 2 years apart) were born, I was working and the children were left in the care of their father. He is not the best role model; his constant drinking and gambling has been a issue our entire marriage.</p>

<p>My fault, I feel, in all this was being to scared to divorce him because of what people would think and being the only bread winner in the house made it hard with two small children. Also, I held on the hope that every time I threatened to divorce him he would change but he never did.</p>

<p>At 16, my oldest dropped out of school and also had a felony. At 16, my youngest dropped out of school and had a set of twins with his girlfriend as well as a couple misdemeanors.</p>

<p>I gave my older boy a body shop which he ran with his father; it was shut down for illegally swapping parts, that cost me a good $100,000. Their father went to prison for 6 years for drug trafficking.</p>

<p>I thought with that bad influence out of their lives they could have a chance to do something for themselves. </p>

<p>I started giving them both $2500 a month to invest, live off, make some money out of, which of course they spent on cloths, games, movies, etc.
I cut them down to $1000 a month which I thought was pretty harsh but would motivate them, and I gave both of them a dispensary, I figured they smoke weed all day and it was legal in Michigan so they should know a lot about it right? Wrong, the city shut them down due to zoning, which was not their faults, however in the 6 months they were open they made no money. That was another $75000 down the drain.</p>

<p>In a last ditch effort to make something out of them, I leased them both brand new vehicles, the agreement was in order to keep the vehicles they either had to go to school or work and pay be back each month for the cars. They both came to me about month before school was suppose to start to let me know they would not be working or going to school, so I cut off the $1000.</p>

<p>Now they don't talk to me, except when they have talked to their father to let them know I am hording the money and keeping it from them, as well as other poisoning of their brains.</p>

"Good Mom or enabler?","<p>I have 3 grown children. The middle child is 28 yo and left home for the ""big city"" about 5 years ago. My husband and I have watched her go from a happy, funny, creative young woman to an increasingly depressed and always struggling young woman. We know she has abused drugs and alcohol, hangs at the bars all the time, her house is a filthy wreck. None of this behavior is acceptable to us. She wasn't raised like this. </p>

<p>However, we try to butt out and let her find her way. It seems like the only time we hear from her is when she is in yet another crisis and needs money. When she calls, I ask pointed questions about where her money goes. I feel there should be some level of accountability if she is consistently depending on us for support. There has been times when we didn't hear from her for weeks on end. At one point, we learned she has been diagnosed with lymphoma and had gone through treatment never telling us about it. (Was this a lie? Others in the family think so) I felt deeply hurt by this. We help all our kids when they need it. But I'm torn between being an enabler and being a helpful parent. </p>

<p>I watched my younger brother shred our family with his addictions and I really don't want this cycle repeated. I'm trying to respect her privacy and I never shame her on her appearance, hygiene or housekeeping though it bothers my husband and I greatly. I try to lift her up all the time (drunken 2 A.M. calls, bailing out of jail, rent and power bills paid repeatedly) and it's hard to watch her struggle. I don't do it for her love and attention and I always say to myself, if she can just get through this, it will turn around. I just want her to be happy. I always have to check my own motivations, though. </p>

<p>Am I a codependent parent? Should I butt out and let her figure things out? I don't want her to think I don't care but I also don't want to be a doormat. Right now, every step I take with her feels like a wrong one and I'm exhausted from worry. She has lost friends in her circle to suicide and I'm terrified she might choose this route. Her siblings reassure me she is just a selfish jerk and has been since she moved out. Is she, really? Or does she need help? I would really appreciate some feedback here.</p>

"Infant has trouble falling asleep","<p>My son is 6 months old and falls asleep to the movement of his swing. When we put him down to sleep, he gets super cranky and throws a fit (I think). </p>

<p>When my husband tells him no, our son cries hard and my husband says that's my son's way of understanding. I feel our son just gets frightened because of the stern tone in my husband's voice. </p>

<p>What can I do to getting my son to not act this way? Is it to early to be telling him no and teaching him at this age?</p>

<p><em>Edit: additional information incorporated from various comments:</em><br>
He will push himself up in his swing to where he nearly is over it even strapped in. The swing is safe, but he's too long for it. I have a crib but my son likes to sleep in his swing. I've tried transitioning him multiple times and it doesn't work. He has slept in his swing since he was 2 weeks old. He falls asleep to the movement of the swing and sleeps to the movement. </p>

<p>When our son starts crying and in my view throwing a fit, we both tell him no or that it's not OK to do that. We don't yell or spank him we just talk to him and tell him no. My husband puts a more stern tone in his voice when telling him no as to when I do it. And I think that's what scares him.</p>

<p>He has multiple toys and activities he does throughout the day. The only time he is in his swing is to sleep. Nothing else. The only time he's constantly in it is at night when he sleeps through the night.</p>

"How to help a 3-year-old with vicious temper to express his emotions in a healthy way?","<p>My three year old boy (the middle of three boys; older brother is 9, younger brother is almost 2) is smoldering with anger pretty often. He flies off the handle at little things. I've dealt with a good share of tantruming with my oldest, who had a speech delay and sensory issues, but this is something else. At the least, he's nasty - he glowers, talks through his teeth, and says very rude things. At his worst, he goes into fits of rage: eyes wide, red face, sweat, teeth and fists clenched, screaming, kicking, biting (if you come near), throwing things, knocking over furniture, breaking toys, shredding books... I have tried letting him ""work it out"", but after 45 min of this my other children are terrified, and, my tantruming child's asthma starts to rear its ugly head and he starts to gasp for air. </p>

<p>I have tried attempting to teach him ""healthy"" outlets for his anger - such as bouncing on an exercise ball (which worked for my oldest), counting, deep breathing, and using his wonderful vocabulary to just tell me he's mad. So far, nothing has worked. </p>

<p>Usually, as is typical for this age, this starts because he is being unreasonable (I want to be naked at school!), or misbehaving (stealing chocolates from mommy's special candy dish). </p>

<p>I firmly believe he is transforming shame, disappointment and sadness into anger. I bought a book that illustrates feelings (designed for pre-schoolers) and he furiously, adamantly, skips the two pages that talk about ""sad"" and ""embarrassed.""  That's when the ""mad face"" shows up... how can I teach him to feel sad, shame, etc., in a healthy way?</p>

<p>I am hoping someone can offer some advice on how to help me help him calm down before he even gets to that point.  He needs help that I am apparently not capable of.  I know he is in hell when he feels that mad, and I am prepared to accept I am doing something wrong so I can fix this. </p>

<p>He never hurts himself on purpose (thankfully).  But I am concerned he will accidentally. And, now that he shares a room with his baby brother, I am concerned for him and his belongings. </p>

<p>My last resort method is to put him in the shower - fully clothed - to snap him out of his rage. He often forgets what he was initially mad about and so is suddenly mad about the wet clothes, which I immediately help him with, and then he begins to calm. It takes several minutes for his breathing to return to normal, and then, he sleeps. </p>

<p>Does he need professional help perhaps? Nothing traumatic had happened... he's just got a really short fuse. It all boils down to this: it is probably an aspect of his personality (being quick tempered) and we want to channel it now before it has a devastating effect on his life. We all know how repressed anger can destroy someone and how equally destructive it is if allowed to be expressed freely as well (it's difficult to have friends, relationships, jobs, if one is flying off the handle frequently).</p>

<p>My husband and I have looked at our own behavior and are doing our best to <strong>always</strong> stay calm, and to acknowledge and talk about the times when we aren't (we're only two humans working full time and trying to raise three boys after all!). No matter how calm and even we are though, his temper is as strong as ever.</p>

<p>We discipline using the three warning system and time outs. The time outs are less and less effective because they turn into tantrums. We started using more positive reinforcement for good behavior (less emphasis on bad behavior) and this has only given him the idea now that he is invincible and can torture his brothers and get away with it.</p>

<p>We are totally stressed out by him, and feel really sad that our happy go lucky baby has gotten such a mean streak.</p>

"While on vacation, how can I balance toddler's needs with parents wants/needs?","<p>Most toddlers are creatures of habit and routine, and our toddler is the same. She is happiest when she has consistent mealtimes, naptime, and bedtime. When we go on vacation, however, we undoubtedly break that routine due to flights, long drives, hotel stays, restaurants, etc. I believe the exposure to new sights, sounds, and stimuli is good for her, but I can see that the lack of routine leads to lack of sleep and irritability. </p>

<p>Many countries don't have dinner options before 7 p.m. (some much later) which means staying up past bedtime if we eat out. Nap time will be on-the-go, not in a crib due to check-out times from hotels and our (selfish?) desire to sightsee. I'm happy to spend some time at playgrounds, but I don't want to only see playgrounds when there are centuries of art and culture to explore. </p>

"How do you respond to unfriendly parent volunteers at your kid's school?","<p>I'm starting to believe it's due to the past year's issue that we had in my child's class. A kid bullied him, but it was never caught, so the teachers and this parent volunteer (that helped out in the class all year) started believing that my son was lying all the time and doing it for attention. This incident caused a lot of issues with my son not wanting to attend school to the point where he'd cry in the mornings because he always got in trouble for telling 'lies' as well as continuously got picked on by the bully.</p>

<p>But this year has been going well in the class for him since the bully is no longer in the same class. We've had no problems with him coming to school and being pumped for a new day.</p>

<p>BUT- a new issue has arisen.  </p>

<p>These past two weeks I've been dropping my son off at the cafeteria for breakfast. The same parent volunteer from last year now monitors the cafeteria in the mornings. </p>

<p>I thought at first it was just this person's personality but I'm starting to notice that they never respond to my greetings and that they act differently towards my son. Very short towards him and isn't 'happy-go-lucky' with him like they are towards the other kids that come in. This morning, after they happily greeted the other parents coming in, their demeanor changed when I looked at them and smiled. They shot a glance at me then looked away. I simply brushed this aside as it isn't much of an issue for me personally. But the fact that they're acting unresponsive or that their emotions are dull towards my child kind of irks me a bit and is heartbreaking that my son is so excited to say hi to them in the morning, only to be brushed aside... </p>

"Is visiting museums worthwhile or beneficial for a toddler?","<p>Would visiting an art museum, history museum, etc. which is not specifically geared toward children (i.e. not a ""children's museum"") be good for a toddler?</p>

"How to get your toddler to ask nicely for things when they're grumpy?","<p>We taught our son really early on to say and sign, ""Please"" when he wants things. We've never responded to his demands when he wants something, and have him ask nicely first. We also encourage ""thank you""s and give him ""your welcome""s. He's better signing these than saying these, we accept signing just as we would speaking.</p>

<p>We'll usually have to prompt him, with a ""How do you as nicely?"", ""Can you <em>ask</em>?"", ""Candy, <em>what</em>?"". However, he's now doing it on his own increasingly often.</p>

<p>The problem we have is that sometimes he'll just absolutely refuse to ask for something, and start crying or exhibiting a (really cute) grumpy demeanor. We've never given in to him behaving this way, so we're not sure why he's trying these tactics. The only factor that seems to be at play is that he's usually less cooperative when he's very tired, but it's not consistent. </p>

<p>I know the title of this question mentions only asking nicely, but I'm sure there are similar behaviors (saying things consistently) that could be helpful.</p>

<p><strong>So, how do you encourage a child to ask for things, when they usually have no issue with it but are currently in a grumpy mood?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I ask because of an incident the other night. Our son has found the see-through storage bin that has a rather sizable collection of unopened Hot Wheels cars. He continually tries to get into the closet to get some of them. He goes as far as clearing the closet door, opening the closet, and pulling bins off the top of the toy bin just to open it up! We don't have any problem with him having the cars, since they're technically <em>his</em>, but we do want him to ask because not only is it polite but it helps us track how many he's getting. We don't want him getting too many too often, as the supply isn't infinite.</p>

<p>Anyway, we stopped him from getting into the bin and told him he needed to ask nicely for the cars before he could have one. We were being quite sincere, and explained to him that he definitely <em>could</em> have one if he just asked (whereas sometimes he asks for things spontaneously, like cookies, and we say no). However, he cried and pouted at us. After 10-15 minutes, he ended up without a car simply because he wouldn't ask.</p>

"How do we determine the right amount of babyproofing?","<p>We have a young one finally starting into the adventure of mobility.  It's very exciting, but we know our house has never been babyproofed.  It's going to take some work to get it safe.</p>

<p>However, there's lots of different opinions on what level of babyproofing is desirable.  Some turn their house into a balloon animal farm of colorful corner protectors, edge protectors, and floor mats.  Others appear to believe that if they turn their house into a jailhouse of 3 foot tall baby fences, their child will never get to any dangerous situation.  Still others appear to take the Spartan approach of ""If the kid survives, they're probably tough enough to be worth raising.""  Some of them can be spotted adding caltrops to the child's playpen to accelerate the learning process.</p>

<p>Clearly there's a lot of personal opinion as to levels of babyproofing.  We're going to have to find our own opinion.  However, do you guys have advice on what to look for, both in our child and in ourselves, to figure out whether we have enough babyproofing?  What are the best ways to look at the situation we are in at any given moment, and decide whether the house is too unsafe, too obsessively safe, or just right?</p>

We are going to be moving in the next couple of months, about 500 miles away. </p>

<p>We brought her with us to look at some houses the first time around. She was a trooper (6 houses and about 3 hours) and loved the ones that had ""stuff"" still in the bedrooms, claiming her room in each house :)</p>

<p>We all paid a visit to the school she would be attending as well. She did very well there also. Had a great time with the soon-to-be first grade teacher and interacted well with other students.</p>

<p>I'm mostly concerned with her leaving her friends <em>here</em> before we go. Her birthday falls about 3 weeks before we plan to move. That will basically be her going away party as well. The next door neighboor who has a little girl that is one year older that we're going to be leaving as well. </p>

<p>The area we are looking to move to is also pretty secluded (mountain town, lots of hills and trees). Our closest neighbor will be within walking distance, but not in plain sight. </p>

"Making reading books the only option on long car commutes a bad idea?","<p>I have a 7 year old son in 1st grade. His school is rather far away, and it takes about 40 minutes for me to drive him there. We are a very busy family, and so I want this time in the car to be ""time well spent."" </p>

<p>What I've been doing for the last few years is allow him to play educational games on his Leap Pad portable game system in the car. This has worked well on a number of different levels. Firstly, he's received a good jump start learning basic math, grammar, spelling, etc. Secondly, we live in a country where few people speak English, and so the games (which are all in English) help expose him to verbal and written English. This English language exposure is very important to me because I want him to be a competent bilingual. He also greatly enjoys playing the games (note: I only allow him to play them in the car on long car trips).</p>

<p>However, one thing that has been bothering me is that my son doesn't like to read (he says that books are boring). I read a lot of books when I was a boy, and I would like for him to have a more positive attitude towards them. </p>

<p>Anyhow, the other day I told my son that he won't be playing his Leap Pad in the car this week and gave him two books to read (not in English, because he is not as good a reader in English as he is in his native language). He refused to even look at the books and just stared out the window for the duration of the trip. The the day after that I told him the same thing, yet he somehow managed to find an electric toy lying around in the car and played that instead. The plan is to remove all forms of entertainment from the car except books and hope is that that eventually out of sheer boredom he will pick up a book and give reading a try. </p>

<p>My question is, am I doing the wrong thing by taking something away my son enjoys so much (i.e. the Leap Lap) that has shown to be beneficial? Is it possible that this strategy will backfire and make him dislike books even more? I don't think that he completely despises books because before bed I read to him English language picture books, which he enjoys. Also, I've seen him thumbing through some of the books we've read together on his own which is very promising. </p>

<p>Another thing to consider is that within a year he will probably ""max out"" his learning potential with the Leap Pad. That is, the difficulty level of the arithmetic, grammar, etc. problems won't be challenging enough for him. </p>

<p>Also, I imagine that it should hard for a book to compete with an interactive gadget complete with sounds and audio? Perhaps studies have been done on this. I am worried that prolonged exposure to the Leap Pad and other electronic interactive media will make it more difficult for him to find pleasure in books in the future.</p>

<p>Maybe I've written enough? Given the situation and concerns stated above, does anybody have any suggestions? Continue with the book only policy? Try something different?</p>

<p>NOTE: While I appreciate the numerous comments and responses on fostering a love of reading, very little has been said about the use of electronic media. If I allow him to use the electronic media in the car and allow him to choose his time freely he will most definitely not be reading.</p>

<p>In response to comments below:</p>

<p>Regarding car sickness: good point that I didn't think about. However, I don't think that this is a problem because I've had him read books out loud with me in a moving car a number of times. However, that is something that I am definitely going to pay more attention to in the future.</p>

<p>Regarding book selection: the books I gave him to read are not English books and were picked out by my wife (the language they are in is not my native tongue). Honestly, I haven't really looked at them. He is interested in bugs, trains, cars, and, superheros. I purchased some train themed comic books in his first language but was chastised by my wife because I guess that she thought that they were too difficult? Anyhow, he didn't really look at them. I feel more confident picking out English language books. Maybe giving him non-English books to read in the car was a mistake. I have been assuming that he should be a better reader in his native language and that he is not yet ready to read English books on his own but I am probably wrong. I purchased a set of Batman and Superman I Can Read books so we will see how that goes. </p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>Yesterday my son picked up a kid oriented graphic novel that we had read together and started reading it on his own! I posted this question to SE the day prior to that so I didn't have time to implement any of the ideas in this thread. So I guess maybe I was doing something right all along! </p>

<p>Regarding the school commute, I think I am going to mix things up a bit. I'm going to give him English language books that I know he enjoys (rather giving him books in his first language that I have no idea if he likes or not; I suppose that it is wrong to assume that a child should begin reading on his own using books in his native tongue). I'm also going to try playing educational English language podcasts in the car like Brains On! and Wow in the World. The rule was previously that the Leap Pad could only be played in the car for longish trips (maybe over 30 minutes). Maybe I'll extend that to one hour.</p>

"How to explain to kids why others have better things?","<p>I recently read an article about how kids' birthdays are becoming a huge deal and a  status symbol for both parents and kids, which leads to kids whose parent can not or do not want to throw lavish parties feeling left out and depressed. The article had proposed schools dialling down on gifts and parties that happen in their supervision. But that solves only a part of the problem.</p>

<p>The bigger picture here is that no matter what we do, kids are going to figure out some people have better things than them. Could be a bigger house, a fancier car, more lavish birthdays, more toys.. anything, really. As parents, how do we explain to kids why others have things that we do not? </p>

<p>As a child, my parents once told me we don't have as much money as someone else that's why we cant buy [something], and I immediately heard that as we're poor and felt terrible about it. I'm not convinced this is the right argument to present to a child, even though its sometimes the real reason. Should we talk about the value of things, how if something is worth its price? The question still stands, how come the other kid's parents have it though?</p>

<p>P.S : I don't have a specific age group in mind, although I'd think kids would probably start to understand social differences at 5?</p>

"Teaching my son a language he doesn't want to learn","<p>My stepson is a six-year-old native Japanese speaker. When my wife and I first met and as we started getting more serious in our relationship, we didn't put a whole lot of effort into attempting to teach him English. Every time the topic was broached he was very adamant about not learning it. </p>

<p>At the same time we got married, I also legally adopted him. If there came a point where my wife, his mother, who speaks Japanese and English, was unable to be with us for a long period of time and I needed to convey something to him that was important, I would most likely need to do it English. </p>

<p>I am already actively learning Japanese. I take regular certification tests to note improvements and while I am a little more than conversational, I am still not quite there yet. With what I am about to ask, please keep in mind, I will continue to learn Japanese. </p>

<p>We have discussed this and my wife and I believe it is time that he does indeed begin to learn English. The kindergarten he goes to is already an English speaking school and he takes an hour long English program every couple of days at the same school. On top of that, I would also like to teach him at home, starting with the alphabet. </p>

<p>I informed him that I would begin teaching him next week and he was not so thrilled about that idea. This is not a debatable matter. Our parents had us go to school to learn about math and science and then when we got home, taught us how to clean our rooms, brush our teeth, and make our beds; all these things were a necessity. We both believe this is a necessity, not an extracurricular.</p>

<p>The question is: how do I coax my son to learn English <strong>while making him a willing participant?</strong></p>

<p>I don't want to go the route my parents or so many other parents take when ""encouraging"" children to do better in school by grounding them or taking things away. This will only push him further away from wanting to learn. </p>

<p>At the moment, he watches a lot of T.V. Probably too much, but that's a separate issue. I was thinking of starting during the time that he watches T.V. If I take this time away though, he will be mad and discouraged from studying with me. If I don't take the time away though, we won't have very much other time to study (by the time I get home, he's already home). Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>

<p><strong>Update Time:</strong></p>

<p>It's been a month since I asked this question and I took a fair amount of advice from most of the questions and I have to say, we've made substantial progress; more progress than I could have ever expected. </p>

<p>First of all, from <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/a/31655/4348"">Stephie's answer</a>, I stopped speaking Japanese completely and went full English. At first he continually asked me ""Hey, why are you speaking English now?"" but he always engaged and never ignored me. Coupled along with this answer and several other answers/comments that suggest make spending time together fun with me, I found a common activity we can do together. <a href=""https://minecraft.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MineCraft!</a> </p>

<p>We both really love video games and MineCraft is something we can both play, and enjoy ourselves. Since I used to play consitently for 2 years straight, I understand a lot of the mechanics of the game. This allows me to explain things to him in English while still having fun. It takes a lot of pantomiming and pointing to my portion of the screen but it works for the most part. The game also encompasses a lot of vocabulary used in the real world so it really helps when we aren't playing too!</p>

<p>I also noted <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/a/31659/4348"">T.E.D.'s answer</a> and put that in the back of mind to acknowledge. Perhaps with a little one on the way, he is worried about losing some love. Mama has continually reassured him that it won't happen and I'm doing more actions that <em>show</em> I love him unconditionally rather than just saying it.</p>

<p>Also some answers noted to get out more with other English speakers. We went camping with another couple like us, English-speaking husband, Japanese-speaking wife and their daughter. My friend spoke to him in English only and we all had a good time. My son even started calling me daddy after seeing my friend's daughter say it to her daddy :-) He doesn't do it consistently but every time he does it makes me pretty happy.</p>

<p>Everyone, thank you for the advice and I will also welcome more answers as our progress continues. Removing the pressure and just having fun has gone a long way.</p>

She will be starting pre-K next month, so we would like to start building good learning habits by using the homework books we get from school as practice.</p>

"How to help a 7-year-old who is stuck on the wrong answer?","<p>We have an almost 7-year-old son, a 4-year-old daughter and our oldest daughter is mentally 3 years old because of cerebral palsy. Almost every day we show a two-minute children's video to all three children, then ask a question about it.  The question is usually relatively simple as it involves recall of a fact, and does not require analysis or even comprehension.</p>

<p>Yesterday we ask our son the question, and he gives a completely irrelevant answer from a completely different part of the video.  We tell him that's incorrect.</p>

<p>We ask his little sister the exact same question.  Sometimes she knows, sometimes she doesn't know, and sometimes we suspect she pretends to not know because she finds it cute and fun.  However, she is four years old, so this is a learning experience for her, not something we expect her to already be able to do.</p>

<p>We ask his big sister the exact same question.  Sometimes she surprises us by knowing.  This time she thinks it's a game to not know because of her siblings' responses.  I whisper the answer to her and she gives it.</p>

<p>I ask the little sister the question again and she answers correctly this time, having heard her sister give the correct answer after I whispered it to her.</p>

<p>I ask our son the question again, who was quiet and looking directly at his sisters when they each gave the correct answer to the exact same question.  He gives the exact same off-the-wall answer he tried to give before!</p>

<p>We know from previous experience that he will usually get stuck on that answer.  We can repeat the cycle a few more times and he will give the same answer, so now we just give up and try it again tomorrow.  We think he is so focused on trying to give the right answer that he is thinking about his best guess for it, and forgets to listen to what's going on around him, even though outwardly he appears to be paying close attention.</p>

<p>This happens two or three times per week, and what also has us concerned is that sometimes he may not really understand a correct answer he gives, but just got lucky at guessing which random phrase we will ask about.</p>

<p>Which would be easier on the child? To already have one we made? Or to adopt, then have one we made? It's common for children to feel like they are not getting as much attention when a new baby comes and would that be worse for an adopted child?</p>

"Is it normal for a 3-year-old to always lay down when playing?","<p>I have a 3-year-old grandson. It doesn't matter where he is, ice cold tile floor or on his bed, he lays down to play. </p>

<p>I've read that in some children this can be a sign of a learning/sensory disability but he is a very precocious boy. One item I did read about that related to him is he doesn't like to be held upside down.  He does seem to have a type A personality where everything must be perfect or he has a serious fit. </p>

"How to deal with a stubborn but brilliant child?","<p>I have 2 boys, aged 6 years and 4 years respectively. This concern is regarding the younger one. He has been very stubborn since birth. But on the other hand, I believe he is very brilliant and has a lot of potentials. Started speaking at a very early age and is very creative and active. Always trying to find something. There is no place left to hide things which he doesn't know of or discovers by himself. Moreover, he can create incredible stories by himself and narrates them.</p>

<p>He started kindergarten this year and until now have not made any friends. Today I spoke with his class teacher and she said that he speaks only with her and doesn't communicate with any other teacher. Eats food by himself and doesn't share with anybody. Have not made any friends. The teacher asked him many times about his best friend, he pointed to a girl but he never spoke with that girl. The teacher made him sit with the girl but he doesn't speak with her. Maybe he just likes her :-) </p>

<p>Each night he tells us that he doesn't want to go to school and cries. The teacher also told that he cries especially when he arrives in the morning. The reason is that he wants to meet his elder brother who is in Grade 1. Both travel by bus at the same time but the classes end at different times, so they come separately to home.</p>

<p>We convince him to go to school on a daily basis saying that there is a salad day or color day or we are going to put something special in the lunch box. During competitions at school like individual or group rhyme competition, he just says that he doesn't want to participate. During playtime, the kids are taken to the playroom, he just stands outside and says that he needs his brother.</p>

<p>At home, he is good, always playing around with his brother and cousins. I usually take them to a play area at least 3 times weekly and he plays nicely on all the toy cars but he is always with his brother.</p>

<p>What I felt is that if he is able to make friends at school, then the school would be more enjoyable to him. Maybe he just misses his brother. I was thinking of taking them both separately to the play area on alternate days just to make them used to each other's absence. Is he trying to seek attention? Or any other issues which I am not able to understand? Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.</p>

"Regression in sleeping for a seven month old - is that normal?","<p>Up until 6 months, we didn't try to train our child to sleep to any particular routine; fed her on demand through the night.  At about 6 months we started to cry it out, and after one unpleasant night of howling, she quickly adjusted to sleeping around 6 hours at one go. Lucky us, I thought, having heard many stories of people taking weeks to train their child to sleep.</p>

<p>However, in the last two weeks she's begun to crawl, sit up and stand, and this has coincided with her struggling to go to sleep; whereas she'd been going to sleep in ten minute or less, without crying much, she's now back to bawling for up to 45 minutes.  She'll sit up, lean back, bang her head on the side of the crib, then crawl around, sit up, bang her head again, ad infinitum, while continuing to howl.</p>

<p>Is this normal? Should we adjust our approach now that she's more mobile?</p>

"What to do when minor son is drawn into religious group?","<p>I have a son from a previous relationship. He is 8 years old and lives with his mother. I am now married and have two other kids, and he is with us regularly about 20% of his time. I have shared custody.</p>

<p>He recently mentioned he has been visiting Sunday prayers with his mom and her new boyfriend for several months in that new ""church"" they attend. I inquired some more and found out that the group in particular is an evangelical group. I have some experience with this group because part of my extended family belonged/still belongs to the same group.</p>

<p>I consider myself on the very atheist end of the spiritual spectrum, while his mother has been a moderate catholic, like most people in our environment. I have been raised moderately catholic but left as soon as I was an adult.</p>

<p>I recently attended a wedding ceremony of that very group, and the sermon included a stab against ""people who don't believe in anything"", who they apparently loathe. I felt directly addressed. I also know of some people from that group who have cut ties with close family members that didn't want to join their circle.</p>

<p>So this creates a bit of a tension field and I am worried he might be slowly drawn away from me.</p>

<p>His mother hasn't mentioned anything yet; she and I are not on the greatest of terms, and our relationship has slightly degraded lately. I suspect this also has to do with her new religious orientation.</p>

<p><strong>How do I approach this topic with his mother?</strong> I do not wish to interfere with her spirituality, but when it comes to my son being taught that people like his dad are ill-guided poor souls, that is not something I take lightly either. Am I wrong to think she was supposed to tell me when she introduced him to that group?</p>

<p>And also, <strong>how do I talk to my son about this?</strong> I always encouraged him not to believe what others tell him to believe, but to find out what it is that works for him. I would never tell him that his mother's actions might be bad for him, but I do sense some cult-like tendencies in this group that I would like to protect him from without rising fear in him.</p>

"5-yo getting violent","<p>My son has always been kind and never got us worried before. Never had any issues.</p>

<p>We recently relocated and he had to change school. The school assigned buddies to everyone because they had merged two Reception classes and thought that would help the kids settle in.</p>

<p>My son's buddy turned out to be quite bossy: he tells my son off, sends him to do ""errands"" and so on.</p>

<p>We tried not to pressure my son to much and being supportive because we understand he's going through a big change.</p>

<p>Last week we received a calls from school that he'd thrown a stone into a door and broke the window. He was actually throwing the stone back to a class mate that had missed him. So the outcome could have been worse.
My son was very sorry about the broken glass and was sad.
We decided not to punish him. We asked what happened and explained why his actions were wrong. The teachers too were quite (maybe too much?) understanding.</p>

<p>Today he's received another note because he slapped another child, without reason. When asked, my son said he doesn't know why he did it. The other child did not provoke him.</p>

<p>Me and my wife don't know how to handle this. As said my son has always been kind and had never hit anyone before.</p>

<p>I'm afraid his new friends are having a bad influence and spoke with the teacher but she replied ""let boys be boys"".
If from one side I agree this will help him handle that kind of people when he gets older, I worry he could end up being violent and bullish.</p>

<p>What should we do?</p>

<p>UPDATE: Turns out my son didn't actually ""slap"" the other kid. The boy didn't respond to my son's call so he pat him to get his attention.
Also I've seen my son throw apricot stones in the garden the other day and he almost hit himself. I asked him to throw a rock and still it didn't go that far. Definitely not enough to break a decent glass door.
It looks more and more like the school is excessively strict on small mistakes while failing to address actual bullies.</p>
"
"Almost 9 year old regularly seeking attention","<p>My boyfriend's 8-will-be-9-in-a-month daughter is with us for the summer.  Her mom lives many states away so summer is dad/daughter time while mom has her for the school year.  <strong>I am having troubles with her trying to draw my attention to her every 10-30 minutes.</strong></p>

<h2>Some background:</h2>

<p>When she came to us, it was really obvious that she is behind developmentally.  Last summer she could successfully shower herself with no issue when she and her dad stayed the weekend at my place.  The first several days this summer she could not wash her own hair because mom washes it for her until I walked her step by step how to.  She also struggled with brushing her hair.  Single digit addition &amp; subtraction was a struggle.  She has poor fine motor skills compared to what I had at her age.  We've gotten her able to successfully shower on her own again, as well as brush her hair without issue.  She's practicing math each day with some games and it has gotten much better.  I'm not asking about any of this, I just want to give context here.</p>

<h2>Details of the issue</h2>

<p>She wants to be constantly near us and is seeking our attention.  Some ways she does this:</p>

<ul>
<li>My boyfriend and I had just walked over to the kitchen area from the living room where she was working on a puzzle.  Within minutes, she's walking over to give a hug. We were still in sight of her &amp; the puzzle.</li>
<li>When I have to take her to work so that she is not alone all day she is sitting right next to me and says things like ""Look"" to get me to look at her craft.</li>
<li>When I am working from home, she is downstairs on the couch playing/entertaining herself while I am working on the computer.  I am in sight of her and she still comes over to hug me / ask me questions (start conversations) / try to get me to look at something.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dad yells at her when she does this, such as  ""Stop coming over here just because we are."" ""I told you to play in your room.""  I tend to start gently reminding her the rules. ""What did I say about bugging me at work?  Drawing my attention is bugging me.  I need to concentrate.""  I get more forceful each time I have to repeat myself. </p>

<h2>Stuff we do together</h2>

<p>I get that this poor girl is starved for attention and I have been trying to give her attention.  For example she is in the kitchen about 1/2 the time I am helping me.  We make breakfast together on the weekends (sausage and eggs).  Through the week she makes herself oatmeal or cereal while I am fixing my breakfast and we eat breakfast together.  When I am cooking dinner, she mixes things and stirs things for me.  She sets the table to eat. When I am home for lunch/dinner we eat that together too (no real idea when I am not home if dad eats with her).  She helps me with housework like folding laundry.  I have gotten her some skill appropriate crafts and have worked WITH her on them.  I do my crafts on the couch next to her.  I try to find time to spend with her.  The other day I played dolls with her.  <strong>At work she is literally sitting next to me at my office desk with a book, coloring activities, and a craft to keep her busy.</strong>  And every 10-30 minutes she is trying to get me to focus on her.  (When we are at my office I make sure it is for at most 4 hours because I know how boring it is, and I work from home when I can).  Being at work with me only happens when my boyfriend is scheduled to work during my work hours and I have meetings during that time.</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>I am an introvert and her constant attempts at getting my attention are wearing me down to the point where I don't have much energy of an evening to spend positive time with her because I need to be alone to recharge.  By not have enough energy <em>I'm talking about tired to the point of exhaustion and making myself sick.</em>  And I do REALLY need her not to constantly bug me at work as I have to concentrate on what I am doing.  </p>

<p><strong>What are some ways to help her not seek my attention every 10-30 minutes?</strong></p>

<p>The closest question I could find was <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/18296/4-year-old-daughter-starved-for-dads-attention"">this one</a> but it is for a 4 year old, and the accepted answer will not help, as she <em>is</em> already a part of most things I am doing from doing laundry, to watering the plants, to taking out the trash.  I have taken advantage of her willingness to help, but she cannot help me develop software at work.</p>

"How to begin sleep training with a 2 year old?","<p>Our daughter is 27 months (old enough that measuring in months seems silly now) and we never performed sleep training, so she is still being put to bed after bath and teeth time with a bottle and rocking chair.</p>

<p>We've been asked if we can sleep train her by the nursery staff (she started full time this week) as they give the children a nap at midday by lying them down and stroking them soothingly. This, of course, does not work with our child, so she misses her midday nap (which she usually gets at home) and is very tired by the evening. (Although this does make getting her to sleep easier.)</p>

<p>The other complication is that she can now climb out of the cot on her own (not particularly safely) so we are considering removing one side, as is typical (or so we believe.) My concern is if we use something like the <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/18287/sleep-training-giggles"">Sleep Lady Shuffle</a> or other process which involves simply ignoring her until she lays down that she will not lay and just climb out of the cot.</p>

<p>Have we missed the opportunity to sleep train or do we simply need to be much, much more patient and insistent? Are there resources for advanced (in both uses of the term) sleep training?</p>

<ul>
<li>Feed him then and hope he learns to sleep through the night somehow</li>
<li>Wait a period of time (say, a half hour). If he’s still making noise,
or starts up again, then feed him. </li>

<p>I understand that a 7-yrs old child likes this repetition thing (watching the same movie again and again and etc) and probably this is related to the way the brain is stimulated to ""feel safe"" when you get what you expect (which may be related to the way the brain does not like ""frustration"" which is not getting what you expect).</p>

<p>I'd just want to understand better why she asks the same question everyday at the same time. Obviously, she knows the answer, but I'd like to know if this is a normal process for this age, if this means she wants to check if some day we're going to give a different answer or if she just want to feel closer talking to me and my wife.</p>

They walk into the house, then head right to the basement and remain down there for the entire time she is over.

I don't expect her to come find me in our house, but if I am sitting in the living room or in her view when she walks in the door, I would expect a ""Hello"" would be common courtesy.

"1 year old toddler changes pattern of sleep","<p>I just noticed a recent change of sleeping pattern of my 2nd son, who is now 1 year and 3 month old. To be accurate the change started about 1 week ago.</p>

<p>Before that he used to turn in right away after being fed with 6 oz milk, around 7:30pm, and wake up around 2am for more milk and fall back sleep immediately. If we feed him with water rather than milk out of concern of overfeeding, he would groan in complaints, kicking his feet for 30 minutes but eventually manage to fall asleep again.</p>

<p>Gone were those days. Starting last weekend he refused to sleep after taking the milk at 7:45pm. He refused to stay in his cradle, he was very adamant and keeping motioning me to take him out. After I complied he would happily stumble around with my support under his arms, or play a ball, engaging in all activities but sleep. This could last for hours. Like today, he didn't fall asleep until 10:48pm. He still wakes up at 2 or 3am, but now it takes almost two hours before he sleeps again. </p>

<p>My son seems entering a new phase of development. He just starts learning to walk and speak, yet his mind matures at a faster pace. He starts demanding and his demands are simple yet clear and he refuses to take a ""No"" for an answer, otherwise he would cry at the top of lungs (in one occasion he cried so hard that he uncontrollably threw up). To me he seems tired of being a good boy, or my father's tough gene skipped my generation and passed onto him. :-)</p>

"Why do babies move this much when sleeping?","<p>Just to be clear: this is not a big problem, I am just curious about a funny behaviour :)</p>

<p>My daughter is 13 months old now and I sometimes sleep next to her at night. This can happen when for example we spend the night in a hotel were no cradles are available, so we book an extra bed and we put them all together. This way, she has a full grown-up person bed for her.</p>

<p>Then, during the night she will sleep tight but somehow moving back and forth, rolling, twisting, etc. Every time I check she will be in a completely new position, so I may have her foot next to my head but half an hour later she will be at the bottom of the bed.</p>

<p>I understand this like as: if I had a bed on this proportion (4x4 meters with no boundaries) I would move this much, because involuntary movement during the night would not find limits and my body would just go on doing them. But still, I am not sure if this is right.</p>

<p>Now our daughter is devastated, and isn't trusting of new people, she doesn't even want to go out to events with us, even though we've got a holiday to Spain booked in the next few weeks. Normally she looks forward to holidays... now she's dreading it. She said she's had nightmares and flashbacks about this since Tuesday.</p>

<p>Me and my husband are worried about this, what do we do next?</p>

"What skills should a 4-year-old have when it comes to counting and memorizing numbers?","<p>Our 4-year-old daughter just turned 4 and just started Pre-K. She can count to 10 and recognize 0-10 written on a board, with really no issues whatsoever. However, we've been working with her for half an hour to just learn the numbers <code>11, 12, 13, 14, 15</code> and she still can't do it by herself. Specifically, it's taken her almost that entire time to just recognize what <code>13</code> is.</p>

<p>Her sister, 13 months younger, can count to 20 with very little help though. We do all of the same activities together -- so I'm wondering if </p>

<ol>
<li>this is just normal differences between normal toddlers,</li>
<li>she's somewhat behind for her age, or maybe</li>
<li>her sister is just a faster learner when it comes to counting.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyone else have experience with what skills a 4-year-old should have when it comes to memorization and numbers? We were thinking she should be able to count to 20 with no help, so we're trying to work with her more to get her there. Is 20 too high of a bar for a 4-year-old? (I assume not, since her sister does it, and is a year younger).</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

"How do you get a three year old to do... anything?","<p>Get dressed, get undressed, wash their hands after using the toilet, brush their teeth, go to bed, get out of bed, stop jumping on their baby sibling, go to childcare, leave childcare, start moving, stop moving... any of the hundred and one things you need a child to do in order to progress through the day's schedule and stay healthy.</p>

<p>I can think of a few strategies:</p>

<p><strong>Physical coercion</strong></p>

<p>Ceases to work after the child is dexterous enough to, e.g., remove the clothes you just put on them.</p>

<p><strong>Yelling</strong></p>

<p>Unpleasant for everybody, and mostly just results in the child yelling back at you in your own voice at some future point.</p>

<p><strong>Threat of punishment</strong></p>

<p>What punishment? Corporal forms are rightly frowned upon, capital even more so<sup>[1]</sup>. To imagine my child sitting on the ""naughty chair"" and staying there is to laugh.</p>

<p><strong>Threat to withhold future pleasure</strong></p>

<p>This is <em>sometimes</em> effective, but the ""future"" needs to be relatively soon and the pleasure needs to be something they want enough (...and you're happy for them to have anyway.)</p>

<p><strong>Promise of future reward</strong></p>

<p>""Star charts"" and such. I know some find this effective but I'm uneasy about the normalisation of extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation.</p>

<p>Am I missing any broad categories, or does anyone have any particular tricks?</p>

"Am I being stressful to my child by trying to teach them how to be creative?","<p>I have two children, one being 7 months old and the other on the verge of turning 3 years old. My question is about my way of interacting with the 3-year-old one, but I hope to learn something I can apply to future interactions with the baby too.</p>

<p>My older child is loving, tidy, playful, well-mannered, smart, and generally everything a parent could dream of. We as parents made a point of stimulating our children, not keeping information away (though simpler words have to be used sometimes), showing not just telling, etc. and so far I think we're doing fine.</p>

<p>I've recently noticed that my child gets really distressed whenever I do something in a way I'm not supposed to. Let me explain:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes I'd be singing a song they know, and I would change the lyrics a bit. Either to fit the current situation (some adults hate that too, I know), or because I learned a new verse, or found nicer words, or just feel like it. This really bothered my child at first: they'd say that the song was not like that and would get very distressed if I tried to go on (sometimes with anger, sometimes with tears, always shouting <em>""no, no, it's not like that!""</em>). This also happened when it was other people singing it ""wrong"", but with a milder reaction (likely whispering to me ""but the song is not like that!"").  </li>
<li>Yesterday we were playing with a jigsaw puzzle of some TV series, and I picked two pieces with the face of the characters on them, and used the pieces like puppets, faking their voices and the like. My child quickly grabbed the pieces out of my hand and said <em>""no, no, don't do that, they are not puppets, they are jigsaw pieces""</em>. When asked <em>""but they have a face, why can't I use the pieces like puppets?""</em> my child just said that the pieces were not for that. I dropped it there because we were having a good time and I didn't want to spoil it.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I remember reading somewhere that, to correctly develop, children this age have the need to feel some things are ""set in stone"", that some things are the way they are and cannot change, so they feel secure enough to develop their cognitive and social skills. Else they would feel too insecure about everything. Is that right?<br>
So my ""being creative"", to them might be like shaking their system of beliefs, like suddenly realizing that maybe nothing is like they think it is. Too much for a 2 year old?</p>

<p>I guess the question is:<br>
<strong>Am I straining the intellectual and emotional development of my child by doing things that I see as imaginative, but maybe they see as crushing the foundations of their reality?</strong></p>

<p>PS: About the lyrics issue, I've managed to make them understand that songs can have many different lyrics and that it is OK to change the lyrics of a song if you like to; and that it is called ""a new version"" of the song. So now when I change the lyrics they are used to, they <em>usually</em> (not always) just ask me if that's a new version, I say yes, and we carry on.</p>

<p>PPS: English not my first language, please forgive any mistakes. I've purposely tried to make the post gender-neutral, though -- hence so many ""my child""s instead of just a pronoun or a name.</p>

"How to Handle Multi-Language Situation","<p>What is the best strategy for a multi-lingual couple to instill both the father's and mother's native languages to the child in a most ""natural"" and efficient way?</p>

<p>My wife and I have been speaking English between ourselves for the eight years we've been together since we met in the USA as international students and until our first son was born two weeks ago. Neither of us is a native English speaker; she doesn't know my native language and I don't know her native language well enough, and we are both pretty comfortable in English (though both not perfect), so we stuck with it; since six years we've lived in a country where her native language, German, is spoken, but I haven't really picked it up as my day-to-day life is in English.</p>

<p>Now that our first son was born we are wondering how to behave, linguistically speaking, around him. Her and I obviously have to keep talking English between the two of us because there's just no other option for us to communicate. When either of us is alone with the child then I suppose we could also speak our respective native tongues to help the child pick it up. But what if all three of us are together, such as at the dinner table? What should we speak? </p>

<p>My wife says we should have a mix where she speaks English to me and German to him, and I speak my native tongue to him and English to her. I feel this is very unnatural since I would like to understand what she says to him, so I feel it's more humane that we all speak English when we are together. But is this going to be harder for my son? He would then be immersed in three separate languages, which I understand makes it harder.</p>

<p>Right now he is still very small, so I guess it doesn't matter a lot yet, but when changing a diaper or picking him up she would speak to him some comforting sentences in German, which is obviously very natural, but if I'm there I'd like to understand those little jokes, funny nicknames and soothing metaphors as well. When I speak to him and she's there I do it in English because I want her to understand as well and then she's rebuking me and saying I must speak my native language.</p>

"Does a newborn/infant need to lay flat in a stroller","<p>I'm on the hunt for an inexpensive stroller to accommodate a newborn <em>without having to buy a travel system</em> and I'm having a really really hard time finding a stroller in any price range that will accept a newborn. The general advice I get from the not so helpful sales staff at most baby gear super stores is that infants <em>need</em> to be flat in the stroller.</p>

<p>This is my fourth child, and my old stroller finally died. I don't want to invest a whole lot of money in any more baby gear because I'm done after this baby. I already have an infant car seat, and I loathe those stupid baby carriers (the ones with the handles that you carry, not the ones you wear) that only exist to dislocate shoulders and ruin backs. So, I don't want a stroller that requires either one of those in order for it to be used by a newborn (under 3 mo).</p>

<p>I have found a few models in both jogger and traditional styles that recline pretty far, but not quite flat. And then I got to thinking about it, and newborns aren't flat in the car seat or those carriers, or in the little bouncy seats (that most of my kids spend the first 8 weeks sleeping in due to problems with reflux).  By pretty far I mean, an incline of less than 15 degrees.</p>

<p>So would <em>almost</em> flat be acceptable, perhaps with head stabilization? Or should I just get an inexpensive carrier to leave in a travel system stroller and hope it stays clean enough to sell on Craigslist once my baby grows out of it (usually by 10 weeks)?</p>

<p>You'd think by #4 Id have this figured out, but, I guess no matter how many kids you have, you never know everything!</p>
"
"How to encourage children to do their homework?","<p>I'm pretty sure no children like doing the majority of their homework. As a child, I resented it deeply because I felt that once I'd left school, I should also have left schoolwork. So I have every sympathy even though now, as an adult, I understand that it helps to re-enforce their learning which will stand them in good stead for exams and the like in later life.</p>

<p>Anyway, we have two kids of 7 and 11 and both, in their different ways, have a bad attitude to homework they don't want to do. The 7 year old throws minor tantrums, which can escalate into major ones if there's something more interesting to do or it's a subject that's strongly disliked. The 11 year old rolls eyes and puts in zero effort to get it out of the way as fast as possible.</p>

<p>As well as wanting them to do well at school (which they do), poor homework reflects poorly on the parents. They're at different schools, due to the age difference, and both schools make it clear that they presume parents will help with homework - so they obviously share that expectation.</p>

<p>Now, before coming to SE, I went to look for advice online. Much of what's suggested we already do: there is a quiet downstairs space for them to work, distraction is minimized, parents are available and willing to help but <em>not</em> take over or do it for them. We do not offer money or treats as a reward (online advice suggests not doing so) as we feel it sends a bad message about the reasons for education: knowledge and mastery ought to be its own reward.</p>

<p>We do not have a regular time slot for homework, because this would be difficult for a variety of reasons. </p>

<p>What surprised me though was that a common suggestion was simply to back off. You can't <em>force</em> children to do their homework and the consequences fall on them, not you. Saying ""no"" thus becomes a winnable battle for older children the way that refusing food can be for younger ones.</p>

<p>While this makes perfect sense, it is not entirely true that the consequences fall entirely on the child. Teachers are bound to think dimly of parents who cannot encourage children to do successful homework. I am also dubious that this approach will work prior to senior school, with the 7 year old.</p>

<p>Are my concerns valid? Is there anything else we can try?</p>

"How to teach a 7-year-old that things don't always go her way?","<p>I've noticed that whenever things don't happen how she expects them to happen, my 7-year-old niece starts crying, runs away, or engages herself with another activity that she has more control over. </p>

<p>For example, if we take family photos and someone says to her to smile, and she doesn't feel like it, she'll start crying and runs away. If we play a game and she loses she says the game is stupid and takes some colored pencils and starts coloring on her own. Or if she does something and someone suggests there is a better way to do it, she drops the thing she's doing and goes watch TV.</p>

<p>After she calms down she will engage again with what she was doing or with people, until something happens that triggers the same behavior.</p>

<p>I live in another town and see my niece rarely, so I though that's it's because she doesn't feel as comfortable around me as she does around her friends and immediate family, but her mother (my sister) says that it happens with them also. </p>

<p>She'll outgrow it in time I think, so I'm not worried that it's an issue, but it wouldn't hurt to work on it. My sister agrees, but at the same time tries to avoid it occurring because of the crying, self isolation, etc.</p>

<p>I think she'll be better if she gets more exposed to situations like these so she has more opportunities to learn, but since I'm not around my niece every day, it's not my place to decide. So what can be done? Should something be done or just give it some time?</p>

"what's typical for birthday parties in the USA?","<p>We are currently in the US (California) and my son is soon going to turn three. He's somewhat grasping the idea of getting older, and I also think he's old enough to really enjoy having a party. We're planning on inviting some friends with small kids (6 in total, 7 months - 4 years old) to our place. Birthday practices vary widely across the globe and we are new to this continent, so I'd like to have some idea of what is typical here. Just imagine you received an invitation to a three-year-old's birthday party and you have to make a best guess at what time of day it will start, how long it will last, what activities are going to take place...</p>

<p>Specifically, I'd like to know the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a time of day that is most typical of birthday parties for this age? For us 11 AM works best (the little guy has a long nap after lunch) but I'm thinking this might be strange. </li>
<li>Should we put an ending time for the party in the invitation? This is not an issue if people typically arrive around the invited beginning time, but maybe they don't? </li>
<li>How long does a typical birthday party last?</li>
<li>Is store-bought cake considered OK for such young kids? Or should we be looking for something special? </li>
<li>What sort of drinks are normally served? For the kids as well as adults.</li>
<li>Do guests get something from us? (e.g. a bag with a small toy per kid)</li>
<li>I know that candles and a birthday song are customary. Anything else? Hats?</li>
<li>Is it understood that we will have a plan for entertaining the kids, or is free play more standard? </li>
<li>Do presents get opened in front of everybody? Do they get opened all at once? </li>
<li>Any other detail you might think of.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just for clarity, we're not trying to mimic the all-American party, I just want to avoid big surprises :)</p>

<p>edit: Maybe I should note that in my country of origin a (1st) birthday involves bbq, alcohol and cigarette smoke in a restaurant, and opening presents - which are mostly envelopes with money - when everyone has left. Later birthdays involve cooking a feast. I know not to do something similar here, but I'm still wary of making really big blunders and was hoping to get some quick advice.</p>

"At what age should a child's self-involvement begin to decrease?","<p>I can recall the first five or six years of my life being glorious, well, what I can remember of them anyway. </p>

<p>From what I recall, to me, the world was <em>all about me</em>. I was the center of it and I knew it, especially since the adults around me tended to reinforce that. Being an only child is something I'm certain contributed to my prolonged sense of entitlement as being more important than anything I saw. It diminished, rather quickly, around the age of 10 from what I can remember and conversations with my parents.</p>

<p>Is there an age where complete self-involvement begin to subside, as a child naturally begins to think of others <em>with</em> and <em>before</em> themselves and their needs? At some point, a child's idle conversation should strive to be more engaging of others, rather than self-narrative, right around the point that a child realizes that stating their immediate needs or desires might not be appropriate due to the circumstances at hand.</p>

<p>I know that being an only child has quite a bit to do with this. When you're the oldest, and a new sibling comes into your life, you get less attention and that's just something you have to deal with. Being born already <em>having</em> a sibling makes this just something that's always been the way it is. </p>

<p>The nursery staff reports that it happens so much that they are having a hard time caring for other kids in the nursery. We have a five year old who does like to ""play rough"" with him, but we have tried to calm that down because we fear that may be part of what's causing the problem. He does not attend daycare.</p>

<p>Does anyone have advice in these situations? The church nursery coordinator emailed us to officially tell us this information and also told us we were welcome to continue to go to the parenting class we were taking, but again if one of the two of us stayed in the nursery with him during class or found other arrangements for child care. We could listen to sermons at home, but there’s something about being in a community at church vs listening in your own home. And yes, we could hire a baby sitter, but that would get expensive. My parents love watching the kids, but they already have to do it enough that we can’t ask them to do this every week.</p>

<p>Our church pastor in his sermons always apologizes for peoples bad experiences at churches for others that have been turned away from the church from how they were treated in the past. I <em>feel</em> like we’re being treated the same hurtful way, but we do feel for the other kids in the nursery as well. Part of the problem I think is that their nursery space isn’t big enough and they for some reason refuse to hire any more bodies (it’s a large church with a large staff already). Sometimes there are 2 people watching around 10 kids including 3 babies. Ironically, we just had a sermon regarding the “lost sheep”, which is exactly how we feel.</p>

<p><strong>Any advice on dealing with our child or our church?</strong></p>

"Is school punishment for mediocre test results reasonable?","<p>My daughter is 9 years old, she's just started grade 4. We've had her in a school for gifted kids since kindergarten. It's been great so far because they understand the challenges that gifted kids face and tend to treat those challenges with a bit more empathy and compassion.</p>

<p>Yesterday I got an email from our daughter's new teacher saying that some of the children performed poorly on a geography quiz and it was ""not reflective of their true potential."" As punishment she made them write an apology note explaining the reason for the poor result and that they will study harder in the future while the rest of the class got to go do a fun activity.</p>

<p>The test and apology note were sent home for us to sign. She had scored 63%, which doesn't seem like a huge deal to me, especially for a kid that loves school, love learning, and normally does well. When we talked about it, my daughter said that this situation made her feel angry because she was excluded from classroom fun and ashamed of her performance.</p>

<p>My gut reaction is that this is a pretty severe punishment for what I see as non-event. This is the second time since starting grade 4 that we've received an email from the teacher over what I consider a mundane occurrence. I'm worried that if this continues that my daughter will start to develop negative emotions to school, start thinking of herself as a failure for not being perfect, or begin to withdraw entirely.</p>

<p>Overall, I've been pretty happy with the school in general. They seem to understand her emotional needs and are patient as she progresses. Emails we've received in the past seemed acceptable and lead to good teaching opportunities at home. My spouse and I are going to speak with the teacher in person next week to try to understand better why this is happening. In the meantime I'd like to get some other perspectives. This is the first time I've really felt like something was out of line and that's part of why I'm asking for other viewpoints.</p>

<p>Is this a reasonable approach for this teacher to take? Why or why not?</p>

"How can we explain our ""cry it out"" strategy to people who oppose it?","<p>My wife and I have had success with a form of the <a href=""http://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-training-cry-it-out-methods_1497112.bc?showAll=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">""cry it out"" strategy</a> with our three children.  I know it's <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/3584/is-the-cry-it-out-approach-harmful"">not for everyone</a>, but our household has gotten into some healthy sleep patterns without long periods of crying.  If it's possible for anyone to be successful with the technique, we have been.</p>

<p>So we have children that generally sleep through the night and a bedtime routine that works well for us.  But occasionally <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr1VCT2ntmc"" rel=""noreferrer"">relatives come</a> or we visit them, which inevitably disrupts the routine.  As a result, our infant twins have difficulty falling asleep and cry more than usual. For one particular relative, even a few minutes of fussing is beyond endurance and she will want to comfort our babies until they (or she) falls asleep.  That would be fine with us if it didn't mean another 2 or 3 nights of readjustment.</p>

<p>Most of our visitors are understanding; our babies cry a little more than usual when we have company.  But other people assume our children cry <em>much longer</em> than they normally do as a result of something akin to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)"" rel=""noreferrer"">observer effect</a>. How can we explain our technique to people who believe it is wrong or cruel to even temporarily withhold comfort from a crying baby?</p>

"9 year old son brought a toy gun to school – how can we get him to understand this isn't just about bringing a toy to school?","<p>My well behaved, bright, popular, naive 9 year old son brought a plastic toy revolver (the kind with the bright orange barrel to indicate that it's a toy) to school yesterday. He snuck it into his back pack because he wanted to show the girl across the street while they rode the bus to school. He had to sneak it because he <em>knows</em> that toys are not allowed at school.  I know he knows this because he was scolded two days before when I found toys in his bag, which I confiscated.  </p>

<p>Obviously, he got caught with it. Another child saw him showing some friends and told their classroom teacher about it once they got to class. This child is probably the only one in my sons class that doesn't get along with my boy. I am not excusing my son's behavior at all, but the dynamic between these two boys is important to this situation.  </p>

<p>My son has trouble understanding that he should stay away from this boy. He is, in my opinion, a liar, a back-stabber, and an emotional bully. My boy wants everyone to be friends, and so he continues to hang around this kid despite my warnings and having experienced multiple betrayals. Until now. He is, for the first time, very angry at one of his 'friends' and is struggling with it.</p>

<p>Per school regulation, my son was suspended for the rest of the school day, the ""weapon"" was confiscated, and he was interviewed by the principal, school psychologist, and a police officer. The school chose not to press charges, thankfully. His intentions were not even remotely malicious, so they were lenient. </p>

<p>I am struggling with how to punish him appropriately for this. On one hand, his principal told him today when we met for his reinstatement that ""it's over now, and we 're moving on. Let's put this behind us now and learn from our mistakes"" and so perhaps I should echo the tone and be forgiving and lenient, chalking this up to at worst a big mistake? On the other hand, my son is not exhibiting any real signs of remorse or appreciation for the seriousness of bringing a weapon to school (even though it's fake) and being suspended, or the sneakiness, or the fact that he deliberately disobeyed me and that makes me think I should come down pretty hard on him to drive the point home.  After all, isn't his lack of awareness (or respect for) the rules the reason we are in this mess?  </p>

<p>I have told him that he is to be on his best behavior for now, and I've removed his electronic privileges while we think what his punishment should be. He's already shocked that there could be any more punishment besides losing the iPad and the 'ordeal' (his words!) at school. This is more evidence that he doesn't get it. </p>

<p>Here's where the other kid comes in: when I can get him to talk about this, without rolling his eyes or making jokes, his biggest problem with all of this is that it's ""not even my fault!"" Since the other kid told on him, after he touched the toy gun and praised my son for being so ""bad ass"" for bringing it in and then pretended to be an innocent, frightened witness, my son completely, thoroughly, blames this other kid. I secretly partially blame him too; for being such a two face I really can't stand him, but I bury it and correct my son; it's my sons fault alone that he is in trouble because when you do bad things you get caught and you get punished. He won't stop obsessing about the ""tattle-tail"" and I really think it's blocking him from seeing the truth here. I suspect he's blinded by the anger and hurt he feels by this kid's betrayal (although they never had any trust, my son falsely believed it was there.)</p>

<p>How can I help him to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Accept full responsibility for his actions. </li>
<li>Nip the ""blame game"" in the bud. </li>
<li>Stay away from this other kid <em>for good</em>.  </li>
<li>Punish him with the right balance of harshness for the seriousness of the offense and leniency for the lack of ill intent.   </li>
</ol>

<p>Everyone is on eggshells here at my house, any advice would be appreciated. </p>

<p>By the way, this is the <em>ONLY</em> toy weapon we've ever had, it was purchased by my mother, and it is long gone. We are not that sort of family where violence of any kind is tolerated, witnessed, or promoted. We don't even have local network television in the house, or violent video games. He wanted the cap gun because he likes the smell of the caps. Honestly. He's that naive to guns and what they mean. We've got real guns in the house, he knows this, and has no interest in them whatsoever. This event really came out of the blue. It is very unsettling however. </p>

<hr>

<p><em>UPDATE</em>  We ended up taking a middle ground approach in regards to punishment. Our first instinct, before I even put this question out for answers, was to remove the biggest distraction/infatuation of the moment so that he would be forced to focus on this. Minecraft went bye-bye. I did take DanBeale's advice though, and he got the iPad back almost immediately (sans Minecraft of course). We allowed him to reinstall the game <em>after</em> he wrote 2 letters of apology and thanks to his teacher for vouching for him and also for claiming he had a ""dentist appointment"" in an effort to shut down the rumor mill, and also to the principal for leniency.  He also had to purchase the game with his own money this time.  </p>

<p>After that, we let the issue of the gun rest (at home) but I did request the school psychologist speak to him about WHY everyone freaked out about the gun. I went this route because my husband kept veering towards making jokes about all this and I just wasn't confident the message would be delivered in such a way so that it would hit home.  That's an issue for another forum I suppose.</p>

<p>My son has finally accepted that this other boy is not trustworthy, and is therefore not a good friend. I think he finally understands that relationships come in many shades of gray, not just super BFF's forever on one side and sworn enemies on the other. He has decided he'll still be nice to the boy, but won't purposely sit next to him at lunch- a shade of grey closer to the enemy end of the spectrum in 9 year old social circles from what I can tell. I never realized how difficult it is to explain trust and how important it is to a child until now. I think he gets it, but only time will tell. Thanks for the great answers.</p>

"How to encourage children to 'reign-in' their enthusiasm + socialness","<p>Our 8 year old (boy) is a rather socially vocal about things that interest him, or anything that grabs his mind, what I mean by that is that he will (at length) talk to anyone around him about his current interest subject (right now it's fishing) or his life (and our family) history, regardless of whether they've shown any interest or not. He will often random start conversations with people who have started an unrelated passing conversation with us (cashiers, random people on the bus, family members e.t.c) about these things, when it's clear (to us) that they are completely lost about what he's talking about.</p>

<p>We've tried explaining to him on numerous occasions that not everyone enjoys being subject to an half hour long conversation about fishing or Minecraft or Egypt or whatever the flavour of the period is, but it seems to not be getting through. It's gotten to the point where a lot of his school peers have started actively ignoring him when he approaches them because they're just not interested.</p>

<p>Obviously we don't want to squash his enthusiasm for these subjects, or any subject, to stop him exploring his interests, but we feel that he's going to have trouble finding friends if he doesn't recognise other peoples interest (or lack-of).</p>

<p>How have other people handled this (or similar) situations?</p>

<p>Personally I feel that some of the cause comes from him trying to establish himself as a clever child, as a lot of the children in his class seem to have a rather high opinion of themselves, but he is a clever child - just when he exerts himself. He also seems to be suffering from some confidence issues - he refuses to apply himself to things which he can do, he just doesn't think he's able to (but I'm thinking this is normal behaviour in children?)</p>

"My one year old daughter keeps waking up same time every night screaming and crying","<p>I am very confused and concerned - My 13-monthld daughter wakes up between 1:30 am and 3:40 am screaming and crying in her crib. I have tried giving her a bottle of milk, cup of water, cuddling her, rocking her, covering her, and singing to her. At this point I'm worried. It started about two months ago and hasn't stopped or gotten any better. She takes two naps a day and she goes to sleep between 9:00 pm - 9:30 pm. Am I doing something wrong? </p>

"When to introduce a half-sibling?","<p>My wife and I divorced. Ironically, our relationship now is better than before the divorce. </p>

<p>We have a son (5) who lives with my ex. He is not entirely aware of our situation. We split when he was just 18 months so for most of his life I was the Dad who lives far away (after the divorce my ex moved to our country of birth while I stayed as an expat in the UK). </p>

<p>My ex did not explain to our son our circumstances - she has been just saying to him ""Dad is working in another country"". We see each other on Skype every other week and I visit him for a few days every 3 months or so. Despite these relatively spaced out visits our bond is strong - he is looking forward to our time together (as I do myself). He seems to get upset when I leave (which breaks my heart).</p>

<p>In the meantime I met someone and we had our baby son (10 months). My ex is aware about it and has accepted the fact.</p>

<p>But now the question is - <strong>when to let our son know about his younger half-brother</strong>?</p>

<p>It is a delicate situation. As I have been away from him most of the time he may start to think that I have somehow abandoned him in favour of some other child. </p>

<p>I have recently moved to the same country with my new family. My hope is that I would get to have more time with my older son and, hopefully, would be able to integrate him with my new family. My new partner is supportive of that.</p>

<p>My ex went to a psychologist and was told that it is advisable to let our son know about his half-brother as early as possible while he is relatively young so that he comes to accept this situation as something ""normal"".</p>

<p>My current feeling is to delay. First, his brother is too young and probably not very interesting to him to play with. My feeling is that once his brother becomes more interactive (can speak, play, run) than, potentially, my older son can perceive him as a play mate.</p>

"Five-year-old fever: what's the cure?","<p>Five-year-old fever: that's what her teacher calls it.  I'm calling it (IN MY HEAD) the ""F*** You Fives.""  Apparently this is something that almost all of her peers are going through; if I had a nickel for every time I've run into another parent who exclaims ""OMG I thought I was the only one!"" when they relate their horror stories and I commiserate...  Apologies for the wall o' text below.</p>

<p>tl;dr: how do I get my 5-yr-old past these daily tantrums?</p>

<p>So she's having daily tantrums.  Usually at night, but not always.  And they are full-blown ""I hate you! I want to punch you in the face! I wish you were dead"" scream fits.  This is not language we use in our house, btw, and the kids never watch anything other than toddler pablum like Thomas and other cartoons, so this stuff comes from another environment (school, most likely).  The one thing that's in common for every tantrum is not getting her way: if her cousin can't come over, tantrum.  If her brother doesn't want to share his favorite truck, tantrum. If we refuse to allow her to eat candy before dinner, tantrum.  </p>

<p>What we've tried: </p>

<ol>
<li>We've taken away all electronic media and toys indefinitely, for both kids (and are definitely seeing an improvement in the 3-yr-old; going TV-free has been a boon for him, regardless of how this turns out).  </li>
<li>She gets between 11-12 hours of sleep a night and we TRY to ensure she has a good diet (she's very picky and we're vegan, but last visit to the pediatrician (about two months ago) her blood tests were just fine, even for B12).  So yes, the doc says physically she's fine.</li>
<li>We've cut out extra-curricular activities other than piano lessons, so she doesn't get too exhausted (we noticed an uptick in tantrums on the nights after tae kwon do, even though we were home 90 minutes before bedtime).</li>
<li>When this happens, I do my DAMNEDEST to remain calm and unemotional, and try to talk her through this. ""So where would you go if you didn't live here?  Oh really?  How would you buy a house? Where would you find food?"" etc.  If she's mad because someone didn't do something she thinks they should have (or vice versa) I try to ask her how she would feel if the situation was reversed (this discussion happens after the screaming has dwindled down).</li>
<li>I will take her to her room if she's just out to scream, but that rarely works well; she pounds at me and kicks the whole way, and either comes blasting out of her room the moment I close the door, or trashes her room to the extent she's able/willing to (last time she threw her pillows on the floor, and some rocks she's collected).</li>
</ol>

<p>We do have a (to my eyes, at least) rather tight schedule; the kids have to get up in time for one of us to take them to separate schools (no bus comes here, since she's in a magnet school), and she has homework (even in Kindergarten) most nights.  We try to do a big chunk on the weekends, when she has time to focus, and she sails through it.  She also has to read every night, and she balks at both those strenuously.  (She doesn't like reading very much at all yet, unless she's in my lap at night, and for several reasons that doesn't always happen.  Especially not THESE nights.)   </p>

<p>Either I'm missing something, or I just need to find my own peace with this stage.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>The vast majority of the issues have been sorted out. We are in regular contact with our family doctor and paediatrician, dietitians, etc. We're getting mental health help and generally feeling better supported.

Now is not the time for more kids or fighting over how many we have, and we both know that. </p>

<li>If I care about how much someone will prepare for a given work situation, I ask them their strengths and weaknesses (which are crap ways to learn someone's strengths and weaknesses, but anyone <em>without</em> a well-thought out answer has done roughly nothing to prepare for typical interview questions).</li>

<p>My initial assumption prior to this advice was that there would be no reason to change the diaper unless there is urine or excrement in it. Or perhaps, unless it's hot and the child is very sweaty. </p>

<p>I guess my assumption may well be wrong, and therefore I'm asking this question. </p>

<p>I guess it could be something with comfort. Do diapers get less comfortable as they are worn, even if the child doesn't urinate or defecate? Or do they risk irritating the skin? </p>

<p>I'm primarily taking about disposable diapers, as cloth diapers are virtually never used in my part of the world.</p>

<p>I have searched the web for this question, and I have been unable to find anything that really answers the question.</p>

"Should I tell my 10-year old son, how screwed-up Cinderella is?","<p>My 10-year old boy recently told me that he likes the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella"">Cinderella</a> fairy tale.</p>

<p>Some fairy tales including this one, have several layers of meaning and sometimes they guide people's life decisions.</p>

<p>Let's look at Cinderella from a realistic point of view: The stepmother humiliates Cinderella for a long time, while her father is watching and doing nothing about it. Her father is the first man she knows.</p>

<p>It's totally reasonable that she holds a grudge against him (for not preventing the attacks of the stepmother), and because she doesn't know other men, she is likely to project this concept to other men as well.</p>

<p>In her family she didn't have a chance to take revenge for her sufferings.</p>

<p>This changes when Prince Charming enters her life. It is likely that Cinderella will vent her anger on him and he won't fight back because he is noble and such.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, real life is full of stories when Cinderellas either</p>

<ul>
<li>tolerate intolerable behavior from bad men/criminals and</li>
<li>reject all those people (men and women), who treat them well.</li>
</ul>

<p>I fear that if I don't tell my son about these hidden meanings, he may get the wrong impression that it is easy to be together with a real-life Cinderella, i.e. that you can improve the life of a ""broken"" woman without investing enormous amount of time, energy, love, money and sometimes major sacrifices in lost career/business opportunities. A real-life Prince Charming would need - besides a genuine love to Cinderella, which borders on insanity - a couple of decades of intensive work to heal Cinderella's wounds (based on my experience).</p>

<p>I also fear that he might have the wrong idea on the probability of success: Lots of men waste their resources on Cinderellas because the latter don't want to be saved (to lead a normal life without daily humiliation and/or violence).</p>

<p>Is there any possible harm if I tell my kid now about the hidden meaning of Cinderella?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> Re-formulating my question:</p>

<p>Can there be any harm to my son in</p>

<ol>
<li>telling him that there are many ways to look at that fairy tale and</li>
<li>explain to him, how I interpret it (and why I don't like it)</li>
</ol>

<p>at this particular age?</p>

<p>In other words: Isn't he too young to learn about the existence of these unhealthy relationships?</p>

"How to help my child that has OCD with Sexual Obsessions?","<p>I have a son that is 15 years old.  He has Tourette's and ADHD and they have been managed well by my wife and I and his teachers at school.  He also has Auditory Processing Disorder.</p>

<p>Some of the problems we deal with on a daily basis are constant movement, fidgeting, and vocalizations.  He doesn't understand body language, many social norms, sarcasm, among other things.  He is in a Collegiate High School and has A's with a few B's.</p>

<p>On top of these problems that have become normal in our household, he recently started having problems with OCD.  It emerged and escalated very, very quickly.  In a matter of 1.5 months he went from what was his normal day to day to his constant fixations, ruminations, and the need to talk to us about them all the time.</p>

<p>He will fixate on something that disturbs him and he can't let it go.  He started doing things like rubbing his hands together until he got blisters.  He is not intentionally harming himself, he is just doing things compulsively to deal with the obsessive thoughts.</p>

<p>Then the OCD took a serious turn and his obsessions become sexual in nature.  And he will see someone, and the thought comes to him, ""why did I look at that person"" or ""I just noticed X body part"".  He then questions why he looked and if he is attracted to it.  It includes members of the family including grandchildren.  He is extremely disturbed by this and one of his compulsions is to constantly want to talk to us about what is bothering him.</p>

<p>He is in our bedroom first thing in the morning, he talks first thing when he gets home from school, and every night before bed.  We have explained to him that it is the OCD, that he isn't attracted and that articles we have read and printed for him explain that because they disturb him he isn't thinking about it because he is attracted.   </p>

<p><a href=""https://childmind.org/article/ocd-sexual-obsessions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sexual Obsessions and OCD</a> explains what he is dealing with to the letter. Some portions of that are below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sexual obsessions can take many different forms. One of the most common is related to homosexuality. A girl who is heterosexual might
  become obsessed with the idea that she is gay. She might have every
  reason to believe she’s straight — she has always had crushes on male
  movie stars, she might even have a boyfriend — but she starts to
  wonder: What if I’m gay? What if I’m attracted to that girl — does
  that mean I’m gay? Kids with this obsession might try to “test”
  themselves by looking at pictures of pop stars and trying to evaluate
  whether they find them to be attractive or not.</p>
  
  <p>Or a child might worry that he has done or will do something sexual
  without consent. This can be something as small as worrying that he
  has offended a peer by inadvertently brushing against her in a crowded
  hallway. Or he might be plagued with worrying that he might commit
  rape. He might have zero desire to actually commit rape, but the
  possibility that he might is terrifying to him. He might walk with his
  hands in his pockets and keep a larger distance than is normal from
  people, to lower the risk that he might do something inappropriate.</p>
  
  <p>People with sexual obsessions might also worry that they have taboo
  sexual desires such as pedophilia or incest. Just as in the other
  examples, they don’t actually experience these desires, but they are
  disturbed by the possibility that they might. These kids might avoid
  being alone with family members, or avoid being alone with children,
  at all costs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Like other obsessions, the difference is when kids have them they
  cause a lot of anxiety and distress and avoidance of the situations
  that cause the thoughts,” explains Dr. Bubrick. “Pedophiles actively
  seek out situations to be alone with children and like those
  experiences, whereas someone with OCD who has those obsessions will
  feel extreme guilt and shame. They’ll avoid those situations and feel
  horrible about themselves just for having the thought.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He starts therapy next week, and I have a psychiatrist appointment for him in two weeks.  The question is how do my wife and I deal with him on a daily basis?  While we understand the condition it is getting increasingly difficult for us to hear him say the disturbing things that pop into his head as he continues to fixate.  Mind you, these are thoughts that include kids from school, church, and people in his immediate family.  It is constant and relentless, we feel so badly for him, we are very worried.  We spend at least 2 hours a day talking to him. It is affecting relationships all around.  It is draining us and we are almost to a breaking point, which he won't deal well with.</p>

"How to use Band-Aids for childhood injuries?","<p>I'll use the term Band-Aids, despite it being a brand name for adhesive bandages. I know they're not used solely by parents, but this question came to me because of parenting. My son is reaching an age where he's started to scrape up his knees and shins, so I'm sure he'll be wearing plenty of Band-Aids in the near future. </p>

<p>Do Band-Aids do anything more than protect the skin from debris or irritation? As in, do they decrease healing time or reduce scarring?</p>

<p>Are there negative side effects to using them? Growing up, my mother would often tell me not to wear a Band-Aid on cuts and scrapes for the whole day, because my wounds ""needed oxygen"". Is there any basis for this? These days, I assume that it's really about keeping the area <em>dry</em>, but I don't know if there's more to it. </p>

<p>Can the adhesive cause side effects, such as clogging pores or instigating skin allergies? </p>

<p>Is there any purpose to the different sizes and shapes other than giving coverage of the wound and contouring the body? For instance, butterfly bandages are designed to hold deeper cuts closed. </p>

<p>Are there times when it's definitely better to use a Band-Aid instead of just cleaning the area and keeping it dry and clean? </p>

<p>While this is many questions, what I'm really asking is:<br>
<strong>What's everything I need to know about using Band-Aids in regard to common, minor childhood injuries?</strong><br>
When to use them, when not to use them, potential risks, potential benefits. Anything that clears up any common misperceptions (if there are any), would be excellent. </p>

"At what point should I choose to have a c-section?","<p>There is a good history of obstructed births in my family; something to do with pelvises apparently. My grandmother had problems, my mother wasn't able to have any of us 4 without c-sections after labor (which nearly killed my younger sister) and a 1st cousin recently needed an emergency c-section for the same reason.</p>

<p>I don't know if I'm affected by the same genetic condition, and won't know until the day.</p>

<p>Interestingly I've talked to the midwife about this twice and she doesn't seems to think it's a big deal. I don't even think there's a note in my file. </p>

<p>The pros and cons of c-sections are immaterial here, obviously I would prefer to have the child naturally if possible, but I'm realistic. I'd assumed it would be OK to try naturally, and if things start to go at all difficult to opt for a c-section. </p>

<p>I recently heard that it is less stressful on both mother and baby (with faster recovery time) to just <em>choose</em> a c-section rather than to have an <em>emergency</em> c-section.</p>

<p>My question is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how do I respectfully handle this with the midwife and the hospital? How do I tactfully make them fully aware that I'm not paranoid, this is a genuine risk?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I better just requesting a c-section (though I'd rather not for health and hormones)?</p>

<p>Worst case scenario, at what point on the day would I ""pull the pin"" and seriously ask for a c-section? </p>

<p>On the other hand should I just have blind faith in my health care professionals? I want to, I absolutely trust in the profession and believe in them -- but the health of my unborn child is paramount to me and I want to do everything I can.</p>

<p>Despite my pregnancy being ideal so far, after listening to the family horror-stories, I honestly believe there's a good chance I'll be end up on the chopping board. Either way I just want what is healthiest for us and to know what my options and rights are, while having utmost respect for the hardworking professionals involved.</p>

<hr>

<p>For those curious to the outcome: the baby chose. After 29-hours of labor (having we believe both ""Passenger"" and ""Passage"" complications). She became distressed and it was a painless decision between me, my team and the professionals involved to have the caesarian as soon as possible. After the necessary epidural anaesthetic it all happened like a machine. Overall it was a stressful day, but it usually is. Note that we chose a major public hospital that performed C-sections. The (purportedly ""nicer"") insurance preferred choice wasn't able to and we would have required a (likely unpleasant) transfer. Having chosen to be at a place to perform the operation limited our options, but fortunately the public hospital completely exceeded expectations, with freshly renovated maternity ward with all the mod-cons and many (free) days in hospital to ensure everyone was fine. Everyone is thriving in the end. </p>

<p>For example, policeman or military soldier should be a model for kids; They -normally- love him or -at least- feel safe while he is around.

"Swaddle for energetic infant? Or am i thinking this wrong?","<p>So our girl (5 months chronological, 3.5 months or so adjusted) has a pretty strong tic when she wants to go to sleep.

BTW: she doesn't seem to have Moro response any more.</p>

<p>It's warm now, so we use a muslin swaddle cloth.  With the give and stretchy in this, she flails out of this pretty easily.  She runs hot, so a flannel cloth is way too warm for her.  We tried the Miracle Blanket, but with both strength and size she grew out of it.  Same with the Nested Bean Zen Swaddle - she's strong enough to break out of the velcro in literally 10 seconds.</p>

"How to deal with Encopresis in primary school?","<p>Our son has Encopresis since many years (the history is described here: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/2209/1092"">How can we potty-train our pre-schooler outside the home?</a> ). </p>

<p>He is now 6 years old and in some phases (which often last 2..3 weeks), it happens 2..3 times a day nearly each day that he has stains of poo in his underwear, sometimes even a large amount of poo.
It is already difficult in the Kindergarten to get the different kindergarten teachers on our (and his!) side to support him and help him with understanding ... he <strong>just is not able to really clean himself alone</strong> in such a situation.<br>
He sometimes/often tries to avoid getting cleaned by the kindergarten teachers and hides until he gets picked up by his parents, so it is even more difficult to clean him if it's dry already and he has been running around smelling strongly for some time...</p>

<p>Anyway, <strong>soon he'll go to school</strong> and the situation there will be even more difficult:</p>

<p>It seems that nobody there feels responsible for such a child:</p>

<ul>
<li>the kindergarten teachers have asked the school teachers what they would do in school, if he poo'd in his pants: they would call the parents to come and clean him.<br>
This would be very difficult, as we are both working some kilometeres away and can not get easily and quickly to school at each time. 
Also if I imagine how it would be if that happens 2 or 3 times a day... it's impossible to deal with... 

<ul>
<li>school seems to have proposed that he wears a diaper... that only avoids underwear getting dirty, but cleaning himself will still be a problem (as the bowels are often very loose and nearly fluid in such situation) - he won't be able to do that alone - and he also can not sit in a dirty and stinking diaper in classes for hours ...</li>
<li>the other children will probably josh him </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I know that this is a really difficult question and maybe there is not ""the"" answer, but I'd like to know if anybody else has similar experience and found a way to get support and help from school or somewhere else to avoid that the parents have to be available all the time in case of such an ""accident"" or that the child is left alone with his problem and the dirt and misses his classes waiting for someone to come and help him...</p>

"How can you offer other parents suggestions without making them defensive?","<p>Because we parents spend so much time <strike> complaining to each other</strike>   sharing best practices, we often find ourselves in situations where another parent is sharing an approach or technique that we have learned or read enough to know is less than optimal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Hot dogs are your two-year-old's favorite food, you say? And he only eats them whole?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Vaccinations?  Who even knows if those work?  We <em>do</em> know they gave a number of celebrity's kids Autism.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And those are the easier ones - often it's more like the parents who don't want to ""stress"" their children with any pressure to establish regular sleep routines, but describe a house full of parents and kids who haven't had more than two hours sleep in row for <em>years.</em></p>

<p>The challenge, and the question I have, is this.  In those rare instances where you feel you really have something important or useful to share:</p>

<p><strong>How can offer people you care about suggestions without either making your friends defensive, or by coming off as someone who considers themselves a parenting expert?</strong>  (I am <em>all too aware</em> that the most important job I've ever had is also the one I'm least prepared to handle.)</p>

<p>My instinct is always to start soft, so as not to seem too pushy ""I think I read that hot dogs might be a bit of a choking issue for kids that age,"" but that seems to go badly, because the softening on my part makes it easy for them to brush it off (""My pediatrician told me what to worry about, and didn't mention that - it's fine"").  And at that point, pushing harder is starting to feel like an unwanted intervention.</p>

"What are the pros and cons of having an advanced student skip a mid-elementary grade?","<p>At the end of third grade, our daughter's teacher approached us (and our school's principal) and suggested that with her test scores (high-school level) and level academic mastery, we should put her in a private school with a gifted and talented program (our public school system has, for I think good reasons, done away with that), or else have her skip a grade. She felt like our daughter's level was such that differentiation within the fourth-grade classroom wouldn't be sufficient.</p>

<p>We aren't really interested in private school, and were a little concerned about social issues, and eventually a deciding factor was that the ELA curriculum for fourth grade focuses on writing and composition — an area that's always been one of our daughter's rough spots. So, with the help of the principal and teachers, we came up with a plan where she divides her time between 4th grade (homeroom, ELA) and 5th (math).</p>

<p>This has worked reasonably well (she's continued to excel at math and has really caught up in the writing skills), but had some problems as well — the daily classroom switch was stressful, and since our state has mandatory testing, that was done at the 4th grade level for all subjects (she did just fine, but again, it was a stressor). So now, as this year comes to a close, we're evaluating what to do next year — whether to continue the split pattern, to move her entirely into 6th, or even to stay in 5th and work with the math teacher on more advanced / in-depth education this year. (The principal has indicated that all of these are options).</p>

<p>I've read <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/801/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-having-an-advanced-student-skip-kindergarten"">What are the pros and cons of having an advanced student skip Kindergarten?</a>, and found the answers helpful in general, but I think the situation at the start of the school system is different from that at later grades — see for example <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/a/1863/16243"">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>I recognize (and again see the prior question) that social groupings might be a factor, but in our case, our daughter really only has a few close friends in her grade (and we'll continue to be friends with those families anyway), and already has friends in the higher grade as well (from the math class, and just from the neighborhood).</p>

So, is there any reason why it would need to be boiled before giving it to a baby?</p>

"What potty training goals should I use for my son's reward chart?","<p>We've promised my 3 year old son an aquarium for when he completes potty training.  </p>

<p>Progress has not been as good as we'd like (he pees on the potty almost every day, but has only pooped once).  Our pediatrician suggested a chart, with specific goals he could work for, to make it more ""real"" than a nebulous promise of an aquarium when he's done.</p>

<p>We took him to the pet store, and had him pick out the tank, inhabitants, and ornaments.</p>

<p>We're planning on placing pictures of each of the items he picked out on a board, with specific goals associated with each item that he can work towards, and see progress with stars under each item. </p>

<p>For example, to get the aquarium itself, he'd need to complete all other goals, plus go <em>x</em> number of days in ""big boy underwear"" without an accident.</p>

<p>We've got between 10 and 14 different rewards to incorporate.  He picked out 14 things, but I felt that that might be too many (plus I'm not sure we can fit all of that in one aquarium).  </p>

<p>We want to start him right off the bat with feeling like he's making progress (so maybe something really easy for the first reward?), and we want to ensure that he continues to be motivated to continually make progress.</p>

<p>What goals should we set for each reward?</p>

<p>20 month old baby girl. Had a bout of the rainy stomach bug 5 days ago, she was down with a bad fever for 2 days, recovered from the fever on the 3rd day.</p>

<li><p>She's still
breast fed, so she's feeding almost every other hour (obviously she's
hungry?) </p></li>
<li>She's become insanely cranky and clingy, not leaving her
mother even for a second. </li>
<li><p>Interact with her with anything,
<strong>ANYTHING</strong>, and she starts crying inconsolably. And we have tried like
everything, the only response is crying + submissive behavior. </p></li>
<li><p>She's not in pain or discomfort, when we put some of her favorite
videos, she will watch them... sitting in our lap of course! She does have a little runny nose, but not like a full blown cold.</p></li>

"Should children of incarcerated parents be told the truth?","<p>On Saturday mornings, I visit a nearby county jail.  Most of the men I talk to are fathers.  Some are serving short sentences and others are awaiting trials that will likely result in lengthy separations from their families. (Longer terms are served in state prisons.) Since I represent a spiritual tradition that many of these men respect, they often ask for my advice on their parenting situations.</p>

<p>One situation that occasionally comes up is whether it's good for the children of inmates to be told the truth of their parent's situation.  For those facing long terms, I feel the answer is simple: tell the truth.  If the father does end up in prison for many years, children will certainly need to know and might resent the deception. </p>

<p>But what about men who are going to get out of jail shortly? Are children significantly harmed by the harsh reality that their father has been punished for misdeeds against the community? Does the nature of the crime and the age of the children alter the equation?</p>

<p>What is my next step?</p>

<p>I rarely whoop my girls, but my 13 yr old has pushed me 4 times in 3 months to have to spank her! </p>

<p>I give her ways to get her stuff back, but as of today she has lost the chance to earn anything back until she can respect me, and lose that smart mouth!  </p>

<p>She repeats every problem behavior my oldest had done, just 50 times worse! </p>

<p>I raised my kids kind of strictly. They have morals, and know right from wrong. They know their manners and know how to say ""yes ma'am,"" ""no ma'am,"" when to be quiet, and when to speak, but it seems like both my girls have to learn things the hard way. They do seem to learn from it, though! </p>

<p>My 13 year old thinks she's always right and knows everything. I don't know the reason she thinks she can tell me ""No,"" or smart-mouth me, but she is sadly mistaken.</p>

"Worried that Kumon tutoring is not working for our daughter","<p>We have enrolled our 6 year old daughter in the Kumon tutoring service for maths since November 2015, and at first she enjoyed it, completing the worksheets well and seeming to really understand her mathematics. We then started her English a few months ago, and again, she started well, enjoying it.</p>

<p>However in the past month or so, she's stopped enjoying it, finding it harder, and losing concentration with it, making silly mistakes in the process. She's losing her passion for Kumon, and it seems to be extending to learning in general. She's also not being actively taught in class, and she recently started column addition, but really struggled, meaning we had to go through it with her.</p>

<p>We try not to put any pressure on her, and only really complain about her results when it seems as if she's not put effort into the work, which recently is becoming more and more common.</p>

<p>We were thinking about stopping it, as if she's not enjoying it, we're worried about the impact it might have on her learning. We've also spoken to another parent that started it with their daughter, and they've now stopped it, because they thought it was stopping the passion and creativity for her, so we think it might be something that doesn't help for some children.</p>

<p>We were thinking it might be better to start a one to one tutor instead, as there's more teaching involved (which is kept to a minimum in Kumon), and it may help keep her creativity and passion for education.</p>

"Inadvertently hurting others' children","<p>This question may seem a little strange, but I guess it does nonetheless have to do with parenting, or with how to relate with other parents and their children.</p>

We wanted to play a round and started to get noticed by a curious little girl, who was the daughter of a couple who also was there. They didn't watch her closely (but hey, who could 100% of the time?). At some point she touched the surface where the disk bounces, and I told her not to do it again, because it was dangerous for her fingers.</p>

<p>I was stupid enough to not warn her that the disk may ""jump"", and guess what happens? In a perfectly fine match (disk never ever jumped away from the field), one time the disk flies into her eye.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not done on purpose, and I immediately felt bad about it. Neither me nor my girlfriend felt able to comfort the girl (it felt out of place for us to do it) and we called their parents to do it. We apologized too. The guy was absolutely friendly and basically said ""things happen"", while the mother took care of the little girl. After a while, I saw the child smile again and noticed she didn't have any ""damage"". I went to her and apologized to her too, explaining that we didn't do it on purpose, and asking if she was well now. I also shook her hand and presented myself and my girlfriend.</p>

<p>The mother was ice-cold.</p>

"Am I making the right decision for my child in removing the father’s choice?","<p>My daughter (age 5) has ADHD and ODD and a disorder I forget, but basically issues because of her AWOL dad. He has past charges of smoking Marijuana in front of her. This is Pennsylvania, where it's illegal. She knows what ""drugs"" are and told me about a month later. He just got in trouble months back for beating and tattooing another inmate while he was unconscious after the judge gave him a warning to behave. He's been in jail countless times. Paid child support once. Always leaves her with a sitter instead of cherishing his weekends with her. He doesn't stay on the agreements. He has taken her from my home and not given her back into my care until I call the police who say they can't involve themselves even though we had custody in a now-over PFA I had against him. </p>

<p>He is to be released in October. I had to ask the jail to refuse mail and phone calls from him because he threatened me and my husband. He's the smart stupid. He knows as long as he doesn't mention that he can and would harm our child, physically or mentally, or that he will take her and move out of state, that I have no grounds to have his parental rights revoked. He convinces his family into getting my daughter to go see him. They ask her before me so I am the bad guy if I say no. He claims I keep him from being in her life but he kept doing and selling drugs. Showed up to probation drunk a day I was taking her to see him. He is always in and out of jail and even put hot sauce on her tongue when she was two because she ""talked back"". She always begs me to see him and says she loves him. His separation and her knowing too much about him thanks to nosey family has caused her to be unruly and everytime we get her to a positive point he breaks her heart. </p>

<p>I'm currently attempting full custody. Am I right in this? Do I have a strong enough case to want this for her? I never would remove him totally because that's her decision when she is older. But he shows no urge to fix himself and I feel he should not be able to make any decisions in her life. I know he will try to take her when he gets out and is served with custody papers. What precautions should I take legally, if any? </p>

<p>For the record she wouldn't even know him from the guy at Walmart if I didn't keep pushing their relationship the whole time. She thought my roommate's poster of wiz Kalfia two years ago was him, and later thought some guy at McDonalds was. All she knows and loves of him is because I let her have photos and I tell her stories painting him as good. I've recently stopped talking about him all together because he hasn't showed interest in being a real father in five years. I don't want to encourage his fake attitude anymore. I can't keep painting for her. But it's even harder watching him lie to her and crushing her over and over. </p>

<p>He has a history of drugs, violence, guns, and more. My current fiance (husband in 4 weeks) has fathered her for 2 1/2 years. (He was her friend first easing into their relationship). Because of her love for her bio dad she will yell at me and tell me no matter wants to see him because of what he tells her. Am I wrong for taking his choices in her life away? He hasn't proved he can parent at all.</p>

<p>It seems like videotaping someone trusted to care for your kids is reasonable in some circumstances - you want to be in a position with enough trust that you don't need to (and we are lucky to be), but realistically, can everyone expect to get enough in an interview and from references to be sure of what happens when they're away?</p>

<p>The question is this:  </p>

<p><strong>How do you deal with the notion of creating a video, essentially to test trustworthiness, without risking violating reasonable expectations of trust/privacy yourself?</strong></p>

And no matter how I clean using hot water, put them in the boiling water on my stove, after some time I can notice that something (algae?) is developing inside. So I go and try everything again.</p>

<p>How can I clean them after every bath ? Or how can I clean them every x days? </p>

<p><em>Edit</em></p>

<p>Those cheaper ducks could be thrown away, but some of the others are hard to find/expensive. And the mini-shower wouldn't have any fun without splashing real water (that we use to bath the ducks during the bath).</p>

"What is the risk of SIDS for babies which sleep on their stomach (no other risk factors)?","<p>Bear with me, as I'm not very good with statistics. As far as I can tell the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/sids/data.htm"">risk of SIDS as of 2014 is 1 in 2,500 according to the CDC (obtained by reducing the 38.7 deaths per 100,000 to lowest terms)</a>. However, the CDC gives no information about the risk of SIDS for a baby whose parents follow all the recommended guidelines. In other words, the SIDS statistics include parents that smoked and wrapped children in large warm blankets. Is there any information about the risk of SIDS for a child which prone sleeps in a situation with a firm mattress, non-smoking parents, no extra bedding, etc.? It would also be great to know the risk of SIDS for the same baby sleeping on his back too. Please include sources.</p>

<p>The only information I could find on the risks of SIDS without other risk factors is <a href=""http://www.heracliteanriver.com/?p=97"">this blog</a>. It states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taking this into account, for people who have no other risk factors, here are the new odds (roughly):</p>
  
  <p>— Chances of a prone-sleeping infant succumbing to SIDS with no other risk factors: about 1 in 20,000 (range 10,000–25,000)</p>
  
  <p>— Chances of a supine-sleeping infant succumbing to SIDS with no other risk factors: about 1 in 50,000 (range 25,000–60,000)</p>
  
  <p>(Note — the numbers don’t quite match up with the other statistics quoted above, because the estimates were generated from a few different studies and calculated in a couple different ways.)</p>

"Potty training 20 months old, doesn't know when she needs to go","<p>We've started potty-training our 20 months old girl, during a 10 day vacation (from work and daycare). At first she would not sit on the potty, but that improved after the first few hours and now she mostly has no problems with the potty.</p>

<p>The problem is that she doesn't seem to know when she is about to urinate - she will go around the house or play and suddenly start peeing. When she notices this she would start saying ""pee pee"", but we are pretty sure it's from seeing the pee come out or feeling it run down her legs, and not from knowing that she is peeing.</p>

<p>We've tried various suggestion we've read on-line - having her in underwear or naked, praising (and rewarding) every attempt to use the potty (and the few successful hits), playing with a doll that also goes potty, asking her if she needs potty (the answer is always ""no"", even if she would then pee 30 seconds later), sitting her on the potty for a 10-15 minutes, etc. We are careful to have a positive atmosphere, never scolding her about the accidents.</p>

<p>She can go for an hour or more without peeing, both when with a diaper and without one. She also seems to be able hold peeing - sometimes she would pee, notice it and stop. Then pee a little again after 5 minutes. This might go on a few more times, until she lets go a lot of pee.</p>

<p>We're worried that she is just getting frustrated - she seems to understand that peeing is in the potty, but doesn't know when she needs to pee. Is this something that is developed during the potty-training? Or is this something that just has to come with time and we can't really do anything about? Since toddlers (and babies) have been (and still are in various other cultures) potty trained this young and younger, apparently without a problem, we hope that she will soon learn to recognize when she needs to pee.</p>

"My 9 year feels I publicly embarrass him","<p>I understand my 9 year old  is at the age where children are beginning to assert their independence and are about to begin cutting the apron strings. From my experience with his big brother, I understand that, apparently, boys really don't want their moms to volunteer at middle school, for one.. fathers are a different matter: you can be called a mama's boy, but not a daddy's boy, right?</p>

<p>In any case, this is not middle school yet. This is a gifted student program (where everybody is a geek and a mama's boy to a degree and there are no bullies), in a district where parents are known to volunteer a lot and keep a close eye on the kids at school.</p>

<p>So, as a single(ish) mother, what is my role then?</p>

<p>We are at the phase where my son is very affectionate in private, wants to sleep in my bed, can't tell me enough times how much he loves me; he is still OK with me volunteering. However, should I do something that does not meet his strict expectations at school (such as sit where other people apparently don't sit), he has tears running down his cheeks, he shows me his fist, and, worst of all, he is very public about admonishing me and publicly yells at me for ""embarrassing him"".</p>

<p>On some level, I understand what's going on; but, in our culture especially, family comes first and respect for parents is non-negotiable. I don't think this behavior would be OK in any culture though.. he would not think about treating his teacher or principal this way, wherever he happened to sit.</p>

"Dads and nurseries","<p>I'm the father of a three year old son who attends a workplace nursery in the UK. I'm together with his mum and admit can be a lazy so-and-so (in life in general, I make efforts not to be) but certainly don't consider anything beneath me, or ""for mums"". Part of that is that I drop off and collect my son from nursery, as well as things like changing nappies, doing bed time, medicine, cuddles, and so on. So far so unremarkable, it's not the 1950s.</p>

<p>Some of the staff at nursery, though, consistently treat me like I'm incompetent, or an idiot who doesn't understand how one human being looks after another, or say things like ""Look, [son]! Daddy's come to take you to mummy"". I'm told everything slowly and multiple times. If both of us (mum and dad) go there for a meeting, I'll barely get a glance. They'll also simply not listen to things I tell them to the extent that I ask my wife to tell them something so that they'll remember. It's not something that tends to happen in the rest of my life.</p>

<p>For a while I thought a mixture of ""I'm just being touchy"" or ""Maybe they're right"", but it's starting to get ridiculous and I can't really sustain that any more.

"7 Yr Old Using Violent Language During Play","<p>My 7 year old son has started using words like 'kill', 'murder' and 'stab' when he's playing with me or other kids.

"How can we help children learn to handle online freedom?","<p>It's clear that children growing up with the internet the same way that my generation grew up with television: it's ubiquitous. Just like my parents worried that too much TV would harm me, it's not difficult to worry about my children being harmed by the 'net. This last week, dana boyd wrote a thoughtful <a href=""http://time.com/23031/danah-boyd-let-kids-run-wild-online/"">opinion piece</a> for Time Magazine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What makes the digital street safe is when teens and adults collectively agree to open their eyes and pay attention, communicate and collaboratively negotiate difficult situations. Teens need the freedom to wander the digital street, but they also need to know that caring adults are behind them and supporting them wherever they go. The first step is to turn off the tracking software. Then ask your kids what they're doing when they're online&mdash;and why it’s so important to them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great advice and I wholeheartedly intend to follow it. My 10-year-old son certainly is growing up with the internet and we talk a lot about the things he does online. (Mostly he plays Minecraft and watches instructional videos...about Minecraft.) Checking in on his activities (by asking, not snooping) has been reassuring.</p>

<p>However, he managed to install a ton of adware on our family computer. (I suspect he followed some link claiming to make our computer run faster.) Thankfully, I caught the problem early. When I asked him about it the next day, he was evasive. He seemed relieved, actually, when I mentioned that I had turned on password protection for administrator tasks to prevent problems in the future. I suspect he knew he'd screwed up and was worried about how I'd react.</p>

<p>I'd like to believe that communication between children and parents will make his online interactions safer, but what can be done when communication breaks down? When shame prevents a child from coming to the parent for help, doesn't that make boyd's advice somewhat risky?</p>

<p>What I've noticed lately as in the past 2 months is that she will go as far as to do everything in her power to push my buttons and get me really angry/upset with her.  And then when I start to look noticeably angry and start to raise my voice, she laughs at me.  I am not sure if anyone has ever has ever been laughed at when you are already furious, but let me tell you it just makes you even more angry.  I've never been violent or hell I've never even been in a physical fight my entire life and I sure as hell haven't hit my kid or anyone for that matter.  But when you are at your most angry and someone just starts laughing at you, it really invokes a lot of restraint on anyone's part. I can't think of a worse thing to do to someone who is angry at you than to laugh at them.</p>

<p>What I have done out of my way of dealing with it is call her a name or something and then go to my bedroom to calm down.  I later regret the name calling and she regrets the laughing bit and I apologize to her and I get the same from her.  I am pretty sure if this same thing happened with a friend that they would physically attack her for doing such a thing, male or female.  As far as I know she only has done this with me so far.</p>

<p>Now the weird part and the part I don't understand is that she claims she cannot control the laughter.  She says that she doesn't want to laugh but she can't help it.  To me I can hear her, but I don't understand how someone can find humor in seeing you angry/upset with them.</p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced this?  And if so, how did you deal with it?</p>

"Newborn handstand pose","<p>Just few moments ago my 2.5 weeks old daughter when laid on her belly (she always liked it and even slept with hands reaching my neck) started to cry a little bit and started flexing. She stared to raise the whole lower part of her body almost to the position like this one <a href=""http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5sayaVGfj1rxfzlmo1_1280.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5sayaVGfj1rxfzlmo1_1280.jpg</a> but with chest still attached to mine. Just like she was trying to do a handstand. It looked really creepy but this is not what worries me. This just doesn't look normal to me. This is my first child so there are many surprising things, and I never panicked but with this one I feel a bit anxious, mainly because I had some balance problems in my late 20ties and I am still undiagnosed (so there is a limited possibility that this exotic condition is genetic).</p>

<p>What made me a little bit more nervous is that I tried googling (newborn trying to do a handstand, newborn pincha mayurasana) and to no avail. Maybe I cannot into google as I am not really sure how to phrase the question in my native language.</p>

<p>After being picked up by my wife she calmed down and I haven't tried putting her on belly since -  I don't want to cause pain to my daughter just for the sole purpose of ""debugging"" the child.</p>

<p>I called my mother and she told me to calm down because maybe my daughter is having some abdominal pain and just trying to do all she can not to put the pressure on the belly. And I would be perfectly calm if she would try to roll over. But it's like telling someone that it's normal for a child to start levitating because of back pain (sorry for the exaggeration but I want to you to understand my perspective).</p>

<p>My questions:
Have anyone encountered similar situation?
Do you think that this is something that requires immediate action (going to hospital) as it may suggest neurological problems or should I wait until next doctor's appointment? This is not a persistent situation so I think it is better to evaluate the situation before going to the hospital (which may cause more harm than good and we still may end up being redirected to a neurologist after classification as not life threatening situation)</p>

<p>Side question:
As this is something that isn't easily describable what is the best way to include a video. How to attach/upload it? I want maximum privacy (the less media of my daughter online the better) so maybe some time limited hosting but then if someone else will encounter something like that in the future these is no reference. I want to be decent (I try to be naked for skin on skin contact) so should I use some blur on my lower part of the body or it would still be considered indecent. The blurring is also related to faces (privacy) ofc.</p>

"Toddler Pooping Problems","<p>My little girl is 3 years old (she will be 4 in July). She is fully potty trained when it comes to peeing on the potty. However pooping is a different story. When we were first starting the potty training, she started holding in her poop making it hard for her to go. </p>

<p>We took her to her to the Dr they put her on Miralax said, ""this will help"" for 1.5 years she was on Miralax, we took her off because she was pooping in pants, with ease, but not on the potty, it was as if she didn't know she had to go, it would slip right out. So we took her off the Miralax and put her on Fiber Gummies, it seemed to work, she was pooping on the potty! </p>

<p>4-5 months go by, doing well, then all of a sudden she starts having troubles pooping again. We will have to start the Miralax all over again. She starts pooping with ease in her panties so once again we take her off Miralax &amp; she is once again pooping on potty with gummies. </p>

<p>One month later, we are having troubles AGAIN. The thing about this ordeal is that her poop is NOT hard and she is pooping just a bit in her butt cheeks but enough to soil her panties. I have tried everything I know! I don't know what to do any more. I have tried talking to her, asking her if she feels if she has to go potty, she won't tell you. We've tried rewards, making her clean her own panties and even taken things away, nothing seems to help. It's not that she is scared to go to the potty, because she will go, has done it before... but when we are having pooping issues, we got through 4-5 pairs of panties in a day for 1-2 weeks then she will start pooping on the potty again. </p>

<p>We have taken her to the doctors over this several times, even to the point where we did a CT to see if she had a tethered spinal cord. All was clear on that. Her doctors do not seemed overly concerned by this, however as the parents of our DD we are and do not think this is normal almost 4 year old behavior! Before she moves up in her pre-school she must be FULLY potty trained!! We are at our last wits end. Has anyone else gone through this? What was done to correct this problem?</p>

<p>Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you in advanced!!</p>

"Established methods to help fussy/picky eaters at late primary age","<p>Our 8 year old daughter has always been a picky eater - even as a baby we had a hard time convincing her to try different baby foods. We assumed she'd grow out of it, but it hasn't happened and it's becoming an increasing problem. </p>

<p>I guess we should be thankful that the range of foods she's willing to eat does include some healthy options like carrot and cucumber, so we're not as badly off as some. But her favourite things are pasta tossed in pesto, noodles tossed in soy sauce and various kinds of junk. Given the choice, she'd eat nothing else.</p>

<p>We're vegetarian so we're already limited - in fact we've got so desparate for her to broaden her range of foods that we've tried to get her to eat fish, but she refuses. Her mum &amp; I both feel it's important to eat a meal together as a family, but at the same time we're not keen on cooking multiple different dishes for everyone. So we alternate between her pickyness being allowed to dictate the families' menu to a narrow and boring range of dishes, or serving things she dislikes which she will eat while making gagging faces and trying every trick in the book to get away from the table early.</p>

<p>Things she particularly dislikes which are particularly problematic include potato and melted cheese. This means eating out with friends is a nightmare, since other parents and establishments typically serve things popular with children like chips/fries and pizza. So she ends up not eating.</p>

<p>We've tried being nice about it and encouraging her to try new things. We've tried being nasty about it and making her eat things she doesn't like. We've tried carrot and stick by suggesting she could eat with her friends more often if she was happy eating different things. We've tried involving her more in menu planning and food preparation, both of which she greeted with boundless enthusiasm and then refused to eat anything unfamliar, even if she'd helped plan or make it.</p>

<p>Since we've made/encouraged her to repeatedly try things she doesn't like, she has had repeated exposure (yes, more than the magic 10-15 times) to a lot of the things she rejects, to no avail. Is there anything else we can try? Anything with a proven track record?</p>

"What do I do about my abusive father?","<p>I'm 16 years old and live in the UK. My father has been physically and verbally abusing me for as long as I could remember, e. g. he punches, hits or slaps me. It's only been reported once to the police but in reality it's been happening all my life. </p>

<p>He abuses me, my mother and my sister. My mum is always too afraid to report it to the police. Growing from an Asian family it's hard for parents to show affection for their children and they are extremely strict, but the violence is unnecessary. </p>

<p>I found my father beating up my mother in the morning, it's what woke me up. This was reported to the police because I urged my mother, but because they couldn't find any bruises they're not taking immediate action. I hate talking to the police and am petrified of them. </p>

<p>As my father owns the house he can stay for as long as he pleases, until the police come to interview him. He's been staying for almost three days and I've been too scared to see him so I stayed with my cousins. </p>

<p>Today I wanted to come home so I could do all my schoolwork that is on my computer at home, but I found out my father was still home. I called my mum and asked if she could ask him to leave as I am scared and feel unsafe being alone with him in the house. Instead, she screamed at me and said ""there's nothing she can do?"".  Is it really my fault that I don't want to be alone with my abusive father? This really frustrates me about my mother and it drives me insane. </p>

<p>I really really don't know what to do but my schoolwork is so important to me. I just cannot stand the abuse from my father anymore, when all of this happens the part that I hate the most is that I feel bad for him. He has never done anything in my life but leave bruises on my skin. But I still feel bad for him and hate myself so much for it.</p>

"How to help a 2-year-old settle in day care where a foreign language is spoken?","<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>Our son is starting daycare in a country where the language is (almost) completely alien to him. Can we do anything to help him settling in this new environment? <em>(full story below)</em></p>

<h1>Original story</h1>

<p>Our son, who is <strong>26 months old</strong>, was born in the foreign country that we're living in at the moment (UK - but the question should be universal), but so far he had little exposure to its language. <strong>At home our native language</strong> (Hungarian) <strong>is spoken all the times</strong> as this is the most convenient (both parents are from there), and he only occasionally hears English when we meet friends or the neighbours, or on the playground. He is starting in a day nursery very soon where only English is spoken and we're concerned that he might have a hard time settling in. </p>

<p>The existing questions I found here are mostly focusing on the language development in these situations, however we're not concerned too much about that directly, as many suggests that children at this age can adapt to new languages very easily. <strong>Our concerns are more about the initial shock of the new situation and the emotional consequences of settling in to daycare</strong>. </p>

<p>Not only he will be left without his parents, which is quite a new concept to him (he never had been left to the care of someone else for more than half an hour and even those were rare occasions), but also in an environment where no one understands him. To make it more difficult, this happens in the age when he had just recently started to speak (he can form some two-three word sentences now, but this is only a very recent achievement, so far he seemed a bit on the late side of the language development) and when he seemingly enjoys that he is able to communicate his desires and can reflect to the world he sees. On the positive side - due to our working hours - for the first half-year he only need to be in day care for two days a week.</p>

<p>The nursery suggested we come to the first sessions with <strong>a mini-dictionary of his most commonly used words</strong>, so the teachers in his group can memorise them. However I'm not convinced that this is a good idea. Due to the vastly different pronunciation between the two languages there is a chance that they won't be able to use it anyway, and even if they do, I'm concerned this would just confuse him even more, as some of his words will be understood but most won't be. I feel that it would be less confusing if we kept clear boundaries between the languages and the places where they are spoken. </p>

<p>So the question is, if this dictionary sounds like a good idea and is there anything more we can do to help him settling in under these circumstances? </p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>Thanks for the great answers so far. A month has passed since his first sessions and unfortunately <strong>he couldn't settle in yet</strong>. He is usually crying from the morning till he is picked up, refusing to eat or drink or do anything in the nursery. </p>

<p>Of course this struggle cannot be solely attributed to the language barrier, I'd think at best it's only some addition to the emotional stress caused by the separation from the parents. However the caregivers told us that our son often <strong>seems to be completely lost</strong>, not understanding what's going on over his head. <strong>Other children</strong> try to play with him in his better moments but sooner or later they start to talk to him and <strong>when he doesn't answer they leave him alone</strong>. We noticed he became unusually shy amongst other children when we're out on the playground too. </p>

<p>So beyond the well-discussed general settling-in advices I'd be still interested in ideas on how to address the language barrier issue.</p>

<p>We changed a few things in a hope these will help:</p>

<ul>
<li>started teaching him the language at home by playing some role-plays in English</li>
<li>printed a set of pictures of the toys they are playing in the nursery and ask him what they are in English</li>
<li>trying to spend more time in play groups which are similar to the daycare environment but with parent's supervision</li>
</ul>

"How to help a 4-year-old who is afraid because she doesn't know yet what she will do when she's grown up?","<p>I have a 4-year-old daughter. Yesterday, when I was changing my daughter in her PJ's to get ready for bed she started crying out of nowhere. This was very surprising because we don't get that very often with her.</p>

<p>When I asked what was wrong she answered: ""I don't know what to be when I am older!"", and the crying intensified. I picked her up and cuddled her, telling here it's going to be fine, and there is no shame in the fact that she doesn't know that, that in time it will come to her, and it's more important to be happy than to be anything else. It took me a hour to get her to calm down! She seemed scared of the fact of growing up.</p>

<p>Now, our daughter is not your typical daughter, she was making 2~3 word sentences when she was 1 year of age, and adding and subtracting about the time she turned 2 years old (already talking with full sentences by then). Now, her intellect is about 6~7 years of age, but her emotional needs are still those of a 4-year-old.</p>

<p>How can we make it clear to her there is no shame in not knowing what you want to be? Can we give her options to trigger her imagination so she will not be afraid of it. Could making her visualizing it (something she likes to do, like taking care of animals on a farm) take the fright out of the situation?</p>

"If my 5yr old is an exceptional liar, should I expect that she will continue lying as she gets older?","<p>I have a gorgeously adorable 5 year old daughter who over the past 6 months or so has developed a bent towards lying. Adorable + lying = bad recipe for a pushover dad (I'm really not, I may be mushy but not a pushover. honest.).</p>

<p>I get that all young kids lie and I get that my daughter probably isn't the worst of them, but nevertheless she <em>does</em> lie, and often, and in very believable ways (legit tears and pleas of, <em>I promise, I really really promise</em>), over very minor things. Her goal in lying is naturally that she either (a) doesn't want to get in trouble,  or (b) wants something (<em>mommy said I could have candy</em> - no. she didn't.). Lately, the issue has been when we ask her if she's done a specific thing we've told her she's not allowed to do. The answer is <em>always</em> ""No"" -- we know (or at least highly suspect) she's lying at least some of the time, but we have no real way to verify which times are truth and which times are lies. (this isn't really my question, but to try and cultivate truth we've expressed that the main thing isn't disobeying, it's lying to us about it. <em>If you just tell the truth, we won't even be that upset at you</em>.)</p>

<p>So, my question is for those of you who've gone through this stage with your kids in the past -- does it get better? I know that I need to encourage her in truth, but I mainly wonder just as a personality trait in general, can I expect her to ever do a 180 in this? My wife and I are committed to honesty, regardless of consequence - we want our daughter to be, too. </p>

<p>We start to get her ready for bed around 8pm. By 8:30 she is in her bed, and the lights are off. Come 11pm when we go to sleep, she is still awake! Again, she isn't crying and as far as we can tell she isn't afraid (she does like the hall light on and the door cracked, so we do that).</p>

<p>Only occasional will she come out of her room, and it is usually for a sip of water or to go potty. Most of the time she returns back to her bed without a problem.</p>

<p>We find her in there playing with toys or looking at books. If we take all that away she will stay awake playing with her fingers or talking to herself. It doesn't matter if she was in the house all day, or played outside for hours on her bike. She just won't fall asleep. She always tells us she isn't tired.</p>

<p>We have tried soothing music but that doesn't work. If we try to stay with her until she sleeps, she just tries to talk to us. We don't talk back to her; she just tells us everything she wants to do tomorrow. </p>

"Is behavioural optometry a real thing?","<p>My 5 year old son was having some trouble concentrating in class and it was recommended that we see a behavioural optometrist. A standard optical test showed his eyes were not perfect but within normal range for his age. The optometrist then ran some further tests with some special glasses that showed his brain was struggling to process the visual signal - thus causing tiredness and lack of concentration. To aid this, we got a pair of mild prescription glasses that he now wears in class and when doing his homework.</p>

<p>My feeling is that this has helped. He now reads longer and more accurately at home. However, since then I've come across articles <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14vision-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> and I'm wondering if this is just wishful thinking.</p>

<p><em>Extra information:</em></p>

<p>I took my other child to a normal optometrist today just for a routine check-up. During the tests, I noticed her running the same tests as the behavioural optometrist; she said she was testing for eye divergence. I then related the story of my son and asked for the validity of the assessment. She said that mild prescription glasses is a valid course of action and would his reduce eye strain since they so not have to work so hard to counter his eye divergence.

"My husband, who is my teen daughter's step father feels bad that he can't have a closer relationship with my daughter","<p>Four years ago, I divorced my ex after 26 years of marriage.  He was extremely manipulative and abusive. He kept track of every mile I put on our vehicles and had to explain if I was ten minutes longer at the grocery store than he thought I should be.  He also cheated on me for most of our marriage.  He often told me that if I left him that he would turn the kids against me. For the last four years, he has tried to do that with no success.  He is a terrible person and I still have to share custody of our 16 year old daughter with him.</p>

<p>I have since married a wonderful man who treats me and my daughter like gold.  He loves my daughter like his own.  He supports her with her financial needs (dates, sports activities, insurance etc.) He has not missed a single volleyball, basketball game, or track meet that she has played.  He has never raised his voice to her.</p>

<p>My daughter is very happy and has never caused me or my husband any trouble.  She is a great athlete and an honor student, and I often hear from teachers, coaches, moms of her friends what a good girl she is.  I'm very close to her, and we have a great relationship.</p>

<p>What I am struggling with is my daughter will not allow herself to get very close to my husband, and he gets his feelings hurt, which I can understand.  She is polite and respectful of him, and sometimes tells him thanks.  When me and my husband are in the same room, she will walk by and tell me thanks or good bye without acknowledging him. He is a teacher at her school, and all of her friends talk to him and get a long great with him, but she barely acknowledges him at school.  </p>

<p>When my daughter goes a few weeks without having to spend a lot of time with her dad, then her relationship with my husband is great.  I know that my ex is still manipulating her, and cannot stand the thought of her having another man be a father figure to her, even though he doesn't support her or behave like a father in any way.  </p>

<p>I am at a loss as to how to make it easier for my husband.  He does all the father stuff, and my ex gets to be the one who dances with her at prom, and all those father/daughter activities.</p>

<p>One one hand, I think we are lucky that things are as good as they are.  I have friends who are in a similar situation, and there is a lot of drama between the kids and step-parent.  Is my husband expecting too much?  How do I make him feel better about the sacrifices he is making for my daughter?  My two adult married kids love him and are so happy that I married him.</p>

"Developing creativity and out-of-box thinking among kids","<p>A teacher asked my 5 year old son to draw an apple and colour it. He draws a large apple and coloured it in purple.  This is not a usual behaviour though. Many times he has drawn fruits of the real colors. </p>

"Restarting baby-led weaning after an actual choking","<p>My daughter choked on mango one month into baby-led weaning (and yes, I do mean choked: reddening, wide-eyed, silent).  We banged the mango out and she was fine.  I however, am far from fine.</p>

<p>I have been sliding back into purees since.  She feeds herself (pincer or spoon), but the food is still chunky, over-the-counter puree; soft lumps like rice or grits; or baby fingernail size bits like cheese.  I have been unable to get passed this fear of a choking encore.</p>

<p>I am frustrated trying to find support for my particular case.

"How will my toddler pick up one language which seems harder than the other?","<p>Our 16 month old son is just starting to talk. He understands a lot and he's lately saying a number of simple 1 syllable English words (cheese, shoes, pea, cat, dog, duck etc). However, my husband and his close relatives are Indian so we would both like our son to also know Hindi. My husband speaks to our son only in Hindi. </p>

<p>Our son hasn't yet said any Hindi words but when we count up his English words he says somewhere between 25 and 30 words, mostly nouns. Nearly all of them have only one syllable. When my husband thinks of the Hindi word for these things they almost all have two syllables.</p>

<p>Our son does seem to understand well when my husband speaks to him but we are worried that the seemingly more complex nature of the words in Hindi will make it more difficult for him to pick up and that he'll be much behind in his Hindi compared to English. He's already at a disadvantage in Hindi because we live in England with not many people around us who speak Hindi.</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience of bringing up a child with two languages where one seems to be more difficult than the other? Might we be worrying unnecessarily and once he gets the hang of words with more than one syllable, he'll start saying more Hindi words?

The difference is that the crying continues all morning—at least until mid-day nap time.  If he sleeps, sometimes the afternoon is then OK.  Once or twice he's had a miserable afternoon too. This has been going on for about two weeks.</p>

<p>He has been going to this daycare from the age of 3 months. He was OK in the infant classroom, then, several weeks ago his initial week in the toddler room was reportedly great (at least, someone told me, ""as great as it ever can be when you share a class with [insert name of disruptive child who upsets everyone]""). Then there was a break of nearly two weeks, during which there were also some staff changes, and when we resumed... misery.  </p>

<p>What to do? My instinct tells me to try to minimize the drama (we try not to make a big deal about going to school and always talk about it positively) but then power through it so that he has an opportunity to learn to be less sensitive to whichever aspects bother him (the separation? the problem kid? the new teachers? ...?)  My wife has endured this up to a point, but has now started taking him home again and staying there with him when it gets really bad (a couple of days so far). I worry both about the inconsistency this presents to him and also about the message it sends that crying gets you out of things you don't like.</p>

<p>Consultation with the daycare director seemed like a good way to get more insight. We were reassured that this is probably a natural ""bump"" and a frequent occurrence and it'll work itself out. Without disagreeing with this outright (it might be right, for all I know) we tried to get more detail/advice but were rapidly treated as if we were the problem and the wagons started defensively circling as if we were complaining (which we were not) unreasonably (which we are not).  So probably nothing more constructive can come from that avenue.</p>

"How do I help my cousin solve puzzles with me without being upset?","<p>I'm 25 and I babysit my cousin occasionally. I like puzzles (a good deal) and I have since I was a child. My cousin is old enough (6) to know this too.</p>

<p>My older brother sometimes looks after my cousin and will sometimes be stumped by the puzzles my cousin will present him (more like riddles, I guess, like ""What gets wetter as it dries"" kind of stuff), so my cousin often presents him with new puzzles every week. My brother doesn't seem to mind too much since he can answer most of them. My younger sister is not a fan of puzzles at all (she says they're too conniving, which I can't disagree with) so if he presents her with a puzzle, she actively does not solve it and encourages him to tell her the answer instead of solving it herself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I've been doing mental gymnastics since I was a kid, and if he hands me any puzzle, I immediately know the answer (he's getting his puzzles from books I used to own). When he was younger, I would only solve the ""hardest"" puzzles, i.e. if he came at me with a puzzle rated with four stars our of five, I would solve that one, and if he came with one with one or two stars, I would encourage him to tell me the answer. That's how my dad got me into puzzles when I was young. </p>

<p>I do not ever solve puzzles without walking him through the steps (unless he tells me the answer first and the answer is correct). It worked for a while, but he caught on to the ratings really quickly and now he only brings high rated ones.</p>

<p>But I can't get him to do the puzzles himself (or sometimes I can't get him to work on an easier one that would help him learn to solve the hard one). For example, he came to me with a 5 star puzzle that I could water down to a 2.5 star puzzle. I changed the puzzle to be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sophie: ""Someone ate my cookies! I wanted that for later! Who was it?""</p>
  
  <p>Person A: It wasn't me!</p>
  
  <p>Person B: It wasn't A or D, I saw!</p>
  
  <p>Person C: But I didn't eat it either!</p>
  
  <p>Person D: Person C is telling the truth.</p>
  
  <p>Only one person is lying. Who ate the cookies?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem I watered it down from had about ten people (and altogether is really long so there's no point in posting it). This puzzle is something he can absolutely solve on his own, but he won't do it. Instead he complains that I'm not being fun or I'm not helping him. If I solve the puzzle he gets annoyed that I'm not helping him and if I walk him through the steps he complains that I'm not letting him think. If I ask him ""What do you think we should do first/next/now?"" He says, ""You already know the answer, so it doesn't matter.""</p>

<p>For the above puzzle, he knows (and has stated) that the key to solving it is that <strong>only one person is lying</strong>. But if I ask him, ""Which person is telling the truth?"" He says, ""You already know so it doesn't matter."" But he doesn't seem to be saying it in a happy way, like it's a joke? He seems upset. He'll happily solve puzzles with my siblings or my parents, even though my dad is more of a puzzle beast than I am.</p>

<p>I really do love my cousin and I'm glad he likes puzzles too, but I can't get him to solve them on his own if I'm around.

"How to fit 3 children car seats into the back of a car","<p>My 3rd child was just born and I've discovered fitting the seats for all my children into the car is a real problem.</p>

<p>My oldest child is using a booster, my middle child a car seat and the new baby is still in an infant carrier.</p>

<p>My car is a large compact (Citroen C3 Picasso), and the 3 seats only physically fit in the car if I use the seat belt (and not the ISOFIX/LATCH system) to secure the car seat - even then the 3 seats completely cover the entire car back seat and there's no way to get to the seat belt for the booster.</p>

<p>I've also tried with my parent's car that is a roomy family car (Hyundai I30 CW) and have the same problem.</p>

<p>We tried putting the baby carrier in the front seat but this didn't work because we need to also fit two adults in the car (and putting the 2nd adult in back between 2 seats isn't practical)</p>

<p>So, what's the standard solution for this problem, how can I get two adults and 3 children into the car safely, reasonably comfortably and legally? </p>

<p>Are there special narrow car seat models? I've seen seat belt extenders on the internet, are they safe? is there anything else I'm missing?</p>

"Discipline hyperactive 3 year old","<p>I have a three year old son who is just awesome.  He is advanced intellectually,  loving, and he seems very empathetic.  He does extremely well in daycare (it is at least an above average daycare), and most of the time at home at well.
<em>However</em>, there are times when he becomes - for lack of a better word - unreachable.  He'll start climbing on his mothers head; run around the room; throw things; etc - and all this would be tolerable to some extent if:</p>

<ul>
<li>There was any way at all of getting him to listen.</li>
<li>He responded to requests to stop.</li>
<li>His behavior was not accompanied with what sounds like maniacal laughter.</li>
</ul>

<p>A typical episode plays out something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>He starts being disruptive beyond what I will tolerate.</li>
<li>I go through various stages of firmness in disciplining him as his behavior continually worsens.</li>
<li>I  threaten him with the loss of something (I always keep my promises) to no avail.</li>
<li>Eventually I take him to his room.  I stand outside holding the door as he tries to get out (he doesn't know I am holding it).</li>
<li>He starts throwing anything that has weight at the door or kicking the door or opening and slamming his trifold closet door.  </li>
<li>Eventually I realize that unless I intervene, his room / stuff / body will be damaged and I go in the room.</li>
<li>Usually I still haven't lost my temper (but I'm getting close), and I go in.  I sit on his bed with him, and hold him as gently as I can while attempting to keep him somewhat still (I hate this and it seems wrong but I see no alternative) while he alternates between laughing and crying hysterically to let him go, ""you're hurting me"" (I'm not), and if I let him go, well - one time I said 'if I let you go, are you going to hit me?'  He looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and said, 'Yes!'  (I regret to say I was not able to stop myself from laughing)...  </li>
</ol>

<p>This all continues for a long time until he gives up sort of - and I do my very best to have him get why he was put in his room in the first place and that daddy loves him and is not mad and it is not ok to do x, etc.</p>

<p>And his behavior has greatly improved in many aspects - until he becomes <em>unreachable</em>.  Whatever happens over their with him when he is in that space seems beyond my powers to interrupt.</p>

"What are some ways to get an older sibling to give a younger sibling a little space?","<p>We have 2 daughters - a 4 year old and a 1 year old.  Our 4 year old daughter will not leave our 1 year old daughter alone.  It is nothing malicious or intentionally mean, but it feels like we should be protecting the younger one.  I actually believe the older one is doing it because she loves the younger one so much.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Overwhelming the 1 year old with toys.  The older one will bring the younger one a toy.  The younger one starts playing with it, and 5 seconds later the older one will take the toy away and give a her a new toy to play with.  This goes on until we tell the older one that it was nice she gave her sister a toy, but she should just let her play with one toy.  The older one is doing it to be nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Hugging for too long.  The older one loves to give the younger one hugs, and the younger one is fine with a quick hug, but the older one wants to hug for 5 seconds or more.  After a 1-2 seconds the younger one starts screaming because she wants to go play.  The older one is hugging her because she loves her, but we can't get it through her head to do a light, quick hug and then let her go.</p></li>
<li><p>Getting in her face.  When the older one wants to talk to the younger one, she will get 2 inches from her face.  She wants to put her hands on her cheeks and talk to her.  The younger one hates it (who enjoys having someone talk to you a couple inches away).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few other things like this, and these things happen many times a day.  I honestly believe her intentions are good.</p>

<p>We always tell the older one that it is sweet that she loves her sister so much, but that she needs to give her some space.  This has been going on for a few months, and I'm not sure we are going about it the right way.  </p>

<p>We have tried gently demonstrating to the older one how hugging for too long or constantly replacing toys is not fun for the receiver (the 4 year old hates it when someone does it to her, but she just can't associate it with her sister).</p>

<p>We don't want to get after the older one all day long (like watching a sporting event when the refs blow the whistle every few seconds - just let them play!), but at the same time it doesn't feel fair to the younger one - or maybe that's just part of being a younger sibling?</p>

<p>Does anyone have ideas of things to tell our older daughter or ways to teach her to give her sister some space?  Or should we just leave them alone and let the younger one learn to fend for herself?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

"What is a safe but useful temperature to set your hot water at?","<p>As you know, modern hot water systems allow you to set the maximum temperature of hot water coming out, either by using less gas/electricity or by mixing the hot water with cold water to the set temperature.</p>

<p>We have baby (our first) arriving in 2 weeks and we probably should revise our hot water setting down from 50°C (which my husband likes to leave it at for doing dishes of all things!) All the books and anecdotal baby advice recommend utilising the temperature setting on the hot water system to avoid children, especially babies, accidentally being burned.</p>

<p>I've read conflicting advice for the right, kid-safe temperature. At the low end, one book suggests 38°C, which is basically just body temperature. At the other end, my husband and I like to shower at around 44°C (which we do by turning on a cold tap and manually mixing which is probably stupid). Apparently it takes a couple of minutes for a kid to get badly burnt at 50°C but just a couple seconds for third degree burns at 60°C so some kind of tradeoff might be in order below 50°C. Would 44°C be safe? What would you set it at?</p>

"Is breastfeeding success possible when baby has ""bubble palate""?","<p>I am having trouble breastfeeding my fourth baby. I have successfully breastfed two of my other three kids, so I am confident that my technique is not to blame. To confirm this I saw a lactation counselor who told me that my baby has a ""bubble palate"" in addition to a possible submucosal tongue tie and a lip tie. She said that an ENT would be able to give me an ""official"" diagnosis, so I will make an appointment ASAP.  In the meantime, she gave me some direction as to how cope until she can be treated, but, she also said that ""no one does anything about a tongue tie like that, but perhaps you can find someone who will."" She said nothing about the ""bubble palate"" other than it might get better when the lip tie is fixed, and/or when the baby gets bigger (she's three weeks old right now.) For now, my baby is getting enough to eat, her weight gain is fair (within normal, if a bit slow compared to my other children), and my supply is holding steady, but, the LC did say that by the time she's a month old, my baby might not be able to get enough and my supply will most likely suffer. This breaks my heart-I can't bear the thought that my baby might go hungry and the solution will be to quit bf'ing. </p>

<p>I have been looking for more info about ""bubble palate"" and have found nothing of any substance or credibility, just a bunch of ""stay strong, you can get thru this"" and ""just give baby a bottle"" on chat forums. I found one pdf of a paper written by a dentist that had pictures of cadavers with bubble palate but no info such as a medical/scientific name for the condition, how to treat it, long term effects, or methods of dealing with the feeding difficulties associated with it. I can find so much about cleft palates/lips, and tongue/lip ties, but nothing about this other defect.  I am at this point fairly well informed about the lip/tongue tie problem, and will pursue correcting it, but there's still a big ""what if"" in my mind regarding the palate: ""what if fixing those two <em>isn't</em> enough?""</p>

<p>So, to sum up my actual questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is ""bubble palate""?</li>
<li>Can it be ""cured"", resolved, corrected, or outgrown?</li>
<li>What are some strategies to overcome feeding issues if there's nothing that can be done?

<ul>
<li>are there any other effects besides the trouble with breastfeeding (speech, solid foods, oral hygiene, tooth alignment, etc)?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, related question:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the likelihood that correcting the lip (and possibly tongue) tie will be enough to overcome the difficulty we're having- making the ""bubble palate"" a non-issue?</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides research/scientific info, I'd certainly be interested in other parents' experiences/strategies. </p>

<p>We need help.</p>

<p>Some additional info:</p>

<p>Baby was born full term, healthy, vaginal delivery w/o drugs/intervention. No complications during labor, delivery, or pregnancy.</p>

<p>No family history of defects.</p>

<p>The ""bubble"" is located on the hard palate behind her gums, and feels like a baby pea-sized indentation when I let her suck on my finger.</p>

<p>My pediatrician sort of dismissed my concerns, since, at our appointment to discuss all this he gave her a bottle and she took it. She dribbled milk out of the side of her mouth like she does at the breast, so she's not getting good suction on an artificial nipple either. For this reason (and, bc breastfeeding should not so easily be given up on) I don't accept his ""solution"" which is to just bottle feed her.</p>

<p>I realize this borders on asking for medical advice, but I'm hoping someone has more info than my dr and the LC (who is a nurse) provided.</p>

<p>I am not so pro-breastfeeding that I'll pursue it to the detriment of my child, but I do think it's worth fighting for. </p>

"Teaching children how to fight back","<p>When I was growing up, my mom taught me that if someone hit me, I was supposed to fight back with all I had, and there was no such thing as fighting fair. ""Don't stop until an adult <em>pulls you off of them</em>,"" she would say. Luckily, despite being a pretty nerdy and solitary creature, I never had an encounter with the ""school bully"" outside of words exchanged. </p>

"Is having a sibling better for a child?","<p>We have several friends who have two or more children, while myself and my wife only have one. Often when we visit them, it seems that the conversation always turns to, ""When are you having your second?"", and when we suggest that we only want one, we are often met with incredulous reactions, often followed with statements like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Shame! Poor child, he'll be all alone when you two are gone.</li>
<li>Shame, he won't have someone to talk to about issues at home.</li>
<li>It's much easier to have two or more, they can play with each other.</li>

<li>Isn't that a bit selfish, you should think about your son, he'll be better off with a brother/sister.</li>

"How strict should we be with our 14-month-old boy?","<p>Our baby is really sweet :)</p>

<p>Generally can be considered as a good / easy going baby. There are times though, when he gets totally out of control.</p>

<p>I've had a discussion with a child-psychologist who stated that it is crucial, even for the first months, not to let the child to do things that are not appropriate, by just changing the tone of the voice. That way you set boundaries to the kid and he supposedly learns not to cross them.</p>

<p>For example, there is this bookcase full of books and magazines, where we usually let him play  with the magazines. Many times though he grabs and throws books from the upper part, which is not desirable by us, most importantly because some of them are heavy and he might be injured.</p>

<p>So it is now understood by him, that messing with the books is not an action we are happy about, and some times he's even looking around, to see if we are watching him.</p>

<p>But there are times where he will keep taking those books, even when we are watching him, without listening to us at all.</p>

<p>How much we should insist to not letting him doing such a thing? It seems that he knows pretty much well what he's doing (something that's not appropriate), but there are other moments though were I think that we should not be so strict, and just let him... throw these books (with care of course) :)</p>

<p>Taken in mind that he's 14 months old, should we keep insisting that this is an unaccepted behavior, or we should loosen up a bit and let him... go wild?</p>

"How do I deal with my mother who is not supporting me, probably because of her grandchild?","<p>I think sort of related: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/4327/how-to-handle-a-mother-who-is-becoming-unkind-to-the-adult-child"">How to handle a mother who is becoming unkind to the adult child?</a></p>

<p>My grandparents live out of country (We live in Indonesia), and they decided to support my brother's college studies. My mother told my brother that after he gets a job, he should help me also get to college, and my brother agreed.</p>

<p>After four years and getting a degree, my brother is still trying to get a good job. I decided to defer my enrollment for next year. In this time my brother got someone pregnant and is now having a family. Now I do not have anyone to support me for my studies.</p>

<p>It has gotten worse because now my mother is totally ignoring me and pouring all attention to her grandchild (who lives in our house most days). This is not jealousy, but mere pragmatism. She does not do chores anymore, and spends most money for my niece (her grandchild). It has gotten to the point where we (my father, I,) out right miss dinner, because nothing is prepared... (at this times we just cook for ourselves)</p>

<p>We can't not have her not have the money (example we budget my father's salary) because she receives still considerable money from her parents. (my grandparents told me that they are willing to help me out on college, but only at unique times and not monthly commit compared to my brother, because they were disappointed too)</p>

<p>I am very stressed and sad right now. Now my mother does not want me to go to college (She says she should just keep the money for her old age). She is always telling me to look at my brother who got a job unrelated to his degree (he is now teaching singing). </p>

<p>I am mainly sad because it feels that my mother is not supporting me both financially and morally.</p>

<p>I have big dreams and I do believe I am a hard working. In the one year of my deferrment I tried to work and even got a job (even though I was 17 at the time.) With the money I earned and saved everything I was even planning to buy my parents a cheap car. But because of our argument (about that I should not go to college) I am having second thoughts. In fact I am feeling a bit suicidal because it seems that my dreams are crushed. </p>

<p>My mother is always telling us not to have s-x with and support our family first. But with my mother's actions I am now feeling that my brother did the right thing - he now has a family, a degree, a moderately good job. <strong>And my mother's favor</strong>. While I am left without a plan, no support (even small things like having food prepared), and my dreams/actions constantly being shoved down at me (she says- if you have such big dreams why don't you go to college without my parent's help?)</p>

<p>It is not even that expensive to make me go to college  because I have a full-blown scholarship (as I've said, I have big dreams and am academic. there would have been no way I got accepted to Google Summer of Code if I was 'mediocre', and the college I got accepted at was the top university in my country. I am not taking this to my head, but still, I have dreams)</p>

<p>Is there an ideal course of action for me? What should I do?</p>

"Sleeping and eating issues at night for a 3 month baby","<p>my younger boy is 3+ months now and he eats regularly throughout the night, like, 12am, 3am and 6am, and fell back sleeping for 3 hours at a stretch, that's a good night. sometime the interval is 2 hours and he wakes up crying and demanding for feeds. </p>

<p>I would say he is a decently good sleeper though, meaning that he falls asleep quickly and cries only for food, except for occasionally being fuss.</p>

<p>The pediatrician warned us that he might be a little overweight and suggested reduce the feeding amount (for now, we feed 6oz of formula each time he wakes up). </p>

<p>That puts us at a struggle if we should feed him or let him cry through? Is he sucking the milk because he is hungry or just an instinct? We learnt from other parents that some infants just sleep through the whole night - is it a result of training or just that babies are different? </p>

<p>My first born (now is 2) used to have similar issues as his kid brother does too.</p>

<p>Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

"What to do about our 8-year-old boy getting in trouble at his new school after having been taken away from his mom?","<p>Our 8-year-old boy is now living with us, taken away from his mom due to abuse and now living with his dad, new home and new school. He spent his first 7 years with his mom and dad had weekend visits twice monthly. When living with his mom he was late to missed school 34 times in 2nd grade.  His mom drank a lot and took him around lots of boyfriends. He was left with his grandmother a lot.  </p>

<p>We have had him here for 6 months now and he is getting in trouble at school several times a week. Talking, knocking cups out of students' hands, running in the hall, acting silly, reading while the teacher is teaching... He says that he is trying to make friends or that they are not paying any attention to him when he raises his hand.  </p>

<p>His dad thinks they might be picking on him.  We have him playing soccer and martial arts. He didn't get to do any of that while with his mom. 
We have him going to see a therapist twice a month for the last 5 months. I know it's a lot of changes. I would like to know what discipline actions should be taken at home for the check marks at school? At first we were taking away his tablet and grounding, but there have been so many more check marks that he would stay grounded always.</p>

<p>He is good at home, he is a pleaser. He has to keep his room clean and feed the dog. He receives check marks on his conduct folder and he has to fill out a form to what happens and why and how to correct to make sure it doesn't happen again, the teacher signs it and the parent. There have been a couple of times that I have being talking to him about the issues at school and he starts to get louder and swinging his arms, I bring that to his attention and tell him he needs to try to stay calm and not be so upset.     </p>

<p>His dad has said that mom was loud and wanted to be the center of attention and that is how he is acting.  What to do?</p>

"How much sun is too much for a child?","<p>My three months old son really likes to sit or lie in the spots where the sun shines through our windows unto the floor. I guess he likes the additional warmth.</p>

<p>Currently it's winter in Germany (from a temperature perspective) so the sun isn't that strong, but I'm afraid in spring and summer eventually the sun will get very dangerous for the delicate baby skin.</p>

<p>I could not find any concise advice on this matter, some say ""no sun at all"", some say ""sunlight is good"", some say ""sunlight only to a certain degree"". Obviously this highly depends on the geographic region and the actual age of the child.</p>

<p>Are there any rules of thumb to decide how much sun is too much? Is there any typical behaviour or reactions to watch out for which indicate too much exposure? Or is it better to play it safe and avoid direct sunlight under all circumstances?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'm interested in both indoor and outdoor exposure, because all children will be exposed to sunlight both indoors and outdoors. (Except for some places in Africa perhaps)</p>

"Impact of frequent change of childcare, and how to minimise","<p>We are a family with parents from two different countries living in a third. For family reasons, we want to move to my native country. The little one is two and a bit.</p>

<p>For my wife, lengthy (1+ year) residency permit processes are required before we can move. She now has the opportunity to transfer with her company to a neighbouring EU country, which would work great for us from the perspective of my family situation. Had it been only us two, we would have jumped at the opportunity to be a few hundred kilometres from my family. </p>

<p>It is, however, a different country. We worry about another transition for the little one: new daycare, new language and new friends, especially when we know that within a year or so, there will be another new daycare situation when we finally do move to my native country.</p>

<p>Assuming a loving family situation with its concomitant stable child-carer bonds, what impacts could frequent childcare rearrangements have? If the only stability we can provide is that we both will be there, what can be done to ameliorate the situation?</p>

"My girlfriend has mentioned disowning her 14 y/o transgender daughter","<p>My girlfriend's 14 year old daughter came out to me as a girl on a bike ride when her mother wasn't there. I fully accept her and gladly refer to her by her chosen name ('Emily' for the purposes of this question) and pronouns. Emily told me she hadn't told her mother yet and she felt more comfortable telling me first. Overall, we have conflict-free, loving, pretty great relationship. She told me not to tell her mother and of course I agreed.</p>

<p>The bike ride was on 9/11, and Emily finally came out to her mother on Friday night (5 days ago). I don't know what exactly happened, I got home late from work and they were in a heated argument, but it ended with Emily going to her room and refusing to come out.</p>

<p>Later that night, my girlfriend referred to her own child as a ""degenerate"". She's mentioned ""sending him to a camp"" and ""disowning him"". She has made other similar comments as well as creating an unsupportive environment by misgendering Emily and referring to her by her former name at every opportunity. She's become even more strict about Emily's clothing, hair, accessories, etc. I would have understood if she were shocked or in denial, if she thought it was a phase, etc. but to be honest, she might well bully her own child into suicide at this rate.</p>

<p>I have tried to talk to my girlfriend, she only responds that I am ""taking his side"" and ""promoting that lifestyle"". I tried everything from telling her about the high suicide rates among trans teens, I showed her studies on how trans teens start doing so much better (in terms of mental health, in school, etc) once they start treatment <sup>1</sup>, and others but she is not budging. There is the added issue that Emily is not my kid, so my girlfriend feels I have no say (and to an extent, I agree).</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>how do I best protect Emily not only from bullies outside the home, but from the bullying she's experiencing from my girlfriend?</strong> I don't want to get between Emily and her mother. Emily's father passed away before she was a year old, so her mother is her only surviving parent.</p>

<p>Also, if it's relevant, Emily is the only child in the home - I don't have any children and she's my GF's only child. They moved in with me about a year ago, we've been together for 3 years.</p>

<p><em>Second question:</em> My girlfriend's talk of disowning or sending Emily to a horrific ""conversion"" camp has me wondering if I should be taking steps to become Emily's legal guardian (if she agrees). <strong>How do I discuss this with her and what are the benefits of legal guardianship in this situation?</strong></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Emily told me she wants to see a doctor about getting on testosterone blockers. She'll be able to get counseling as well, since extensive counseling is a given when considering transition. The trans-friendly clinics/hospitals in our area have mental health professionals on staff and require their patients to undergo counseling before and during transition.</p>

"How much should a 26 y.o. adult child assist their parents?","<p>I have a friend who is a 26 year old single guy who makes a good amount of money, not six figures but a close amount. He bought a 3 bedroom house and has a solid career, and on top of his apps and open source projects he is branching out socially.</p>

<p>But his parents, who gave everything for his private school education, have been underemployed for a few years and financially struggled. He has helped them here and there with money but did it selectively and carefully, as he learned the hard way they can get too dependent on him. But finally his Dad got a fulltime job, making a modest white collar salary again. They're short on cash, but their house valuation nearly doubled.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, his Dad is moving to the same city as his son. The son gave a few thousand to help his cash strapped parents get the house on the market, and the parents promise to pay him back. But while the house gets sold, the son reluctantly agrees to let his parents and younger brother move in temporarily. His only worry is the sellers market is so competitive that his parents may struggle to buy a house. Not to mention, he despises the petty family drama and more than once told his Dad to stop the  attitude or find somewhere else to live.</p>

<p>I only post this because I'm close to this guy and can relate to his experiences. Its so backwards to the typical narrative nowadays. Most kids in their 20s live with their parents and rely on them for help, not the other way around. He came to me for advice and I do not know what to say. </p>

<p>What rules and boundaries should be established in this kind of situation? Financially and socially, What can he do to balance his own life and seeking his own family while helping his parents? Is there things he should have done differently to balance expectations more optimally?</p>

"What are effective strategies against social phobia?","<p>Our 5 years old (in a month) daughter has <strong>excessive apprehension about being immerged in new environments with people (especially children) she doesn't know</strong>.  Basically, she will cry her heart out when we try to leave her in such an environment, then she will stay away from the group, near an adult if possible.  I feel there is more than just timidity, I guess this qualifies somehow as social anxiety disorder ?</p>

<p>It has already reached a bothering level, because we cannot always prevent such situations to happen (e.g. during summer we can't afford to keep her at home so she had to follow a holiday camp, it was like sending her to Guantanamo every morning…), and because she is starting to miss fulfilling opportunities (we are cancelling a music and dance initiation program because she doesn't want to attend the class, despite her loving the topic and liking the teachers).  This is less an issue in school because she already knows most children from the last two years (and she has good friends with whom she knows how to behave quite excited), yet teachers seem moderately concerned by her lack of involvement in group activities.</p>

<p>She went to a child psychiatrist last weeks, but he didn't help much, beside saying she was quite anxious (which was actually the reason for which we sent her to him, she is constantly and litteraly eating her fingers) and a bit egocentric, but had no strong issue (I guess he was only looking for some psychiatric disease).</p>

"Ideas for a poster helping kids deal with an emotionally abusive environment","<p>My wife engages in a lot of emotionally abusive behaviour, including yelling, calling names, and the more dangerous stuff like the passive aggressive silent treatment, gaslighting, projection of her own mistakes on to others etc.  We have two small children, and so far she has done less of this with them, but as they grow and begin to challenge her authority I can see her doing it more and more.  </p>

<p>I am learning to set boundaries and am in the last stages of trying to either change this relationship or leave (please do NOT give me advice on the relationship - that's not what I'm looking for).   I've made a small poster and want to put it up in the house to both help my kids understand and to reduce the amount of self-blame if she begins to guilt trip and use the silent treatment on them as well.  So I came up with these points for the poster:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I'm angry, it's my job to tell you calmly, and your job to listen calmly.</p></li>
<li><p>If I feel like screaming or hitting you, it's my job to calm down, and your job to let me calm down.</p></li>
<li><p>If I call you bad names, it's my job to stop, and your job to not believe what I say about you.</p></li>
<li><p>If I do something wrong, it's my job to say sorry and try to make things better. </p></li>
<li><p>If I honestly do that, it's your job to stop being angry.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And it's our job to love, to care, to build our dreams together.  </p>

<p>Would these be ok?  Do you think I should change them or add anything?  Please also note that my wife will, definitely, reject anything I propose, so please do not suggest discussing it with her, as at this point that will not help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Here is a revised version, based on the very very helpful comments from @anongoodnurse below. Explanation for revisions below this.  </p>

<h1>OUR FAMILY FIGHTING RULES</h1>

<p><em>Repeat after me:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I'm angry with you, it's my job to explain why, calmly and clearly.</p></li>
<li><p>If I feel like screaming or hitting you, it's my job to calm down.  </p></li>
<li><p>If you're telling me what you're feeling and why - angry or sad or happy or lonely - it's my job to listen and to care.</p></li>
<li><p>If I'm calling you names or saying you're a bad person, you shouldn't believe what I say about you, and it's my job to stop.</p></li>
<li><p>When I do something wrong, it's my job to say sorry and try to make things better. </p></li>
<li><p>If you do something wrong, say sorry, and try to make things better, it's my job to forgive you and stop being angry. </p></li>
<li><p>Whatever you do, it's always my job to care for you.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Because we all make mistakes, and we all need forgiveness, because otherwise we can't do our main job - to love, to care, and to build our dreams together.</em></p>

<p>Reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>To avoid the impression, that was pointed out, that any one ""job"" depends on the other person doing theirs</li>
<li>To include the explicit point about negative self-images</li>
<li>The last two points in @anongoodnurse's list seemed like they specifically were aimed at the person being abusive - so putting them in seems like it would make the poster seems less universal, since as he/she said, the key is to make these rules that clearly apply to everyone.  Those could be communicated elsewhere?</li>

"Is screaming a phase?","<p>My wife picks up my daughter from daycare at the end of the day and goes home to get dinner ready and do some chores as she waits for me to get home. My daughter is 7 months old. When she gets home she changes my daughter and feeds her a bottle. When my daughter is picked up she is happy as a clam. When my wife puts my daughter down in the same room or in a different room she just starts screaming. It has gotten so bad that my wife has gotten overly frustrated and I have had to give her some time to herself to de-stress as I arrive home an hour later and she stops. She only does this at the end of the day. My wife can't hold her everyday after work, nothing she needs to do or wants to do would get done. Is the screaming a phase? We do leave her to play on her own periodically depending on what is going on in a different room or in the same room and she is fine. It seems that this week things have gotten a lot LOUDER with her. Anything I can do to curb this behavior or save my wife some sanity till I get home?</p>

<p>The methods I used with my middle school kids were to allow them to stand if they wanted to, offer fidgets, allow for noise canceling headphones when independent work was being completed, offer up hands on and active lessons (more labs than lectures - nature hikes, field trips as often as possible, dramatic presentations to illustrate a process. . . etc.) I also made sure to include a wide variety of assessment styles (presentations, writing of papers, quizzes and tests, they could write children's books or a song. . . etc. whenever possible)  </p>

During college when my parents divorced 'B' put my other parent, (parent 'A') whom was <em>always</em> there for me and whom I cared deeply about, into a major bind and filed for bankruptcy, which placed 'A' with all of our family's debts. Furthermore, because 'B' filed for bankruptcy, and 'A' was buried in debt, I then had no way have a co-signer for loans, and I thus suffered many difficulties in college: at times I became malnutritioned, and I was intermittently homeless. Now I have just graduated with dual degrees in Mathematics and Physics, and I plan to pursue a PhD at UCLA (which is very well-funded by fellowships/scholarships). Now 'B' wants to reconnect and seems like they actually want to be a parent, but I don't have any interest in connecting with them. How should I handle their approaches? For instance, 'B' will call me weekly, but I haven't answered for the past 3 weeks and either just cancel their call or let it go to voicemail, is there something more productive I can do? </p>

<p>My question(s) is - is that at all possible, since I don't yet know the language? How would I go about it, if I want for both of us (maybe all three, if my wife decides to join us) to learn French? Should I learn first, and then - if/when I feel proficient enough - introduce my boy to it?</p>

"How can I teach my son to behave nicely in the playground when other children make it hard?","<p>I've been trying to teach my 3 and a half year old son to treat other children nicely and to try and resolve all conflicts without aggression, by talking. We've been talking about the issue and agreed on a couple of rules. Namely, that he should always wait for his turn to play with things and that instead of fighting his way through a conflict he should talk to the child he's arguing with. </p>

<p>Once we get to the playground, I can see him trying to follow those two rules, but he fails each and every time. Even if he waits for his turn to play, others in front of him fight over who gets to go first. If he builds something and somebody is messing up his thing, he first says that he didn't like it and then, when it doesn't help, he slaps them or hits them with a toy.</p>

<p>For example, the other day he was digging a large hole in the ground when some other boy came up to him and started filling the hole up with sand again. My son tried telling him to stop and that he didn't like that, but that boy ignored him and continued filling up the hole. So, my son ended up hitting him. I have always disapproved of such behavior, but I keep thinking that it is tough for him, because I cannot really think of a reliable way of resolving these types of conflicts.</p>

<p>If I'm telling my son not to fight and to try and resolve conflicts by talking, what I can I do if other children either don't listen to him or show him that fighting is perfectly normal? </p>

<p>How should I teach him to react if other children ignore his efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully?</p>

"How to deal with young child's apparent fear of embarrassment","<p>Cultural background: my family and I live in the Midwestern US.</p>

<p>My wife and I have a five-year-old daughter who seems to have a morbid fear of 'other kids laughing at (her)'. Previously she would mention this whenever she was feeling shy, but since she's generally a sociable and out-going child I've never overly worried about it.</p>

<p>But lately it seems to impact her well-being <em>every</em> time she has to do anything in front of a crowd. She recently graduated from pre-k and the kids did a little song-and-dance routine, she just stood there with her head down. Although she's been in karate class for a year at the latest session she was very uncooperative. At church this past weekend she was happily playing with the other kids until it was time to sing their song and dance and she just stood there. Six months ago this child was belting out the Frozen soundtrack at the top of her lungs for the entertainment of the neighborhood kids. When asked about these issues she replied with her ""I'm shy because I'm afraid people will laugh at me' line.</p>

<p>I don't know where this is coming from, because to the best of my knowledge she's never been laughed at. Asking her why she thinks anyone would laugh at her when no one has done so does not yield any sort of answer (part of irrational fears is that they are just that: irrational). I can only assume that she picked it up from television where snarky dialogue and personal embarrassment are par for the course.</p>

<p>As the question title and background I just gave may indicate, I'm a little skeptical that this situation is a legitimate fear as stated by the child. Is she <em>really</em> that socially anxious in certain situations (but her usual cheery self with small groups of adults and other children)? If not what's going on? If so, how do I assuage her fears?</p>

<p>Most of what I could find online about social anxiety was (unsurprisingly) geared towards teenagers with their greater emphasis on peer relationships, not five-year-olds who still more or less orbit their parent's star.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Thanks for all the great answers, wish I could accept more than one!</p>

"Do babies *have* to be weaned from breast milk or infant formula on purpose?","<p>My daughter is 15-month old. She has been breast-fed and bottle-fed since the beginning, interchanging between the two. Since 10-month we have started feeding her more ""adult"" food, such as vegetables and eggs.

<p>I think she is one of the luckier children in Hong Kong to get such a long period of breastfeeding.</p>

I have some personal demons that I'm struggling to resolve at the moment, which have had an impact on my outlook on many aspects of life. As well as this, I already had a generally cynical and pessimistic personality. <br><br>
In the scenario where I now have a child, I appreciate that my own opinions and attitudes may not be the most constructive ones to pass onto said child.<br> I believe that a certain level of skepticism is important, as it helps to build critical thinking and encourages the formation of one's <em>own</em> opinions rather than following the herd. <br><br>
<strong>However</strong>, I am aware that I can sometimes go overboard. <br>
My personal opinions may conflict with those of most other parents on certain issues, but I do not want to be one of those embarrassing parents who kick up a stink and dominate school council meetings and the like, as that can be damaging to a child. <br><br>How can I encourage my child to healthily question things, and think for themselves, whilst discouraging outright pessimism? <br>Should I sometimes withhold my true beliefs about a topic when my child asks, and give them the 'proper, parenty' answers?

"How do I help my wife be more engaged with our child in the mornings?","<p>My 3-year-old child wakes up after about 6-8 hours of sleep which I think is normal. I get up around that time to pick up the house, study for school, and then I head out to work. When he wakes up, his mom is still sleeping, so he climbs up into her bed and tries to wake her up and asks to breastfeed. She tells him:</p>

<ol>
<li>Feeding is only before you go to sleep.</li>
<li>It's too early, go to sleep.</li>
<li>Raise her voice back at him irritated, and they both have this argument.</li>
<li>Combination of 1, 2, 3.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not sure what to do right now. I always wake up instantly when my child wakes up. I feel horrible sleeping in. I'm always tired too. But when I started exercising, I had a lot more energy, so after I wake up now, I recover faster, and I'm quickly energized.</p>

<p>The question would be how do I approach my wife without offending her? There could be a number of factors making her so tired, but she has always slept in though. Here is what I know:</p>

<ol>
<li>Breastfeeding drains all her energy</li>
<li>Not exercising for 4 years has put a toll on her, thus her energy level declined</li>
<li>She's under a lot of stress from school that's why she sleeps more</li>
<li>She needs a break that's why she's quick to snap</li>
</ol>

<p>Every person has a varying threshold for stress. I try to remind myself I'm going to school like her, working at our job, then after I come home, I spend the rest of the day with my child, so she can decompress. It's 12+ hours a day. I'm completely drained, but I remind myself how exciting learning from my child is to keep me going.</p>

<p>I do admit I spend less time with her, but I make sure to spend at least 1-2 hours a day with my wife. I know this helps her know that I care, and I do love her. But maybe this is one of the reasons? I make sure she and I have at least a day to ourselves most of the weeks. She always comes back home looking more energized when she does.</p>

<p>I'm looking into different approaches, but if anyone knows of some practical advice specifically for this, please share your experience. I want to know how to talk to my wife about the situation and not offend her for not waking up early or quick to lash out at our son.</p>

<p>PS: I noticed one thing that helps out a lot is when she and I are reading parenting books. It always refreshes what we don't know and keeps us on our guard. I picked up another parenting book, and I am reading it and explaining to her different ways to go about the situations. I know when I do, I can see her chance dramatically. I know she wants to do the best for our son, that's why when I read about parenting and share what I learned, it reinforces what her and I should be doing and eases everything. Bottom line, I think the frustration stems from not knowing what to do in the given situation and expecting our child to be able to comprehend given his 3 years on earth what had took us over 25 years.</p>

"How can I move my toddler's interest from toys to playmates?","<p>My kid is 2 years and 9 months now. For a year now we've been in USA and we were buying him electronic toys (buttons, music, lights, shapes, numbers), so he is very sharp at those, he can say number up to 40, he can sing 10s of rhymes. So far all is well.</p>

<p>But recently we are noticing that he is preferring toys over interaction. Only if toys are not noticeable, he will interact with persons who attracts him, specially females.

In one hand, this would perhaps make her less anxious about choosing her path in life. On the other, she might feel that I'm trying to tell her that I will only admire her if she becomes as successful as the women I'm talking to her about. </p>

<p>She kept on showing him her toys. He didn't respond.<br>
She wanted him to come over the other room to show (introduce) him to me. So, she <strong><em>repeatedly</em></strong> said ""Bhaiya come"" to him, and kept on running back and forth to him to see if he's coming or not. He didn't respond.</p>

<p>I was observing all this from the other room. 
On seeing the plight of my daughter, I jumped in the scene and started talking to her and paying attention to her so that she wouldn't feel ignored.
I told her to pick up certain toy and show it to the boy which she did. Boy responded by just holding the toy. I kept on continuously responding to the toddler so that she didn't feel that she was talking to walls.</p>

He shows lots of signs of it, but doctors aren't sure. They say he's rebelious or has ADHD. He doesn't take changes well. For example, if you disappoint him by changing the time of a meeting or do something else than he expected, he'll make a fuss. He has very narrow interests and doesn't get that he hurts people by being abusive - it's their fault, e. g. he can be such to a disabled person. His mother has MS, by the way, he doesn't seem to catch this, for him she's healthy.</p>

<p>He really does badly at school, he has a huge backlog in learning, especially in math and languages. Average teenagers can be lazy but they can manage ""around"" their laziness somehow and have decent grades. As a poor student, he doesn't make any effort on his side to change it. He doesn't seem to be motivated to learn at school. He says that learning doesn't make sense. If he did, he would be at least average.</p>

<p>When one does his homework with him, he often gets distracted, furious, hysterical or even wants to make you do his homework for him. Spending time on TV is making things worse. He also doesn't believe he can succeed, it's hard to convince him that he's smart (but he is). It sometimes seems he doesn't comprehend any of the subjects we go through, he sometimes doesn't get the question. It feels more like he doesn't want to, because it doesn't make any point to learn. </p>

<p>It's strange that one day he does well and the other day he does really bad doing his homework. Same with grades at school - he sometimes does well and sometimes badly. Some people (e.g. his psychologist) say that he's manipulative. He may play a role of helpless but in fact he doesn't want make any effort because learning bores him.</p>

His father and I have been separated for a year, and my son lives half the time with his father and half the time with me and my partner, with whom I'm expecting another baby.

<p>The thing is my son hasn't been sleeping well (at all?) for about 10 months. When the kid stays with his father, he tells me he sleeps all night. When he stays with my mother, they tell me he also sleeps all night. But when he stays with me, he doesn't sleep. It takes about 45 minutes every night for him to fall asleep, and I need to lie with him so that he can fall asleep. He (unconsciously) moves, he flinches, he kicks, and it looks like he wants to fall asleep but can't.</p>

<p>He goes to bed everyday at 8 or 9, and at 1 o'clock he wakes up and comes to my bedroom saying he wants to sleep in my bed. I return him to his bed, stay until he falls asleep, and at 2 he comes again. And so on, for about 4-5 times each night. And most of those times it takes him from 30 minutes to 1 hour to fall asleep again, because he can't stop moving.</p>

"Is Fatherhood natural among humans?","<p>I read in a book and have heard this argument by many social scientists that Fatherhood was an invention by humans during the time when we first started living as societies. This was presumably in order to strengthen the grip of males on human society and provide patriarchy a stable foundation.</p>

<p>I do not seem to agree with this. As a male aged 15 I have strong urges to become a father and really love children. If fatherhood is unnatural and not a product of our evolution how is it possible that males have an urge to father children and feel a strong, genuine love for their offspring?</p>

<p>The argument that Fatherhood is rarely found in the animal world as it is primarily the mother who rares and cares for children is valid, but then again human beings are so much different in other respects from animals, too.</p>

<p>Is it then not possible that the love a human father feels for his offspring is just as natural as the love a human mother feels for her offspring?</p>

<p>Here is one research I found: <a href=""http://sebastiankraemer.com/docs/Kraemer%20origins%20of%20fatherhood.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Origins of Fatherhood</a></p>

"4 year old being hit in school","<p>For the last few days my four year old daughter has been coming home and telling me that she has been hit, and hurt, at school by a couple of boys. </p>

<p>We don't hit in our house and she has no siblings or close family to squabble with so this is all very new to her - she has been telling the teacher but nobody from the school has said anything to me about it. </p>

<p>I'm pulling her teacher to one side in the morning to talk about it with her but I'm so annoyed with it that I'm so tempted to just tell her to fight back, however, she is known at school as being a very sensitive and caring little girl and she always looks to see the best in people so I obviously don't want to change her outlook and encourage her to do something that she knows is wrong.</p>

<p>So I've been wondering, what do you tell your kids to do when they get hit? Have any of them been hit in school and how have they dealt with it? What was the fallout with other parents? How would you handle this?</p>

"Helping a preschooler be a good friend","<p>My almost-four year old boy has been expressing concerns recently that some of his close friends don't want to be his friend any more.  While I'm aware this sort of drama is perpetual in childhood, I think he has some specific concerns that we need to help him address.</p>

<h2>1. Being Pushy</h2>

<p>He's a very pushy child.  I don't think most children his age have a fully developed sense of empathy<sup>1</sup>, and most are still fundamentally selfish, but he's definitely more pushy than most other children his age.  He tells other children how to play, and complains when they're not doing it right.  He wants to play with a certain toy and gets very mad when someone else is playing with it.  Occasionally he'll grab toys from others, although we've mostly worked that out (or age has).</p>

<p>There are a few other children who are probably innately as pushy as my son, except for one thing: he's quite big.  He's 42"" or maybe a bit taller now, which puts him for a 4 year old in the 95th percentile.  This means that he's physically able to dominate the other children around him that are his age, and it also seems to give him the confidence to <em>do</em> so.  If he wants to take a toy he can do it.  He's faster than most of them, he's stronger than most of them. <sup>2</sup></p>

<h2>2. Being selfish</h2>

<p>In addition to being pushy, he's definitely still quite selfish.  We set up a playdate the other day, and he liked the idea, but he also said that he didn't want [friend] to play with his trains.  (He has maybe a hundred wooden trains.)  I tried to talk about it more, and he just didn't seem to get that his friend would want to play with trains <em>and it would be rude not to let him</em>.  I tried my usual tactic - asking how he'd feel if he was at his friend's house and couldn't play with any of his toys - but it didn't seem to get through.  When the playdate did occur, the friend basically parallel played with my 2 year old's toys (who was at daycare).</p>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>All of this adds up to the fact that the selfishness and pushiness means he doesn't completely understand why his playmates don't want to be friends with him.  He's noticeably sad about it - enough so to tell me, out of the blue, that he was sad about it - but he doesn't really get how to fix it.</p>

<p>How can I help him fix it?  What can I do to help him understand what he needs to do to be a better friend?  </p>

<p><sup>1</sup><sub>As a side note, this is the same preschooler from <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/19179/how-can-i-help-my-preschooler-develop-empathy"">this question</a>, and we've worked on it some in manners similar to what @anongoodnurse suggests.  That's seemed to help, so it's possible more of that is what's needed.</sub></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>Playing with older children seems to change this dynamic dramatically, which is part of why I think his size matters (though it's not the only difference, of course).  He plays very well at the park when he finds a random five-to-six year old (in particular, a girl) to play with, and will clearly limit his pushiness and usually follow the child around to some extent.  Some of this could well be emotional maturity - either the ability to cope with pushiness, or the knowledge 
of how to overcome it.</sub></p>

"How to help parents cope with me moving out","<p>Let me preface by saying I'm not entirely sure if I'm asking this in the right place and I'm very emotional right now, I apologize if my post is in disarray or if this question is not within scope of this site - I hope you will all understand.</p>

<p>I am 22 years old, I graduated from college 5 months ago, and I'm currently working. For several months, I've been planning with my twin sister and several of my friends to move out and live in a rented house. We recently got approved for a house and signed the contract so my sister and I broke the news to our parents. My dad has been silent but my mom is incredibly upset, and I'm afraid we're permanently damaging our relationship with her.</p>

<p>To give further background, I am first generation Asian-American. No one in my extended family has ever moved out of the house. All my cousins live at home - even if they go to college away from home, they'll move back in immediately and won't leave until they get married; I have two uncles who still live with my grandmother. So, one of my mom's main grievances is that I don't care about my family anymore and that I value my friends over my family. She also thinks our living arrangement will be awful because there's going to be 5 girls in one house and we're gonna ruin our relationship with our friends.</p>

<p>Her second grievance is that she thinks I'm ruining my financial standings by moving out. I make roughly $70K a year and I have roughly $17K in savings. I do not have a car right now and I will need to buy one when I move out. The rent I'll be paying will be $100 more than what I'm paying my parents right now. She thinks that I am making a mistake by not staying at home and saving money, which to be fair, yes, I understand that it would be technically cheaper to live at home especially since I'm lucky enough that my parents feed me, do my laundry, and pay for utilities.</p>

<p>My motives for moving out seem very Western, but I just want to be independent and not treated like a child. I still have curfews and all my actions at home are scrutinized and monitored, and I just feel like I can't be my true self while living at home. I don't hate my family and I have no intentions of abandoning them; I'm not moving that far away from home and still want a relationship with my parents after moving out. I know that I'll have to grow up by managing my finances carefully, cook for myself, take care of myself etc etc.</p>

<p>I guess my question is <strong>how can I communicate to my parents my motives and help them cope with the idea of me moving out? Considering my background, is it really so wrong for me to want to move out? Am I really not in a situation to be moving out? Am I really such a terrible daughter for wanting to move out?</strong> I'm sorry, I'm just so terribly upset - I technically wasn't the one who broke the news to my parents but my sister; I was taking a nap and had awoken when I heard my mom scream at the top of her lungs that she would kill herself and I'm worried that my decisions are hurting her and that I'm an awful person for doing this.</p>

"Teacher called my sons statement racist","<p>My son is in class with 2 people named Matt. He was trying to get <em>one</em> of the Matt's attention. They both were talking to my son. The conversation likely could be paraphrased like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Matts</strong>: Which one of us are you trying to talk to?</p>
  
  <p><strong>My Son</strong>: The brown one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His teacher overheard that and gave him a small speech about how he was being racist and he should not talk like that. The specifics would be lost via second hand information. This happened a few days ago and there was no note in the agenda that talked about this (which is normally where I would find correspondence from the teacher). </p>

<p>My information does comes second hand from my 9 year old son however I am confident that he is telling the truth. </p>

<p>While his statement is less that tactful I believe it to be a correct observation. I recall reading something a long time ago that talked about how children are colour-blind in that they see other children and not other children of different heritage etc. </p>

<p>My question is kind of 2 part. </p>

<ol>
<li>Could my sons statement be seen as rasicm or racist? <em>I</em> do not think talking about skin colour is inherently racist. . </li>
<li>Assuming my assertion is true I should say something to the teacher because while I can educate my son, mostly on tact, I do not think called his statement racist is teaching him correctly. What should I say to the teacher? My son could have twisted the words.</li>
</ol>

<p>I do not think this is something I want to let go as it could give my son the wrong impression of how to deal with other people. It is not a question of it being rude or inappropriate as it definitely was. I think is it a question of if it was racist. </p>

<p>My ex moved out within London initially. Then in June 2016 she left the country with my son. She used a written permission I gave her before we split. Originally she continued to work from abroad (EU) commuting each month to London. During this time my son stayed abroad. She explained that this arrangement makes it easier for her to take care of our son due to the presence of her extended family. She also wanted to stay close to her mum as she has been battling cancer. Originally I had sympathy and understanding for this arrangement and did not object to it even though the written permission I gave her expired in October 2016. </p>

<p>However, it became increasingly difficult to have a contact with my son. My ex would cancel arrangements on a short notice. She would also make it difficult for my son to visit my family. It went like this for more than a year. What can I do in this case? I have, basically, no idea as I wasn't expecting that it will come to this.

"What is the appropriate age to tell my daughter that her biological father doesn't want to be a part of her life?","<p>I had a beautiful daughter with my very first boyfriend at the age of 16. He was 18 at the time and he was very careless about the whole situation. He was a high school dropout, selling and using drugs at the time as well. For that reason, my mother forced me to end my romantic relationship with him before our daughter was born. Surprisingly to my mother, I was not reluctant at all. I understood that he was not fit to run a family or a household and I wanted something better for my daughter and I.</p>

<p>He was very upset about my decision. His reaction didn't bother me. I was determined to finish high school and go to college to give my daughter the future that she deserved. My mother was my greatest support. One month after our daughter was born, my stepfather got a promotion at his job and we all had to move to another city 3 hours away. </p>

<p>Within my daughter's first few months of life, I was informed that her father got arrested for selling drugs and was going to be in jail for a few years. Fast forward 3 years, he gets released from prison. Within those few years, I have already graduated high school, attending college, married with someone else and about 4 months pregnant with my second child. I found out about my daughter's father's release from a mutual friend about a month after he had been released. He hadn't tried to see his daughter in a whole month. I brushed that thought off and I spoke to my husband about it and we decided that I should take the first step and contact him. I asked around for his phone number and I called him to try and see if he was ready to see his daughter and begin a relationship with her... that didn't go well.</p>

<p>He became very upset at the news of my marriage and new baby on the way. He said that I had replaced him with someone else to raise our daughter, I assured him that I was not trying to replace him as her father. He said, ""It's too late, you already gave her a dad and who am I to stand in the way? You all are a happy family."" I kept insisting that she needed him in her life but he just kept turning himself into the victim somehow. He walked away from his responsibilities, just like that.</p>

<p>As my daughter got older, my husband made sure that she never felt ""fatherless"". He made no difference between our own children and her. She stopped calling him by his name and began calling him ""daddy"" when our son began to speak and call him daddy. It was like a natural thing. He was the father that she knew and he demonstrated love to her everyday. Over the years, I never stopped contacting her biological father. Maybe about every 6 months or so. I was voluntarily sending him fotos and updates, asking if he would like to see her and not receiving any type of response except maybe ""I'm too busy these days."" Sometimes I could actually talk him into visiting her, especially if we were in town... conveniently enough for him, he would accept to see her. She has probably seen her biological father about a handful of times in her entire life. She is twelve years old.</p>

<p>My husband and I never hid the fact from her that he was not her biological father. In a way that a child could understand, we explained it to her and she always knew. We also never spoke ill of her biological father to her, never. When she asked where he was, we told her that he was ""working a lot and living very far away.. and that when he had the chance to visit her, he would."" We told her that he loved her very much and she believed it.</p>

<p>Fast forward to when my daughter was about 10 years old with a 7 year old brother and a 4 year old sister, my husband and I got divorced. He was a wonderful father to all 3 of my children, but a horribly unfaithful husband. I grew tired of his multiple affairs over the years. I decided that enough was enough and I couldn't forgive him any longer because it was just eating away at me and making me miserable.</p>

<p>We have been divorced for two years now and he has just been the best co-parent a person could ask for. He is and always has been a wonderful dad. I have just remarried but this has in no way changed the kind of dad that he is to the kids. We made a child support arrangement without the court/legal system involved. He pays consistently and always on time. We made visitation arrangements on our own as well, that we are both happy with. By the way, this all involves my first born. He willingly pays me child support for her and he takes her too. There was never a question about it. He says, ""She is my daughter and she always will be. I raised her and I love her with all my heart. She was my first baby."" My new husband and him get along well. My new husband tells me that he really respects my ex husband as a father because only a real man would do what he does for my first born. The kids watch the way all of us treat eachother and they see that we all respect eachother. That makes them happy because they just love us all, even my new husband. They approved of him on the very first day that they met him and they let me know it.Haha! </p>

<p>This is what I hate... Just a couple of days ago my oldest came to me and randomly asked me if I have heard from her biological father lately. I responded, ""No I haven't, but he has probably been busy with work."" Then she asked me send him a picture of her in her cheer uniform (because she recently became a cheerleader at school). I said ok and she literally watched as I sent it. Hours later she asked if he had responded anything and I said he hasn't. Note, he never responds to anything I send him of her, but she doesn't know that. So she asked me to send him a text to make sure it is still the correct number for him, so i did. Hours later he responded ""Yes this is still my number."" My daughter's face just dropped when she saw that he had not given a response to the photograph of her. She said, ""That's it??"" I told her that maybe he was driving or doing something that didn't allow him to text more than he wanted to. She didn't look too convinced but she let it go. </p>

<p>I was so angry that my daughter felt ""looked over"" just because that idiot couldn't even say something as small as ""Wow she is beautiful"" or ""She is growing so fast"" or even ""Good luck with cheerleading"" SOMETHING! I started to text him back asking him what it is that he wants me to tell his daughter when she asks about him... the photo attached is his response to that question.</p>

<p>Now, my question is when will it be appropriate to show these messages to my daughter? Because I have more messages from him that I have printed out years ago where he is saying that he simply doesn't want to try to be her father... etc. he basically passes the baton over to my ex-husband in these messages. I saved them because I thought that one day I'd have to tell her the truth about her biological father's lack of interest in being a part of her life. I also thought that it would be proof enough to show her that I have tried very hard to include him. In case he ever tries to tell her some fake story about me secretly pushing him away behind her back etc. Would it do her more harm than good to show her these heartless things that he has written in regards to her? Should I maybe just tell her about it right now since she is only 12 years old? Show her the messages later? Should I wait longer to even say anything to her about the person that he really is? I don't know if is the right time yet. If it is, I wouldn't  know what to say. I wouldn't want to say too much. If I do say any of it to her, I am afraid of what it will do to her.

"19 month old emitting short bursts of high-pitched screaming when frustrated","<p>I know there are a lot of posts on here about screaming but I feel like my situation may be different. Feel free to mark this as a duplicate post if not...</p>

<p>My wife, my mother-in-law, my 19 month old son, and I are on a vacation.  This has obviously been a difficult adjustment for our son and we've tried to make it as close to our routine as possible including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bringing lots of familiar toys.</li>
<li>Trying to have him nap/sleep at the same time as home (despite being in a different time zone).  </li>
<li>eating similar foods that we know our son likes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite that, he seems to have recently picked up a habit of high-pitched screaming when he doesn't get something he wants. I don't recall him doing this before our vacation.</p>

<p>An example would be a tendency to ""run wild"" in public areas (e.g. aquariums, ice cream shops, bookstores, pools, malls, plane flights,  etc).  I realize that he's a kid and needs some measure of <strong>safe</strong> independence but eventually we need to ""wrangle"" him in and continue with whatever we're trying to do (continue visiting other parts of the aquarium, stay in the safe kiddie pool area, wait in line behind other folks at a store, etc).</p>

<p>When that happens, he tends to unleash a ridiculously high-pitched scream. Sometime it's multiple short bursts. Other times its lengthy.</p>

<p>During these episodes, he's clearly frustrated and admittedly, I'm not at my own personal best -- I usually feel mortified and immediately aware of the inconvenience (or perceived inconvenience) this may be causing others. I realize that's not the best perspective and am trying to work on that. I wish I could just shut the world out and deal with my son one-on-one.</p>

<p>In terms of addressing our son, I've tried a variety of things including:</p>

<ul>
<li>time outs if a quiet area is available.</li>
<li>offering hugs and trying to comfort.</li>
<li>trying to distract with something else.</li>
<li>trying to give advanced notice if something is changing ""OK david, in 5 minutes we're going to be leaving..."" although I doubt he has a concept of time yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure if anything is really helping to prevent future episodes so I can't tell if what I'm doing is making things worse. </p>

<p>Since he's 19 months old, he only knows a handful of words and can't really articulate how he's feeling through spoken word. I understand that's part of why he's screaming -- he's frustrated and trying to communicate during a tantrum.</p>

<p>Is this making any sense? Is there anything I can do? I'm honestly and sincerely dreading the 4.5 hour flight back home next week and feel like everything I'm doing now is just making things worse. :-(</p>

"How to teach children the difference between pets and vermin?","<p>My 16 month old daughter just witnessed her grandmother chasing and proceeding to bash a mouse to death. My daughter was within 4 feet of the death site. She was pretty shocked and asked to pacify after. She didn't cry but she was a little upset. I told her that ""mice are very dirty"". She has helped me find and kill flies and mosquitoes around the house before. </p>

<p>She is very fond of animals. I want her to be compassionate to animals but how do I make sure she isn't in an episode of <em>Hoarders</em> later on because she can't find it in her heart to remove mice from her home?

"What is a positive way to handle a boy who acts like a girl?","<p>My 3yo regularly plays and acts like a girl. For example, he likes to take his arm out of one sleeve on his shirt and pretend he's a princess. He loves to dress up in his mom and sister's clothes. He asked for a dollhouse for Christmas. He often compares himself to his little sister saying, ""I just want to play with her, because we're the same"". He'll also make comments about how things are pretty and beautiful, and likes pink and flowery things. Even his body movements and facial gestures are very feminine in nature.</p>

<p>He also frequently refers to things as the mommy and babies, both animate and inanimate. For example, if he see's a big and a little animal, he'll refer to the mommy and baby animal. But he'll also refer to a big and little pillow as the mommy and baby pillow. </p>

<p>To be honest, we have no problem with any of this. He's my son, and I love everything about him and the way that he thinks. This behavior may or may not be an indication that he will have homosexual tendencies in the future, but that doesn't matter to me, because I support how he thinks and who he is. </p>

<p>His personality and tendencies are obviously different than what society deems typical or normal. We've tried to maintain a neutral standpoint on everything: not ignoring the situation, but also not discouraging or encouraging one behavior over another.</p>

<p>The question is: what is the best way to handle the situation?  What types of things should we be discussing with him. How should we approach those conversations? Any help from someone who has a similar situation or has worked with childrens' sexual identity issues would be greatly appreciated.</p>

"Arguments for/against same birthday for siblings?","<p>My son is born on October 1st three years ago. My wife is pregnant again and the calculated delivery date is October 22nd. Both children are boys, 3 years apart. We might end in a situation where the delivery is earlier, for reasons irrelevant to this question. </p>

<p>I believe that around their birthdays is the only time in the whole year that the actual date matters. It really does boil down to practical considerations around patience (gifts) and planning. I think that if there is, say, a week or more between the birthdays then it's easy to separate but if the difference is <em>only a very few days then it gets complicated,</em> and that's the situation I'd like to avoid.</p>

<p>I know from friends that having the same birthday makes events easier to plan, from the parents' perspective. It would also remove the unhappiness of a small child saying <em>""why does he get presents today and I don't.""</em> Being a twin, and married to one, I know that there's nothing problematic in sharing a birthday as long as both get their fair share of attention. </p>

"Have I lost my daughter?","<p>She's currently sixteen and I feel like I have lost her.
When she was younger she used to be a sweet, caring and understanding girl, but then she entered middle school and everything changed. She didn't like anymore physical contact (she is disgusted if a member of the family touches her, but she can tolerate her friends' contact), her grades fell down and she would always listen to music to ignore us. It got worse during her second year of ms; she was always thinking, she looked sad and mad and when I'd ask her what was going on, she always said ""nothing"". That's when she seriously started to think about moving to another country when she finishes college (ever since she was a kid, she had said that she doesn't like Argentina and that she would move to USA or Canada, but I didn't think it was for real).</p>

<p>Three years has happened since then and during these last years she started to look happy, and would let me hug her o kiss her... but now she is going through that phase again. Her grades are great now, but the only reason is because she is going to apply for a scholarship so she can move to another province with her friends).
I know she doesn't love or like my family, she has always showed discontent with my parents and my siblings and their families. And honestly, I don't think she loves me nor her dad. She only cares about her friends, and she has said that she only loves them. Two months ago we had a fight and I told her to leave the house and she did it but came later to home even though she could stay with her friends. I can remember what she said when we saw each other after the fight: ""you are just giving me more courage to leave you to die alone"". Since she's my only child, her dad and I are divorced and my parents are really old, I know it's true that I will die alone if she cuts me out of her life. The worst part of it is that I know she can do it, I know she has the courage, but I can't do anything to change it. I don't know if she hates me, but I know she has never liked me.</p>

<p>When she was going through that phase 3 years ago, I talked with her dad and both agreed to try to find out what was going on. </p>

<ul>
<li>Bullying? We talked with her teachers, classmates, friends and boyfriend, and everybody said she has never been bullied. They also said she was normal with them. </li>
</ul>

<p>Her boyfriend also told us she said she doesn't feel her family as family, that she feels disconnected.</p>

<p>All made sense. She's an only child and doesn't have cousins of her age, so since she was little she laid on her best friends and always said ""family is not your relatives, but those who loves you, supports you and try to understand you"". My relatives has never given to her what she's looking, but her friends does because (and i  quote) they are going through the same. </p>

<p>The day I kicked her out of our house she and my brother had a fight. They have a really tense relationship and always end up fighting, but this one was really big. Both screamed at each other and she was, literally, shaking of anger. Both loses their temper easy, but I didn't want to fight with my brother so I just stayed quiet. That's when appeared the angry tears and she screamed to her uncle ""Who the fuck do you think you're? You are not my father and this is my house, my money, and I can do whatever I want to do here"". It freaked me out and that's when I kicked her. Once she packed her things, took money and slammed the door, I felt terrible. It made me realize she was right that I never stand up for her.</p>

<p>That's what makes me think I have lost her. I gave her a reason to not like me and look for love in people she's not related to, I gave her a reason to just not tell me anything about her life.</p>

<p>Update: she has been visiting a psychologist for the last two months because she has showed symptoms of ocd since a young age. according to her psychologist, it might be a reason of why she started to avoid physical contact.</p>

"Encouraging older brother to play with younger brother","<p>I have two children, 33 months and 14 months old.  They're both tall for their age, very physical types; climbing, running, etc.  They both like to play with vehicles of all sorts, balls, ride on trikes.</p>

<p>That all sounds like a great recipe for kids getting along - except that the older one resists playing with his younger brother, because the younger one isn't able to play 'properly' yet, and just breaks the train tracks, throws toys, etc. - all things you expect a 14 month old to do, really, but not something a 33 month old can handle.</p>

<p>We still want them to play together, though, and are trying to think of ways to help them play together at this age such that they can both enjoy it.  Sometimes reading books together works, although the younger one resists that some - he wants reading time to be him-only, as older brother will otherwise take over.  Playing at the park ends up in parallel play, but at least it's nearby.  Other than that, though, in terms of in-the-house stuff there doesn't seem to be much that works.</p>

"Typical frequency of discplinary issues for a 5-year-old?","<p>My 5-year-old son just started kindergarten a week ago, and has already committed two infractions serious enough for the teacher to bring to our attention:  once throwing a serious tantrum, and once biting and spitting on another child.  Tantrums we are still working on at home.  Biting hasn't been a problem at home for a couple years now, and I've never seen him spit on someone.</p>

<p>Is this normal behavior for adjusting to a completely new social situation?  Is there anything we can do to help him adjust?</p>

<p>If it helps to know his reasons, the tantrum was because he thought he was being punished for talking too much.  Although I have no doubt he has been told off by his teacher for talking, he wasn't being punished.  The thing he thought he was being denied simply wasn't on the schedule that day.  The biting and spitting was because the <em>other</em> child wouldn't stop talking.</p>

"How important is ""at night time"" as part of a newborn's feeding schedule?","<p>Now that we have conquered jaundice, our doctor has shifted our breast-fed two-week-old daughter's feeding schedule from ""every two hours; wake her; no exceptions"" to ""every two hours; wake her; you can go up to four hours at night time.""</p>

<p>I am not questioning the validity of our doctor's orders. I am confident that there are good reasons to stick with this schedule and wake our daughter accordingly. What I do question is the importance of the 4 hour period specifically occurring at night.</p>

<p>As often as not, our daughter's only session of staying asleep for more than a couple hours is in the afternoon. At night time, she tends toward two hours on the high end, and sometimes wants to cluster-feed (last night, for instance, there was only one between-feedings period over an hour). </p>

<p>The shift towards longer breaks sounds great as it will help my wife to get actual sleep, if-and-when we can take advantage. But those opportunities may be few and far between if they are only allowed at night time.</p>

<p>One option we've considered is to allow up to two anytime 4-hour breaks if our daughter and my wife are both sleeping soundly. Is there a strong reason that these 4-hour breaks should only be at night? What could go wrong from us allowing them during the day?</p>

<p>It seems worth it to let our girl have her days and nights stay mixed up a bit longer if that is what it takes to provide her with a well-rested mother.</p>

<p>Edit: After a day or two, we were lucky enough to see her long sessions of sleep shift to the 8pm to midnight timeframe. That has largely made this a non-issue. In retrospect, I still think that 4 hours during the day would have been fine if that was the only way to provide sleep to my wife </p>

"Can a father use his son's first name as a pseudonym to publish his writing?","<p>I have a friend. Let's call him John Smith. John Smith has a son. I'll call him Robert Smith. John, their family and Robert's friends all call the child Robert or Robby. No one calls him Rob.</p>

<p>Now, in his free time John writes novels. He wants to publish them under a pseudonym, and the perfect pseudonym he came up with for his writer self is Rob James Ford. (I'm still making up all the names, but the principle of similarity is the same.)</p>

<p>John Smith is a bit worried how his son will feel when he grows up and discovers that his father has ""appropriated"" his own name.</p>

<p>Little Robert is eight years old today and knows quite a few other Roberts, among them one of his best friends, so he is used to the fact that his name is not exclusive to him. But he also knows his father by the name John and that Rob is one possible short form of Robert. When he reaches adolescence and has to find his adult identity -- possibly accompanied by conflicts with his father -- he might feel that his father has been transgressing into what is rightfully his own by using his name for himself. It might feel wrong to Rob Smith that his father calls himself Rob Ford.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>Is it unproblematic for John to call himself Rob? After all he does not call himself Rob Smith but uses a different last name with a version of his son's first name, so there is no mistaking Rob James Ford for Rob(ert) Smith. But at the same time Rob <em>is</em> the name of John's son, and they both recognize this.</p>

<p>What should John do?</p>

The question we have is how does the feeding work? Do we supply bottles of breast milk to the daycare or do they usually insist upon giving formula?
Should my partner continue expressing throughout the day at the office or can she just do that before/after work? It is my understanding that expressing should be happening every few hours, but perhaps this is not correct.</p>

"Bed time stories for a 6 year old boy","<p>So I have a 5 year old boy, turning 6 in 2 months.
We've been reading Harry Potter as bed time stories, and it has been great. We've gotten to book 5 now and it has started to be more grown up, I think. He doesn't really understand most of it anymore and it's getting pretty dark.</p>

"What is the minimum amount of structure and rules that a child needs?","<p>My wife and I have very different ways of handling our children (almost 3 and 5 years old). We agree about the rules we want to set, but we are <em>complete</em> opposite when it comes to implementing the rules. </p>

<p>For the last three to four years, I have been fighting to get my wife to implement the rules we agree upon and to be extra careful with implementing the rules myself. This has caused our relationship to be close to a breakdown and it is severely affecting the feelings I have towards my children. I look upon the time I spend with them more as work than as pleasure, because I have to spend so much time trying to get the children to enforce rules. The kinds of rules we are talking about are things like putting on clothes themselves, sitting at the table while eating, eating diversified food, staying in bed after they have been put to bed, not hitting, kicking, biting or throwing things at each other. </p>

<p>I consider my attempt to get my wife to enforce the rules in a similar way to mine as failed. And I believe it to be a high risk of our relationship breaking down if I continue to try this path. I don't believe that a broken relationship will improve the situation in any way, but only reduce our ability to solve the problems. Therefore, I am asking you whether I could just let go of most of the rules and still have children that turn out well. Do they need to sit at the table while eating? Can they fall asleep in front of the telly every night? Can they learn conflict resolution on their own? </p>

<p>They are both in kindergarten now, where they are functioning reasonably well, but they have both had periods where the kindergarten have had to dedicate one employee almost exclusively to the child for a few weeks. This happened with both around the age of 2,5.</p>

"How do I deal with acute cases of ""stay at home envy""?","<p><strong><em>Summary:</em></strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>an older child (in school) is 99% of time OK with the fact that sometimes he gets to go to school on days the younger child stays at home. This includes 100% rational agreement from him that there are good reasons for that.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes (rarely) on those days he would have a major meltdown and refuse to go to school when it's time to leave, specifically because the younger one stays home.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What's a good way to handle such meltdowns?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Details:</em></strong></p>

<p>We have 2 kids. </p>

<p>Older one is in elementary school. They have only a limited amount of days allowed for absences in school year, all of which we usually use for sick days. </p>

<p>The younger one is in preschool (meaning there's no such restriction).</p>

<p>Moreover, school and preschool do NOT share 100% days off.</p>

<p>In practice, it means that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the older kid's school is closed and younger isn't, we keep them both home (for good reason<sup>[1]</sup>)</p></li>
<li><p>When older kid's school is open and younger is closed, younger one stays home but older one isn't.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On <strong>some</strong> of the latter days (not all), the older one has major meltdowns right when it's time to go to school, and refuses to go.</p>

<p><strong>What's a good way to handle such meltdowns?</strong></p>

<p>The meltdowns are extremely impactful, because being late for school costs him tardiness points (that detract from his available off days); AND there are health risks to leaving for school after meltdown for him.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Important notes:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>100% of time outside those meltdowns, the older one is 100% in agreement with us that it's correct thing to do. He knows very well all the reasons for it, can recite them back and agrees with them.</p></li>
<li><p>He never voices any issues until it's time to dress for school on those days. As in, we would have a conversation 1 hour before about it, and he would calmly reconfirm that yes, he knows the younger one will stay home, and he's fully OK with it.</p></li>
<li><p>He almost never has before-school meltdowns on OTHER days (when they both have to go). I'd say ""younger stays home"" account for ~80% of meltdowns before school.</p></li>
<li><p>It's not simply about ""we have to separate instead of play together"", because he never has issues when attendance is reversed (he stays home and she goes).</p></li>
<li><p>He has some sibling rivalry and jealousy issues in general, but they aren't endemic. But he's very receptive to reasoned arguments over what is and isn't fair.</p></li>
</ul>

"Delegating godfather responsibilities to atheist brother","<p>I have two siblings: a younger brother ""Todd"", and an older brother ""Jack"". Todd is a single father of three (realtor; lives in Canada; wife left for Europe and hasn't been in the family's life for 5 years now). Jack still lives in Canada (Toronto) with his wife and two kids, and is a wealthy civil engineer. Jack had a falling out with a lot of the family years back when he started college, since our entire extended family is deeply religious (Catholic, Greek Catholic, etc), and when he ""came out"", most of the family ""disowned"" him (i.e. parents took him out of the will unless he ""repents"", most family members save for a couple in-laws ignore him, etc). Since we're all ""family"", he visits every second Christmas/Easter/Thanksgiving, brings overpriced gifts for Todd's kids and whatever nieces/nephews he gets to see, etc.</p>

<p>I have a <strong>big</strong> problem: I was the only person around who could accept the role of godfather for Todd's kids, and he's suffering from terminal cancer. I travel between the US and Europe a lot, and don't even own property in Canada. I'm in no position to take on three young children as a surrogate parent. </p>

<p>Jack and his wife told me privately that they would assume responsibility for the children provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>Half of Todd's assets and (eventual) inheritance from our parents goes into a trust fund for Todd's kids (tuition, down payment for a house later in life, etc).</li>
<li>The other half of Todd's ""wealth"" goes into a trust for Jack and his wife to cover additional living expenses for the kids. If the fund is ever exhausted before the kids hit 18, Jack and his wife cover the remaining expenses (toys, clothes, summer camp, etc) out of pocket. If any funds remain at that point, they get deposited into TFSA/RRSP for the kids.</li>
<li>Only one dollar is given to Todd's ex in our parents' will, to avoid her having a way to claim she was ""forgotten"".</li>
<li><strong>The ""tough"" part</strong>: Jack has no intention of raising the kids catholic. He intends to debunk it gradually with the kids, and even insists he'll pay for their private school/college fund out of pocket if it means they go to a secular school to ""break the cycle of sickness"" (he really despises religion).</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I convince Todd and my parents to delegate rearing Todd's kids to Jack? I imagine Todd and my parents will flat-out refuse the idea. Is it possible to ""send"" the kids to live with Jack and his wife after I've assumed the role of their legal guardian, or is there a ""bad faith"" element there (no pun intended)? I can't take care of these kids, my parents are too frail to watch them, Todd's dying, and no other relatives have stepped up to the task. I don't want these kids winding up in a community home because of Jack and our parents being stubborn over ideological differences.</p>

"What to do about my 6-year-old son with listening, focus and behavioral issues?","<p>I have 3 boys, one a 6 year old. My husband and I are very positive people and try and do a lot with our children, and give each child equal attention. The concerns I have with my 6 year old son are based on his listening, lack of focus and most recently the following bad behavior. </p>

<p>Over the past two years our oldest son has had trouble listening and focusing when you would speak to him. I know it sounds typical; we would joke that he has ""selective hearing"". But if we say something simple to him (with eye contact) then ask him to repeat, his response is ""I don't know"" or ""umm... I forgot"". When you need him to stay and focus on something he would have to do something else quickly because he can't help it. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, he is the same way in school. Example: his school has a fire drill and the kids are to stay in line. My son sees an ant hill and has to walk over to it and check it out. The teacher tells him to get back in line but then a second later he does it again. The teacher asks him why is he disobeying what she asks and his response is ""I don't know"".</p>

<p>My son is a good boy, but unfortunately also has a problem with following bad behavior, which is our biggest issue, from particular children in his school: he likes to do things that make people laugh. Like being silly in a fun way, or doing something inappropriate (like making noises with his mouth). </p>

<p>We've recently gotten emails from his teacher saying ""he has been very disruptive in her class, following others' bad behavior and makes many inappropriate noises."" We try to remind him every day that it's rude and disrespectful to act that way. We ask him if he likes getting into trouble? Does he like copying the bad kids (he names the bad kids on request, which we are aware are the trouble makers)? Does he like it when Mommy and Daddy get upset? Do you like to have fun and do fun things, because bad behavior doesn't deserve fun? Do you like when Mommy and Daddy talk to you in the morning about being an awesome boy and have a great day? We try not to sound negative and try and speak calmly but we get to a point were we feel like when we speak to him, while he says he cares, we don't feel that he does. </p>

<p>We've done time outs and daily good behavior charts. We've awarded little prizes on good behavior. We've tried so many options and it's just making us sad and scared for the boy he'll become. We know he's a good boy; he just needs to show it more and stop copying others' wrong doing just to get a laugh.</p>

<p>We recently called his pediatrician to see what we should do about his listening, focus and behavior thinking it's related with ADHD. I was referred to have a Neuro Sociological Evaluation done, which I'm still waiting to get through. </p>

<p>I'm sorry for the request on so much info, but we're coming to a halt on what to do next. I'm open to suggestions.</p>

"Who is lying about throwing away a slice of pizza?","<p>I found a (seemingly) perfectly good slice of pizza in the trash. I became curious. So I asked both children if they did it. Both denied it. There is one other adult in the house. After questioning, I eliminated the other adult as a suspect. I know I did not do it (because it is not the type of thing I would do and I'm 99.9% certain I would remember doing it if I had). So that leaves two remaining suspects. Both children. (Ages 10 and 13). Both deny doing it.</p>

<p>Obviously, my concern here is not over the pizza itself but over the fact that someone is clearly lying to me. I questioned both suspects separately, then together, then separately again for approximately 30 minutes hoping one would ""break"" and confess. Neither did. I suspect one more than the other (call it 80-20) based on intuition and prior history (he lied last year about homework). But he vehemently denies throwing away the pizza to the end; neither suspect cracked an inch.</p>

<p>Also, a goal here is a learning experience. For example, there might come a time in the future when I have to determine which child is lying to me. So, I am searching for any ""tells"" or other behavior patterns that might be helpful in the future as well.</p>

We're going to see an ophthalmologist once the pediatrician weighs in and recommends one, and I'm interested in suggestions for what I should look for in an ophthalmologist, and in what we should do to prepare for the visit.</p>

<p>Particularly, how important is it that we find one that specifically mentions these conditions as things they specialize in?

Our pediatrician hasn't noticed this in her periodic checks, but I suspect that he's more focused during these visits (a person he's not that used to, who is talking a lot to him).  I worry the ophthalmologist will have the same problem - not be able to diagnose because of lack of presentation during the visit.  </p>

"An Adult Child and a Difficult Ex","<p>My biological son, 26, will soon be graduating college and my wife (his step-mom) and I are throwing him a graduation party.  My wife and I have had a very difficult time with his mother and her husband.  </p>

<p>We ""enjoyed"" a very Jerry Springer like moment with them yelling and screaming on our front lawn a couple of years ago.  His mother refers to my wife as ""the incarnation of evil"".  Given that the divorce is old (13 years ago) and all financial obligations were over, to the satisfaction of the court, over 4 years ago, my wife and I were hoping the angst would die down.  </p>

<p>But it hasn't; his mother still feels a great deal of hate for both my wife and I.  While I understand that there are strong feelings behind this rage/hate I am not sure what I can do to mitigate them.  And really how much control can one have over another's feelings?</p>

<p>In most ways I could care less.  I would love to be civil with the mom and step-dad for the sake of my son.  But given their past behavior, I just don't want to be around them.  I don't want to pay to entertain them or even be in the same room with them.  If it was just a public place, I would just leave.</p>

<p>Any advice on how I would broach this subject with my son?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I did have the talk with my son, and he let her know she was not invited to the party.  As an olive branch I encouraged him to spend time with her after graduation but before the party, and they did.  They also spent the night before together, and they could then use the excuse of getting back to their home (8 hour drive) to not attend the party.  </p>

<p>She is also a ""Shiite Christian"" (my son's words) very religious.  We had the party at a brewery which would also give her another excuse for not attending.</p>

"How to improve my 5 year old son's behavior in pre-kindergarden?","<p>My oldest child (5 year and a half son) has been more agitated lately in pre-kindergarden and often will make other kids laugh or disrupt activities in class.</p>

<p>We have been getting more feedback like this lately (from his teacher) and it is a bit discouraging for me and my girlfriend as I am unsure how to tackle this and we are afraid this behavior is going to carry on in kindergarden.</p>

<p>I have talked to him a couple of times already about the fact that it is not acceptable to disrupt classroom like he does (or talkback to his teacher). However, as much as he seems to understand it is not fun to get distracted like that (I made him relate to the fact that he doesn't like when his two years old sister talks during the time I read them stories for instance) he keeps doing it.</p>

<h1>Background information:</h1>

<p>He goes to pre-kindergarden twice a week (during the morning). My girlfriend is a stay-at-home mom and we also have two daughters. We get weekly report cards from the teacher and they used to be positive but, as stated above, lately he has been ""losing stars"" on his cards. <em>He knows he's going to school soon (in September) so we are thinking it might be related to anxiety</em> (new stuff tends to makes him anxious but he breaks the ice quite easily). For the last two or so weeks, he started crying when my girlfriend leaves from the pre-kindergarden class. He will sometimes hug her leg, just like little kids do when they are younger (again, separation anxiety?).</p>

<h2>Additional information:</h2>

<ul>
<li>He's always happy in class and participates a lot, he just seems not to listen to instruction or disrupt activities.</li>
<li>His teacher told us that our son had talked back to him (ex:""Let's do activity A"", (him) ""No I won't""). And sometimes just laugh at instructions given to him. This is something I realized we had a problem with a while ago. I used to let him argue with me. However, I have tried to eliminate that.</li>
<li>He is a smart kid, and has got a whole lot of stimulation when he was younger. During diner, he often talks on an on. Out of my 3 kids, I would say he is the one who requires the most attention still.</li>
<li>I have an anxious personality. While I try to control myself and not let it show to him. I am afraid he can still sense it sometimes. I would not say, him going to kindergarden is something that makes me anxious however.</li>
</ul>

<p>While I do not see this has a huge problem (since this is pre-kindergarden) I don't want it to snowball. I also do not like the fact that he might be bothering other kids or be impolite to his teacher. Could any of you shed some light of what we might be doing wrong or what we could be doing to help the situation?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>EDITED To Add:</strong> Nothing new or odd is happening aside from the from the fact that I think he is more aware that school is starting soon. It's good to note that we had remarks similar to the one above from his teacher before (or other play groups), but it just wasn't a common occurrence. At least to me it was more normal. As far as discipline; it's normally time out alone in his room if he's too agitated or if he hits/hurt he would go in the corner. We do use the reward system from time to time (grid with sticker, etc). I've stopped arguing at home by simply letting him know that no means no. For instance if he asks for the tablet and I don't want him to, I used to argue on the reasons of why he could not have it with him. Now I will tell him, for example, ""you can't have the tablet because reason X"". If he try to argue about it, I will ask him ""what did I just tell you?"", to which he will repeat what I just said for instance, and I simply let him know that my answers stays the same.</p>

"Three year old able to poo in the toilet but still pees in his nappy","<p>Our 3-year-old son has shown signs of improvement lately in using the toilet to poo. He is still wearing nappy, but he is able to take his nappy and shorts/trousers off and then climbed onto the toilet by himself to poo.

Normally he would tell me before if he wanted to poo, and I would supervise him until he finishes.

"How to react when two toddlers fight over the same toy?","<p>Your children are playing happily. Suddenly, you hear them yelling and notice that they both grab on to the same toy and fight over it.</p>

<p>You don't know who ""had it first"" and, thus, has some kind of ""moral right"" to play with it. They both can't talk yet (or have just started to talk), so you can't ask them what happened.</p>

<p>How do you react? Take away the toy (which might be unfair to the child who ""had it first"" and played with it)? Force them to play together (how, with toddlers)?</p>

<p>(Let's assume that it is not possible to get a second copy of the toy in a feasible amount of time, i.e., in the few minutes until their attention shifts to something else.)</p>

"Fear/interest in thunder and lightning","<p>My almost-three year old has the strangest love/hate relationship with thunder and lightning.  He will often react with fear when he sees lightning or hears thunder, and will talk about ""I am scared of thunder"", ""I don't want there to be thunder"", etc.; but then when we walk out into a thunderstorm, or look out the window, he will be incredibly fascinated and say ""I love thunder"", ""Daddy can I see more lightning"" (when there is not some for a while), etc.</p>

<p>Will it be helpful to him overcoming his fear of thunder (which often means sleeping in our bed at night when there are bad storms) to encourage the 'love' side of things (I tried taking him outside during the last one, which included some small hail, and he loved it and was sad when the hail stopped)?  Or am I making it more likely for him to have nightmares about thunder?  </p>

<p>Intuitively it seems like it should help to give positive associations, but he also had very significant negative reactions that night (as bad or worse than before).  I realize things don't change overnight, but I don't want to be making things worse.</p>

We have always been on the same page with each other whenever we correct bad behavior or instruct her on why a type of outburst is inappropriate. </p>

"Paternity Leave, How much does the Father need to be home?","<p>I'm trying to collect some opinions on this, because I'm a first time parent and most of my friends don't have kids. Basically, I'm trying to work out how much I will be needed at home during the first weeks and months of the baby being born. Don't get me wrong, I'd love stay home with the baby the entire time but its a comprise between supporting the girlfriend, raising the baby and work/money commitments. I'm trying to strike the right balance.</p>

<p><strong>Just to outline the situation</strong></p>

<p>My girlfriend is due around November this year, and I am planning as much as I can in advanced. I've been talking to HR at work, trying to decide what the best arrangements to make for work are at the time of birth and directly after.</p>

<p>To be it into context, it just so happens that I am the main bread winner in the relationship and my girlfriend will be stopping work a couple months before and staying at home to look after the baby. She will then looking for a new job after a duration (6months? undecided as of yet). So my girlfriend will be the main carer for the baby (9 to 5) initially.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm entitled to</strong></p>

<p>I am entitled to 2 weeks paternity leave, at statutory pay; which is significantly less than my usual pay and makes a huge impact to our finances. I also have flexible hours, some holiday available and the opportunity to work from home some days of the week. </p>

<p><strong>My current plan</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I'm assuming everything will go ahead as expected and there will be no complications. If there are any, I'll need to change plans anyway so if it happens I'll rethink things.</p>

<p>Roughly the week proceeding the due day (or the point where it looks like it might be any minute) I will work from home, and be able to spring into action straight away and drive her to the hospital. Its worth noting that the mother-in-law is very local, and very helpful so she'll be on standby to help throughout the birth and the months after.</p>

<p>After the baby is born, I will take a week of paternity leave and the odd couple days of holiday to bridge across the nearest weekend or if we need a extra day of so.</p>

<p>After the initial paternity leave period, I will go back to work and work from home ~2 days a week flexibly, depending on how I'm needed at work and home. I'm an engineer, so my time is split between working on a computer (anywhere) and working in a lab (in the office). I would keep working from home a couple days a week for a month or two, probably up to Xmas.</p>

<p>In the New Year, I would look to going back to work in the office full time. I have flexible hours, so I can work different times to work around baby commitments as needed.</p>

<hr>

<p>So I'm wondering, how much will I be needed during and after the pregnancy. Is just over 1 week dedicated, plus working from home for 2 months after enough?</p>

"Is it dangerous to microwave formula if I swirl the bottle and test the temperature afterwards?","<p>The overwhelming consensus online is that microwaving a babies bottle can be ""dangerous"" because microwaving formula <a href=""http://similac.com/feeding-nutrition/formula-feeding/making-a-baby-bottle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can produce hot spots</a>. However, if you simply swirl the bottle you can even out the heat distribution and eliminate said hot spots. The amount of bubbles produced by swirling is minimal and heat redistributes very easily in liquid. That being the case, if I test the formula's heat and its a good temperature, and the heat is redistributed, whats the big deal about microwaving the bottle? Is it just that people can't be trusted to swirl the bottle well and test the temperature? </p>

"My 21-year-old adult son hates me","<p>My adult son, who is 21, expects me to do everything he wants.  He takes no responsibility for his actions, instead always finding a way to put the blame on me and or others. </p>

<p>For example, he brought a dog with him when he moved back in ""for a few weeks"" (right). Recently I asked him to clean up his pup's poop from our hallway (his pup is house trained but was ignored.) His response: ""Can't you do it? You saw it first.""  Then  he followed this by saying he would after he finished his cigarette and game. </p>

<p>I explained to him when he moved back home (completely free) that he had to tend to his dog when he's not at work.  Oh, he was fine with it then. </p>

<p>All my son's childhood was a struggle for me. A struggle for respect which I never got (he says I must earn it.) And he says not to piss him off because if I do, be prepared for his rage; he will stop at nothing to bury me. </p>

<p>He will tell lies and make it all about me, and in the end he will move out and all of it will be my fault. </p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong></p>

<p>I will admit I've become a push over, but in the past I was not. I've had him arrested at 16 for shoving me into the wall outside of our house. When caught doing wrong by the police, I was told it wasn't bad enough to arrest (though he was cuffed at the time!) </p>

<p>I have called the cops for him setting fires in my garage; they just told me to beat his a##. I did the whole ""if you do this you will lose (example his games)"", so he walked in his room, bagged it up, and handed it to me, saying, ""You're gonna eventually take them so here."" </p>

<p>He's very intelligent and plays the polite role in front of others. The last time I called the cops in June, he immediately called them as well, stating I was suicidal and that he feared for my life. They came and spoke to us and did nothing, so I left the family member's house where we were and the cops asked, ""Are you just gonna leave him here?"" I said, yes he's 21 and an adult, and you can't force me take him with me. </p>

<p>I know I have to stand up to him but it's exhausting. Also my husband (not his father) finally had enough and put him out for his disrespect and abusive attitude towards me. </p>

<p>I guess I need to be the one to change and stop trying to apologize for things I didn't do even if he believes I did. For example, he blames me for being an ""absent parent"". I had a normal job, was gone during school hours. </p>

<p>He acts very entitled and dosen't respect boundaries at all. He has treated his ex wife this way as well. It seems to be towards women mostly. </p>

<p>I just want him to grow up and have a happy and healthy life. I'm not here to place all the blame on my son. I'm here to gain knowledge about what I can do to change myself, and hopefully help my son help himself. </p>

<p>A little background information: I was 15 when my son was born he was conceived through non-consensual sex (just once). His father was 21 and not a nice person. He was violent towards me physically, mentally, and emotionally through my 13 to 16. He has not been involved in my son's life since his first year. My son had no knowledge about how he was conceived; I hid that from him because I thought it might hurt him. My son was diagnosed at age 5 with ADHD.</p>

<p>I notice that my safety has been mentioned a lot in comments and need to clarify that he is no longer in my home. My husband had enough; my son left but not before pushing my husband (well trying to anyway.) My son's leaving never goes smoothly; it's always a 2 hour or more event full of verbal attacks, usually all towards me unless someone speaks up for me (then they become part of his attack as well.) I'm afraid one day he won't know when to stop.</p>

"Are there any benefits or downsides in ""flexible"" food time?","<p>Are there any benefits or downsides in feeding the children (around elementary school age) on the schedule of ""I'm hungry now"" as opposed to scheduled meal times?</p>

<p>This is of course assuming that the nutritional content remains the same, e.g. it's not like they demand a piece of cake 1 hr before lunch and then don't eat soup or veggies because of that. </p>

<p>An example would be: they ask for food 1 hour before usual lunch time and get a fruit salad (that they would otherwise get at snack time) because they aren't yet hungry enough for full lunch. Then they eat lunch 1-2 hrs later. Then then demand what would have been dinner during snack (but eat less of it) and then finish the day at usual dinner time with something light like an extra Yogurt. So they get 1 extra meal, with a <strong>mild</strong> increase in calories<sup>[1]</sup>, and no decrease in useful nutrition.</p>

<p><strong>My main concern is lack of stable food schedule</strong> induced by indulging such demands.</p>

<p>Is that a valid concern as long as I manage the total nutritional input in a sane way?</p>

"Is this strange behavior for a 5-year-old?","<p>I am asking about my stepson.  I don't have any children of my own, but to me his behavior seems bizarre.  </p>

<p>He talks constantly and will say the same thing several times using different words.  For example: ""That building is really old.  Look at that old building.  That building looks really old.""  This happened during a walk recently.  We acknowledge and respond to each statement, but after that third time it gets kind of redundant.</p>

<p>Also, he needs specific instructions.  If you ask him to get dressed and do not tell him to take off his pajamas he will just put his clothes on over top.</p>

<p>He checks out mentally a lot.  You can send him into the bathroom to brush his teeth and find him standing there ten minutes later, staring into space, not yet having brushed his teeth.  </p>

<p>He also has a very poor memory.  He cannot recall what he did at school or what he ate for lunch.  Basic questions seem to confuse him.  I ask ""what did you do at the park?""  He says "" what did I do?""  Or he will just not answer or will make up an answer.  I guess because he can't remember.</p>

<p>He asks a lot of rhetorical questions, for example, when I am making coffee he will ask what I am doing.  I use to answer but now I say ""what does it look like I am doing?"" where he will respond ""making coffee.""</p>

<p>Other times he is super bright; good coordination.  I taught him to ride his bike at age four.  I just don't get it.  </p>

<p>Also it is like he is incapable of being alone or entertaining himself.  He will follow you everywhere and wants to get super close.  If you send him to his room to play he will ask to watch T.V. instead.  If he is told ""no, go play with your toys for a bit"" he usually won't go, he will just hide in the stairwell.

<p>And by ""no-good"" I mean - mentally and financially unstable, irresponsible, irrational and alcoholic (in my opinion - not professionally diagnosed).</p>

<p>After reading the answer to <em>post <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/10449"">Sharing parenting/custody duties with an ex-partner</a></em>, I can honestly answer NO to all those questions. BUT - this is my opinion. And I am sure my ex doesn't think of himself that way.</p>

<p>I am struggling with the concept of my son having a right to have a relationship with his father no matter what kind of a father he is and no matter how damaging I think it might be for my son in the long run.</p>

<p>And.</p>

<p>Keeping my son safe and making sure he is growing up well-balanced, physically, emotionally and mentally healthy child, in a safe and stable environment - which would mean keeping him away from my ex.</p>

<p>Can I tell my son (if his father doesn't seek visitation until then) - that when he reaches 18 years old he can seek out his father and get to know him and have whatever kind of relationship he wants with him. But until then try to fight his request for visitation (if it ever happens)?</p>

<p>My son is 4 years old now and doesn't have visitation with his dad now. He saw him last when he was 2.5 years old. His dad had supervised visitation when my son was 1.5, but only came once and withdrew his court petition for visitation since then. Also I have a restraining order against him because he has zero respect for me and my boundaries and has been harassing me for years.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Edit: I have to add that I do not talk badly about my ex to my son. My son has a right to make up his own mind about the kind of person his father is and my opinions about my ex - have nothing to do with my son's opinions about his dad and I keep those separate.</p>

<p>But, my son is starting to ask about his dad now - things like: where is he, and can we go visit him and why isn't he here. And sometimes he says things like ""my father doesn't want/love me"". And it is heart breaking for me to hear him say things like that. So I reply with ""Your father loves you. Of course he wants you. And he just lives far away and is working and cannot visit"". Which is partly true. I don't want to lie to my son, but I also don't want him to think that he isn't loved or wanted. And I know that my son will always be curious about his dad, and that the response I have will soon get ""old"", and I would need to come up with a better response.</p>

<p>Another addition:
The reason this is a struggle for me is because I realize that I am not a perfect parent. That I make mistakes and that in some way I am sure some things I do - will have long term and possibly damaging effect on my son. I hope not - and I try my hardest not to make those mistakes but - I am not perfect and I can only do my best while striving towards a goal of raising a happy and healthy and stable, responsible, compassionate, etc. child.</p>

<p>So - how can I tell if not having a father at all is better than having an unstable father in my son's life? Even if he (the ex) does things that are potentially long-term damaging - isn't the benefit of having a father still outweighs it?</p>

<p>Details on this question can be found below, but here is a summary of my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I approach the parents of these children?
<ol>
<li>What should I say to the parents?</li>
<li>Do I work with the parents to set rules for their kids? (I've never had to do that with other parents.)</li>

<li>How can I keep the number of children within a manageable level? I know I don't feel comfortable about having 7 kids over.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Original Post</strong></p>

<p>We have recently started having some strange neighbor kids come over to our house and start playing in the back yard and I'm not sure how to deal with it.</p>

<p>One day we found 2 of these kids that we don't know or recognize playing in the back yard with our daughter and her friend. We didn't say anything, but just thought it was weird. Then there were five, then there were 7. This all happened in two days (literally overnight). We've tried to discourage so many coming over and it has helped, but now these neighbor kids are starting to play with our kids outside toys when we aren't even home. I also found out that these kids have taken toys from other homes. They are all pretty young (probably 9 years old and younger) so I'm sure it isn't malicious, but I'm definitely not comfortable with it. We don't have a garage, so we cant lock things up.</p>

<p>We don't know the parents, but I think I know where they live. They are of Hispanic origin, but I don't know if this is a cultural thing.</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with this? Insights from Hispanics are especially welcome.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I don't mean she wet their pants or actually act like a baby. I mean she likes to immitate some baby talk and things like that. Completely manageable.</p>

<p>At the same time, I'd like to promote some more independent behavior, like eating by herself, slicing the food by herself, getting a little more responsabilities, learning to be more patient, etc.</p>

<p>Currently our bedtime routine involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read story while drinking milk (she does this calmly)</li>
<li>Brush teeth (most of the time she allows us to brush her teeth well)</li>
<li>Change nappy and get into pyjamas. At this point she runs into the adjacent rooms giggling and saying ""I'm running away!"" or hides under her bed. Or she lies on her bed right at the top right against the wall where it's harder to reach her. The problem here is it drags out bed time at the end of the day when everyone is tired.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've tried asking her ""do you want me to help you get dressed or do you want to get dressed?"" but she just ignores this. She is capable of putting on most of her clothes given enough time.</p>

<p>The only way to get her dressed is to first catch her. This feels sub-optimal and as she gets bigger I don't think my back will support picking her up all the time. All the chasing feels like setting a bad precedent as well. </p>

<p>Threatening to take favourite toys away wins co-operation but I think there may be better techniques out there.</p>

<p>Once she's on her changing mat she behaves well if we talk to her and ask her questions. (""What was your favourite thing today?"", etc).</p>

"How to handle unending questions that the child can answer themselves based on rules?","<p>We are trying to get the kids to be as self-sufficient as they can, including mentally.</p>

<p>So for some things, we have simlpe rules, so they don't need to get our approval/permission for every detail.</p>

<p>However, it is extremely undermining to our goals when a child who knows the rules 100% perfectly and can tell you the answer according to the rules at a drop of a hat STILL asks you the questions that rules can answer all the time.</p>

<p>Examples (MANY of these or similar per day): </p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>""Can I play this video game?</em>"" ""What do the rules say?"" ""<em>Don't play before 10am and only after homework and chores are done</em>"". ""Have you done homework?"" ""<em>No</em>"". ""So can you play?"" ""<em>No</em>"". ""Correct! You know the answer then"".</p></li>
<li><p><em>""Is it OK to listen to music now?""</em> ""What are the rules for listening to music?"" <em>""No music when someone in the family is asleep.""</em> ""Is anybody asleep""?  <em>""Yes, mom's sleeping""</em>. ""Can you listen to music?"" <em>""No""</em>. ""Correct! You know the answer then"".</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What would be the reason for a child who 100% perfectly knows the rules and can apply them - for many years - to still ask when they know the answer clearly? And what can be done to encourage them to STOP asking in such a clear cut situation?</strong></p>

<p>NOTES: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>This does NOT appear to be a simple excuse to grab for attention. It's alwasy about a genuine want; and after asking said question, the child is perfectly content to go play/read by themselves for an hour or more with no attempt to contact the parent until the next time they genuinely want permission to do something.</p></li>
<li><p>These are old, established rules. The child knows the rules for years, and was perfectly able to reason those rules years ago, never mind now.</p></li>
<li><p>We already try to incentivize by always praising when they reason themselves (which does happen sometimes). </p></li>
<li><p>The child has no doubt in their knowledge of the rules. When pressed for an answer according to examples above, they never experience any hesitation or doubt as to whether their reasoning is correct (justifiably so).</p></li>

"1-year old has trouble sleeping at night","<p>I have a 1-year old son that has a lot of trouble sleeping at night. From the day he was born until about 10 months old he had to be rocked to sleep. At 10 months old we sleep trained him using Ferber method and it worked. At bedtime we would hold him for a while, read a book, pray, etc., then put him into his crib. He would cry for a very short time, sometimes less than a minute, then fall asleep. Throughout the night he would seldom wake up, maybe one time at most, and even then he would fall back to sleep by himself. </p>

<p>When he turned 1 year old this method only had a 50-50 chance of working. Now when we put him into his crib he would cry for a long time, could be up to 15 minutes or more. And when he cries a long time, there's a good chance he would puke, and then chaos ensues. During the night he wakes up frequently, 2-3 times, and need to be rocked to sleep again. </p>

<p>Note that he has no trouble at all sleeping two naps during the morning and afternoon. We rock him to sleep at naps, and it's usually fairly effortless. </p>

<p>I do not think he goes to bed hungry. We give him an 8 ounce bottle of fresh milk about an hour or so before bed time. </p>

<p>I don't know what went wrong and I don't know how to fix it. Why did he revert back to previous state? Is there something about night time that scares him now that he's more developed? We have a small night light in his room. Thanks for your help. </p>

"Mission Impossible 6: Toilet training my daughter","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>My daughter recently turned 4.</p>

<p>In December, she was diagnosed with autism.  She is on the mild (verbal) end of the spectrum.  She has communication and social issues, as well as some self care and behaviour issues (tantrums).</p>

<p><strong>Toilet training attempt #1</strong></p>

<p>Shortly before she turned 3, we tried to toilet train her for the first time.  We did this for a few weeks and it became much too stressful.  She never told us when she needed to go, and we constantly needed to prompt her.  The end result was constant weeing on the floor, a couple of frustrated parents, and being put back in nappies shortly after.</p>

<p><strong>Meanwhile...</strong></p>

<p>For most of 2014 we had a few major events (including the birth of another child) which put toilet-training well on the back burner.  She was pretty much in nappies the entire year.</p>

<p>Although, she would often express an interest in going to the toilet (or potty) to make a wee.  We would take her nappy off in these situations and let her make a wee like a ""big girl"".  We would always praise her and do a big song and dance whenever she had a successful wee on the toilet, and she seemed to delight in this.</p>

<p><strong>Toilet training attempt #2</strong></p>

<p>In January this year we decided to give it another go, and with this 2nd attempt we were much more determined to be successful.  So off came the nappies.  ""You're a big girl now, and you don't have to wear nappies anymore.  Big girls go on the toilet"".  She seemed to enjoy this concept.  The only time she goes in nappies now is when she goes to sleep (because we don't want to have to clean her sheets every day).</p>

<p>The accidents still happen fairly regularly.  We keep on telling her ""please tell mummy or daddy when you want to go to the toilet"".  She seemed to understand this, but very rarely tells us she wants to go.</p>

<p>Fast forward 5 months to June...We don't seem to be making a lot of progress, and we're going a bit nuts.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of issues</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>She very rarely tells us when she wants to go.</li>
<li>We will usually start to see signs of her wanting to go (pushing legs together, walking funny) but by that stage it's often too late and she's already wet herself.</li>
<li>If it's been quite a few hours since she last went, we'll try to take her but she will refuse.  I have discovered recently that bribery (allowing her to watch a cartoon on the toilet) helps though.  And if I managed to convince her to go to the toilet, she'll make a wee (she clearly needed to go).</li>
<li>If she has a tantrum (for whatever reason) she will usually wet herself if she hasn't gone for a while.</li>
<li>She oddly seems to be better at kindergarten and has less (wee) accidents - they have smaller toilets there which are more accessible than our home one, which might encourage her to go.  She also mimics other children who are going.</li>
<li>We offer both the toilet and potty at home to encourage her to not go in her pants.</li>
<li>Dirty public toilets are a no-go zone (understandable, I don't really like them either).</li>
<li>Often when we are out (e.g. at a restaurant) she'll say ""I need to go the toilet"".  We get very excited that she wants to go, but then we take her and she doesn't want to sit down.  Apparently she just wanted to go the toilet room, but not actually make anything.</li>
<li>She always tells us after she had made something in her pants, just not before she has made it.</li>
<li>If she makes a wee on the toilet (quite regularly, when we are able to convince her to go), we always make a big song and dance of it, rewarding her with stickers, stars and rewards.  She enjoys this attention.  Positive reinforcement to the max.</li>
<li>She seems to also realise (maybe) that drinking water leads to wees, and doesn't seem to like drinking water as much as she did when she was in nappies.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What about number twos?</strong></p>

<p>That's even more stressful.  In all this time toilet training, she's only made a poo on the toilet maybe once (and that's when she was caught about to make one in her pants).</p>

<p>Otherwise, it's either in her underpants or her nappy (when she's in bed).</p>

<p>She has mostly dropped her daytime nap now, but often she'll tell us that she wants to go to sleep during the day.  She knows we will put a nappy on her for this, and after she goes to bed she'll often call out 5 minutes later ""I made a poo"".  We then change her, and she wants to be awake again.  All apparently very premeditated on her part...</p>

<p>Getting her to makes poos on the toilet is close to impossible.  We have even let her sit on the toilet or potty with a nappy on just so she can get used to the concept of making a poo in that position.  But she still won't do it.</p>

<p>Sorry for being graphic, but when she does make a poo they can often be quite messy ones (not diarrhea but not solid either).</p>

<p><strong>Advice we have received</strong></p>

<p>We have seen a psychologist and occupational therapist who advised the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Social stories (provided to us) about toileting, in both book and DVD form.  The book even has pictures of my daughter in it to try to encourage her to do the right thing.</li>
<li>Making the environment at home peaceful and non stressful.</li>
</ul>

<p>We always try to remain calm when there is an accident, but we all have our moments and sometimes it gets a bit much.</p>

<p><strong>Where to now?</strong></p>

<p>They say that insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting different results, and that's definitely where we're at now.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas about how to tackle this seemingly insurmountable problem?</p>

"How should I inform parents if their children are bothering me?","<p>Today, on the bus, I was seated a row behind a mother and her young daughter (I guess about 5-6 years old), and the child just couldn't stay quiet: she was singing constantly, saying ""byebye, please come in"" to every car that we came across, even parked cars, being very annoying in general.</p>

<p>Now, I personally am quite quickly annoyed by young children. I have Asperger's, which in my case means it's hard to just mentally ignore noises like neurotypical people can, especially if I don't really have something to occupy myself with. And young children, in my experience, are usually making rather high-pitched noises, often quite loud and repetitive, which really bother me.</p>

"What avenues can we give to our 6 year old daughter to help socialize with those outside her immeidate family?","<p>Our 6 year old daughter is really bright and very friendly and outgoing to those in her immediate family (parents, siblings, uncles and grandparents).</p>

<p>But when she is in social situations where she has to interact with those outside this well known circle she becomes very shy and introverted. If she is among those her age she will never go forward and introduce herself and try to make friends. If an adult tries to interact with her, like Dad's friend saying ""Hi, how are you?"",she will just look down and not even reply. If a waiter brings her a balloon in a restaurant she will not even say thank you.</p>

<p>I think part of the problem is we are currently home schooling her and so she doesn't get much exposure to people outside her home and close family members.</p>

"Teaching perseverance and planning","<p>My eight year-old has an issue with perseverance and planning.  We thought playing <a href=""https://minecraft.net/"">minecraft</a> would help.  If you're not familiar with minecraft, it's a game where you gather resources to build things, while fighting or avoiding dangers like monsters and lava.  He <em>loves</em> the game, understands the mechanics of it very well for his age, and would spend every waking hour playing it if we let him.</p>

<p>The problem is, he's <strong>really</strong> bad at the planning part of the game.  A typical line of thought for someone his age with his level of understanding of the game mechanics (which I know from observing his cousins) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>I keep getting killed by monsters.</li>
<li>I need to make some armor.</li>
<li>I'll sleep or stay somewhere safe at night in the meantime so I won't get killed as much.</li>
<li>I need a bunch of leather to make armor.</li>
<li>I need to raise cows in order to get leather.</li>
<li>I need to plant some wheat to feed the cows.</li>
<li>I need a fence to keep the cows from wandering away.</li>
<li>I need a chest to keep my stuff safe, so I don't lose everything if I get killed.</li>
<li>I will work on all these things, making adjustments as I go, until I have my armor.</li>
<li>I will plan the next steps to get more powerful armor.</li>

"Absent Father vs. Father with alcohol addiction","<p>I was raised with a father who was dependent on alcohol and who was very abusive emotionally but sometimes physically towards my mother. At that time I wished I wouldn't have a father at all. But I know he was there to support us financially and sometimes it wasn't that bad. During the time when he was sober and behaving normally, he was showing affection and love towards us.</p>

<p>Now when I look at it I wonder if it's better to have an absent father or a father with dependent drinking who is present. Is there any study showing that having an abusive father dependent on alcohol is better than an absent one?</p>

<p>My parents' generation tended to stay in a marriage in spite of these problems. But now people advise to get a divorce. I'm wondering which is better for the children? All the studies I found only compare good present fathers vs absent ones.</p>

"Am I interrupting my husband's parenting?","<p>My husband and I constantly have communication problem against parenting. Since I posted <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/27300/need-suggestions-my-husband-and-i-have-different-opinions-on-parenting"">here</a> last time about the discrepancies of parenting between us, he was so happy that someone said I should not interrupt what he was doing with kids, and always said that I interrupted him now.</p>

<p>I surely agree and try not to intervene his parenting. But I also feel that either he or I have some misunderstanding about interruption/intervention. And as parents, we should learn to improve parenting instead of something like “so what, this is the way I do it, don’t interrupt me”. I’m not sure about other moms, but I really can’t bear hearing our boy crying. Many times as long as my husband was with the boy, I could hear the boy crying and I felt upset. Why would it be my fault that the boy crying with him (because I did in a nice way that the boy likes?)? Why can’t it be him not doing things properly or not really thinking what the boy thinks? Am I really interrupting him?</p>

<p>For example, early this morning, the kids’ school will have Halloween party and I was kind of late to take the boy to school. The boy ate most of the breakfast but I was hoping him eat some fruit too. So I asked my husband giving him some fruit while I can prepare for something else. Very soon after I left to another room, I heard the boy crying. When I came out, the boy said he wanted mommy to sit next to him instead of daddy. So I said, ok, let me handle it then. My husband thinks I was interrupting him. Later on, my husband tried to put shoes on the boy, but the boy resisted, cried, and asked me to put shoes on him instead. So I said, ok, let me put on the shoes and we leave. My husband said I was interrupting him so I didn’t do it. The boy struggled and cried, grabbed the shoes and ran to me asking me to put shoes on him. So I did. Did I really interrupt my husband? I really don’t want to ruin the boy’s mood in the morning. He already doesn’t like the morning drop-off at school, I don’t want to add any more unhappy mood to make it worse. Actually today he did cry sadly when I left the school and I felt my heart was torn apart. Did I do anything wrong? Is it my problem that the boy favours me over his daddy for most of things, brush his teeth, put his shoes on, play with him, put him to sleep, feed him (he can eat by himself but wants to be fed. I have to admit I didn’t do right about his eating habit at the beginning and should really change), take him to washroom, and change his clothes/diapers etc.?</p>

<p>Once when my husband put shoes on for the boy, the back of the shoes got bended in a little bit so the boy complained, but what he said was “it’s fine” and didn’t fix it, so I did. I can’t understand why it’s fine – we adult would feel uncomfortable when the back of the shoes got bended in, while would it be fine for a kid? My husband said that because he himself was spoiled by his mom he doesn’t want the same thing happens to our boy, but this doesn’t mean we can expect the kids to do something that we ourselves don’t like to do or don’t do! We parents should grow up, change ourselves, and play different roles when the life changes too!</p>

<p>I’m really frustrated. Sometimes I even think it would be much simpler taking care of kids by myself alone.</p>

"When should I take my pregnant wife to the hospital for nausea?","<p>My wife is 12 weeks along with our first child and we are very excited to be parents next year.  However, since about week 6, she has had quite a few bouts with nausea.  We were quite aware that this is normal in pregnancy and informed that it most often slackens in intensity during the second trimester (here's to hoping that's the case), but yesterday was probably the worst day yet.  She ate early in the morning and then was unable to hold down liquids or food for the remainder of the day.  This culminated in an evening of about 5-6 trips to the bathroom to vomit which made a rough total of about 9 or so episodes of vomiting.</p>

<p>Long story short, I was quite concerned and tried repeatedly to convince her that it was time to go into the hospital (Sunday night so urgent cares and/or doctor's offices were closed) so that she could get hydrated and possibly some nourishment.  My question is was I over-reacting?  If not, what are some ways that I could convince her that the hospital is the best bet?  (The situation was complicated by the fact that she was very tired, both from the dehydration and a poor night of sleep, so going into the hospital sounded like a terrible idea to her).  If it helps with severity of her symptoms she did mention this morning that she probably should have gone in last night.  I just want my wife and my growing child to be safe and healthy.</p>

"How do you discourage a toddler from hitting people?","<p>From talking to other parents, it seems like most boys (children?) go through an early stage of hitting at around 1. I have a 14-month old (2nd) son who occasionally hits me in the face, and occasionally hits his big brother in the head with objects. His big brother is very good about not hitting back, and playdates have been pretty well monitored, so we're fairly sure no one is modelling this behaviour.</p>

<p>With the older son (who is now 5), we successfully discouraged this at the ~1-year-old stage by sternly saying ""no-hitting"" and grabbing his hand as soon as he did this. In retrospect, we believe our 1st seems to have been unusually well-behaved at this age (compared to our 2nd and anyone else's child we knew at 1 year old)</p>

<p>Our 2nd is perhaps a more typical boy, and shows much more signs of testosterone/aggressiveness, and challenges us and tests his boundaries much more often than our 1st did. The stern ""no-hitting"" doesn't seem to work so well, even when we follow up with a brief time-out (in the playpen, which is now almost strictly used for this purpose).</p>

<p>We've heard that all kids go through this phase, and that the more you make of it, the longer it lasts. </p>

<p>Does anyone have good advice on what do here to ensure this doesn't develop into something worse?<br>
Should we just stay on track with the stern ""no-hitting""/time-outs?<br>
Or should we ramp up the punishment somehow? 
Or ignore it in the hopes he'll soon grow out of it?</p>

"What language should I use to talk to my baby?","<p>I know two languages: My 'mother tongue' and English. I used to speak my mother tongue until I moved to an English-speaking country at the age of 8.  Consequently, my mother tongue is at the level of a typical 8 year old i.e. I'm not very articulate, and I'm unable to express myself clearly and concisely in my mother tongue. When I'm speaking my mother tongue, I find that I use the grammar of my mother tongue, but English verbs and nouns. </p>

<p>Anyway, I have been speaking my mother tongue at home with my parents, and English with my friends, so my baby (fetus) has been exposed to both languages in equal amounts.  Which language should I use to communicate with her once she is born? I'm comfortable with 'baby talk' in both languages, but what about when she is older? My mother tongue feels more 'natural', however, my vocabulary is limited, while my grammar is perfect. With English, my vocabulary is wider, but I still do tend to make grammatical mistakes occasionally.  Even if I use my mother tongue, it will be interspersed with many English words, because I'm simply not fluent enough. With English, I can clearly communicate without mixing languages - My vocabulary is at the level of a native speaker. </p>

<p>In addition, I will be homeschooling her, teaching her to read and write.  I do not know how to read or write in my mother tongue - I don't even know how to read or write the alphabet.  With English, I can obviously read and write.</p>

<p>What do you recommend? I want her to grow up speaking both languages fluently - a true bilingual - unlike me, I feel like I only know one and a half languages, not two languages, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>*The reason that I'm illiterate in my mother tongue is because I went to a 'foreign or English school' in my home country. I've been speaking, reading and writing English since I was 5 years old.</p>

"Does anyone recognize where the phrase ""Dinosaur on the button"" comes from?","<p>Our 3.5-year-old son has picked up a catchphrase/joke punchline from somewhere... but we can't figure out where it came from, his teachers can't figure it out, his daycare teachers can't figure it out, and google has been no help at all. I even thought it might be some kind of mis-pronunciation degradation of something else. But ""dinosaur"" and ""button"" are both very clear, and are words well established in his vocabulary... he knows what they are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dinosaur, on the button!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's a few different ways he presents it... the most common is to get our attention with a ""hey mom"" or ""moooommmmiiieeeee...."" and when we acknowledge him, he tells us, very matter of factly and proudly, ""Dinosaur on the button."" At other times it just comes out like a frustrated teenager trying to explain to the old folks why some concert tickets are an absolutely necessity... with an air of exasperation applied to the ""on the button"" bit. Once or twice, the dinosaur has been on something else... on the sofa, on the window... but it's pretty much always on the button. Dozens of times an hour.</p>

<p>I thought this was a short lived thing, a few days like everything else with toddlers seems to be when they first get it in their heads and are playing with it.

"1-month baby crying when on floor","<p>I am a first time father with 1-month old DS. My wife has been exclusively breastfeeding, 20 mins on each breast every two hours. Currently both my wife and the baby are on a medication because they have thrush.</p>

<p>I have some issue with how my baby is doing in relation to the situation my wife and I are in.</p>

<p>I had about two weeks off work to help out my wife in raising the baby. He basically starts crying when he is in unwanted position. The only position in which he would not cry is having his chest up on my shoulder. Everytime my wife and I try putting him on the floor or making him sit or holding him on his back to our chests, he bursts out crying like he lost his world.</p>

<p>It's quite okay for me to hold him on the shoulder but as my leave is going to end soon, I am very worried that my wife would have hard time alone with the baby at home without anyone helping her. (She would have to eat, sleep etc but could not do so without the baby off her body)</p>

<p>An additional issue is that the baby is sleeping for an average of 8 hours a day most of which is through the night which will make my wife's job even harder. (He wakes up everytime we put him to his crib and starts crying) Breastfeeding is IMO quite efficient as there is not much resting between sucks. </p>

<p>Because we also have hard time making him fall asleep at night (wakes up when he lies down), we have been considering to put him to sleep training</p>

<p>So based on the above, the questions are:</p>

<p>Is there anything we could do to make him like other cuddling positions at least? </p>

<p>Is the amount of his sleep okay? </p>

"Responsibility, Real Choices, and Consequences","<p>How do you best approach (if, at all) teaching children in the late toddler to preschool age groups about responsibility - not responsibility as in doing chores (which we have a good handle on), but as in making choices that have meaningful consequences?</p>

<p>One example of this is that when we go out for dessert, we let our almost-three year old choose to forgo dessert for a small toy (like a car) that is the same cost as the dessert we'd have bought him.  This often works well, or at least without argument, when dessert is consumed at home or when the choice is made at the dessert place (where he often chooses the at-hand dessert).  </p>

<p>However, if he chooses the toy and then after that, Mom or Dad get dessert, he often will through a tantrum if he's not allowed to eat a significant portion of said dessert.  The only solution we've found is to discard the dessert at that point, which doesn't really make anyone happy (but stops the tantrum).  Reminding him about the toy doesn't seem to make a difference; he regrets his choice at that point.</p>

<p>What good solutions are there to helping him cope with his choice?  Is this even a good idea at this age (34 months)?  Are there better ways to teach meaningful choices that are more effective at learning?  Or is this just one of the many difficult things you have to do as good parents?</p>

<p>Should I cut my communication with my daughter down to only French? Should I cut it down to speaking Greek with her, since this is the language I speak with her mother every day? Or should I just continue mixing everything up? Or can I even start speaking English with her?</p>

<p>I don't want her to struggle to the point of extreme frustration, but if this means that in the end, her language development will catch up to normal kids, I am inclined to let her struggle a bit. So are there any longterm deficits for her, if I introduce English?</p>

<p>Please advice.</p>

"3.5 month old wakes up from nap after 30 mins and will only go back to sleep by feeding","<p>My little guy has never been a great sleeper but we hand him on a pretty rough schedule up until last week. He had to go to the hospital for 3 days. He is well now but his naps are completely off. He is easy to get down, probably because I feed him to sleep (another problem I want to work on) but he has been waking up at EVERY nap after 30 mins. I try letting him cry for a few minutes (never works) going in and patting him, giving him his pacifier, sometimes I pick him up, nothing works. I finally give him a bottle and that sometimes gets him back to sleep. I have to feed him for about 10 mins and try to quickly switch out his paci for his bottle but he usually wakes up and I have to start the feeding process over again. Most days I just give up and end the ""nap"" by getting him up for a real feeding. </p>

<ol>
<li>How do get him not to wake up after only 30 mins?</li>
<li>How do I get him to go back to sleep with out feeding him? He sleeps pretty well at night. We put him down around 8, wakes up at 3, asleep again until 6 so I know he is capable of going back to sleep on his own. We swaddle at naps and bedtime and his room is dark.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!</li>

"Non-judgmental all round parenting of a child: Any resources?","<p>How do you allow a child the freedom to fail and make mistakes while ensuring that they are learning from it. Just because a child refuses to conform does not make him/her a loser/problem/etc. Just because they are doing well now does not mean they will be like that for ever. You will never know when some one could blossom into a butterfly or have a humbling fall from grace. I don’t want to be a helicopter parent, but I also don’t want to be reckless and harm my child’s life and/or wash my hands of what is definitely my responsibility.</p>

<p>Example 1: Suppose they are hanging out with the wrong crowd. Maybe this will teach them a good lesson in life because you never know when someone will come across a character who may have malicious intentions. Learning to deal with such people should be part of life. At the
same time, I don’t want my kid to turn into a criminal, getting sucked into something into/witness acts of criminality. I want my kid to know when to draw the line and I would encourage them to have diverse friends from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>Example 2: Just because a child does not do well in studies does not mean they can't succeed (in the eyes of the society) at a later point in time. But I don’t want to ignore not doing well in studies because that might be a sign of delinquency and/or lead to criminal behavior. ( I am not saying that there are no educated criminals .. but you should get the idea).</p>

<p>My questions are :
Is there a good heuristic/rule of thumb I can use to ensure that my child is not becoming a delinquent/threat to society and maybe lean on being somewhat productive in the eyes of society? I don’t mean that as an act of external validation, but we are social creatures and people's opinion of you matters to a certain degree.</p>

<p>How can I ensure that my love/affection for the child is not letting me see the reality of what they are becoming in case it is something problematic?</p>

<p>Preferably I would want to train my child (because that is my job) to be a self educated person who can handle the stress and surprises life has to offer and that means learning to deal with both success and failure, learning to deal with happiness and sadness.</p>

<p>I would prefer some scientific literature or books/resources based on such literature that doesn't put meaning into every single act/incident and/or overly blames/praises either the child/parent for what they have/will become.</p>

<p>There is only so much you can do after all right?</p>

"How do I resolve a child's anxiety for war?","<p>Missile warning siren tests are going to be conducted in Hawaii once per month.  Presumably the government will start distributing information on shelters and how to shelter in place, and some schools will add ""Duck and cover"" style training to their emergency preparation strategies.</p>

<p>I recall as a young child (age 7-9) in the late 70's and early 80's doing such training in school, and reading headlines about possible war, and felt some anxiety about it, worrying that war would suddenly break out in our back yard and my family would be affected. I don't believe I expressed that fear to any adults, and simply lived with it for years.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I explain the situation to my children without scaring or scarring them?</li>
<li>What questions can I ask them to uncover hidden or unresolved fears and anxieties?</li>
<li>When, or at what age, should these things be discussed, alternately how should they be approached at each stage of life?</li>
<li>What mental and emotional tools can I teach them so they can deal with these worries and anxieties in unfamiliar situations?</li>
<li>Where do I find additional resources to help me - in terms of keywords or search terms - for either books, instruction, teaching, or professionals to help me tackle this issue?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have a large family with children ranging from 1 to 17, so please don't restrict your answers to the hypothetical 7-9 year old I was when I originally faced these fears. Also it's been pointed out that children already participate in a number of other drills, so while I'm focused on war, consider generalizing your answer if the same advice applies to many types of anxiety causing events.</p>

In these cases, I'll usually cheerfully respond with something to the effect of, ""what was that, sweetheart?"" but then he acts embarrassed and either shakes his head or says something like, ""why are you saying that!""

"My 7 year old daughter is the team cry baby...how do I help her stop?","<p>My seven year old daughter plays on a soccer team. She loves soccer. She is not the best player and not the worst.

She fakes injuries, gets frustrated and cries in front of everyone when she doesn't score a goal, and is the first one to say, ""We're never going to beat the other team."" </p>

<p>Personally, I always HATED that kid on my team, and now I'm that kid's mom. She does love to play and has fun when things are going her way.

"My 9 year old son regards life as meaningless","<p>My son, who is currently 9 years of age, tells me that life is absolutely meaningless and that ""we're all here to waste time"". </p>

<p>When he first told me this, I felt both angry and depressed. </p>

<p>And no, this is not because I am religious. I am an atheist, but I think his outlook on life is detrimental.</p>

<p>From an even younger age, teachers and I myself have observed that he is very intelligent, mature and highly interested in mathematics and physics since an early age. </p>

<p>One thing that I think is leading him to believe that life is meaningless is because he's very anti-social and often teachers tell me that he never talks in class and remains aloof (in his own world). </p>

<p>Some of his behavioral attributes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Was a late talker - didn't talk til he was 6.</li>
<li>He spends most of his time alone outside in a forest and the only time I speak with him is when he comes for dinner, breakfast and lunch. </li>
<li>When he's home, he rarely talks to me other than on eating occasions. </li>
<li>I have been since consequently told that he is ""different in a strange way"" by many people. </li>
</ul>

<p>Somebody suggested that I give him the internet so he could search around, make friends and other things. He only used it three times and told me that ""It's a great place to attain knowledge but other than that, it's horrible.""</p>

<p>After this, I consulted a teacher from his school and she told me that I should sit down and talk with him. </p>

<p>And this is when he told me that life is meaningless. He said, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Look. I know what you are trying to do. I know that you're worried
  about me. I know that you've been talking to a lot of people about my
  behaviour. But why do you want me to live my life the way others want?
  Life, by it's nature, is absolutely meaningless. Imagine yourself to
  suddenly wake up in a room, knowing of nothing, except the fact that
  you'll die within the next two hours. Would you attach importance to
  anything you would do during this period? Ofcourse not! All I know is
  that I am alive, a son of yours, on a beautiful diverse planet
  somewhere in the cosmos, and all I am interested is in knowing why did
  we acquire existence. This may be impossible, but I'd rather pursue
  the great impossible than spend my life living accordingly to the
  sentiments of people!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has no friends and nobody that even knows him properly. I feel that he'll go on to acquire mental illnesses as he ages, I don't know why but I don't feel good. Is there anyway to convince my son not to adopt this nihilistic outlook on life?</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit #1</em></strong>:</p>

<p>After reading all of the answers, I decided to convince him to visit a psychologist to be introduced to a society bearing children with ""interests similar to his"" but he wholeheartedly rejected this and is instead urging for a visit to MIT and spend a hour with some people named ""string theorists"". He is saying that he has ""formulated five logical alterations of general relativity"" but there is a very critical mathematical inconsistency in the fourth. He told me that, <em>""String theory is a lovely marriage of the quantum and macro worlds and is arguably the among finest mathematical achievements we have seen in years, but it's a little bland and most likely a fluff. Since string theorists are great mathematicians, I think they'll help me sort the issue out. But they're likely to be intimidated and even humiliated, psychologically, by my age and won't take me seriously. But it doesn't hurt to try. If that doesn't work, maybe you can assist me in publishing an article in a science journal. And no, as a son, my love for you is inherent but I don't want to meet some snobby know-it-all children. I am not interested.""</em> </p>

<p>I told him that I'll take him to MIT next month, but I don't think I can really do that. How will I get the scientists in there to talk to my son? Will they allow it? How can I tell them about this? And above all, what if I can't and how will I tell my son this? He was so happy when I told im I'll take him to MIT. Furthermore, I would like to add that he found out all about physics and mathematics by reading from my husband's vast collection of books. My husband was a mathematician with interest in physics and philosophy as a hobby, and he suffered from schizophrenia in his later life and passed away when my son was five. </p>

"Reading to a colicky infant?","<p>My 4-week-old daughter suffers from extreme gas pain that leaves her spending very few waking hours in a content, attentive state. Our lives for the past month have literally been about near-constant soothing over 90% of the time she's awake. Through generous application of the 5 S techniques from Dr. Karp's ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" we are able to keep her below the 3-hours-a-day 3-times-a-week qualification to officially declare her as colicky, but if we weren't constantly soothing her, I'm sure that she'd qualify.</p>

<p>I'd like to do everything I can to give her every advantage. One component of that should be reading to her regularly. However, with constant pain and the related crying/soothing there seems to be no opportunities left to read to her. The amount of time she spends in a quiet, attentive state each day measures in a handful of minutes. We're spending those moments talking to her, getting face-to-face time, and occasionally introducing high-contrast visual stimuli.</p>

<p>When should we become concerned about not having enough time spent reading? Is there any benefit to reading to her while she is sleeping? </p>

<p>I'm not so much worried about the time spent right now, but if this continues for 3, 6, or 9 months (as we've heard could be the case), then I'm concerned that the only word she'll know is ""Shhhhhhh""</p>

"How can I avoid ugly arguments with my wife?","<p>I was recently playing a board game with my 12 year-old son and wife of 18 years. We reached a point in the game where it was my turn to play while my wife could win the game with her next move. Because my son's turn was next, I did not block her, forcing him to block her or else lose the game.  I pointed this out to him, and he, half-jokingly, also declined to block her. </p>

<p>My wife and I wound up in an argument about whether goal is to win, or to enjoy ourselves. Tempers escalated, and son ran crying to his room, etc, etc. We eventually realized that we had a fundamental difference of philosophy about playing games, and we both explained our points-of-view to my son, who seemed to understand our different opinions.</p>

<p>How would you have handled this situation?  Should we have to set the boundaries of whether we are playing ""serious"" or not at the start of the game?  Should I have just let it go?  Any other advice?</p>

"Understanding the idea of ""fears"" as a young child","<p>While watching the Lion King with my older toddler (almost 3), he asked me an interesting question I couldn't answer.  During the scene with Scar and the hyenas, I asked him if it was scary (as I was concerned it might be).  He said yes, and asked me ""Why is it scary?"".  Further questioning made it clear that he did think it was scary, but he didn't understand why, and I didn't come up with a good way to explain why something would be scary.</p>

"Raising a tri-lingual child, tricky context","<p>I have found many of the topics here very interesting, but would like to share my personal situation, as it is quite specific, to see if you guys have any advice or experiences to share. :)</p>

<p>I am German, and my wife is Hungarian. We live in Sweden (I work in Denmark), and are currently expecting our first child. My Hungarian is very rudimentary, my wife's German is quite good. Nevertheless, our language of communication is English (also the language we work in).</p>

<p>We definitely want to bring our child up with our heritage languages, Hungarian and German. Additionally, there will be a third language involved as soon as the child enters day care, which is possible at age one here. I am a bit torn between Swedish and English as the third language. Normally I would go for the local language Swedish, to enable the child to speak the language of the country it lives in. I really like Swedish as well, and am able to communicate in it at a basic level myself. However, my wife is not that fond of living in Scandinavia, therefore it is hard to foresee for how long we will actually stay here.</p>

<p>English on the other side is generally a very useful language, even if we move somewhere else, as other countries generally have international/English kindergardens or schools. I feel that this decision should be made early on, in order not to confuse the child, or rip it out of a language context and leave it ill-equiped in a third country.</p>

<p>Do any of you have experiences with a similar situation? How did you decide? What challenges did you face along the way?</p>

<p>The last question is a more concrete one:
It seems that most parents follow the ""one parent one language"" approach, which to me makes sense. But how do you handle the language spoken between you and your partner in front of the child, if it is a third one? As described, we usually communicate in English. We could however also switch to German, to keep the languages in the house limited to 2.</p>

<p>This question is a bit related to the previous decision: IF we decide to make Swedish the third language (therefore sending the child to Swedish day care etc.), talking English to each other would mean that the child would actually be exposed to 4 languages. :)</p>

<p>Again, I am happy with any advice or experiences you can share.</p>

"How do you determine when to start a child on music lessons without pressuring them?","<p>I have a 5-year old who has shown some interest in music.

"Step Parent - To be concerned or not to be","<p>Brief history:</p>

<p>Became involved with a young woman, knowing she had a 5 year old daughter. Biological dad was in the picture til daughter was 2-3, and then left the state. Strangled mother while pregnant, does drugs, all around no-good. </p>

<p>My fiance (young woman) lived with her parents, and her parents generally raised daughter. When I came into the picture, fiance started coming around me more often and daughter grew to love me. However, there was definitely a noticeable need from daughter to be with grandparents and quite frequently.</p>

<p>We became pregnant and had a beautiful baby boy. Now my family consists of Myself, Mother, Daughter, and son.</p>

<p>The mother and grandmother are pretty close I would say and whenever the grandmother wants to see daughter, Mother let's her go. This has, in my opinion, gotten a bit out of hand when all summer (2+ months - EVERY weekend) daughter goes to her grandparent's house all the time. </p>

<p>Now, from her perspective - She was a single child, who inherited a brother. I'm generally gone during the week days working, and she has to fight for her mother's attention with her little brother. But when the grandparent's beckon her, she gets attention from both grandparents and they leave the boy home with us. So she gets undivided attention from two people instead of having to share one person's attention with her brother.</p>

<p>From my perspective. I don't get much time with either child during the week. My only time to spend with them is on the weekends. I expressed my thoughts to Mother - I don't get to see them. I'm trying to blend this family, but every time I have an inkling of time to spend with them together, she bails and goes and gets that 2 on 1 attention. When we are together we are two peas in a pod and vibe really well. I love her and try and do cool things with her and teach her. I've also bought us a new home that fits all of us with plenty of play room and got a new job to support all of these changes.</p>

<p>Now, we have another child on the way and I think it's super important for her to stay with us on the weekends. We are essentially making rules for my boy, and making daughter follow them too because now he looks up to her and does what she does. We are holding her accountable which without a doubt is probably a bit harder on her than when she was an only child, because she is constantly being told not to do something for reasons a, b. But we are explaining to her why we are enforcing these rules...we aren't just hushing her and sending her away. We take the time.</p>

<p>If she continues to go away on the weekends I feel like she will become alienated when the new baby arrives. I feel like she will pick up habits of her grandparents instead of habits of our family. I guess I'm curious if I'm being overbearing here...am I wrong to want her to stay with us? I mean sure get out every other weekend and get some time away with your grandparents (who spoil the heck out of her). But the majority of the time should be spent with us...</p>

<p>So another point is I'm the step-father. I feel like if I start enforcing this stuff with her mother, I will be looked at as the bad guy. I don't want to make either party upset, but this weekend for example she was gone from Friday 4pm to Sunday 5pm. I barely saw her at all. I was a bit upset about that. Do I have a right?</p>

<p>Any advice is much appreciated. Sorry for the length, but this does require some explanation. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1: <em>Mother's thoughts</em></strong> - Mother sees things from both perspectives. She has usually allowed daughter to go with grandparents regularly because she, as a child, went to her grandparents regularly. My concern is that her parents didn't really prepare fiance for life and a lot of that fell on my shoulders. So when I raise my concern she sees it and feels deeply for the situation and tries to make adjustments but ends up just telling the grandparents ""OP wants to spend more time with daughter so your weekends are cut off"" Which ends up making them resent me.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2: <em>Questions to myself</em></strong>- 
It seems the grandparents have assisted in raising her as some commenters have mentioned. To answer some questions: I do feel like there is a power struggle. I will make house rules, and have a clip down system (taken from her school) so if she's bad three times she will need to go in timeout or whatever fitting punishment at that time. I enforce this. Mother enforces it when I'm gone. When she goes to grandparents she has free reign and no boundaries and comes back with no sense of accountability and does what she wants. Do I feel the need to have control? Yes, I would say I do feel the need to have control. Because of poor choices made in the past, which we are all guilty of, this girl has a void in her heart. I want to have at least a part in making that better, and filling that void as a father figure that loves her mother, and her. Grandparents are coming in as psuedo parent's and when they get two-on-one time it generates momentum in another direction. Then I find myself asking if she even wants to be here? If 9 times out of 10 she chooses to go hang out with them, does she want to live there? </p>

<p>Seems general consensus is to seek family counseling, which we will look into but I guess I am looking for some kind of validation here. If I'm invalid in my behavior and thoughts I can change and I will be the change, but I need to know if I'm way off base or if this makes sense.</p>

"Embarrassing experience with my nephew; Should I tell his parents?","<p><strong>The experience and my actions at the time</strong>:</p>

<p>Three years ago, my nephew was three years old, in the middle of his potty training. After lunch with the family everyone went outside, he and his older brother (who was 6 back then) joined me near the computer like they always did, playing together some classic games.</p>

<p>At some point I excused myself to the nearby toilet room leaving the two of them to themselves with a game they both knew and loved. While I was still in the middle, the three year old nephew entered the bathroom and said he had to use it and asked for my help.</p>

<p>I have seen his parents take him to the bathroom before and under normal circumstances I would have just gone and called them; however I wasn't in any condition to get out of the room. I asked him to go ask his parents or hold a few minutes until I was done but he didn't budge and insisted on immediate action.</p>

<p>Fearing he would mess his pants I got up and helped him through the whole process. He pretty much did everything on his own, probably he was at a stage where he still needed the supervision. After he was done he went out, I returned to the room a few minutes later to find both brothers playing as usual.</p>

<p>I considered telling his parents, asking if I acted properly but was too embarrassed to mention it and it didn't happen again. </p>

<p><strong>My question and debates</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I have done anything different? If so, what and at which point?</li>
<li>Should I have told his parents afterwards, even if just to inform them?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now father to a 2-year-old toddler I do realize I might be making it a much bigger deal than what it really was; on one hand parents always want to know what their child is doing but on the other hand maybe such a thing is totally normal. (Potty training has not started yet for my daughter so can't really tell.)</p>

"How should I handle an 8 year old lawyering and quibbling?","<p>How should I handle an 8 year old lawyering and quibbling?</p>

<p>E.g., anytime he has a rule, or a task, or is told what to do, his FIRST impulse is nearly 100% to find some fault with the technicality or wording and either start arguing based on that, or simply not do and then when asked explain ""Well you said it THIS way"".</p>

<p>Just to be clear - this is on topics where he knows 100% certainty what the <em>spirit</em> of what's being told to him is... he literally does what in adult would be called ""Lawyering"".</p>

<p>This isn't even limited to things he doesn't like or objects to - he simply enjoys the process of finding loopholes. Which would be fine if he was a law student and not an 8YO child who actually needs to do things he's told to do.</p>

<p>One of my problems is that I don't want to clamp down TOO hard - first, because it shows he has good brains and lets him exercise them; and second because later in life it IS a very valuable skill to have, even to a non-lawyer. </p>

<p>But at this point this create actual practical problems - critical things not done, or tons of my times wasted on close supervision of things that he's perfectly capable of doing on his own since age of 3 (e.g. brushing teeth or dressing or eating or cleanup etc...). </p>

<p>My main concern isn't stopping the behavior completely, but limiting it to things that aren't critical/important or time-sensitive situations. He doesn't seem to care when it's appropriate to quibble and laywer and when not.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>""I'm Done with breakfast"". ""Did you finish eating?"". ""Yes"". ""OK, get ready for school"". Then I walk up to where he ate and notice he didn't drink his juice milk. ""Why didn't you drink, and why did you say you finish""? ""Well, you asked about EATING. I finished EATING, but not drinking"". Just to be clear, he knows perfectly well (and confirmed it) that what he was being asked was whether he finished his entire breakfast, liquids included.</p></li>
<li><p>""Please take all the books you were reading that are now strewn around your room to the bookshelf?"" ""OK"". 15 mins later, find a bunch of books still in the room. ""Why didn't you take these?"" ""They aren't books I was reading, they are activity books"". Again, he very happily confirms that he knows full well activity books are included in ""books"", or that the goal of the excercise was to make his room tidy.</p></li>
<li><p>""Please clean up your toys from the floor of the room"". 10 mins later ... ""Why are these 5 things still on the floor""? ""Well, my sister played with them, so they aren't 'MINE'"". ""Didn't you play with them TOGETHER""? ""Yes"". ""So do you think I meant to include them in the cleanup""? ""Yes, you did"".</p></li>
<li><p>""Why did you hit your sister when throwing that thing? Didn't I tell you to NOT throw it when she's standing in front of you and tell her to move away so you won't hit her?"" ""Well, she wasn't standing. She was sitting"".</p></li>

<p>Ideally I want to dress her up such that she doesn't get too warm inside, but is comfortable when outdoors. They don't go out, if it's below 35 degrees or snowing. Also, she isn't very verbal, so she can't ask the teacher to help her take off her jacket if she gets warm indoors. It's impractical for me to assume that the teachers will take off both sweater and jacket so that she can cool off indoors, and then bundle her up again (they have 14 kids.. And I don't want to be 'that' mom).</p>

<ul>
<li>What is warmer - fleece pants/fleece lined jeans/ good ol' jeans or

"Appropriate confrontational behaviour to teach a 2-year-old?","<p>At my two-year-old daughter's nursery, there's one ""energetic"" boy who is perhaps a little lacking in the empathy or discipline department. What I'm saying is, he occasionally behaves too roughly towards the other children, going as far as hitting them. Now I'm sure it's nothing too extreme - there's adult supervision after all, and I know he's reprimanded when caught - but what I'd like to ask is: what behaviour should I teach my daughter when he's hitting her? I see two alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fight fire with fire. Encourage her to hit him back. Obviously, there are problems with this approach. I'd very much like to convey to her that hitting is not-okay behaviour. However, I definitely do not want her to fall into a victim role, and being proactively defiant may help with that. Also, the boy might benefit, when he realizes that there are boundaries that can not be crossed without repercussions.</p></li>
<li><p>Have her respond verbally: yell at him not to hit her. This is more in line with avoiding not-okay behaviour (hitting), but I'm not sure this will have the desired effect of him not hitting her.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage her to ask the adults for help. This is my least preferred course of action, because it is the least self-reliant, and I'd rather she feels self-empowered to deal with these situations.</p></li>

"Lying to my daughter about her mother's death","<p>My 10-year-old daughter's mother died last week. She was a masochist and suffered from depression and childhood issues. She, from what I understand, hung herself in her closet from a belt. I'm not sure if she intended to kill herself or if she was trying to ""get off"" and wasn't able to get the belt off in time. There was no note AFAIK, so my guess is it was the latter, I want to think it was an accident but neither would surprise me.</p>

<p>As far as my daughter knows, her mother had a heart attack. She's taken the news really well so far. She gets teary-eyed from time to time when I really try to press the subject of her mother's death but she is otherwise acting like nothing happened.</p>

<p>My brother is a psychologist and a grief counselor. I asked him for advice on the subject and he said she seems healthy but that I should try to evoke a response from her regarding her mother's death as it's unhealthy to hold those feeling in. We wrote her letters and burned them. I try to talk to her about it at least once a day but I never get much of a reaction from her other than teary eyes. She hasn't really vocally cried since we initially told her and even then it wasn't much. </p>

<p>Since her death we've moved into a bigger place, closer to her school. She's excited about having a bigger room and getting to sleep in a little bit. Maybe that excitement is helping to mask the pain somewhat. At least I feel like that's the effect it's had on me.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don't like lying to my daughter but I feel justified in this case, and one day, years down the road I plan to tell her the truth. In the mean time it's been really hard to evoke a reaction from her as my brother suggested. I believe it's important that she cries to get those feeling out and it's occurred to me that if I tell her the truth about her mother's death that might evoke a reaction.</p>

<p>Should I tell my daughter the truth about her mom's death or continue to live a lie, risking that I might slip up and accidentally refer to her mother's suicide or that she might hear me discussing it with church leaders or other family? I feel like this will be a hard lie to maintain. If not, what other things can I do to help my daughter get those emotions out?</p>

<p>Edit.. I think telling her would help me with my own grieving process as well. Maybe that's selfish. I just want to do whatever is right and best for my daughter though.</p>

<p><strong>Update...</strong> A few important points....</p>

<ul>
<li>I've seen people on this site try to ask questions in lieu of therapy. I'm not one of those people. I'm asking to <strong>supplement</strong> therapy. We are in contact with several therapists - the problem is there is often no consensus among them, so in order to make the best possible decision I'm asking the community as well.</li>
<li>My brother is neither my therapist, nor my daughter's therapist. In fact we don't even speak very often as he lives out of state. I only just recently found out he was a psychologist. That said, he has been an invaluable resource to me because he knew me as a child and in many cases I'm learning that he knows me better than I know myself. He's also a somewhat prominent figure in my church, which means he's sort of a one-stop-shop for all my general spiritual and psychological questions... but he is definitely not my therapist nor is acting in that capacity.</li>
<li>I told her the truth yesterday and it turned out to be a good thing I did, as it filled in some of the puzzle pieces for her and answered certain questions that she had.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you all for your advice and your opinions.</p>

"Should I really be insisting that my daughter finish eating her meal?","<p>Like many young children, my 4.5 year old daughter will often stop eating her supper (6 PMish - she has breakfast and lunch at daycare) and say she's not hungry.  My instinctive initial response is to insist in some fashion because that's what my parents always did.  The assumption seems to be along the lines that they're just being picky or distracted, and will get hungry later, and that they need to learn to eat on a schedule.</p>

<p>But regardless of whether she'll be hungry 3 hours later, what if she really isn't hungry now - aren't I doing her a disservice in her development by ingraining the idea that she should keep eating when she's not hungry?  What should I do, just a gentle reminder that this will be her last meal of the night?</p>

"Is tickling ""cruel""?","<p>At the risk of asking a subjective question, I recently heard from another parent that tickling triggers the same nerves as pain receptors but at significantly lower levels of intensity.

"How can I help a child who won't talk to anybody at school? Selective mutism","<p>Although I am not a parent, I am interning in social work.  I am currently working with a student in an elementary school who does not speak. The parents have explained that she does speak at home (I also witnessed her speaking to her mother outside of the school), but she has not said a word since she began school in August.  I work with her individually and in a group, and she still refrains from speaking in both settings.  We wonder if the cause is anxiety because she's not speaking at school but she is at home.  Have any of you experienced something similar with your children? What can we do as school staff to create an environment that is more comfortable/less anxiety-inducing for her?</p>

"Can anyone give me advice on my son's father?","<p>I'm having a hard time right now dealing with my son's father. We are both 27 and I met him 2 years ago. I also have an 8-year-old-daughter whose father is not in her life. I raised her on my own and her father told me from the beginning he wasn't going to be around and I accepted that and created a beautiful life with her.</p>

<p>When I was 4 months pregnant (with his baby) I found out he had slept with a 16 year old (he was 25 at the time). In Canada (where we live) the age of consent is sadly, 16. I was mortified when I found out, because it goes against everything I know to be morally right. I later then found out that when he was 19 he dated a 15 year old for a couple of years. </p>

<p>When we were together the first time, I left my son and his father together for a weekend. I came back to lots of porn on the computer, which is attached to the TV in the living room. But that's not the most disturbing part; it's the fact that he watches Youtube music videos and gets off to them. </p>

<p>Now, my daughter likes to watch those types of music videos for the music, and it just highly disturbs me to know he gets off to that, and not knowing where my son was when he was doing it is another thing that really bothers me. I also found that he was watching porn on my daughter's iPad, which I pretty much begged him not to do in the beginning as I don't need my daughter seeing such things. He did his best to delete it, but come on, where are his morals? </p>

<p>Unfortunately, his mother did not raise him properly, and he has such a disrespect for women. He likes things done his way, and if it's not done that way he gets mad. When we were together as well he had a problem staring at women (the young ones with barely any clothing on), I brought it up many times and he said he knows he does it and that he will stop and he never did. He would say things like ""I was never taught to not stare,"" and ""it's harder to not stare,"" and ""I don't even know I'm doing it"". However, he's not abusive in any way towards me or the children. </p>

<p>This relationship left me with zero self confidence but that is besides the point; it's not about our relationship; it's about him and his child's relationship. </p>

<p>My major concern is the fact that he has never gotten help for the way he was raised, the fact that several times he has told me he knows he needs help. He says he doesn't like the person he is, and doesn't want to be that way anymore, but he still hasn't gone to get help. </p>

<p>It worries me that he will one day look at my daughter sexually because of his enjoyment of younger girls, and if not my daughter then her friends. </p>

<p>I also fear that our son will learn his ways of disrespecting women and thinking it's ok to take advantage of young girls for his own sexual wants. </p>

<p>We separated 2 weeks ago. Yesterday he started asking to see the kids. If this goes to court, I can't see a judge taking any of my concerns into consideration as it's all speculation, but I truly do just want my kids to be happy and be raised in a healthy environment.  </p>

<p>I in no way want him out of the picture. I want him to be a positive role model for his son, and even though he wants to be in my daughter's life, I have a very hard time with that right now, especially since he has told me twice now that he loves my daughter more than he loves his own son who is now 7 months old. That is not something I enjoyed hearing. He has a massive family too, and I have no family just me and my kids and I just want the best for them. </p>

<p>I guess my question is whether or not I should let my kids near him. </p>

<p>Am I just being selfish or are my concerns actually legitimate? Because I do truly feel he needs help of some sort to not only become a happier person (he never laughs!) but to become a positive role model to his child that can protect him and show him the right path in life. Any help would be greatly appreciated.  </p>

However, when I sit down (because at some point I get tired), after a few minutes, she starts crying and never stops until I get up and walk again. She is about 6 weeks old.</p>

<p>Notes: I have the habit of often rocking her gently when I hold her while standing up. But I don't think this is the reason because when I sit down, I try to do the same but it is ineffective. It often happens in the evening, before going to bed. Also, I remember one of her older brother (she has two) was doing the same when he was a baby too (and it drove me crazy too).</p>

"My 8-year-old son is still soiling and wetting himself. Please help!","<p>My 8-year-old son has been wetting and soiling himself for a long time now. We have been referred to hospital specialist nurses who are helping retrain his bladder. This was over 18 months ago and we are still no further. They told us that he may not know when he needs to go the toilet but can't say this is definitely the reason behind the accidents. They have said they can't do anything about the bowel side of things until bladder problem is under control. </p>

<p>It is occurring everywhere: school, out shopping, family outings, parties, at home, literally anywhere.</p>

<p>He won't tell us until we smell him at bedtime. If he has soiled or wet he will hide his pants and won't clean himself up. </p>

<p>We have tried many approaches: Talking, trying timers, a wobl watch from hospital, reward charts, naughty step, making him clean his own underwear, taking away privileges, stopping sleepovers, making him strip off bed each day when he has had accidents through the night. Honestly the list goes on. Nothing at all is working. </p>

<p>After all these years I'm at the end of my tether. I am getting upset and find myself crying over this when he isn't around. He is now in year 4 and residential trips are coming up which he isn't allowed on if he still has these problems because of hygiene reasons and because of other children who are also on trip. He is being tested for autism through school. </p>

I heard from a neighbor that the he may be bored with the food, so we served him different food, but he still doesn't seem to be interested. We also tried to change the way we gave the food to our son, but that didn't solve the problem either. One thing that keeps me a little more calm is that lately he more often asks to be breastfed. Maybe this is caused by his eating less solid food.</p>

<p>I've heard that this phase is pretty normal for all children. What has actually happened to our son in this phase? What makes him not want to eat the food we give him? He has asked for food, but then doesn't eat it.
Is it enough that we focus on giving him more in breastfeeding? Because when he doesn't eat as much solid food, he asks for breastfeeding more often.</p>

(Although, she does actually use her thumb as well to pacify herself.) After her first 45 minute sleep cycle she may or may not wake up again and need the same thing. And in the process of going to sleep during that first sleep cycle she may or may not wake up and need the same thing.</p>

<p>But after the first sleep cycle, she seems to be out for the rest of the night. Conceivably, she's sort of waking up between sleep cycles I suppose, and getting herself back down to sleep during this time?</p>

"Am getting emotionally distant from my mother day by day. What can I do to mend the bond?","<p>I'm a child and not a parent. I don't understand what to do in the situation I'm describing below.</p>

<p>I have both my parents and a brother. </p>

<p>It all started a 2 years back.</p>

<p>2 years back we were all living a happy life, understanding each other and obviously loving each other. Smiling at each other. Most importantly I used to share everything with my parents.</p>

<p>It was my 10th standard with I joined a tuition class nearby. That Aunty who taught us was (is) a wonderful and a helpful person and so I used to stay after class for about 10-15 minutes daily discussing the new things which I found out in maths (she taught us maths) while hoping to get some more facts regarding that topic. I constantly told my parents how awesome she was*. My parents then decided to visit her place once for the praise.</p>

<p><sub>*but at times I also told that her teaching style didn't suite me well, we never had discussions in her class. Which I don't think was the reason behind my parents' visit, because I praised more.</sub></p>

<p>I don't know what happened that day at her place. But I soon released that it wasn't a good meeting, when my mother asked me: why I disturbed her after classes and tried to ""teach"" her? Soon after my mother started thinking that I wanted to ""show off"" my knowledge in front of her*. I must say, I really had no intentions of doing this. So I started leaving the class before everyone else. </p>

<p><sub>*It took me about a week to completely realise what my mom was actually asking me, obviously she didn't ask me this directly.</sub></p>

<p>After that incident I don't feel comfortable in sharing anything with my mother, since my mother started blaming me for everything that happened in my life, it felt as if suddenly everyone else became ideal humans for her.</p>

<p>This distancing increased when I became busy studying for JEE. I really conversed very less with her,  I and my dad both were interested in tech and science we both talked a lot about latest things happening around the globe.</p>

<p>Probably my mom started thinking that I didn't want to talk to her. This I feel has made her irritate on tiny mistakes of mine. </p>

<p>To add more trouble: my brother is really a smart child, he knows very well how to escape situations* and very good at fooling others. At times I shout at him mainly to make him close doors behind him, to wash his hands and legs properly after playing in the mud (my parents are not bothered much about this but he really comes out of the bathroom in just a few seconds, obviously without touching soup). This shouting triggers response at the other corner of the house and my mother comes running and then starts shouting on me without having a look at his mistakes). </p>

<p><sub>*He initiates the fight and then escapes by doing what I wanted him to do since the beginning, and hence giving my mother a reason to shout at me: ""don't you have patience?"". I'm sure that if the situation would not have turned this serious my brother would never listen to me. </sub></p>

<p>Today I had another serious verbal fight with my parents regarding my brother's irritating actions and his uncleanliness.
I think my dad understands what is going on and so every time he controls the situation by making my mother quite without telling me anything, this obviously irritates my mother. 
My mother, today told that even the maid working at our neighbour's house has a better life than hers because she is the one who has to listen to my dad.</p>

<p>I believe that the meeting with my teacher has made my mother look at me with a foul vision. My mother now always tries to find my faults*. And our relation is now not so good. Now, I try to avoid interactions with her. </p>

<p><sub>*to such a limit that it made her think that I have so much of attitude that I couldn't ask for another roti myself during dinners. While watching TV with my father and brother, I really didn't see how much of roti is remaining in my plate and so didn't bother to ask for more roti(s). I was so engrossed in watching television that I actually didn't concentrate on eating, and quietly picked up rotis being placed on the dining table.</sub></p>

<p>There have been numerous verbal fights between me and my brother, and hence There have been quite a lot of incidents when my dad has controlled my mother without telling anything to me.</p>

<p>Of course there some more factors which have led to this situation, like to avoid talking to my mother I started watching TV during dinners, earlier we used to discuss what had happened that day.</p>

<p>I am now feeling as if I'm not living with my own family, there is no love, no laughing, no jokes shared. Everyone is very ""serious"" now. No one smiling. There is an imaginary boundary separating us now. We're becoming robots now.</p>

<p>Is there anything I could do now?
Ps: I cried while writing this</p>

Please let me know what motivates him. What can I do to get him back on track? I will not give him harder work to challenge him as I feel he will completely shut down. He refuses to do the work we have, so harder work makes no sense. He is extremely smart and can do higher level work but I feel he will act out more. What do you think? Now that he is more comfortable he wants everything to be on his own terms and learning and listening is not something he wants to do. We had visitors today during our presentations and we had to remove him from the carpet to sit at his desk for 5 mins. because he wouldn't let presenters talk. He did great btw! He just had a hard time letting others have their turn. It breaks my heart to have to discipline him.  Any feedback from you is very valuable!</p>

"How to provide the most support to children as an 'uncle' with only monthly visits","<p>As a side effect of some volunteering I do, I find myself playing something of an 'uncle' like relationship for some of the children of women I've volunteering with.  I love children and am more then happy to play that role, and of course only do so when encouraged to by the parents.</p>

<p>Some of their kids grow attached to me, and as it is now I currently have at least half a dozen sets of kids that look forward to my visits and their parents encourage me to know and be involved with them, acting in something of a quasi uncle like role with the children when visiting.  The kids vary in ages, though generally all younger then teens.</p>

<p>I only visit these kids occasionally, Level of contact depends on many things but generally after I'm no longer actively volunteering with them I'll still occasionally visit somewhere between once a month to once every other month.  </p>

<p>Many of these kids do not have a traditional father.  Most either have a single mother, or two mothers.  The father is usually either completely out of the child's life, or plays a minor, and not always positive, role in their lives.  Most of the kids are still well adjusted, with two parents that care for them, but I think part of the reason some latch on to me so quickly is because I am a male.</p>

<p>Anyways, I enjoy spending time with and playing with these kids.  However, I would love to help encourage the kids in any way I can.  I'm wondering if there is anything I can do as an 'Uncle' to help the encourage growth and positive development for the kids; beyond simply playing with them and making them feel important.</p>

<p>Again, the kids are all generally already loved with good parents, in fact it's pretty much guaranteed that the parents are good parents who would raise the children well for me to know the family to begin with.  The kids aren't desperate for love or emotional support etc; though occasionally perhaps at least curious about having a male role model (though usually I'm not the sole male role model).  </p>

<p>Are there things I can focus on to try to make the most of my limited visits with these kids while I'm with them?  Beyond playing and having fun, which is a given, what small things might I try to do to help encourage the children I'm playing 'Uncle' for?  Can I really have any impact on them with such infrequent visits, even if they do look forward to them?</p>

<p>I want him to create the things he wants to create, instead of what we think he might want to create, and he's certainly welcome to color outside the lines as much as he'd like (both literally and metaphorically), but at the same time, I want to encourage him to start building up better skills and techniques.</p>

<p>Part of this stems from my recent venture into painting for recreation.  I have essentially no training, and haven't painted anything since I was a kid using watercolors and fingerpaints.  I'm ""learning by doing"", and, by doing so, I'm finding how much technique and practice can be involved in being able to express oneself artistically.</p>

<p>So, should I be teaching my son anything at this point, or just letting him have fun?</p>

<p>If I just let him have fun with it, when should artistic skills be actively taught?</p>

<p>If I teach him now, what types of things should I be teaching him?  Things like ""if you're painting something, make sure you haven't missed spots where you wanted color"" and the basic concepts of color mixing?  Or should I include things like brush techniques, layering, or other, more ""advanced"" tricks?</p>

<p>How do I ensure that these craft projects remain fun while building his skills?</p>

"How to deal with an unsupportive parent","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> My mother isn't supportive and she doesn't seem to understand me. My family life is miserable and I don't know what to do about my situation. I know I should probably see a counselor but my parents aren't willing to support me in that and a counselor cannot change my parents' behavior. What can I do to improve my situation?</p>

<p>To prevent this from being downvoted into oblivion: I believe this post is on-topic (see <a href=""https://parenting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/226/would-we-accept-questions-about-parents"">this</a> meta post) and I'd ask anyone to please read to the end before downvoting. I've put a lot of time and effort into this post and I don't know what to do about my situation.</p>

<p>Bit of background info, my parents have a successful marriage and we're a family of 7. A 14-year-old boy (me), 12-year-old girl, 10-year-old boy, 6-year-old girl and infant baby, all except aforesaid baby and myself being homeschooled by our mother. I understand that so many children cause stress on the parental units but I don't feel this is an excuse for being hateful.</p>

<p><strong>My good qualities:</strong> things I feel my parents should be proud of (but they aren't)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I'm an advanced piano player.</strong> I've submitted work to a studio and it's ""likely to show up in some production or other within a year"". But whenever I practice my compositions on the piano I always hear from my mother that it's ""sloppy"" or ""too bangy"".</li>
<li><strong>I'm a good runner.</strong> I'm a freshman and I'm <a href=""http://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/Division/List.aspx?DivID=38466&amp;filter=9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">top 100 in the state of Oregon</a> (out of over a thousand) for Cross Country. I'm 5th on my team and I have a 5K time of nearly 18 minutes. When I get home from a meet my mom usually ignores me and my dad grills me on my run*.</li>
<li><strong>I get good grades.</strong> I have a 3.7 GPA. I'm taking Precalculus as a Freshman and I ""attend"" an online school (which is said to be more challenging as students have to manage their own time). I had a C for about two weeks - my mother threatened to pull me out of school and homeschool me again. My father threatened to put me in a public school.<br><br>
<sup>*To be honest, I appreciate this as it's a good evaluation. But even so...</sup></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My less good qualities:</strong> Some struggles I have that I feel my parents should be helping me through</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADHD.</strong> This is why I don't attend a public school. When I did I talked out in class and distracted the other students. Instead of getting me help, my mother rejected the ""idea"" that I had ADHD (although an fMRI showed that I did) and just pulled me out of the school.</li>
<li><strong>Depression.</strong> I haven't suffered from this for many years but I attained it when my mother was abusive. In my current situation I'm pretty sure it's coming back because of how terrible my family life has been for the past few months.</li>
<li><strong>Headaches/migraines.</strong> I suffer from a medical condition that causes constant headaches and the occasional severe migraine. I can't handle loud noises or unnecessary constant movement, such as that from a small child. My 12-year-old sister constantly prances about, singing and shouting as if she's an 8-year-old. When I ""look upon her with disdain"" or ask her to calm down my mother rebukes me, saying I can handle it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The downright crap about me/us:</strong> Severe trials I've gone through <strong>in the past</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Crimes and court.</strong> I don't see any need to go into detail but I made a mistake that got me into the juvenile court systems for a few years. I understand that it was stressful to my parents and financially shaking, but I don't think they understand how big of an impact it had on my life too. It has caused quite a lot of trouble but I got no parental support when I needed it the most.</li>
<li><strong>(previous) pornography 'addiction'.</strong> <em>I haven't had this problem for a year.</em> We're a religious family in which this is seen as a serious misdoing. I didn't see it on purpose at first but it caused a few years' worth of bad habits. I don't think this has made me a very good person in the eyes of my mother.</li>
<li><strong>Abuse.</strong> A few years ago my mother was very physically abusive (she isn't anymore). She hit, kicked, pulled hair, etc. I know this hasn't helped our relationship much...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other possibly useful information:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I do chores at home.</strong> I do all the typical chores such as dishes, taking out the trash, and sweeping. But instead of ever being thanked for helping with the family, instead I am criticized about my ""bad job"" every single time.</li>
<li><strong>I have an advanced social life.</strong> I don't feel spiteful towards the entire world, just mostly towards my home. I have a supportive girlfriend and some great 'bros' that are always there to listen to/help me through my struggles. But after spending a fun afternoon with friends and returning home my parents will always make me feel down again.</li>
<li><strong>I don't have much self-esteem.</strong> Due to the constant criticism of my mother and bullies at church, I don't think very highly of myself. I don't do self-harm but I don't see many reasons to esteem myself as a great person.</li>
</ul>

<p>After all this, what I'm getting at is: Aside from counseling (which is no longer an option), what can I do to improve my situation at home? Is it normal for parents to treat me this way? If, in the case that the problem lies in me (as I'm constantly hearing), what can I do to improve my relationship with my mother/family?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Thanks to everyone for your help! I appreciate all suggestions given. I accepted the answer I did because it contained the advice that seemed to start the most change in my family over the past few days. Thanks for your support!</p>
"
"What does it mean to ""say a few words""?","<p>I have a 17-month-old who isn't talking yet. Our pediatrician says that if he isn't talking by 18 months then they'll do a hearing test. But that can't possibly be the problem since we know he understands us, in fact a month ago we went through the words that we absolutely know that he understands and we stopped counting at a hundred. We know he can hear and we know that he understands a lot. But he's not calling us mommy and daddy. He vocalizes a lot and can repeat what we say pretty well, so if we say ""mommy"" he'll do a pretty good job of that, and things that start with ""d"" he can create a pretty creative vocalization of a word that starts with a ""d"", sometimes accidentally getting the exact word right. But, that's not ""talking"", right?</p>

<p>My wife and I have been assuming that to talk means to use the words to communicate instead of pointing, grunting, or using the his small subset of sign language. What do the books mean when they say ""can say a few words""? What do doctors mean? And how did you define this milestone?</p>

"Does playing classical music for infants and young children make them smarter?","<p>I read pop neuroscience books as well as science sections on news sites (e.g. BBC, NY Times) and one of the claims I remember reading was that <strong><em>supposedly</em> listening to Mozart music made infants smarter.</strong> Google searches on this topic turned up articles as early as 2007, so the idea has been in circulation for a while, even among mass audiences. Reasons given for the varied from promoting language skills to enhancing neural plasticity. But from a parenting perspective (the one I am interested in),  the basic question is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the so-called ""Mozart effect"" a scientifically supported, developmental leg up or a media-fueled ""scientific legend""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, does my kid actually gain any advantage? </p>

<p>To answer this, consider the following questions: </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Is the Mozart effect a scientifically substantiated fact? That is, does listening to classical music actually make infants smarter and lead to greater intelligence?</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd like to distinguish this from merely becoming more educated due to studying music. I didn't grow up listening to Mozart and now I compose, so there are clearly many ways to learn music. But the critical claim is, if I take two groups of children and play Mozart for one and not the other, does the Mozart group gain some noticeable enhancement of intelligence? </p>

"Are most half-day pre-school programs for stay-at-home parents, or are there options?","<p>At least in my state (Washington), the child care licensing is such that most preschools are only able to care for a child for 4 hours per day. I found a couple of places that do preschool and then childcare on site, but those are very rare. Most small, appealing programs are half-day only.</p>

<p>Does this mean that most of these programs are only suitable for stay-at-home parents? What are the other options? A part-time nanny? Maybe there are other approaches?</p>

"My two-year-old wets through his diaper at night, what to do?","<p>My two-year-old son has lately been urinating a lot in his diaper at night, to the point that it is completely full in the morning and if we don't change it right as he gets up the urine he's been holding in because the diaper is full will soon come out and wet his pants.</p>

<p>He has also made a habit of, if he is not wearing pants/shorts, pulling his diaper down a little if it's full and urinating.</p>

<p>This morning I was alerted to the fact that my son had woken up because he kept complaining about a ""mess"" from his bedroom.  I went in to his bedroom to discover that, at some point during the night, he had taken off his pajamas and wet the bed.  I don't know if he had pulled his diaper down as well, but it looked like he had adjusted it (perhaps pulled it down a little and then pulled it back up).  This was the first time he had wet the bed.</p>

<p>For a few weeks now my wife and I have been putting on larger diapers (two sizes larger than his normal size) when he goes to sleep to increase the urine storage capacity.  Clearly, though, this effort has not been enough.  What else can we do to </p>

<ul>
<li>keep him from wetting the bed again while still in diapers?</li>
<li>keep him from taking off his pajamas at night?</li>
<li>keep him from pulling down his diaper when he doesn't have pants/shorts on?</li>
</ul>

<p>I know there are diaper booster pads and overnight diapers.  We haven't tried any of these yet.  We've also recently quit giving him any milk right before bed.</p>

<p>The pajamas he took off last night were zipper onesies.  I was surprised he was able to get it off.  </p>

<p><em>Additional, possibly related note:</em> my son has also made a habit of pulling stool out of his diaper if the back opening of his diaper is accessible and we don't change his diaper soon (usually due to his refusal for us to change his diaper).</p>

"Child's sleep schedule vs Parents'","<p>I'm trying to learn the do's and dont's of parenting for when my baby comes along, by watching other parents. I'm able to learn a lesson or form a theory on most things except this one area:</p>

<p>The baby in question is almost 3 years old, doesn't go to sleep till 3 or 4 in the night if he sleeps in the afternoon. The afternoon nap happens sometimes when he's awaken early in the morning or is tired out. And it gives the parents a really tough time when it happens. They have to take care of dinner and other things at night and go to office the next day which becomes next to impossible. So what they do, is try their best to not let the baby sleep in the afternoons, no matter how sleepy he gets. So naturally, he gets moody and cries and yells and throws uncontrollable tantrums. Parents have a tough time with that too, but choose this over sleepless nights.</p>

<p>I was never for constraining the baby too much, be it about sleeping or eating - as long as its safety/health is not compromised with. Sure, build a schedule early on and stick to it so that the baby's body is also in sync with it. But when and how should I start enforcing the schedule? And at the cost of upsetting the baby this much? Parents certainly cant change their schedules and office hours, either.</p>

<p>The question boils down to ""what do i do if the baby's sleep pattern/schedule is different from the parents' even after 2-3 years""?</p>

"Child with diarrhea: what to do when you think the doctors aren't doing enough?","<p>My son, who is 2 years old, has had diarrhea now for 11 days. About a month ago he started to have diarrhea. I thought it was just an illness, but it would stop and then start again. </p>

<p>It started to be more consistent on June 23rd. He had two episodes each on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th; 3 on the 26th; 5 on the 27th; 3 on the 28th, 29th and 30th. On Wednesday the 1st, he had an episode in the morning. He woke up crying like he was in a lot of pain, but he ate breakfast and acted fine. Later he had 3 more episodes. Then 3 episodes the next evening. Today, Friday, he has had 3 more episodes. </p>

<p>Yesterday I took in a stool sample to be tested. That came back negative for the most common GI issues children can have, like C Diff. </p>

<p>I took him to the ER today, just to give them another stool sample, now they want me to give him a probiotic medication. The results of the test should be back sometime next week. </p>

<p>They keep trying to tell me it's just a virus, but with this lasting 11 days in a row now, I doubt that it is. </p>

<p>I don't know what else to do for my little guy. When he is getting ready to have diarrhea, he cries horribly. He grabs his tummy and says ouch. </p>

<p>None of the medical staff I have taken him to is taking this seriously. How much longer does he have to be having diarrhea before they finally take it more seriously and do something?!?!?!</p>

<p>Edited to add: I'm not really seeking medical advice. I realize there isn't much else I can do for my little guy and there are no approved medications to give to him. I'm really needing advice on how to get these physicians to actually do something. I mean they have sent out now two stool cultures, but mainly they send us home because he is not dehydrated. I have scheduled an appt for him with a GI doctor, but that is far as I have gotten and that appt is not until the 22nd. </p>

"How much crying/tantrum is normal for a 2-year-old starting daycare?","<p>My child had a rough start to daycare a couple of months ago, where he vomited for the first few days and seemed like he would never settle. He eventually started staying for half a day, though he rarely ate or slept there. But through all this he was a happy baby at home.</p>

<p>Now the last 4 days have been full days, and his behavior at home has changed drastically. After the first 2 days he started crying hysterically (and inconsolably, sometimes for more than 30 minutes) at the slightest trigger, or when getting up or going to sleep. Spending the weekend at home made him much better, but by the end of Monday he was just as bad. He has also started lashing out with his hands and feet at whoever tries to comfort him.</p>

<p>He hasn't exhibited any of this behavior before, and it is quite worrying. I'm mostly worried about long term damage rather than the short term inconvenience.</p>

<p>Have any of you seen similar behavior in your kids? And can anyone point me towards any resources or NHS (UK) services that might help?</p>

<p>We are also considering reducing his hours to half a day for a few weeks if we can arrange the time off from work.</p>

"What are the outcomes of highly unusual community outreach to young children?","<p>I can't think of a way to better title this question.</p>

<p>My question is a direct response to a recent news event. <a href=""http://www.wdbj7.com/news/local/roanoke-boys-birthday-party-goes-viral-family-feels-reddit-hug/34026818"" rel=""nofollow"">You can read the article online</a>. </p>

<p>Here's the scenario:</p>

<p>A child with a condition socially impairs him, in this case a speech delay known as apraxia, was having a public birthday celebration. The parents, uncertain that anyone but close family would attend, created a Facebook event that went viral worldwide.</p>

<p>In response, more than 300 people, primarily strangers, attended the child's event, bringing hundreds of gifts, with more being shipped via online orders. Much of this is because of the action of the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/3cdwtu/reddit_you_did_it_300_people_showed_up_at_a/"" rel=""nofollow"">Reddit</a> community.</p>

<p>Responses such as this from the Internet happen occasionally, ranging from raising money for medical bills, sending pizza to children's hospitals, and now making amazing birthday celebrations.</p>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<p>What are the implications of such a large turnout on the psychological and emotional health of children who receive such enormous gifts (if not quite so enormous as this)?</p>

<p>How do you properly guide their expectations about such events in the future, to help them realize, in a healthy manner, than such an occurrence is not likely to happen again?</p>

<p>If you have a child of your own, that may or may not have social development issues, who reads such articles, how do you help them realize that such events are not typical for every child and that shouldn't necessarily expect the same?</p>

<p>I'm hoping there is some base psychology/sociology information that deals with similar events, if not the same events. For instance, I've recently read (still searching for articles) about the negative effects of military parents' surprise public homecomings. Those are also situations that are atypical for children, have a huge immediate impact on the child's life, and may or may not involve a lot of community members.</p>

<p>Update: I've had time to think about the question more, so I'd like to provide the following:  </p>

<p>I realize this is given as multiple questions, and am willing to break it down into separate questions if necessary, but I'm really asking one overarching question:<br>
<strong>What are the short-term and long-term psychological, emotional, and social outcomes of such events on children in unusual spotlights and children that witness/learn about such unusual events?</strong><br>
My multiple questions are intended to be <em>guidance</em> towards answering the larger question, not as discrete questions requiring dedicated answers. Although, I suppose there <em>is</em> an implied follow-up question being:<br>
<strong>If any of these outcomes are negative, how do you, as a parent, mitigate them?</strong></p>

"Couple separated 18 months ago (irremediably), sharing custody of two children. Good or bad idea to share weekend experience together with the kids?","<p>My brother and his ex-wife separated a year and a half ago. They are both over it and would never get back together. They have a 12-year-old girl and a 10-year-old boy whose custody they've shared without much conflict since then. The kids, while certainly affected, remain fairly happy.</p>

<p>Now, my brother plans to take the kids to a theme park for a weekend. Last time they were at one the family was still complete and happy, and they all had a wonderful time and share a great memory of it. So, inevitably, the idea of inviting his ex to come along with them has crossed my brother's mind, in hopes of giving their kids one more (and probably last) memorable childhood experience shared with <em>both</em> their parents. </p>

<p>But here's his (and everyone else's) obvious doubt: </p>

"Should toddlers drink milk during the night?","<p>My son is almost 2 years old and he still wakes in the night to drink. I know he <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/302/at-what-age-do-kids-start-sleeping-through-the-night?rq=1"">is</a> <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/1711/how-do-we-help-our-toddler-to-sleep-through-the-night?rq=1"">not</a> <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/21077/toddler-never-sleeps-through-the-night"">alone</a>. </p>

<p>As I would like to get a full night's sleep, I have been contemplating watering down his formula to get him to stop expecting food at nighttime.</p>

<p>But here is the thing: he gets a bottle at 8 (of which he usually only drinks 120ml - 4 ounces for you at the other side of the big water). If he wakes around 12 that is 4 hours since his bottle and 5.5 hours since his last solid meal. If he wakes between 2 and 4, it has been 6 to 8 hours since he last ate anything, and only a small bottle at that. Some nights he will wake twice to drink, around midnight and around 4 or 6.</p>

<p>Is it reasonable to expect a small child to go for 10 hours without food? I know that some kids do sleep through the night but how common or even healthy is it?</p>

<p>I am a grown up with plenty of reserves, for me it is no problem to sleep 10 hrs if I would get the chance or to skip a meal. But he is growing (fast), his metabolism is fast and he has little reserves. </p>

<p>Maybe instead of striving to cut out the night drinking altogether, I should try to make sure it is only one bottle somewhere between 2 and 4?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: From the answers I conclude that toddlers can sleep all night without extra milk and that the way to achieve this is to make the evening bottle into a small meal with extra solid food.
This leads me to conclude the problem is in the daytime feeding schedule: evening meal is at 6:30 (on daycare days we are rarely at home before 6). Evening bottle is at 8, 8:30. At this point he is not very hungry yet so only drinks about 2/3.
Breakfast is around 8. But with all the drinking, he is not very hungry in the morning.</p>

<p>Additional question: When toddlers sleep through the night, how are the following spaced: </p>

<ol>
<li>dinner </li>
<li>evening snack and/or bottle</li>
<li>breakfast</li>
</ol>

"Seventeen year old daughter wants to take an international trip to meet someone she met online","<p>So, my wife and I are emotionally drained.  Our daughter is 17.  We live in Ontario Canada.  She met a girl online that is 16 and she wanted to fly to California over Christmas holidays to see her.  Now my daughter says she is not gay, just bi or whatever it is that kids now are calling it.  It doesn't matter what a person's sex is, it is about the person and that's fine, we have no issue with that. </p>

<p>We had a big argument about it and we told her straight out that she is not flying to California to meet someone.  Apparently the girl in California has ""strict"" parents so my daughter thinks she can stay in a hotel and just hope that this girl can get away to see her. </p>

<p>As some background info, my daughter is a very immature 17 year old.  Yes my wife and I have spoiled her, she is an only child and as a result, she is not very independent.  We take her to school, take her to and from her job, she has never had a serious boyfriend or girlfriend. </p>

<p>So we thought we had diffused the situation.  We have her passport and her birth certificate so she cant fly out of the country, but now last night she told us that she is going to go to California in April when she turns 18 no matter what.  </p>

<p>We don't want her to go.  We don't think its safe, my wife is in tears, its affecting us so much that it consumes our days.  We don't know what to do.  We don't even know if this girl is who she says she is.  I have done some checking, phone record lookup, name search, address search.  </p>

<p>My research shows 4 aliases on the phone number and 5 sealed court documents which are serious. Some solutions we have thought of, including offering to pay to have the girl come to our house. That would bring things up to speed with her parents. </p>

<p>Is ""taking the ball away for a week"" an effective punishment for a child under 5, considering that they seem to have shorter attention spans?

"6 year old daughter: a bully? manipulative? sensitive? or just difficult?","<p>My 6 year old daughter is amazing in many ways - she is smart, creative, likes school, gets along well at school, is independent...on her good days.</p>

<p>However, I'm really struggling with her at home. Her teacher says ""she's a friend to everyone"" at school, but at home, I feel like she is defiant, disrespectful, manipulative and a bully. She basically makes my life a living hell when she does not cooperate.</p>

<p>Specifically, she is defiant. When she is in this ""behavior twilight zone,"" she will ignore instructions/requests to follow rules like ""stop running in the house"" or ""stop screaming like a chicken."" She will yell ""No!"" sometimes, if she feels like being defiant, even for perfectly reasonable things. Trying to engage her in a conversation is infuriating because she won't answer even polite questions about why she won't put on her jacket in the freezing weather. She will do things incredibly slowly (it seems like it's just to annoy me) when we need to go someplace. About half the time she behaves like this defiant demon and the other half of the time, she is motivated and perfectly, independently capable of getting out the door for school, for example. That's why I can't figure it out. Who is this child? Is she a nice, smart girl? or a deeply disturbed psychopath?</p>

<p>I know that sleepiness and hunger can be major causes of this type of behavior in her, but even accounting for that, she seems to behave so poorly sometimes.</p>

<p>Whenever I try to respond to her behavior with negative consequences, she has huge meltdowns. Now, I know you're probably thinking: what child DOESN'T have meltdowns when they don't get what they want? Well, her meltdowns can last hours and she is persistent. She begs and begs ""Give me another chance"" but the whole hour leading up to this point, she was whining and manipulative and then as soon as you give her another chance, it will be another hour of dealing with that behavior (don't worry, I recognize these moments and rarely give in, BUT I'M RUNNING OUT OF STEAM). Also, often during these meltdowns, she will flail around on the floor and make horrible sobbing sounds. She will often tap an arm or leg on a piece of furniture and then use that as an excuse to melt down further. She often drools and lets her snot run down her face for dramatic effect. I know that when she taps her arm or leg it's not serious because I'm standing right there...it could just be a brush against a cup or something that could never in a million years hurt someone, but she uses it to escalate this terrible scene.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, I find that I have an actual physical sensitivity to sound (it is stronger at certain parts of the day) that make the whining and crying and screaming almost unbearable (on top of the regular discomfort of having to listen to a six year old whine non stop for hours).</p>

<p>The worst part, though, is how verbally abusive she is. She says incredibly rude and hurtful things, sometimes without realizing it. However, even when we try to talk to her about it, it's like she doesn't understand that she could possibly hurt anyone's feelings. In particular, she makes comments about my cooking. Every. Single. Night. And yes, we are poor, so we can't afford to eat out EVER and I do actually slave in the kitchen for hours trying to prepare healthy and tasty meals that my husband and children will eat, so it really hurts my feelings when she says the food is ""disgusting."" (It's not disgusting, but just for the sake of this post, if you don't believe me, just pretend you do). Other times, she just talks to me in very disrespectful ways. My husband and I are pretty good about addressing it right away, but talking to her is not working. It is clear that she is ignoring us while we're talking or distracts herself so she doesn't have to listen. On top of all this, we have two younger kids, whom she is often responsible for ""riling up"" by chasing them around the house or starting games that encourage rough housing, etc. </p>

<p>I try very hard to squash this bad behavior right away and my husband tries to do so as well, but some nights I have to check out because I'm so upset and I don't want to also become verbally abusive to her. I will just signal to my husband that I've had enough and go watch tv on my computer alone for hours. Those nights, he has to get them bathed and put to bed, which is something we normally do together. </p>

<p>I know that some of her bad behavior developed after I had the twins (they are 4 years old) and I struggled with depression and anxiety and PMDD for 3 years after they were born, but I have received treatment and therapy for my issues and have always been proactive in dealing with her behavioral issues. I even had her in therapy but she was so well behaved that we were ""discharged"" so to speak. It seems like recently her attitude has gotten intolerable and she has really hurt my feelings a couple of times recently. I tell her that she's being rude and that it's not appropriate but then I end up isolating myself and crying about it and I feel really stupid for that. I'm worried that she is a trigger for my depression and anxiety. To be honest, before I had the twins, she wasn't a super easy child, but my confidence was in tact. After, her behavior has caused me to feel so bad about myself that if she weren't my daughter but just someone I knew, I would cut her out of my life entirely, but I obviously don't want to do that to my own daughter, who I love. I already resent her for some of this. Help me find a way to cope!</p>

"What to do with a teenage girl who won't stop lying?","<p>I have a 16 year old I am raising...I am 29 and have a 7 year old son. She is my baby cousin...her dad had a stroke and is being taken care of by family in another state. Her mother abandoned her with me to go be with a boyfriend in another state. She has been with me since she was 11.</p>

<p>Since that age she has been acting out. Nonstop boyfriends and lying about them. Last year, she was spending the night at her ""best friends"" house...who turned out to be a boy of course. She made a fake phone number to pretend to be the parent of said boy so I was texting her instead of a real parent.</p>

<p>This year, she stole the car and wrecked it. Lied about what happened until I investigated and found broken glass, etc. in the driveway. </p>

<p>I've grounded her numerous times, taken away her cell phone, etc. NOTHING IS WORKING. I'm 29...I'm at my wits end. No one else in the family is willing to take her in because of all the issues she has. I know it all stems from being abandoned and from having a bad mom...I've tried so very hard to provide her everything she needs...a nurturing environment and also assuring her that I would never abandon her like her mother did. I try to be loving, caring, etc. I don't know what else I can do...</p>

<p>EDIT: It wasn't just her also who came to stay with me...it was her and her brother who is now 18 and out of the house. He acted out also with drugs and lying but improved his behavior, graduated and got a job. He's doing well. Nothing I do is helping with the girl. </p>

<p>My question is what can I do to get her to stop lying? She lies even when she knows I know the truth. How do I get through to her? What do I need to do besides the usual things like talking, taking away things, grounding, etc.</p>

"How much pressure should I put on my kids to learn?","<p>My wife just started reading ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother"", a book written by a Chinese mother who talks about the pros and cons of the high-pressure and rigid parenting style of some Chinese parents. </p>

<p>In discussing the book with my wife, I started thinking about high-pressure vs. low-pressure parenting. One of the arguments for pressure are that children will often say they are not interested in something, or will be lazy about things such as practice and homework. I've experienced this first hand with all of my children. They are frequently reluctant to start learning something new, but after you force them to do it for a while, they get over the initial hurdles, then it gets easier.</p>

<p>But how much pressure is too much, and how little pressure is too little? What differentiates consistency from pressure?</p>

<p>Also, how do we decide what educational areas should have more pressure than others? Obviously if a child says that they don't feel like learning how to read or how to do math, because they don't want to do homework, you have to follow through and make them do it. Anything else would be irresponsible, because those are mandatory curriculum for any legitimate school. But what if the child makes the same excuse with learning piano. Is it equally as irresponsible to let them quit playing piano because they don't want to practice? Arguably, if your child grows up to be a professional musician, the music lessons are much more important to his/her education than math was.</p>

<p>I realize much of this could be subjective, so <strong>I'd prefer answers that have some sort of statistics or studies backing them</strong>.</p>

"How to handle the situation with a 1-year-old preferring dad over mom with her suffering emotionally?","<p>I am the proud father of a 1-year-old boy.  My wife and I love him to pieces!  A few months after his birth I suffered through a terrible bout of anxiety attacks.  Turns out it was just my way of reacting to such a drastic change in my life and it took me a few months to fully embrace my new reality.  While I was working through this period of anxiety, my wife let me take the lead on most of the activities with our son in the hopes that by jumping into the situation with both feet, my anxiety would lessen.  This was indeed the case and I can now look back on that time as a learning period and feel pride that I am now past it. </p>

<p>For the past 6 months, our son has been showing a very strong preference for me over his mother.  I have tried to remove myself from some of the daily tasks that we do with him and my wife has taken over in those, in the hopes that our son will see us both equally.  While his favouring of me has lessened, it most certainly has not disappeared.  This clearly hurts my wife who only wants to be treated equally and not be shunned by her little boy.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that I am sure that this is a phase and that at some point I may well find myself on the outs with our boy and he will be stuck to her like glue.  While she understands this, it does nothing to help in the present and I hate seeing my wife suffer emotionally.  </p>

<p>I have to mention as well that I went back to work full time one month after the birth of our son. My only time with him was at night and weekends. My wife stayed home for a full year and has only gone back to work recently.</p>

My students are minority students from a low-income area, and I feel like they are completely out of place among the other students at the lab who are mostly from a privileged socio-economic standing; the lab was open to all students, but we were the only low-income minorities their that day. How can I help my students to not be intimated by the class/cultural barrier?</p>

<p>Some examples that came up during the lab were as such:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We took the bus 2 hours to get to the lab, while other students were casually speaking about their lavish plans for the rest of their summer vacation to travel abroad.</p></li>
<li><p>When one of the other students asked my students which high school they were from, and they responded with a low-income school's name, there was some audible discouragement in my students' voices.</p></li>
<li><p>After the lab, one of my students told me how 'those other kids didn't seem normal', and it was pretty obvious he/she was referring to aforementioned differences.</p></li>
<li><p>Also after the lab, one of my students seemed discouraged by the fact that some of the other students had already been working on the project for a number of years and that he/she is just <em>now</em> getting involved in research.</p></li>

"How to protect my children from cyber-bullying","<p>Cyber bullying has been a talking point in the news for the last few years, where stories of children being 'attacked' online in social media causing them to go into depression, sometimes forcing the child to change schools, the family to move or tragically an occasional suicide.</p>

<p>How can we as parents help to protect our children from cyber bullying without completely preventing the kids from participating in social media (which may ostracize them from their peers and lead to real-life bullying instead)?  While I'd rather not essentially stalk my children online, if that's the only way then are there any ways to either do so discreetly?  Or can you recommend a way to convince my children to voluntarily allow us as parents to keep a close eye on them?</p>

"Travelling when baby is young: bring them or leave them?","<p>Background: two or three times a year, I travel to conferences for work.  I'm usually gone for about a week.  I can miss some of these conferences, but missing all of them would be very detrimental to my career.  Since I go all over the world, my husband usually comes with me and we turn the trip into a vacation for the two of us.</p>

<p>Problem: I'm expecting my first child in September and I'm not sure how to handle the travel once the baby arrives.  I have two basic options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Travel without the baby.  Since my husband usually comes along on the trips, this would mean leaving the baby with his grandparents.</p></li>
<li><p>Travel with both the baby and my husband.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My main concern with 1 is that I'll be the baby's primary caregiver, and I'm not sure if he'll feel abandoned if I leave him with someone else, especially when he's very young.  With an older child I could at least explain why I'm leaving and when I'll get home.  My main concern with 2 is that I'm not sure if travelling with a young baby is safe.  For example, my last trip was to India, where mosquito-borne illnesses are an issue.  In addition, the travel can be physically exhausting -- the India trip took twenty hours of flying and a twelve hour time change.</p>

<p>My wife and I are both Christian, so it would stand to reason that we'd raise our son to be Christian as well. However, I don't want to impair his ability to make religious decisions by forcing my views on him. On the other hand, I can't raise him to be an atheist; firstly because I don't hold those views, and also, because that would be no different from raising him to be a Christian.</p>

<p>What's a good way to balance personal religious views and freedom of choice for a child? Should we force him to pray for his food, or at nighttime? Should we pray for him when he's present? Should we take him to church, once he's old enough to stay at home?</p>

"How do you handle poor behavior by other people's children?","<p>I believe that interacting with a variety of other children at social functions is an important part of childhood development.  However, there seem to be a <strong>lot</strong> of children who are... how shall I phrase it?  Undisciplined.</p>

<p>Undisciplined behavior in other children can have direct impact on your child, no matter how well behaved.  Poor behavior in other children can serve as a bad example, or it can result in upset, or even injury, for your child (think chronic hitters, biters, and bullies).</p>

<p>Even normally well-behaved children can have bad moments, too, especially when in a group environment where situations can escalate much more quickly than normal.</p>

<p>However, disciplining other people's children is a potentially touchy subject, especially given the wide range of opinions of child raising ""best practices"".  I know some schools of thought advocate ""never saying no"" to a child, and many advocate very different approaches to setting boundaries.</p>

"How to (or should I even try to) break a zombie fixation for a three-year-old","<p>I have two boys, one eleven, and one three.  I don't know exactly how or when, but the 11-year-old has decided that it was a good idea to explain the the 3-year-old all about zombies.  Of course he left out any meaningful discussions about death, and dying, and the fear thereof.  The 3-year-old was already afraid of dying (a fear which he is steadily overcoming), and has now become much more attached-read clingy-and is afraid that zombies are going to get him.  I have been a little on the fence with this one, where in some instances, I will go along with it as imaginative play, and he and I will go ""Zombie Hunting"", which seems to help him overcome the fear (and its fun), and in other circumstances, I feel compelled to tell him, ""Zombies are not real, your brother is just trying to scare you, it's time to go to bed.""  </p>

<p>I know there is no meaningful way to explain to a three-year-old that monsters and zombies and the like reflect a human fear of death, and of supernatural/unexplained/misunderstood phenomena.  </p>

<p>EDIT: adding details in response to anongoodnurse's question:</p>

<p>This has been continuing for 3-6 months, and occurs morning, noon, and night.  There is a close association to darkness, but Zombies could be behind the curtains at breakfast, in the bathroom all day, in any unfamiliar place (or wherever the parents or groups of people are not) and yes they are almost always in dark places.</p>

<p>EDIT: Refining question.  There are some excellent responses and great food for thought.  I don't think the first part of the question has been addressed, though.  </p>

<p>My question is two-fold: </p>

<p>Does this represent a fear of death/dying.  </p>

<p>Put another way (and with more detail) could this type of fixation resolve to a more general fear of death (which was his preoccupation prior to this, and which he seems to have come to some sort of understanding) that might indicate he really hasn't gotten over his fear or misunderstanding of death?  </p>

<p>Regardless of the answer to the first part, How or should I even try to convince him that zombies aren't real?  </p>

<p>In response to answers and comments, and after some reflection, I don't think it is practical to try stopping him from engaging in the imaginative play ""zombie hunting"".  Additionally, I have concerns about confusion arising from engaging him in this type of play while also stating that zombies aren't real.  However, isn't the basis of imaginative play entertaining thoughts of things we know don't exist?  (I think I have a new question brewing)</p>

<p>This part of the question then becomes, how can I best support him overcome this fear?</p>

"5yr Old Has Trouble With Letters & Reading","<p>My daughter is 5 years old (will be 6 at the end of February) and lately has wanted to learn to read.  However, I've become a bit concerned because it seems as though she has absolutely no memory for letters or words.  We can point to one letter, tell her what it is and what it sounds like, and have her repeat it.  After doing a second letter and going back to the first, she doesn't know it.</p>

<p>Last night a book we were trying to read had the word ""inside"".  I covered part to make just ""i-n"" and we worked through the sounds to get to the word ""in"".  Then I covered that part and we'd work through the sounds to get to the word ""side"".  Then I'd go back to the first and she wouldn't remember it.  I could switch back and forth repeatedly and she never remembered the word.  The word ""inside"" appears repeatedly throughout the book and she never once seemed to remember it, always having to work through it anew.</p>

<p>In the same book, we worked out the word ""going"" -- the only word on the page.  Turn the page and the first word is again ""going"" but she didn't recognize it and we had to sound it out from scratch.</p>

<p>This has me somewhat concerned.  I know that 5-years is still pretty young but this seems wrong.</p>

<p><strong>What it is not:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>She is not ""slow"".  She speaks 3 languages (French, English, German).  She's observant and curious, asking a lot of great ""why"" questions about how the world works.</li>
<li>She's not physically incapable.   She rides a bike and scooter, and skis like nobody's business.  Yesterday she was helping me build a tool-box and had no problem repeatedly putting the wrench on the bolts and tightening them up.</li>
<li>She doesn't seem to have bad eye-sight.  She had no trouble aligning the wrench with the bolts or reading the small, engraved ""10mm"" on the wrench to make sure she had the correct one.</li>
<li>She doesn't seem to have a bad memory in general.  We play games like ""Memory"" or ""Lucky Catch"" (which we lovingly call ""boot to the head"" -- you'll understand if you've played it) and she does quite well.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're planning to take her to an pediatric opthamologist to double-check her eyes and play a few more games while paying more attention to <em>how</em> she plays.</p>

<p><strong>So...  Any ideas on what this is?  Or am I just reading too much into it?</strong></p>

<p>One last piece of information that may or may not be related...  She claims to be having some trouble at school (kindergarten) when she has to touch an icon and drag it from the top of a big screen to the bottom.  All I know is what she has said -- I've never seen the activity myself.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2014-09-24:</strong> My daughter is now 7.5 years and starting grade 2.  When we read together she does quite well; it's rare that she doesn't recognize a world she had to work out just the page before.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2019-05-23:</strong> Now 12, she's doing very well.  She reads easily in both English (<em>Ender's Game</em> at the moment) and French and scores in the high 90's on reading comprehension tests.  Her biggest struggle is that she has to understand everything so words that she doesn't know frustrate her and can inhibit her desire to read.  She won't just ignore the word, leaving the rest of the words to communicate the the idea.  This is not inconsistent with the rest of her personality.  :-)</p>

  The opening is wide enough now (approx 10 cm), which is wide enough to
  bring the baby's head out side, but the issue is before that opening
  the passage is very narrow as the two bones are very close and it is
  impossible to widen the gap between these two bones- shall we apply
  force there?. If we force the baby to come out through this passage,
  we fear that we might damage the baby's brain. also we cannot wait any
  more because the baby is now not in the fluid, we broke that while
  trying for normal delivery. so we are going for operation now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The doctors also gave the lady some injections for giving her pains-induced delivery.<br>
The lady said she felt immense pain because of this.</p>

<p>Also the lady had gone for ultrasound several times, and the doctor herself said everything was normal.   </p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why are cases of normal delivery reducing day by day. Till about 10 to 15 yrs back we used to hardly hear about birth by operations. But now this is very common. </p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that the doctors might go for operation because it is easier for them (i.e  for doctors), and they can make more money?</p></li>
<li><p>Up to what extent the doctors argument about the proportionally narrow passage can be true? Is there no way to bypass/avoid/widen this passage? Why such cases were not prevalent 10-15 years back? </p></li>
<li><p>The induced delivery pain is more than the normal pain?</p></li>
<li><p>Post birth the mother and the baby  both are fine. But what are the risk involved post operation, and what best can be done to avoid such births in  future (e.g some exercises?).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I can see something fishy in Doctors arguments (though, I am not a biology student). </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> 
One of the argument I am getting from the first 4 answers is: ""now a days bigger babies are born as compared to earlier, while the women hips are not widening at that proportion"" and thus c-section is the only way for delivery in most cases.  Can someone please put some authentic references in support of this argument?    In fact I have read the opposite that 100s of years back people used be taller as compared to now, and they lived longer.</p>

"How Much Hallowe'en Candy?","<p>My kids have been out for the night and returned each with a big bag of candy.  My wife and I are wondering the best rules for the consumption of such.</p>

<p>In the past we've set limits of letting them have one after each meal but I know some parents let them eat as much as they want, telling them that when it's gone, it's gone and if they get sick, to don't go complaining about it -- might as well learn lessons about over-eating at an early age.</p>

<p>What <em>facts</em> are there to support either of these two policies, or any other policy for that matter?</p>

<p><strong>Follow-Up:</strong>  Thanks everyone for all the information.  FYI, here's what we decided:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can eat as much or as little as you want.</li>
<li>You can only eat it directly after a healthy and balanced lunch/dinner -- not breakfast, not snacks.</li>
<li>Any eating of candy outside these times will result in immediate and permanent confiscation of all remaining candy.  <em>(My son actually asked, ""Will we get the bag back for next year?"")</em></li>
<li>You must brush your teeth well as soon as you're finished after which no more candy.</li>
<li>When it's gone, it's gone.  No asking the other if you can have some.</li>
<li>If you eat so much that you get sick or a tummy-ache, don't be complaining about it -- learn from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funny thing...  My kids (boy=8y, girl=5y) are already talking about how they're only going to eat one or two at at time to make it last.  I <em>really</em> love kids!  &lt;tearing up&gt;</p>

"How to teach your toddler to pronounce old words correctly?","<p>My 2-year-old is now capable of making certain phonetic sounds that he wasn't able to when he first started speaking.</p>

<p>For many words, he's adjusted his pronunciation slightly as he's used them more often, and we've not had to do any training. For other words, he continues to use the old, incorrect pronunciations despite his apparent ability to do otherwise. We tend to rely on repeating back complete sentences with proper pronunciations, or just having conversations where we slip in the target words, rather than doing any explicit <em>correcting</em>.</p>

<p>Specific examples:<br>
He calls Captain America ""Cappa Nappa"". But, if I ask him say the words more slowly, I can get a ""Cappin Uh-merta"", which is closer and we're very happy with it. </p>

<p>When he first started referring to the TV he called it the ""Deet"" (a ""word"" he also used for other things). He can now say something like ""Tee wee"" or ""Tee fee"", but now he'll just say ""Watch movie"" or ""Watch show"", opting not to say TV at all.</p>

<p>We know he can pronounce the words better, but seems to be attached to the older pronunciations. This may just be because the older pronunciation is physically easier for him to say, or because we understand him well enough with his improper pronunciation, it's simply habit, or most likely a combination of all of those.</p>

<p><strong>How can I effectively coach, train, and/or encourage my child to pronounce words in a new way, now that he's physically and/or cognitively able to make new sounds?</strong></p>

<p>Or</p>

<p><strong>How can I effectively teach my child to stop using their ""nonsense words"" and instead use the real words they're now capable of saying, when they have a strong personal preference to avoid the real words?</strong></p>

<p>In our case, I feel that our son has demonstrated his ability to do better, but <em>chooses</em> not to because it <em>is</em> more challenging for him. I want to encourage him to try and tackle more challenging tasks.</p>

<p>We're very happy with his language development, and are more amused by or endeared to his mispronunciations than anything. But, I feel there are certain words we could more actively work on. Language is one of his primary learning activities, and I'd like to set the stage so that he's accustomed to having small challenges. </p>

"How to communicate with tiger parents?","<p>I know some <a href=""http://www.apadivisions.org/division-7/publications/newsletters/developmental/2013/07/tiger-parenting.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">tiger parents</a> who put extremely high pressure on their children, for example, they applied many extra curricular activities, tutorials for their kids and made them very busy. Their children had lose their childhood and it's not good for their development.</p>

<p>But their parents think that it's good for them, it let them grow faster, know more and pushed their children to their limits.</p>

<p>So how should I communicate with those people?</p>

<p>I tried talking to them but most of them are not open-minded, so it's a bit difficult to communicate.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edited</p>

<p>When I took a look at the answers, people might think it's OK for those parents as long as their children feels good, yes, I totally agree with that, but here's an example: (Happened yesterday)</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first day of the book fair, and also summer holiday starts, some of the parents used several thousand dollars just to buy exercise books for their kids for this summer, I agree that learning is important and is a must for children, but the problem is: is this necessary to have that much exercise for them?</p>

<p>Another example happened last month:</p>

<p>Some parents have their children applied for many extra curricular activities: e.g. Monday Piano, Tuesday Singing, Wednesday Swimming + Tutorial, Thursday Tutorial, Friday another extra curricular activities and same for saturday and sunday. When I talk to their parents, I notice their children's emotion, he's already very tired and was even forced by the parent to say ""I'm happy"". So I think it's a bit too much for a kid even though I agreed learning is very important for kid.</p>

<p>Also, some kids even started tutorial when they're one year old, they started to learn writing, isn't it a bit early??</p>

"When your child says something embarrassing in public... how do you deal with it?","<p>So our 3 year old son is both talkative and imaginative, but hasn't necessarily learned all the social decorum that comes with age/experience and social development. There's been a number of embarrassing situations/social faux-pas that we've just about explained away, but sometimes it is pretty difficult.</p>

<p>As an example, we were in the photo printing shop waiting for our prints and my son exclaimed ""Look daddy, a witch!"". As I looked around he was pointing straight at a bedraggled-looking middle-aged lady whose hair was unkempt but was probably just having a 'bad hair day'. I calmly walked him around to the opposite side of the shop, crouched down to his level and said ""I can't see a witch, but there's a picture of a dragon on the wall"". He protested ""no daddy, over there, with the green boots"" (luckily out of earshot). I asked him ""does she have a Broomstick, a Cauldron, and a Cat?"", to which he replied 'No' and accepted she couldn't be a witch, then.</p>

<p>On this occasion, some quick thinking diffused any further awkwardness or upset.</p>

"How to deal with 5 year old stepson's view on me?","<p>I'm glad I found this forum. Maybe you can help me!</p>

<p>I'm 31 years old and have for the past 12 months been living with my girlfriend and her five year old son. I have known them for nearly three years. I moved in with them and then rented my own flat out to a friend.</p>

<p>On paper everything is great. My girlfriend is pregnant and we'll have a baby in February. I can't wait! Her son really likes me as a stepdad and says that I'm the funniest one to play with. I love both him and my girlfriend who is an openminded girl and just everything I have been looking for my whole life.</p>

<p>The thing is that I'm having personal issues with a few things that stresses me a lot and that I don't know how to handle them:</p>

<p><strong>I miss my dad!</strong> Sometimes when my stepson is at bed in the evening he cries and says that he ""misses his father"". His biological father lives in another country. They have only seen eachother maybe 20 times on Skype. They don't even speak the same language so my girlfriend has to translate their (very short) conversations. I'm a great stepdad, but I still get the thought of ""am I good enough?"".</p>

<p><strong>Mom only!</strong> My stepson can be very ""mom-sick"". He's never allowed me reading him a story before bedtime. Sometimes his mom has to help him with something and DEFINITELY NOT me. These things are very normal for every child (even with both biological parents present), but it still hurts my heart because I really love this kid.</p>

<p><strong>Am I a guest?</strong> The other day I heard him say that my girlfriend is the one looking out for him - and not me because I'm looking out for my own family (my parents and sibblings). This hurts because does he just see me as a funny guest or what?!</p>

<p><strong>I feel trapped!</strong> I know this is how it is when having a family, but I genuinely feel that a lot is on their terms. I moved into THEIR home, I wake up when THEY wake up, I eat when THEY eat, I can't play video games until the KID sleeps. I feel like their world is perfect, but not mine.</p>

<p>These are the main things that in one combination hurts and stresses me. I really don't know how to tackle it. My mood and emotions can go from top in a whole week to bottom in a few minutes, especially when I get a gentle ""reminder"" of what my place is in the house.</p>

<p>I get in a vicious circle and I see only the bad things!</p>

<p>I have several times spoken with my girlfriend about and she supports me, but mostly I'm just making conclusions on my own and that's not healthy of me because sometimes I don't see the bigger picture. Deep down inside I know that my stepson in time will see and appreciate that I have been a great father to him, but it's hard to give so much love without getting much back.</p>

"Child will only sleep while being held - 6 mo","<p>TL;DR: My son will sleep fine on his bed for about 3-4 hours then will only sleep if held. How do I fix this if we aren't wanting to go through Cry It Out?</p>

<p>Loads of context:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>my son is 6 months old</p></li>
<li><p>sleeps on a floor matress in his own room</p></li>
<li><p>not yet mobile</p></li>
<li><p>can roll from belly to back, but not visa versa (yet!)</p></li>
<li><p>sleeps almost exclusively on belly</p></li>
<li><p>can sleep for 8 hours without nursing</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The history:
He was sleeping >8 hours on his own and without waking to nurse. Or might wake 3-4 hours in and be easily put back down after being held a few minutes. Both parents caught a cold and my son had a bad sleep night, and we let him sleep on us. Since then (3 weeks) he has refused to sleep unless held when he wakes up. He started waking up after about 1-2 hours, then we discovered he was teething. We have given acetaminophen or ibuprofen as directed but he still wakes 3-4 hours in and requires cuddles to sleep and wakes up upon being put on his mattress. Additional doses of acetaminophen (after 4 hours) have only helped once, allowing us to get him to sleep on his mattress again. Ibuprofen lasts 8 hours, so no additional doses were given.</p>

<p>Questions:
Should we treat this as part of teething that he will grow out of, or as a behavior that we have taught him and must train him to change? Or both...</p>

<p>If training, what methods would you suggest, considering that we are not up for pure Cry It Out </p>

"How do you operate a successful ""Star Chart""?","<p>So, one of the techniques for improving behaviour that you often hear about is the ""star chart"". You put the focus on good behaviour by adding stars (I nearly said ""badges"") for the good stuff and when the row is complete the child gets a reward.</p>

<p>We're going to start one off tomorrow but my kids are between 5 and 8 and so the reward has to be a big one to be meaningful to them and to keep them engaged. So we have this nice treat lined up for when they've filled 15 or 25 stars or something like that.</p>

<p>I figure on listing under the chart the kinds of behaviour which will earn a star (""getting dressed promptly on school days"", ""fighting less"", ""helping lay the table"" and plenty more besides). They're starting to read now so it'll help to remind all of us what behaviour we're looking for.</p>

<p>I guess my question is, how to make the goals concrete for the children? What we're trying to achieve is <strong>sustained</strong> reduction in fighting, <strong>consistently less</strong> nagging required at getting dressed time, <strong>regular</strong> help with laying the table etc. Awarding a star for just a single instance of getting dressed promptly is pointless, since it already happens from time to time. We're not looking for one-offs.</p>

<p>On the other hand saying x has got to occur 10 times or 5 days in a row, or at least 4 times in one week, in order to earn a star, well, it's just too unmanageable. People will lose count.</p>

<p>Any better ideas? </p>

"Financial Situation - Second Child","<p>At present stage, my partner and I have a 6 month old child and are financially fine (not living a lavish life, just getting by). My partner wants a second child, and my only concern is financially if it's possible, and if others have experience in the matter. </p>

<p>Of course, the entire expense of a toddler is beyond me at this stage, as my child is still very young. I have had a look at the finances we currently have and I do not believe it would be a wise decision, but again, these are estimations:</p>

<pre><code>Income
  Salary Fortnightly: $1,609.34 ($38,624.16 yearly)
   Note: No Government assistance is taken into account at this stage

Expenses
  Netflix (Monthly): $20.00 ($240.00 a year)
  Internet (Monthly): $99.00 ($1,188.00 a year)
  Rent (Weekly): $365.00 ($18,980.00 a year)
  Groceries (Fortnightly): $300.00 ($7,200.00 a year)
  Electricity (Quarterly): $350.00 ($1,400.00 a year assumed)
  Water (Quarterly): $250.00  ($1,000.00 a year assumed)
  Car (Weekly): $100.00 ($5,200.00 per year, not taking into account servicing and parts)
  Fuel (Weekly): $50.00 ($2,600.00 per year assumed)
  Phone  (Monthly): $100.00 ($1,140.00 per year)
</code></pre>

<p>For clarification, I live in Brisbane, Queensland - Australia.</p>

<p>Of course there are things that can be mitigated (electricity, water, Netflix) but there are also a number of expenses not on this; baby nappies, clothes, shoes, doctors, medicine, toys etc. that are under the ""$150.00/w grocery allowance"". </p>

<p>Running with these numbers, I would find myself to be over-expended by $323.84, which is a safe number to assume family tax would be more (Present stage we're getting $56.00 per week). Running under the assumption my partner would get a part time / full time job would mitigate some expenses further; higher family tax, but also the incursion of daycare. </p>

<p>My biggest concern here is whilst trying to have a second child and completing the family, we're not correctly equipped financially to support our child. The first two years of his life would be quite a struggle as we'd not want him/her in day care by then. </p>

<p>Whilst I understand that <em>logically</em> the numbers are indicative that it should not be done, I was wondering how others are able to do it (if possible), and if they've lived off less an income? I do want another child, and I would of course find a secondary job, but what other factors would one take into consideration with this move? </p>

<p>My partners suggestion would be that it's best to get the second child out of the way, when they're both close in age, and we then work on both chasing our careers once they're in day care. Sounds fair, but that's a hell of a tight budget to accommodate. </p>

<p>FWIW: I did not post this in Finances as it's not <em>entirely</em> about that. I mean, a second job shouldn't be too hard to come by, it's more a question of as a parent, and starting a family, is it safe/a good move?</p>

"4 month old waking frequently during first half of the night","<p>I have two questions. Firstly is it true that baby should have the deepest sleep in the first half of night? My 4 month old baby used to have a 4-5 hours sleep after I put her to bed from 6:30pm to around 11:00pm. She seems sleeps better before midnight and then wakes up 2/3 times from midnight to morning. But recently she would wake up crying every 5 min before midnight. Most of the time from 10:30pm, last night from 8:30pm. Every time she wakes up me or my habby goes in to bounce her back to sleep. She will fall back to sleep very quickly(she seems to be very sleepy) but wakes up again in just a short time. We try hold her and rock her after she's asleep and that can only get us for up to 10 minutes sleep. (I rock her and hold her for all her naps, she won't sleep on the bed during the day) She will keep waking up and cry. It feels like something bothering her. I thought it might be teething pain or gas pain or too cold or warm. But after midnight she can sleep for three hours in one go. And a bit more peacefully. Is there any particular cause for baby wakes up only first half of the night?  </p>

<p>Some background information, She's having two night feeds at 12:30 and 3:30am. She has three to four naps a day. The naps are from 50min to 2.5hrs. In total she naps for 4-4.5hrs. Her bed time normally around 6:30pm to 6:30am. </p>

<p>Second question is after midnight if she wakes up completly for some reason(I didn't attend to her in time when she wakes up hugry) she won't settle back to sleep for an hour! She will talk to herself or moving around or sucking her feast. If I try bounce her back to sleep she will keep moving and talking. She just won't sleep. If this happens around five it can last for even longer. Is this because she sleeps too much? I tried different bedtime. I found her happily go to bed at 6:30pm. If it's too early or late it takes a lot longer to settle her. Also I found if she wakes up before 6:30 she will look tired and catnapping whole day. I tried to lengthen her waking time during the day(currently around an hour) but she will be shutting and cranky if I don't settle her to sleep. </p>

<p>Please help. </p>

"Son screams in crib at the top of his lungs until Mom comes in","<p>My toddler son has recently discovered how to scream at the top of his lungs, it seems.  It sounds like he's being murdered or something.  When he cries and wants something, he does this usually now.  He's about 16 months old and this started about a week ago.</p>

<p>Also about the same time he started waking up constantly at night when nobody is with him.  We've actually had him sleeping in his own room in his crib since he was about 8 months old and it's never been a big issue (occasional wake-ups, especially when teething, but nothing major).</p>

<p>We did a little traveling right before Christmas time, so he slept in the same room as us in a crib provided by the hotel.  I'm not sure if this has anything to do with his sudden attachment to having us in the same room.</p>

<p>As of 2 nights ago, he only will be quiet and lay back down if his mother is the one who comforts him.  I used to be able to, but not any more.  </p>

<p>By ""comfort"" I mean, just be present in the same room as him.  As soon as he sees either of us (well now just her) he would lay down, close his eyes and go to sleep.  This makes me think that he's not in pain or sick or anything, but I could be wrong.</p>

<p>I've never gotten angry with him, but last night I found myself yelling at the top of my lungs partially out of anger and frustration but also just to get my voice over his and I finally had to just walk out of the house.  I don't know what has changed with him.  We had a few nights back in town (since traveling for xmas) where he was fine by himself in his crib.  </p>

<p><strong>summary / tl;dr;</strong> in the last week my son developed the following annoying behaviors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Screams at the top of his lungs</li>
<li>Needs someone in the room with him while he sleeps (and has an uncanny ability to detect when we're not there and wake up)</li>
<li>The last 2 nights he has only responded positively (by shutting the h*ll up) when his mom is the one to enter the room.</li>
</ul>

<p>A couple other things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>We noticed him tugging on his left ear today during the day.  I thought possibly it was an ear infection, but I haven't noticed him doing it at all at night while this mayhem is occurring. </li>
<li>I think he might be teething (he seems to always be teething and it's usually pretty manageable with some Tylenol - but that's not preventing him from waking and screaming his head off)</li>
<li>I haven't gotten angry with him besides tonight, and I can't think of anything that would have changed that is making him demand Mom only.  We usually take turns but the last 2 nights it's been her only because if I enter the room it's just as bad, if not worse, than before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anybody know what I can do to calm this behavior?  Or what I can do to help my wife?  Or what could be causing such a behavior? </p>

<p>Btw, it's 7am right now and we've hardly slept more than an hour maybe tonight.  He's screaming as I type this and somehow my wife has slept through it (pure exhaustion is my guess), but if I go there it changes nothing.  At worst, he was waking up about 5 minutes or less after she leaves the room.  There was one point tonight where he maintained his sleep for about 1.5 hours straight but he just woke up a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

"Should I push my parents to divorce?","<p>My father suffers from depression, my mother and I constantly try to help him.<br>
Five years ago my grandmother, that is his mother, unexpectedly died, and my grandfather's Alzheimer's became evident. 
His disease got considerably worse this year, to the point he talks no more, seemingly remembers nothing, doesn't follow a conversation and stays most of the time at bed. Heartbreaking for anyone, let alone my father.</p>

<p>He hadn't been able to accept his situation and her death for a while, but now he kind of has. However, he does try to ignore death, for example he let my mother go to a funeral instead of him, even if the not too close relative was actually his, and asked her nothing when she came back.</p>

<p>After what happened, he is experiencing a strong fear of loss. 
Of losing me, now that I moved to a big city to study. 
Terrorism added to the mix (we live in Europe), and when I went (regardless of coming back very often and texting and calling every day), he fell into depression, losing weight too. </p>

<p>A year passed and perhaps he's better physically, but he is still very anxious, still doesn't have a reasonable picture of reality. He still hardly laughs to jokes. He still doesn't live well.
And obviously it's hard for my mother too. Some months ago we managed to convince him to see a psychiatrist (how hard it was!), though unfortunately it seems the dosage might not be adequate. Well, I hope it's a matter of dosage.</p>

<p>Apart from the juvenile infatuation, I remember that when I was a grown up kid they never were a lovely couple, often argued, but sometimes they had fun together. 
With his depression, things got worse. They certainly haven't exchanged the words ""I love you"" for years, no kisses either. He pretty much has lost the will to do stuff, to enjoy life. He lives in his own world where he has a terrible job (false), makes terrible sacrifices (false) and has to anxiously check if I'm right. My mother is being left out.
He almost never makes compliments to her and almost always nitpicks about things.</p>

<p>He even forgot her last birthday! In the evening he noticed she were grumpy, and she told him why. He apologized, sure, but obviously he should have remedied his mistake the day after with some special thing, and obviously he did nothing!
Unfortunately I learnt about this with their latest argument. </p>

<p>It started because of a related TV promotion, when she stimulated him about necessity of enjoying life, and he rapidly got mad, saying once again the world is too dangerous for not being anxious. After a while my mother made her suffering clear, mentioning her birthday, and he dismissed what she said and replied that was an unimportant mistake, and that she is awful for not forgiving him. He proceeded saying he had never forgotten before (which is true, but didn't get a decent enough present for her 50th two years ago) and that she shouldn't tease him, but be nice to him and help him not to be afraid. </p>

<p>Seeing he didn't recognize her patience and her help, she reminded him the very last time she encouraged him to keep calm; my father got mad as if she were accusing him of having been too worried that time, while he allegedly was just making sure of things. Moral of the story: he didn't recognize her care.</p>

<p>In 3 months it's been at least 3 times my mother told him the situation has become critical, with them being unable to understand each other, and said they should not remain together if nothing is left but suffering. He always replied giving her ""freedom of action"".
But they have been together for more than 25 years and they have me, it is a very hard decision.</p>

<p>Deep inside I think she still loves him, and she definitely cares for him, she feels compassion for his situation. 
But she's starting to cede. On the other hand, he probably doesn't love her anymore, and his depression minimized his affection. They might have divorced, had I not been here. I'm quite confused.</p>

<p>Should I talk more insistently to my father even if he doesn't listen to me, or should I push my mother to divorce? Or should I wait for the dosage to be increased?</p>

"Guilt as a natural consequence of bad/wrong behaviour","<p>We all know that natural consequences is the best tool when dealing with inappropriate behaviour. However, one of natural consequences of doing something bad to another person is feeling guilty for what you have done. </p>

<p>My intuition tells me that <strong>guilt cannot be used as discipline tool</strong>, so my first question is: <strong>am I right?</strong> I have an impression that using guilt as a form of punishment leads to children having pshychological problems, and even neurosis. But I have never seen proper studies about it, so I would be grateful, if you could recommend me some, if it's really true.</p>

<p>My second question is more practical. How can I <strong>help a child to overcome the feeling of guilt?</strong> I don't say the children don't need to feel guilty at all, but there must be a moment when they get over it, and an adult should be there to help.</p>

<p>Note: this question might seem a bit too abstract, because I am asking it in advance. My child is only three, so it's still unrelevant to her. But I feel that the answer will be useful for me in future.</p>

<p>Edit: I am very grateful for the answers explaining the difference between guilt and shame. Don't you think that these feelings are mixed in a child? I am also concerned about sensitive children, those who do not need to be told twice and tend to analyse their behaviour a lot.</p>

<p>I also doubt the effectiveness of feeling guilty to prevent repetition of bad behaviour, as it doesn't fade of quickly enough and one can get used to it. </p>

"How can I persuade a preschooler to wear a suit?","<p>A few month ago, I asked: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/19696/can-i-avoid-nice-clothing-being-a-source-of-argument"">Can I avoid nice clothing being a source of argument?</a> That was mainly focused on my eight year old, and now I have a related question... but about a preschooler.</p>

<hr>

<p>Our youngest (three and a half) only wants to wear about five shirts, all t-shirts with dogs on them. Any other t-shirts (e.g. dinosaurs, trains) are rejected as ""too fancy""* and are only worn after a lot of arguing or negotiating. An actually ""fancy"" shirt (with a collar, either polo or button-down) is rejected and leads to incredible tantrums if we try to push the issue; I once suggested he could wear a tie and he nearly exploded.</p>

<p>Since he's a preschooler, this has not yet been a major problem: we don't go many ""fancy"" places anyway, and there are different standards for acceptable clothing for young kids in a lot of situations. But, <strong>he's been asked to be the ring bearer</strong> in my cousin's wedding. If we accept, the event is going to require a suit.</p>

<p><strong>I have no idea <em>how</em> to get him interested in the idea of dressier clothing.</strong> We have two months to prepare: what can I try to make him more open to different, ""fancy"" clothes?</p>

<hr>

<p>* I feel it's important to note that <em>neither parent</em> defined these shirts as fancy: it's an adjective that he decides how and when to use, and we have a tough time predicting when it will be an issue. (I would not, on my own, decide that a bicycle t-shirt is fancier than a doggy t-shirt.) I'm also unclear on why fancy is a bad thing, but that's the implication he makes.</p>

"What are the legal, emotional, and/or behavioral repercussions of confiscating money as a punishment?","<p><sup>Let's assume I'm a parent and that I use this punishment, for the sake of the question.</sup></p>

<p>The primary punishment I use to discipline my children is to confiscate money. It seems fairly effective in preventing them from repeating behaviors, as they only misbehave the same way once or twice after I repeatedly take their money. While I don't keep the amounts of money consistent, to throw them off, I typically take $1 for every time they:</p>

<ul>
<li>use inappropriate language</li>
<li>refuse to do chores (persistently)</li>
<li>act mildly rude</li>
</ul>

<p>And a bit more when they:</p>

<ul>
<li>hit one another</li>
<li>act excessively rude</li>
<li>turn in late/missing assignments (children are homeschooled)</li>
</ul>

<p>The most I've ever taken was $25 because I asked my daughter to walk to an activity after being quite rude and she refused.</p>

<p>For reference, none of the children have any steady income (oldest is 13). The younger ones receive most of their money from allowance, the older from yard work/babysitting.</p>

<p>So while this punishment is effective and they usually apologize/repent for their behavior, I'm not sure of the downsides of it. Are there any possible behavioral, emotional, or legal repercussions? For example, if one of my children were to tell another adult about my punishment, would I get in trouble? Or could it cause lasting resentment towards me?</p>

<p>This is the easiest disciplining method I've ever used, but I don't want to continue taking their money if it's going to cause problems. Any thoughts? I'm looking for any criticisms you might have.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern, we currently reside in the Portland area of Oregon.</p>

"How to handle disobediant children as non-parental authority figure","<p>I volunteer with children regularly, usually very young preschool or toddler age.  One of the common issues I have noticed is that handling disobeying children can become complicated when your the authority figure trusted with the child, but in a volunteer format where exact expectations from parents are unclear.</p>

<p>For example, I once was a teacher aid for sunday school class for preschool age children, and I was the one responsible for handling distractions and problematic children so the teacher could focus on her lesson.  These kids were so young, with no experience with this sort of format, and so we had a decent number of issues with kids just not knowing what the rules were they were suppose to follow.</p>

<p>Most of the time simple corrections would be all it took, maybe taking away a toy.  However, what happens if a child refuses to give me a toy, or if I tell two fighting kids to sit in opposite corners to separate them and one refuses to do so?</p>

<p>With a kid in my family I would physically take the toy, or carry them to where they need to be.  However, I don't know what the parents' opinion will be of my using physical force to control their children.  I'm already a male , which sadly means I have to watch my every action due to idiotic prejudice about men working with kids, so I'm afraid of any risk of being seen overstepping my boundaries.</p>

<p>One child I remember fondly was not a bad kid, but was hyperactive (ADHD), had a desperate desire for attention, even if negative, and did not yet understand why his acting out in class was a problem.  He was a real nightmare of distraction, running away just so someone would have to chase him because he thought it was fun, doing stuff to force me to give him attention to make him stop etc. He could easily single handled prevent any lesson from being taught if left unchecked. </p>

<p>Ultimately I managed to work out a policy of giving lots of positive attention whenever possible, and making 'discipline' from acting out as boring as possible for him; it worked pretty well actually, and his mother told us she was very pleased with the progress he made with us, to the point she felt ready to put him into school a year earlier.  However, part of handling him meant (very short) time outs for misbehaving where I would have to sit beside him (while pointedly giving no interesting attention to him) to stop him when he inevitably tried to get up and run away from the char (which happened multiple times per time-out originally).  The first time we used this timeout policy I had to physically stop him probably a dozen times in just a few minutes.</p>

<p>I had the mother's defacto permission in this case; however, I don't know how I would have handled this child if I didn't have explicit permission to physically restrain him if needed.  I could see some overbearing parents being quite displeased with the same course of action I used with this child if I hadn't gotten express permission.</p>

<p>So my question is how do you handle these situations as a defacto-authority figure?  How do you know where the limit of the authority afforded to you by the parents are, and when they would consider it crossed.  And what methods do I have to deal with infractions, including fighting between children, which really can't be ignored, if the child won't cooperate with me and I don't know what authority I have?</p>

"How can I ensure my 14-year old's safety on a major trip away from home?","<p>Brace yourselves, it's going to be a long one... I hope this is an acceptable question here; if not I wonder if the Interpersonal Skills board might take it?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: My 14-year old daughter wants to visit a young man I've never met who lives a significant distance from us. I'm reasonably confident it's safe because of context, but I want to know how I can be more certain.</p>

<p>I'm a single mother with a 14-year old daughter, who we'll call Lydia. A few years ago (think when Lydia was 11-12), we had an older (17-18) female friend (call her Ella) who she'd met at school babysit for her after school while I was still at work. Ella became a good friend to Lydia, and I trust her (Ella).</p>

<p>I assume they hung out together at school as well, as over the summer holidays 2016, Lydia started mentioning some of Ella's friends in idle conversation. Fast forward slightly: she started talking to one of these friends (Ella's age, and we'll call him Oliver) on Facebook. They've met in person a few times, both with and without Ella present, so I'm confident that at least he's a real person who is who he claims to be.</p>

<p>For better or worse, Ella dropped out of our lives when she left school and went to university. Oliver didn't (drop out of our lives that is) - Lydia continued talking to him online and they have a good friendship. Lydia is having a number of mental health issues that she won't talk to me about (I think I've reacted the wrong way to them previously so she won't trust me with them any more, but that's another issue), but she talks to Oliver about them and says he's really helped her.</p>

<p>The current situation: Oliver is at university around 100 miles away from us (""us"" being in London). Recently, Lydia brought up to me the idea of going to see him for a day or potentially a weekend. I hope some other parents on this board can see why I'm nervous about that.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to allow her to go, because I think it would help her and make her happier, but I'm still not entirely without concern. The journey itself is not a concern: it's not a difficult trip by train, I could take her to the station one end and Oliver could pick her up at the other. However, while I'm reasonably sure that Oliver is who he claims to be and Lydia would be safe, I've never personally met him, which makes me nervous.</p>

<p>How can I talk to Lydia about this? What can I do to allay my own fears? Going with her is out of the question - she would rather not go than have me with her. What other options are there?</p>

"Impact of moving to Germany with a stepson and a toddler with signs of autism","<p>I live in the midwestern U.S. with my wife, my 8 year old stepson and our 2 year old son who shows signs of and is undergoing therapy for autism. The company I work for just offered to relocate us to their headquarters in Germany for a period of 2-4 years. My wife and I love it there and have daydreamed about spending more time abroad, and it would be an excellent career opportunity. <strong>No one can make this decision except us</strong> and I'm not looking for a recommendation. I am seeking wisdom from other parents on what kinds of issues we should be thinking about to make this decision, pros and cons, or general opinions and advice on some of the specific issues to aid in our decisionmaking.</p>

<ul>
<li>My stepson visits his biological father every other weekend and they have a positive relationship. He pays child support and we would need to reach an agreement with him, maybe involving allocating the support money toward travel expenses to send him back a couple times a year. He also has two half-brothers who he sees at his dad's.</li>
<li>Our 2 year old is ""presumed autistic"" (our doctor won't officially diagnose it until age 2 1/2). He has serious language and behavioral delays. We're set up with local resources that provide 1-on-1 therapy sessions for language and behavioral development and have been doing this for about a month.</li>
<li>My wife quit her job last fall and has been staying home with the kids and plans to continue to do this whether or not we move.</li>
</ul>

<p>So naturally, some things we have to think about are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How would a move to a foreign country affect our younger son's development? Would being exposed to a foreign language impair his development even more or is there a potential it could actually help?</li>
<li>How would the older son react to moving so far away from his biological father? He and I have a wonderful relationship as well, he loves, trusts and respects me, we have bonded very deeply and he has adapted very well to having a dad and a stepdad. Would a change like this ruin a good thing and plant seeds of discontent, resentment, regret, ... where there don't seem to be any now?</li>
<li>We can see this as an amazing life experience for the kids - we can always come back in a few years if we want and the trip would expose them to lots of culture and history they wouldn't get otherwise. Or we can also see it as taking them away from a life experience they're already used to and happy with.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for any thoughts and talking points you might have. For the purposes of this question we can ignore issues of finance or logistics. I'll be posting a similar question on Travel.SE about some logistics questions and will add a link here when I do; but here I'm chiefly concerned with the kids and the impact this decision might have on our family.</p>

"How do you tell if a toddler is lactose intolerant?","<p>Our daughter was breast-fed until about 1 year-old, with a variety of table foods as she got older.  During this time she would ocassionally get skin rashes, but we didn't think much of it.</p>

<p>When she turned 1, we started her on whole milk, and a normal balanced diet.  In the 6 months since then, she is averaging about one ear infection per month, and has chronically dry skin.  </p>

<p>She got ear tubes, but she continues to get regular ear infections.  Now her doctors are recommending adenoid removal.  Before we go to that, we want to consider that both the skin trouble and ear infections might be allergic reactions.  The most likely allergy seems to be dairy products.  We've started her on soy milk, and she's gotten another ear infection since then.  But we haven't tried completely eliminating dairy from her diet (because that is very hard to do!)</p>

<p>Are there any reliable ways to tell if she is having a reaction to dairy products?  If we were able to completely eliminate dairy from her diet for some time, should we expect the skin trouble and ear infections to completely go away (assuming they were are a reaction to dairy)?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: We've had our daughter on no dairy for about a month now.  Her skin has been about the same, and she's gotten her usual monthly ear infection.  We are now pretty confident that she doesn't have an issue with dairy.  To confirm that, we plan to heavily reintroduce dairy to her diet.  Assuming no noticable changes at that point, we'll assume she's good.</p>

"How to persuade my father to stop physically abusing my mother?","<p>In summary: I am the daughter. My mother is being domestically abused by my father. What can I do to make him stop <strong>without hurting my mother in any way? - she still loves him!</strong></p>

<p>Details: My father is a very abusive character. When I was a child, he used to go into 'rage' modes where he would just beat the life out of my mother. Trying to interfere would only get me enough injuries to not be able to go to school for the next week. As he got older, the rages got fewer but he would still lash out randomly. I'm not talking about the odd slap to the face kind of abuse - I am talking about the kind of abuse that lasts for up to 20 minutes, and renders my mother bloody and swollen and not able to walk for days. Growing up it was extremely painful (physically and mentally) for me and I still wake up from the nightmares. I was terrified of him - I think I've spoken about 15 words with him my entire life.</p>

<p>I moved out when I was 18, reasoning that I could get my mother to come live with me, but she refuses to go anywhere without him. </p>

<p>The last time I went to visit, they started an argument and I interfered and told my dad to back off.  He started yelling things at my mother saying she's been training me to go against him, and I wound up backing off at the request of my mother.</p>

<p>I would very much like to file a complaint against him but that would just make things worse for my mother - she wants to be with my father (and I don't understand her) and furthermore, if I do file a complaint, I am sure I will never be able to see my mother again.</p>

<p>I have thought of this so much for the past week that I am hopeless and see no way forward. I even considered paying him some cash every month, almost a bribe to not fight with my mother.</p>

<p>Can you think of any way I can put an end to this without hurting my father's ego so it wouldn't create any more consequences? If only I can find a way to persuade him to not physically abuse my mother...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I moved out to a different country as soon as I could (that's how much distance I wanted between us) and though I now live in a better place, my mother still lives in a third world country where help for cases like this is not readily available - certainly no helpline that I can find online, but a legal action may be a possibility.</p></li>
<li><p>During the times when ""arranged marriage"" was the only acceptable type of marriage, my parents loved each other and, naturally, their parents / family did not agree to that, so they had to do the ""runaway marriage"" - because of this, neither my mother's family nor my father's family are now in contact with any of us. So getting family members involved is not an option.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for answering, I was just hopeful that maybe there is a way.. a strategy.. or something I could to to intervene. Looks like professional help is the way to go, though I am scared of that route.</p>

"What should be done when your child wakes up from a nap and is extremely irritable?","<p>We have a daughter who takes naps and (usually) wakes up extremely cranky and irritable. She is 1 month away from being 3. Because she is so irritable, she'll usually cry when she wakes up. Depending on the day, it can range all the way to 30 straight minutes of crying. But, it's not always like this. Sometimes she'll wake up from a nap and not cry a bit or even be cranky. Usually we can get her to calm down after 10-15 minutes of crying by doing some playful activity. Or sometimes she'll want something such as to watch a certain TV show, to do a certain activity, a certain food, etc. If we don't(or can't) give her what she wants, that's when the 30 minute crying sessions happen. </p>

<p>We're not really for sure what to do. Instincts tell me that she appears to be crying to manipulate us into getting what she wants, but if this is the case she is extremely stubborn and content with crying until her voice is hoarse. What we've tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>Time out until she is done crying (works about 25% of the time)</li>
<li>Attempt to distract her with something fun or interesting(works about 25% of the time. Most of the time she is just not interested)</li>
<li>Holding her and soothing her until she is done crying (if she wants something, this hardly ever works unless we give it to her though... and it can again take 15-30 minutes for her to calm down when my wife is doing this) </li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the things she requests are things like </p>

<ul>
<li>Candy/junk food</li>
<li>A particular food(other than junk food, such as eggs)</li>
<li>To watch a certain TV show</li>
<li>For us to play with her in her room(when we're trying to get her to eat dinner)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these things are particularly problematic because she usually falls asleep when we are preparing dinner. We usually try to keep her awake, but it's nearly impossible when she wants to take a nap. </p>

<p>What should be done in these instances? Has anyone else experienced their children doing the same thing? </p>

<p>Note: Other than these fits, she's usually pretty well behaved(I'd dare to say better than most toddlers at least) and temper tantrums and the like are handled well with a time out(she even knows when she starts crying to go sit at her time out spot and will usually go there before we even tell her to)</p>

"helping a child deal with a parent who lies","<p>I emphasise that this is a prospective question - I am asking about how to prepare for a situation that has not fully arisen yet. </p>

<p>My wife is emotionally abusive, and while we are currently in a phase of working on our marriage, I think it is most likely that it will end soon. One of the central parts of her abusive behaviour has been gaslighting - denying things she did and accusing me of things I didn't do, while implying that I am mentally ill - and over the past year that has developed into full-blown  lying.  She will act badly and then simply lie about what happened, usually by claiming I did something I never did.</p>

<p>We have two children - an eight year old girl and a four year old son - and I think that so far my wife has not been consistently dishonest with them (though she has done it to our daughter on occasion).  However, as they grow older and begin to challenge her further, I expect her to start using the same tactics on them, unless she works on herself, which currently looks unlikely.</p>

<p>My question is - is there anything I can do to gently teach my kids to trust their own memories and versions of reality (for instance, keeping a journal), to prepare them for this eventuality?  And assuming we do get a divorce, what should I do when the children tell me of episodes like this?  What should I tell the kids?</p>

"Why does this special tune makes my 2.5 year old daughter sad?","<p>A few weeks ago my daughter saw a turtle toy being used by some other kid in kindergarten. She asked us to buy her one too and so just before Christmas, we bought one. This is the kind of turtle toy that you can turn its lights on and then it projects stars on ceiling and can also play different songs/tunes. I guess it is primary function would be to get kid asleep at night. </p>

<p>The next day my wife called me at work and asked if I could get home earlier. Our daughter had been playing this one particular song for almost  two hours and had been crying and calling for me. So I got home as soon as possible and she gave me a big hug and we played a lot together, yet she was still sad and would not let the turtle away from her. Finally, I managed to hide turtle and after some time she was normal.</p>

<p>The next day was a weekend, so I stayed at home. When she got up, she started to  play this song again and began to be sad again. She refused to play or do anything and would hug me or my wife all the time and occasionally begin to cry. I tried to get turtle away or to at least change song, but she refused. She demanded this particular song and wouldn't let the turtle away from her. Once again, she looked very sad and behaved strange.</p>

<p>In the end, we hide the turtle and I removed the batteries later. Now when there is no way for the turtle to play this song, she acts like a happy, normal kid.</p>

<p>I can't figure what was that all about! </p>

"Sleeping routines and mother-father differences","<p><strong>The tl;dr version:</strong> </p>

<p>The father can get a toddler to sleep easily, but the mother struggles. Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what strategies were used to overcome it? </p>

<p><strong>Scenario:</strong></p>

<p>We have an 18 month old son who nurses twice per day. He's been going to a daycare from the time he's been 15 months old. I drop him off in the morning at around 07:45 and my wife picks him up after he eats lunch at around 13:00. He seems really happy there (based on our observations, the reports from the workers, and the excitement he gets when he arrives there), but since he started there, he hasn't consistently napped. </p>

<p>Since he was about 8 months, I have been solely responsible for putting him to bed at night. He and I developed a nice routine and he would go to bed and fall asleep without fuss 99% of the time. At that time, my wife would get him to nap by nursing him. In preparation for the daycare transition, my wife slowly reduced the nursing sessions to twice per day: once in the morning before breakfast and once in the evening before supper. </p>

<p>Now he won't nap except for on the weekends when I'm there. Recently I took a two week vacation from work in the hope that I would be able to help get him some much-needed naptime and then transition him over to his mother for naps once a routine was established. During those two weeks he slept great during the day, but now that I'm back at work, he won't nap. He just screams and screams and screams as soon as his mother puts him into his crib no matter what she does. He'll scream for 1.5 hours and then my wife will go and get him. In the early days of this, she would then get him to nap either by lying down with him and then by taking him for a drive in the car. He would usually fall asleep right away, but she can't then transition him back to his crib. </p>

<p><strong>What we've tried:</strong></p>

<p>My wife has tried to adopt and adapt our routine to no avail. She's tried to develop a routine completely different from mine. None of this works. The only way our son will nap is in the car or sleeping (and nursing) in our bed with his mother. Neither of these options are optimal. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced this circumstance. Is it just to do with differences in the ways that we've interacted with our son? It's starting to make my wife crazy and very upset. It's obviously difficult to hear your son who you love scream for an hour and despite my protests, she inevitably sees it as somehow being her fault. Of course, it isn't but that's hard to accept. If anyone manages to read through this, I'd be interested to know if anyone else has experienced anything similar to this and if so, what they've done to cope. Or if anyone has a theory about what might be behind this, I'm all ears!</p>

"9-year-old received tablet as gift, but he does not have the self-control or maturity to own a tablet","<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>Upon receiving the tablet, his first course of action was to install a game. For various reasons, I believe that he has proven himself to be irresponsible with such devices, and it would be detrimental to his development to have it. What should I do?</p>

<p><strong>Full text:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Recent positive behavior: Starting to follow his schedule, completing homework on time albeit with constant nagging and frequent yelling.</li>
<li>Recent negative behavior: He installed malware on his computer in an attempt to install video games, then denied doing so when confronted. He executed a factory-reset on dad's workplace cellphone, and he changed some obscure language settings on dad's computer. This resulted in data loss, wasted time, and lost productivity.</li>
<li>I discussed with him the blunders described above, what went wrong and how to avoid them. Next, I spent some time telling him about being humble and modest, as opposed to gloating. I was satisfied with his reception to this talk and gave him the gift.</li>
<li>One minute after receiving the tablet, he naturally (and to my great dismay) went gloating to our dad, who commented in a sarcastic tone: ""Yes, give him a tablet because his academics are too good."" Hence, a condition was implemented that he is not to install any games on it. The following morning, I found <em>Pokémon Go</em> installed, so the tablet was confiscated.</li>
<li>The games that he wants to install seem to employ psychological techniques to produce addiction. These games do not challenge him intellectually and do not require creativity. I've seen him spend hours grinding mindlessly to collect virtual points/rewards, and I know from first hand experience that these types of games have correlated to a flat-line in my own intellectual development.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm ashamed to say that I yielded to my emotions in gifting him what he wanted rather than what he needed. He'd done nothing to earn this and has not proven to be capable of using a mobile device responsibly. If not controlled, it will inevitably be detrimental to his development.</p>

<p>I believe that the correct course of action is to ungive this tablet, but that is a can of worms in itself. This will be a lesson for me to remember as this was ultimately my decision and my naive mistake, but right now I'm looking for a solution to this. What should I do?</p>

"Finding Great Books at the Right Level","<p>My daughter began reading at age three.  When we enrolled in Kindergarten, she was tested and it was discovered that she could already read (and comprehend) at a fifth grade level at age five.  She was not tested with Lexile, so I do not have a lexile score, but am aware of their website and its resources.</p>

<p>The trouble is that despite her reading abilities, she still has the attention span of a six-year old (now that she is six) and still wants pictures. We check out tons of books (and I own tons of children's books).</p>

<p>Additionally, Books written for fifth graders have material about which she is not ready on a social level.  </p>

<p>It is getting a little crazy pre-reading everything (well, mostly skimming) in order to be sure book content is appropriate and to screen for challenge level.  </p>

<p>Do any of you have experience (or short-cuts) for finding books that are challenging but still appropriate for such a child to read?  For many reasons, I am now homeschooling her and she has already finished all of the Literature and Comprehension material for her second grade curriculum for this year.  She has not finished the other second grade Language Arts curriculum, but she still needs to have reading time.  </p>

<p>She has lots of books she enjoys reading, but none of those books are actually a reading challenge for her meaning her vocabulary building and sentence structure complexity level are stagnating.  She finishes Magic Treehouse books in just an hour or two, but The Roman Mysteries Series (which she loves) is a little too overwhelming for her to feel good about reading alone.</p>

"How can I prevent my 2 year old from covering her face with a blanket when she sleeps?","<p>For the past couple of months, our two year old has been covering her face (her whole head, actually) with a blanket whenever she sleeps.  At night we usually go in after she has fallen asleep and pull it down to her neck.  During her naps we don't want to disturb her, so when she wakes up from her nap her face is bright red and her hair is wet (with sweat) like she just had a bath.  It's not like she just rests the blanket on her head - she more wraps her head in the blanket.</p>

<p>At first she was using her ""blankie"" which has a satin side - I was really worried that she would suffocate so we told her not to cover her face or we would take her blankie away.  We ended up taking her blankie away but she just started using the blanket/bedspread on her bed.  We can't take that away because we live up north and it will be getting very cold at night.</p>

<p>We tried giving her a very small (maybe 6 inch by 6 inch) thin blanket that she could put on her face but she won't use that.  We have tried giving her one of those quilts that has a lot of holes in it, but she won't use that either.</p>

<p>We have asked her why she does it but she just says ""because"".</p>

<p>We tell her every night before bed not to cover her face, but when we go in to check on her, the blanket is wrapped around her head.  Sometimes when we try to pull it down she wakes up and puts it back on.</p>

<p>Should I be concerned that she is covering her face?  I worry about her suffocating or getting overheated.  It is very hard to reason with a two year old.  We even tried telling her we would take a toy away from her if she covered her face, but when we check on her later, her face is covered.</p>

<p>We can't get her to stop covering her face - the only thing left that I can think of is to take away all of her sheets and blankets on her bed - but that isn't really an option because of the cold weather.</p>

<p>I'm out of ideas so I am hoping someone here can think of something.  Or maybe I'm just over-reacting and I should let her do this?</p>

We can hear a <strong>bang!</strong> whenever it happens. Sometimes it's so loud that I seriously worry he might be suffering minor concussions... It happens usually two or three times between between his bedtime at around 19:30 and when my wife and I go to bed at around 22:00. </p>

<p>One option we have heard about is what is often called a ""bettnest"" in German and I think maybe ""bumpers"" in English. Here's an example: <a href=""http://www.waschbaer.de/Bettnest--17559d2a369410.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.waschbaer.de/Bettnest--17559d2a369410.html</a>. We didn't have one at first because the German government advises against them (as do many pediatricians, I think) because of an apparent increase in the risk of SIDS, among other things. </p>

<p><strong>My Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Has anyone experienced this kind of head-bonking phenomenon?</li>
<li>If so, what did you do about it, if anything? Or what might you recommend doing to cushion the impact?</li>
<li>Do the health warnings applied to crib bumbers like the one linked to above still apply to an 18 month old?</li>
</ol>

"How worried should I be about head bumps as my infant learns to get around?","<p>We have hardwood floors in the house, and have made a little ""play area"" out of foam interlocking ""tiles"" for our 9 MO to play on. Of course, he's not content to restrict his explorations to the designated area (on the contrary - he loves dropping his blocks on the hardwood floor so that they make a more interesting sound!)</p>

<p>Naturally, as he learns to crawl, cruise and get about, there are bound to be spills, falls and other bumps - he seems to be particularly talented at bumping his head when he's sitting and turns around too quickly.</p>

<p>How much of a concern are these bumps to the head (I'm not talking about falling from a height - just falling from a crawl or sitting position)? </p>

<p>Should we be hovering and not letting him fall at all? Is falling a natural and reasonably safe thing that teaches children about cause and effect and hopefully to be less clumsy? Can they seriously injure themselves as the result of a bump to the head on a mat or the floor?</p>

"How can I increase the numeracy of a toddler?","<p>My 2-year-old is just starting to learn counting. A few weeks ago, if he saw two of an item, e.g. a clock, he would say ""clock clock"". In the last week, he started saying ""two clock"". Although he can name all the numerals 1-9, he cannot (or will not?) exhibit a count of any number of objects more numerous than 2. Still, this is the beginning of numeracy.</p>

"Raising our daughter to be bilingual without one-parent-one-language","<p>I've been through a lot of answers here on raising bilingual children, and the general consensus seems to be (1) each parent speaks their language to the child ('one parent - one language') and (2) There is consistency.</p>

<p><a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/67/what-are-some-strategies-for-raising-a-bilingual-child"">What are some strategies for raising a bilingual child?</a></p>

<p>My husband and I have a fully bilingual relationship. We live in a non-English community and speak 50/50 English and our local language at home. He's fluent in both, I'm fluent in English and advanced in our local language. </p>

<p>We <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching"" rel=""noreferrer"">code-switch</a> a lot and speak both languages all the time. Different subjects of conversation are associated with each language (work is English, mundane home affairs are local language) and sometimes we'll simply use whichever language is easier or quicker to get the point across. We'll switch languages mid-sentence and borrow words that are shorter/easier to remember from the other language.</p>

<p>We would really like to continue doing this after our daughter is born. This system works really well for us. However, I am concerned that this goes against the general advice I've read. I'm particularly concerned that our daughter won't know which word belongs to which language, or that she won't be able to tell the languages apart and get them confused, especially since we mix them so often. </p>

<p>I really don't want to have to switch to the one-parent-one-language method because it takes a lot of work and conscious effort to implement and I'd be concerned we'd just default to English out of laziness. </p>

<p>Maintaining a 3-way conversation with her where I speak one language and my husband speaks another is particularly where the difficulty lies, since we'll automatically want to switch to the other person's language (so my husband will hear me speak English and he'll automatically want to switch to English too and it'll take a conscious effort to not do that). I've been in situations where one side is always speaking one language and I have to maintain the opposite language and it is really tough to do.</p>

<p>Is it going to be detrimental to her if she hears both of us speak both languages all the time, with (seemingly) arbitrary distinction between them? </p>

"How to become closer to a religious parent as a non-religious child","<p>My mom is a devout Christian, and she holds tightly to her beliefs since that is what kept her hopes up when she suffered a kidney disease. Since I was a child she has always tried to get me more involved in the faith by taking me to religious events and getting me involved into a youth group. However, I have had bad experiences with both. The former case always involved going to prayer events early in the morning or all day/all weekend while I wanted to hang out with my own friends or sleep in and watch anime/do programming. In the latter case I always felt left out of the group since the kids all grew up together while I only joined in high school and they constantly talked about memories they had before I joined (them claiming that the group was ""closer"" in the old days didn't help either). The former case happened when I was 11-16, while the latter happened around 16-18.</p>

<p>Fast forward to college years, and I've moved out on my own (and am still living away from her even after college). Despite her telling me I should call her more often I don't want to talk to her because she references God/Jesus/Christianity in everything she says to me, saying things like</p>

<ul>
<li>""I'll pray for you"" </li>
<li>""Having sex is against the Lord"" </li>
<li>""Just keep praying and God will give you what is best for you"" </li>
<li>""God has a reason for [insert bad event here] happening"" </li>
<li>""Did you go to church?""</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to be closer to my mother, but at the same time I don't want to hear about religion every time we speak. We have had meaningful conversations before in the past, but whenever she says something religious it makes it less meaningful due to the experiences I've had.</p>

"How can I work with a math teacher who is having trouble differentiating learning?","<p>My daughter is very bright, and particularly good at math. But, she gets bored easily — possibly some near ADHD traits, although generally not to the level where it causes any disruption. She's in seventh grade this year, and tells me that math class is the worst part of her day, which is sad and scary. STEM  education research shows that girls often lose interest in math and science at this age, even when they excel at it.</p>

<p>Specifically, my daughter says that she understands the material presented in class immediately, but then the whole class is spent going over it, leaving her, as she describes it, ""bored out of my mind"". And evidence shows that she <em>does</em> get it — she's getting an A in this class and can easily do and discuss the material. (She even teaches it to her younger sister.)</p>

<p>I've spoken with the teacher a number of times over the year so far, and he seems receptive, but... it isn't really helping.</p>

<p>Initially, he said that he would ""shift"" the homework so that she'd be getting a more challenging problem set. (The materials are structured so for each section of the workbook, easier problems come first, and he usually assigns the first few questions as homework.)</p>

<p>After a month or so, though, this never actually happened — my daughter was coming home with the same problems, and still complaining. So, I talked to the teacher again. This time, he said ""Oh, well, she's not doing any of the challenge problems, and that's how I really know if a student is advanced.""</p>

<p>Challenge problems? Turns out that these are written on the board in the back of the class every week. They tend to be more like math puzzles than something which follows the curriculum (for example, one was the <a href=""http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55862.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Knights of the Round Table Marriage Problem</a>). Students <em>may</em> work on these if they're finished with in-class work — but there's no space to <em>discuss</em> them.</p>

<p>My daughter says ""I'm not a mind-reader! How can I figure out how to do these things if we don't talk about them in class?"" And, that point does seem to have some fairness. I encouraged her to try them <em>anyway</em> to help show the teacher that she can, and she has some, but... I'm sympathetic to her argument that doing brain-teasers doesn't do much to address the thing she's having a problem with.</p>

<p>What she really wants is for the <em>regular curriculum</em> to move at her pace. I know that's really hard when you've got a class of 20, but there's got to be <em>something</em>. Last week, I went back to the teacher again and we talked about the issue with the challenge problems, and I reminded him again that he hadn't actually done the ""homework shifting"" he'd first promised. So, the new thing is that he sends home a notecard with some extra, more advanced problems.</p>

<p>They're currently doing the very beginnings of algebra; the normal homework has them graphing equations like <code>x = 3y</code> and <code>x = 5y - 5</code>. The first notecard had problems <code>3x + 8y = 24</code>. My daughter said ""Dad, I don't know how to do this."" I showed her how to isolate the x variable, and I could <em>see</em> a little nuclear lightbulb go off in her head.</p>

<p>The next day had <code>y = x²</code> and similar, and again, bam — ""Dad! This isn't linear!"" And last night, she was given some equations and told to find the ""x and y intercept"" — and to look up what that meant. I showed her on the graphs she'd drawn earlier (""Look, when x is zero, you <em>intercept</em> the y axis..."") and again, she didn't need to be told twice.</p>

<p>So.... this is at least offering some challenge, but:</p>

<ol>
<li>She's still bored <em>in</em> class,</li>
<li>She says ""So, when we do get to this stuff, now I'm going to be even more bored! I'd rather just wait to learn it so I at least have something to think about.""</li>
<li>If <em>I'm</em> doing all the teaching, <em>what is she going to class for</em>? </li>
</ol>

<p>And thank goodness I can still dredge up memories of all this stuff — if I couldn't, I'm not sure she'd really do well being completely self-directed via Khan Academy. I mean, we could get a private tutor or something, but that's still <em>extra</em> work, not <em>better</em> work.</p>

<p>I'm kind of out of ideas. Do you have any helpful suggestions I could bring to the teacher? I could talk to the principal, but without some concrete idea for what I want, that just seems like getting the teacher in trouble, which isn't my goal.</p>

"Difficulty pronouncing R and L: how fast is it overcome?","<p>This question concerns difficulty pronouncing the sounds R and L between the ages of 4 and 6 years old.</p>

<p>Assuming that there's no serious problem (that is, all other sounds are correctly pronounced and speech is mostly intelligible) and that the child will learn to pronounce those letters correctly on their own, how fast is the process of overcoming it? </p>

<p>I don't mean the whole practice and exercises that I've seen advised everywhere, though. I mean, once the child starts pronouncing the difficult letters, is the evolution overnight or does it take several weeks, with some words correctly pronounced and others not so much. Are there moments of backtracking, when they go back to not pronouncing words correctly, or is it more like 'learn the trick and rarely make the mistake again'?</p>

<p>By the way, I'm not from the US and where I live it's considered normal for children up to 6 years old (or older, if their teeth have gaps) to have difficulty pronouncing some letters. Very rarely have I seen or heard of children asked to repeat the word correctly or coached about how to pronounce correctly those difficult sounds, only after they start school. Only if a lot of sounds are not correctly pronounced, making speech unintelligible, will one go to a doctor about it.</p>

"Hand me downs: what to do when it's not the receiving child who is resentful","<p>Our family has three boys and now a baby girl. My oldest is in his teens and was so gentle on his clothes that I have had a steady supply of well cared for and almost brand new hand me downs available for the next two boys (and a select few for my girl). Fewer things survive my second boy, but what does gets saved for his younger brother. I have the clothes organized in a closet by season and size and I let the boys ""shop"" in the closet at the beginning of each season before we hit the stores. This has been going on without any issues for years. </p>

<p>Lately, my 5 year old has been catching up in size to my 7 year old, so that right now, they are almost the same size. One is 7-8 and the other 6-7. Ususlly the clothes are ""out of circulation"" for two years but it's been barely a season lately, and this winter they are overlapping. My 7 year old has always been very possessive and kind of jealous, and now he's refusing to ""allow"" my 5 year old to wear ""his"" clothes. It's true that some of the stuff was his not too long ago (a month is as long as I could let them sit in the closet before my 5 year old needed to ""shop"".) The 7 year old goes into the 5 y.o. drawer to ""takes back"" what's ""his"" or attempts to rip the clothes off of his brother if he sees my 5 year old wearing them. He calls my 5 year old a copy cat, a thief, a scrub (for wearing someone else's clothes), and other nasty names. Poor little guys, each in their own hell. One getting tortured simply for getting dressed and the other by his emotions.  This is very distressing for everyone. Our mornings have become total chaos.</p>

<p>Here are some things we've tried:</p>

<p>My oldest son has tried to reason with my 7 year old, and remind him that the clothes were his and he's never once gotten mad at the 7 year old for wearing them. He also pointed out that the baby wears onsies, sweatpants, and mittens that were my 7 year olds and he doesn't get mad at her.  My 7 year old's response is ""well, they aren't your clothes anymore because they are mine, so you would be an idiot for being mad at me for wearing things that are mine."" He then rejects his own ""logic"" when we apply it to his brother who is wearing his clothes that are his. My 7 year old says ""no, they are mine forever once they are mine.""</p>

<p>We tried doing a ""swap"" in the closet. He had to ""buy"" the clothes out of the closet with his old clothes. He was fine with this. He happily swapped out a pair of size 7 jeans for an identical pair of size 8's. We then waited a few weeks before we brought our 5 year old to shop. Our 7 year old immediately spots ""new"" clothes on his brother and will tackle him and inspect the tag for the size. </p>

<p>We've tried buying the 7 year old clothes instead of going shopping in the closet, and skipping him altogether with the hand me downs. He still gets mad at my 5 year old, claiming that he should have first dibs and they are STILL his even though he never laid eyes on the items since my oldest last wore them years before. </p>

<p>We've bought new clothes for our 5 year old, and our 7 year old screams and cries that we make him wear my oldest son's rags while the 5 year old gets new stuff...when we mention that he has several brand new pairs of Hanna Andersson sweats (not cheap!) that he picked out for himself he says ""yeah but you'll take them and give them to him! You only wanted them for him!!""</p>

<p>We're worn out by this. Our 5 year old, who has mastered the morning routine and has been getting himself up, dressed, and fed every morning without much intervention now won't get dressed, and is moody and snippy in the morning. He won't put his clothes away because he insists it's a waste of time Bc his brother will just rip them out during one of his ""raids."" Our 7 year old has also started going thru our daughter's books and blankets to weed out what's ""his."" At this point he doesn't get mad at her, but comes to me all teary eyed that I've given away his baby things like he ""doesn't even exist.""  Then he gets mad at me.  He goes thru the trash to see if I've thrown away his school work, and inspects the contents of boxes that go out to make sure I've not donated any of his things. He's like a little hoarder in the making! (No, we've never suffered a loss like a fire or flood, been poor or displaced, and we've never forcefully down sized his belongings for any reason. We also don't give into tantrums, but he hasn't given them up yet nonetheless.)</p>

<p>I suspect he's got a larger issue (we're already in therapy for his anger/temper/tantrums) but for now, if anyone has any tips on what to do about the hand me downs I'd appreciate it. I saw the other question here that deals with resentment of a younger child, so, how about we cover the topic from the opposite perspective?  How can I make this easier on my 5 year old, who just wants to get clothes on so he can go to school? I've already spoken to our therapist about this and she was stumped! She says most kids are happy to see their stuff go, or, couldn't care less. </p>

<p>Please don't say stop using hand me downs because with 4 kids, it's not economically feasible to purchase new clothes for all of them every season.  </p>

"10 year old refuses to go to bed","<p>Our 10 year old stepdaughter has trouble going to bed at night.
She refuses to go to bed, and fights us very hard, to the point where our only hope of her going to bed is to physically pick her up and put her in her bed. Then, we have to keep picking her up and putting her back into bed, up to a couple of dozen times.</p>

<p>Her attitude and behaviour are fine until we ask her to go to bed... it's like a switch.</p>

<p>The routine goes a little like this:</p>

<p>We say godnight and ask her to go to bed. The first one or two requests are usually ignored. When we stop requesting and start telling, she responds with ""No"", ""make me"" etc.</p>

<p>This is usually followed by delaying tactics or inventing reasons to come back downstairs. We reach a point where the only response she will receive is the word ""Bed"", followed by physically putting her there if necessary.</p>

<p>It can go on like this until after midnight, and she will vehemently complain, insult, argue, scream, shout, hit things, slam doors, say hurtful things, throw stuff, and has at one point struck one of us.</p>

<p>We have recently suffered through 3 weeks of this with only a single night off (which was rewarded). We have been consistent with not budging on bedtime while allowing other things that aren't as important, so the frequency started to lessen. However it crops back up and is a real pain on a weeknight - and I don't want to give over any random weeknight to keeping one of the kids in bed.</p>

"Why does my infant wake crying the instant we put him in his bed?","<p>This is probably a classic but here goes. Some time between midnight and three my 9 month old will wake crying. Often he is hungry or has gas and can be fairly easily consoled and falls asleep in our arms once his needs have been met.</p>

<p>However, on many occasions, no matter how long we wait or how deeply he appears to be asleep, the instant he ""touches down"" on his bed (or sometimes a few milliseconds before), he will arch his back and begin to cry. After that there is nothing to do but to pick him up again and he will frequently fall right back asleep in our arms. </p>

<p>What's up with that? Is it time we take the shards of glass out of his mattress? (just kidding - I'm tired and feeling a little punchy). </p>

<p>When he first falls asleep for the night the Devil's orchestra couldn't wake the little sack of potatoes, but once he transitions to REM stage we go through this circus act. Not every night - some nights he will sleep straight through from 8:30 till 6:30. But on the ""bad nights"" we might be up for a couple hours doing the ""putting himdown"" song and dance. </p>

<p>I guess I want to get some opinions on ""how the heck does he wake up instantly the moment he touches his bed?"" and ""why?"" before moving on to what could be done. </p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I'm answering my own question 4 years after the fact because I had the recent opportunity to think back on this and wanted to capture those thoughts.</p>

<p>Eventually things worked out. It was many months, but sleep habits formed and everyone ended up getting their much-needed rest. In the meantime, here's what worked:</p>

<h3>Reduce the % change in environment.</h3>

<p>Basically, I tried to make sure that there was as little change at once, with pauses in-between. This translated to a fairly drawn out process, but anything was better than being up all night. In order to reduce the % change, I had to add a bunch of stuff that could be kept constant. Noise, lighting, temperature, etc. because of course physical contact and orientation were going to change as soon as I put him in the bed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Noise: create a white noise environment that will not change when you put the child down - be aware that the sides of a crib can alter the frequencies that hit the ear, so be mindful of your sound source and how it sounds above the bed (where you'll be rocking the child) and inside the bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Humming: add your own noise (humming or singing) to the mix. This is a good one because it maintains your presence, and (more importantly) can be tapered off gradually (sing quieter and quieter)</p></li>
<li><p>Light: be mindful of how any ambient light can be occluded by the sides of the crib - and possibly register on the child's eyelids. And don't forget your own shadow.</p></li>
<li><p>Orientation: you need to gradually move the baby into the exact orientation (in your arms) that the child will be on the bed. So figure out how you need to hold the child when being laid on the bed and maneuver him/her into position in your arms. Cribs with deep sides are killer because you have to really bend over and that can mess up your back. Don't let the child roll when you lay them down! Be prepared to stay leaning over the crib with the child still in your arms, but touching the bed for agonizing periods before you remove your hands / arms, which changes body heat</p></li>
<li><p>Body Heat: blankets and swaddling are key here as they insulate the child from y our own body heat and there's less of a temperature drop when you extract yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't leave yet! If by some miracle you've extracted your hands, stay where you are! Keep everything else constant - your humming, the white noise, the light, and your presence.</p></li>
<li><p>Ninja-like exit. Practice your exit - two steps max if you have creaky floors. I had it down to two steps, a pivot and close the door in under 2 seconds. When you're ready to go for broke and you've followed all the other steps slowly, get out of there in a (soundless) flash.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat, repeat, repeat. Ritual is the key. The more you do everything exactly the same, the more smooth the process will be.</p></li>
<li><p>Stay calm. Agitation is the worst. You know those nights you REALLY just need the baby to settle down because you have to get some work done, or go out, or just get to sleep? That's the night it will take THE LONGEST! So just be calm. I got to a point where my inner monologue was ""hey, enjoy it. You get to be with your baby just the two of you. These are precious moments. Besides, what else am I going to do with my time? This is what I was made for..."" I'm not sure I bought my own propaganda all the time, but, 4 years later I can still look back at all that with fondness so I can only conclude that A) it WAS actually precious and special and rare and B) you forget the bad stuff and remember the good - as do your kids - and that's why the human race has not died out.</p></li>

"Value of pacifier as a young infant's sleep aid?","<p>There seems to be no consensus among baby-sleep experts on the value of the pacifier; some sources consider it a good sleep association (akin to swaddling and white noise), others see it as a hassle for parents who must constantly reinsert it, not to mention eventually wean their strongly-attached toddlers from it. It's been valuable for us but I'm beginning to wonder if it's worth discontinuing much earlier than toddlerhood.</p>

<p>My situation: my three-month-old is generally a good and independent sleeper -- we've been practicing ""drowsy but awake"" since he was quite young in hopes that it'd create smooth and generous naps, like it did for our older son -- except that he has a very strong association to the pacifier. He doesn't use it much during the day (only to hold him off while milk is warming, or if overstimulated in a public place) but since the newborn days, he's relied on it to fall asleep on his own for naps or bedtime. (Typically I'll put him down in the crib, pacifier inserted, and soothingly rub his back or hold his hand; this calms him enough that he can settle on his own, most of the time, although I confess to rocking him to sleep on fussier days.)</p>

<p>At three months, I'd expect him to begin consolidating daytime sleep into fewer and longer naps, and he seems to want to. But despite an otherwise excellent foundation for independent sleep, he has difficulty extending his naps beyond one sleep cycle (~40 minutes) because invariably the pacifier has fallen out of his mouth; he certainly doesn't have the hand-eye coordination or self-awareness yet to reinsert the pacifier himself, and won't for some time. I've found myself reentering his room to soothe him and re-insert the pacifier, in order to get any decently long and restful nap out of him (and if I do this, he can nap for two or more hours at a time). This practice seems unsustainable, especially when it means leaving my energetic toddler alone downstairs while I deal with the pacifier every 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Given that we're just now working on establishing a better nap schedule anyway, am I crazy for trying to wean the baby off the pacifier at the same time? I feel like the short-term pain might be worth the long-term gain -- and that doing so at three months, before object permanence sets in, might be the best opportunity. But I also fear that breaking his best sleep association at such a young age could make napping more tenuous and difficult overall, which would be counterproductive -- and I fear that half-measures (trying to settle without the pacifier, growing frustrated/enraged, then finally giving up and reinserting it) would lead us to both negative consequences. </p>

<p>Has anyone had this experience with pacifiers before? Is there any evidence of benefits of the use of pacifiers into toddlerhood?</p>

"How best to take advantage of a child's extended vacation","<p>This is a little more complicated than it might seem, so I'll give some back-story.  </p>

<p>We have 2 kids:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The oldest, 11, was born to us during my first year of college, and I was only intermittently in the picture due to distance, and relationship instability at that point.  He is diagnosed with moderate autism, but is extremely high functioning and has a high IQ.  He is fairly creative and has a very good ability to think abstractly. He has a fair number of great qualities, but the negative behavior so dominates daily life that it really overshadows many of the good times daily.  He also has significant social-behavior <em>problems</em>, and very poor impulse control, and frequently gets in trouble.<br>
We have a fairly high-stress and contentious relationship with this one.  He will not complete any chores without significant involvement by one or both parents; he (quite viciously sometimes) argues just about everything that requires him to do anything other than what he is doing at the moment.  This is emotionally taxing and makes it difficult to connect and maintain a connection him.</p></li>
<li><p>The youngest, 3, was born to us after we reconciled, had moved in together for about a year or two, and had a stable relationship.  He was a relatively early talker, is highly verbal and intelligent.  He has his own issues that are hard to deal with, but he has not yet hit the pre-teen argumentative/defiant stage-or anything resembling it.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Currently, the 11-year-old is traveling out-of-state to visit family.  My question is, other than taking time to more closely bond with the 3-year-old, and taking time to ""recharge"", what can actively be done in anticipation of our 11-year-old's return to prepare and, quite honestly, regroup, for a stronger/smarter/more understanding approach?</p>

<p>What I might also be asking, is ""what are some good, fresh approaches to use with an argumentative, effort-avoiding, back-talking, smart ass whom I was not fully prepared to (positively) interact with as a parent in the first place""?</p>

"Why has my infant suddenly changed her sleep patterns? Is she teething?","<p>My daughter normally goes down for the night around 7.30pm. After that she sleeps soundly (with a feed at 10pm) until 3-4am, where she'll grizzle a few times but go back to sleep without needing to be taken out of the cot. Then she'll wake up fully between 6am and 7am.</p>

<p>A few nights ago this changed. She will still go to sleep relatively easily, but will wake up every few hours, including before her 10pm feed, crying like a wounded polar bear. Our usual soothing techniques don't seem to work, and sometimes she cries herself fully awake. </p>

<p>Around 4am we snap and take her into our bed to see if that soothes her more, but last night she just lay in bed babbling and playing. It took 90 minutes to get her back to sleep and she still woke up around 6.30am. </p>

<p>What could cause this behaviour? I'd suspect teething but then why was she so seemingly happy when she woke up at 4am? Shouldn't she be either tired or still crying from the teething? Why does she behave like this at night but be relatively happy during the day? What can we do to help her sleep more?</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>She's now 9mo, and this behaviour has recently got a lot worse. We started using controlled crying to great success, and she now goes down to sleep at 7.30pm with great ease. However the middle-of-the-night crying is still occuring, except now with more force than ever. She screams extremely loudly and violently, but I'm pretty sure she's not in pain. She has been doing this for almost two weeks and still doesn't have any teeth, so it's probably not teething, and she still does the tell-tale pause in crying that signals she's just looking for our attention.</p>

<p>Comforting her in the cot does not work, she doesn't stop crying and she rejects her dummy. Picking her up does stop her crying. Taking her into our bed stops her crying, but she doesn't go to sleep, instead play-fighting or crawling around the bed, which keeps us awake as much as the screaming.</p>

<p>We have been trying to do controlled crying in the same manner as we did for her bedtime, but it's harder because we can't stop her crying while leaving her in the cot. The longest we've left it is two hours of solid crying, but then our tiredness and guilt about the neighbours makes us give in.</p>

<p>Any more help/support appreciated.</p>

"How do you handle a toddler that refuses to say 'sorry'?","<p>My two-year-old son is generally exceptionally well-behaved and polite.</p>

<p>He was saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" at a very early age, and would apologize if he had problems sharing or accidentally hurt someone.</p>

<p>However, now at 26 months, he has started to really push our boundaries.</p>

<p>Most recently, he refuses to say ""sorry"" when he hurts someone.</p>

<p>On one occasion, he was playing too rough with me, and pinched my neck pretty hard.  I said ""ow, that hurt.  You've got to be careful.  Can you say you're sorry?"".  </p>

<p>On another, he was bouncing on the bed when he landed hard on my wife, and hurt her.  She also asked for an apology.</p>

<p>Both times he said ""no!"", laughed, cried, covered his eyes, ran away, and generally avoided apologizing.  We kept insisting that he apologize, and I tried explaining to him that sometimes you can hurt someone by accident, but that apologizing showed that you didn't mean to hurt them.</p>

<p>He asked ""why?"".  I tried simplifying it, saying that ""good boys say sorry so they don't hurt other people's feelings"".  He then said he wanted to be a bad boy.  I said ""people don't like to be around bad boys"".  He said ""why?"".  I said ""because they hurt people and don't say sorry.  People don't like to get hurt.""  However, he responded by saying that he liked to get hurt.</p>

<p>At this point, I can't tell how much of this is him just testing boundaries, and how much is him simply not understanding the concepts.</p>

<p>In the past, taking away the toys he was playing with was usually enough to get him to apologize, but that no longer works.  Last night he was put to bed about 30 minutes early, with no bedtime stories, because ""bad boys don't get stories read"".  However, we still got no apology.</p>

"How to deal with my parents frequently getting mad at my life choices?","<p>I’m 26 and I find both of my parents get mad at me for very bad reasons. For example, I was visiting my mom. In a mad tone she told me to stop playing a game on my phone. Just realizing it now, I find this hypocritical as when I come to visit she usually leaves the TV on and watches it so it’s not as if we’re giving each other undivided attention. I find this particularly offensive as I got a job and worked hard to make money to buy my phone, both of my parents seem averse to technology and my mom never owned a cellphone.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say my parents regret their life decisions, but I would say they aren’t happy with their life. They both live alone and don’t like their jobs. I sometimes wonder if they take this out on me.</p>

<p>I also find my parents get mad at me for work/career related decisions. I’ve always had a full time job when I wasn’t in school full time since I was 16. Right now they’re mad at me because my job doesn’t use my degree and doesn’t advance my career (I took it as it’s temporary and pays very well and I need money right now). </p>

<p>I told my mom that she’s not allowed to talk about my work, phone, money or living accommodations because it always leads to an argument. Was this the right thing to do or any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Also things like if my parents found out I have been napping they start criticizing me for being unhealthy or lazy.</p>

<p>I find that both my parents are very nosy and if I try to steer the conversation away from a topic that would be unpleasant to discuss, they go towards it. Also both my parents need to get the last word in an argument, they won’t drop a subject until you drop it. This behavior makes me want to hide information from them.</p>

<p>When I say my parents get mad at something I do, it’s usually expressed through their tone of voice. I’m curious, is getting mad at someone ever an appropriate? It’s ok to express your opinions and desires and to tell a person not to do something, though “getting mad” basically means trying to use aggression to control another person. </p>

<p>By the way I’ve seen a psychologist for a completely separate issue and found it did more damage than help so please don’t suggest seeing a psychologist or councilor. </p>

"Daughters friend invading","<p>My daughter is in 7th grade. We left a private school for homeschooling for 2 years. This year I put her back in public. She started this new adventure with an old friend. They were very close from 1st grade to 4th when they fell out a little. During homeschooling they got close again. There had been alot of drama while we were gone and everyone was blaming this girl, but I didn't believe it.</p>

<p>My daughter has been a specific type of dancer since Kindergarten (Irish Step Dance) it's unique and very special to her. She works incredibly hard at it and has alot of pride about it.</p>

<p>3 months ago the friend started taking classes, initially saying it was to improve her footwork for tennis. Well now she is always talking about it, telling people they dance together, having her Mom buy all the stuff (that my daughter had to earn through years of hard work) and just overall invading into a world that was special and personal for my daughter.</p>

<p>It may seem petty but it's really bothering her. It bothers me too in that it feels like an invasion. There's really nothing I can do about it but I'm struggling with what to tell my daughter.</p>

<p>I will add, there's alot of other nonsense too. Trying to drag her into boy and online drama etc. In a few short months I've realized I was wrong about her and now we feel stuck.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks for all the input. I was definitely not very descriptive in my post, because it's hard to explain really. There's a lot to it and she doesn't enjoy the friendship anymore because she's not much for drama, social media etc... The friend has lots of other friends and activities. I don't necessarily have a problem with her taking up dance, but my daughter is FEELING invaded. It's genuinely upsetting her. She treats her like the ""sidekick"" and is very dominating in the friendship. I think my daughter is feeling this entering into the world that was her own special place. Make sense? She FEELS that the girl only wants it because she doesn't want my daughter to have something special that's only hers. I can't change any of this for her, but I guess I'm struggling with telling her to stop complaining and be happy about it, or telling her that her feelings are valid.</p>

<p>I've encouraged her to expand on the new friendships she's developed and to just try to ignore it. The good news is this overall new adventure into middle school has been pretty good so far. That's why this is a bit puzzling how much this is upsetting her 😕 but I get it at the same time.</p>

My son walked up and grabbed it and ran to my wife with a big smile on his face.  Note, he didn't take it out of the other childs hands at all, and the other kid was seemingly done with it.  The other kid came up ripped it away again and set it back down to play with the other toy.  My wife finally got upset and said something to the kid and the 3 year old's mom came up to her and said ""well your son did steal it from my son"".</p>

<p>The 3 year old's mom is now setting a precedence that</p>

<ol>
<li>It's the 3 year old's toy (by saying it was his and my kid stole it), but it's 
the libraries not his (<em>see below</em>)</li>
<li>She obviously doesn't care to encourage good social behavior with her kid</li>
<li>She has some social issues of her own</li>
</ol>

<p>Funny thing was the kid started crying when they left because he had to leave the truck.  He obviously has this mindset that the truck is his, and I'm sure the mom is part of the problem there.  I couldn't help but to laugh a little ... just loud enough for the other mom to hear.</p>

<p>Note, my son has taken these encounters like a champ. Never shed a tear, I'm super proud of him for that. But I also don't want him thinking this is ok.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have advice for dealing with a bully who doesn't share toys (even when he's done playing with them), who will rip toys from my sons arms,  and who has a parent that seemingly encourage these anti-social (and downright mean) behaviors?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are my concerns above correct/valid?</strong></p>

"Research into dealing with kids biting","<p>I'm a grandad wondering. I'm watching my kids and their contemporaries deal with various parenting issues that my wife and I encountered ourselves. As they're living some way away I don't often get involved day-to-day, just see some discussions on social media.</p>

<p>Recently the question of dealing with biting came up. Various opinions were expressed, pretty much in line with questions and answers I've seen on this site. The contrasting opinions being ""teach them it hurts, bite them!"" and ""how can you expect a child to learn not to bite by biting them?!"" </p>

<p>I saw one statement to the effect: extensive research has proven that biting may stop the initial biting behaviour but in the longer term other violent or aggressive behaviours will manifest.</p>

<p>Now as I have a somewhat academic mindset that piqued my interest. I'm somewhat sceptical that such research results exist - it sounds quite a difficult thing to study - but if we have facts I surely want to base my actions on them.</p>

<p>So I began googling to see whether I could find that research, or indeed any other solid basis for choosing a disciplining strategy relating to biting. Then I realised that most serious academic work is hiding behind paywalls. Hence the question:</p>

<p>Do we have empirical data about effectiveness of strategies for dealing with biting? Do we have longitudinal studies that might reveal whether apparently effective approaches might have longer term less desirable effects?</p>

<p>Please note: I'm not here asking for opinions about what we should do, or accounts of what worked for you, or even the policies of schools or other organisations. I'm interested in the empirical basis for making such decisions.</p>

"How to best handle a mother who does not enjoy staying with her kids","<p>The bonding between mother and child can be compromised early on, for instance by post-partum depression. More rarely, a mother can have difficulty enjoying her time with older kids such as those of age 6, possibly because she sees this maternal role as a duty rather than a fulfillment.</p>

<p>Whenever such bonding is compromised and a mother sees her commitments to her kids mainly as a duty and cannot find inherent gratifications in being a mother, her life can turn badly, with unfavorable consequences for her spouse and the children themselves. </p>

<p>How can this best be handled? Besides individual psychotherapy or family counseling, which practical interventions, in everyday life as well as more in general, can favorably impact on such crisis in motherhood?</p>

"Should I let my adult daughter know that I am her biological father?","<p>My daughter is 33 years old. She has grown up in a normal loving family and knows me as both a family friend and godparent. Her parents had fertility issues so I helped them have a child. </p>

<p>All parents know. I believe she has a right to know the truth and personally want her to know, but her family parents do not want her to know the truth. Well, the mother is 50:50 but her father is definite that she should not know. He is an alcoholic and they have just separated. </p>

<p>With life turned upside down it is my belief that now is a good time to be honest and have a fresh start to changing family dynamics. Also my daughter has 2 sons and alcoholism runs through her 'fathers' family, causing deaths, and she is naturally concerned for her children. But they do not have his genes.</p>

"How can I decide whether to raise my teenage son's allowance?","<p>My 14 year old son currently gets an allowance of $12 per week. </p>

<p>He has no fiancial obligations that he has to pay from this amount, this is just for ""fun"" things. He does a list of chores, together with the family, but we do not ""pay"" for doing them via allowance.</p>

<p>He claims that his friends get $20 per week and wants me to increase his allowance. Financially speaking, that wouldn't be a problem. But I see his friends smoke and I don't want him to follow suit. I'm afraid that giving him more money would lead to his spending it for unwise or potentially dangerous things and I find it impossible to control what he uses his allowance for. My feeling is that the current amount is sufficient.</p>

"How can I make noisy toys quieter?","<p>My son has a few toys that are so loud and piercing that they hurt my ears (emergency trucks with sirens, an aeroplane flies around in a circle on an articulated arm, and a toy musical piano). My ears have had almost forty years of abuse, and <em>I</em> find them unbearable; I hate to think of the potential for damage to my son's ears. I don't understand how toys can be made and sold with such deafening noise levels.</p>

<p>I know enough about electricalness to know that I could just open up the toy and snip the wire to the speaker. But what if I don't want to mute it? I have considered covering external speaker grills with tape, but my son would probably just remove the tape. Is there something I can I do – discretely, from inside the toy – to an electronic speaker to quieten it without removing the sound entirely?</p>
"
"Innocent age related stubborness or bad behaviour?","<p>My 4-year-old shows impressive stubborness and singlemindedness. While it is sometimes clear, often I find it hard to tell if I'm looking at: ""I'm four years old and surprises make me insecure"" or ""I'm the resident dictator, all shall bow to my will"".
My gut feeling tells me these are different things and should be dealt with differently.</p>

<p>Two examples: we go to the zoo and I see the parking lot nearest the enterence is almost full so I drive to the next parking lot with many empty spaces. Son starts crying he wants me to park at the parking lot ""where we always park"". I hate parking so I go to the empty one. </p>

<p>He cries and screams, I have to drag him out of the car (first I run around the car trying to catch him, while he is inside the car and tries to evade me). He continues to cry in the parking lot on his bicycle on the way to the zoo, so I finally cave in. I put him and his bike back in the car and drive to the parking lot with few empty spaces. All is well.
I ask him why it's such a big deal and he cannot really tell me why but he says it's a big deal.</p>

<p>Now the other one:
I put jam on a slice of bread for breakfast, I'm almost done as he declares he wants me to put peanut butter on the other half. I tell him I have finished this slice of bread I will put peanut butter on another slice. He starts moaning and crying: he wants me to throw it away and do one half-half. It ends with time outs on the stairs, lots of crying and him throwing stuff and finally he eats his breakfast and we're late for school.</p>

<p>Sometimes it starts out when he asks for something I will happily accommodate, then slowly increases his demands until he either wants something he cannot have or he has annoyed me so much I decide I will not give in to everything he asks. But when he only gets 80% of what he has asked for he will think of something new. Rinse repeat. </p>

<p>Should I not seek confrontation when he displays quasi-autistic behaviour (like in the parking lot)? 
How should I deal with unreasonable demands and are they the result of too much freedom to choose in general? 
I have always believed that he can do what he likes as long as he is not doing anything dangerous or terribly inconvenient. If he wakes up and says he wants to go to the swimming pool, and we are free to go, then we'll go. </p>

<li><p>Asking to write 2 words: ""gradual, planning"" multiple times after explaining the context with examples (say for gradual: ""Did you run immediately after being born?""

"Helping a child independently make logical connections","<p>My seven year-old son has a lot of difficulty making logical connections on his own.  His inability to make logical connections is his biggest obstacle to academics and social functioning.  How can we help him improve at it?</p>

<p>For example, one of his teeth fell out last night, but he left it in the van.  We took him out to the van this morning to see if the tooth fairy came.  He looked straight at the money a few times, but didn't notice it, because he was looking for his tooth.</p>

<p>We asked him what he was looking for, and he answered his tooth.  So we asked why he was looking for his tooth, and he answered because he left it in there last night.  So we asked him what the tooth fairy does, and he answered correctly and promptly.  But it still didn't dawn on him.  So we asked him what he should be looking for.  Only then did he get it.</p>

<p>We know this isn't age-typical behavior, because his four year-old sister sometimes makes similar mistakes starting out, but she almost always makes the connection when she first sees hints like the money, and on the rare occasions she doesn't, she doesn't need more than one verbal hint.  Our son almost never makes those connections without our input.</p>

<p>He easily remembers the pieces of the puzzle one at a time when prompted, and once the pieces are all there he can easily put them together.  He does very well on logic games like robot turtles.  It's just like it doesn't occur to his brain to ask the right questions.</p>

<p>This affects him academically.  Math has a lot of deductive reasoning, and in reading new words he often gets stuck on his first pronunciation, and it doesn't occur to him to try an 's' sound for the 'c', for example.  He is actually a grade level or more ahead in reading, according to <a href=""http://a2zhomeschooling.com/all_time_favorites/reading_level_assessment/"" rel=""nofollow"">these tests</a>, but it's like he remembers a huge number of sight words rather than possessing good decoding ability.   In other words, he is severely hampered in learning new things independently, but probably above average in recalling facts he learned previously.</p>

<p>We've probably said things like ""What other sounds does a 'c' make?"" thousands of times, but it doesn't occur to him to ask those questions of himself. Obviously modeling the behavior isn't working.  We could make prospective memory aids for specific situations like reading new words, but that won't help him in other new situations, especially social ones.</p>

<p>We try to give him as small of hints as possible, in order to help him exercise that skill, but it hasn't seemed to make a difference.  What else can we do to help him develop this skill?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Birth to 6 months: Since an infant's vision is still developing,
  choose books with little or no text and big, high-contrast pictures.
  Also consider books with interactive stuff, such as puppets, mirrors,
  or peepholes, recommends Pamela High, MD, author of the Brown
  University reading study and a professor of pediatrics there. The more
  ways you both have to enjoy a book, the better. If you'd like, read to
  your baby from grown-up books or magazines too. Comprehending the
  words isn't really the point with babies this young. For infants,
  reading is about the tone of your voice and cuddling up to you.</p>

<p>However I find that my baby sleeps, cries and eats. Her eyes are not really opening all of the time, which means she can't see the colorful books; she doesn't seem to be able to hear my voice ( if she does, she isn't showing it), which makes it quite pointless to read to her. </p>

"Need suggestions on how to deal with my 11yo in school","<p>This turned out way longer than I intended, please try to bulldoze thru it.</p>

<p>My oldest daughter is 11. She's the middle of 5 (21 19 11 9 7). Her older bros are in 'college' (they're taking classes). They pretty much blazed the middle-school trail for their siblings so the wiff and I have had plenty of warning with the general issues that we will face again. Yes kids are different, I know this... but they've all grown up in the same middle class neighborhood so their general issues are very similar</p>

<p>The problem with school work is that she's simply not doing it. I was an 11 yo latchkey kid that never did his homework, but I also didn't have much if any guidance or direction. There's nothing stopping her from coming home, getting a drink, sitting in the kitchen, and doing the hw before her siblings get home. This isn't earthshattering and therefore, I expect that she can do that. She doesn't. We're midway thru the 2nd quarter of 6th grade (1st yr of middle school) and can't seem to crack the nut into making a routine. She's failing 3 of 4 core classes (science, math, communcation arts/english, but not social studies) because she doesn't do the work. She's seriously about to fail and repeat 6th grade simply because she will not do it.</p>

<p>She's very much like I was and her 2 older brothers. The difference is that I managed to deal with it without parental or school aid, and her brothers eventually got it. Both of them, Jr/Sr yr, were finally able to do what they needed to do without me crawling up their back about it.</p>

<p>Anyway, in class, she does other things besides ""using her time wisely""; ranging from sitting there staring at the ceiling to old-school reading a book you <em>want</em> to read while it's framed in the book that you're <em>supposed</em> to read. She's supposed to fill out a daily agenda with the assignment for that class (all kids get the agenda booklet) have it signed by the teacher (just my kid and then i deal with it at home) and then come home and do the work, and me or mom will look it over. This is not a complex process, but she's supposed to do it 5 days in a row to get pc/ds privileges back. The most she's managed to do is 2 days.</p>

<p>Now . . . I know that she's distractable. She always stops in the middle of whatever and I have to make her focus. ""Aaaahhhh, there it is... add/adhd"". Not so fast there, bub... </p>

<p>I've not seen real effort put into doing it. Without going into the gory details and examples, she can get started (2 days above) and she clearly exhibits the ability to focus (not hyperfocus) for varied times and levels of concentration. But they're all things that she really likes to do... reading, drawing, pokemon, building lego farms with her younger siblings. I don't count, but to some extent probably should count, minecraft and certain pc/vid games that require serial attention on goal oriented gameplay. </p>

<p>It's hard to quantify in this space all the things I've tried and the conversations I've had with her. Her teachers generally care, but they're middle school teachers with 200 kids, or whatever, to deal with. One teacher seems to be going thru the motions but the others are interactive with her and parents. I've burned completely thru a variety of motivational systems, positive, negative, bonus, none of them stick. From ""bring a signed agenda home, I'll put a bead in your vase"" (full vase gets you something cool) down to ""bring it, or else"" and all the ""or elses"" have come to pass. And I know from experience with her older brothers that they eventually turn into the rat in the electrified cage: After 2 weeks without pc/ds, it no longer matters. </p>

<p>Yes I follow up on the negative stuff. 11 is too old to spank in our house (besides, she's like 5'8"" 150#), but she quite literally has zero privs right now. Come home, sit at the table, the end. And I still have to tell her to do the work and she doesn't do it because I'm busy being a parent and can't stand over her like a totalitarian despot. </p>

<p>As said, it's not my first rodeo. My older boys had previously set the mark on ""horrible getting hw done"" and we dealt with it, dare I say, effectively. I managed to deal with it without parental or school aid, and her brothers eventually got it. However it took them several years, all the way up into hs, before I had to really start hacking into life-affecting privs. Both of them, Jr/Sr yr, were finally able to do what they needed to do without me crawling up their back. </p>

<p>So the fact that I've blasted thru a 6 year plan in 2.5 mos has left me with no idea what to do. I've considered homeschool (my schedule would allow it), her younger siblings are in the gifted program at school and she missed it by a couple points in math (she convinced herself that she hates math yet can do it easily). They all tested high in younger grades and are following the same path of dumbing down to the curriculum that's taught. Homeschooling, tho, presents a number of challenges for especially me.</p>

<p>So, after all that, the questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What else I can do motivationally? I've explained how much it woudl suck for her to repeat, and she gets it: the next 6 years of school will affect the next 60 years of her life.</li>
<li>Any specific recommendations for some kind of professional? I'm not beyond counselling but I've no idea where to begin. I'm not beyond accepting diagnosis, but I'm not convinced that 1) she's diagnosable and I'm not throwing meds at it 2) she's got a problem beyond motivation. We know add and adhd kids and personality wise she's nothing like any of them.</li>
<li>Any thoughts on the homeschooling solution? What about part time homeschooling?</li>

"Tandem nursing infants of different ages","<p>Does a newborn infant of 2 wk get enough nutrition from the breast milk which is also fed to a older child of one year in tandem nursing?
Our pediatrician said that the better quality milk made for newborn is unnecessarily taken up by the older child, which may cause the newborn to not get the sufficient  nutrition. But the local La leche representative did not object to tandem nursing and allowed it. So what are the evidence based guidelines , pros and cons of tandem nursing infants of different ages?</p>

<p>Also the older child is now  even more interested in breastfeeding then ever before on seeing her sibling feed , this inspite of the older child getting enough external foods. The older child feeds more frequently and for longer duration clearly showing  competing behavior.</p>

"Is jogging an appropriate activity for a pre-adolescent child?","<p>This question was motivated by seeing a 6 or 7 year old girl jogging with her mom today. I was in slow moving traffic so I know she ran at least 2.5 miles (the distance between the lights causing said traffic). The little girl was wearing ear buds, running shoes/gear, and had what looked like a pedometer on her waist. A perfect replica of her mom. If she wasn't so young it would have been cute, but because of her apparent age it left me feeling more disturbed than anything.  </p>

<p>Don't get me wrong - kids need exercise. But I feel that pre-adolescence, it should be more about play, fun, team building, and sportsmanship than ""fitness.""  Perhaps my opinion is off base? After all, Olympians are made not born right?  </p>

<p>However, with Olympians in mind, I am having trouble finding any other motivation for a lengthy jog than to be fit or to train. I actually love jogging, but wouldn't dream of encouraging my 9-year-old to do it because the benefits (besides an Olympic Medal) I'm seeking are not applicable to him - cardiovascular health, weight management, mental clarity, muscle tone... frankly, running just seems like it would be really boring for a kid. Of course, there are also risks involved, which are joint damage, getting hit by a car, sprains, etc... So why would someone allow/encourage a young child to do it? Is it healthy for a 6, 7, 8 year old to do long distance running? At what age is running a healthy form of exercise for a kid? </p>

<p>Am I crazy for thinking this scene was weird to begin with? (That's a matter of opinion and not good ""stack"" form so no one has to answer that...)</p>

<p>I don't want people to think I'm picking on runners - I also wonder if any of these other ""adult"" sports would be healthy/appropriate for a young child (say, more than 5, less than puberty):</p>

<ul>
<li>weight lifting</li>
<li>swimming (laps, not as part of a team)</li>
<li>cycling</li>
</ul>

<p>Do any of these sports have a benefit unique to children (as in, something kids would get that adults wouldn't - such as a development advantage) that would make them a better alternative to the usual kid sports (baseball, soccer, karate, etc.) that perhaps I am unaware of?</p>

<p>I realize there's quite a bit of opinion-orientated questions in here - but I'm leaving it so that my intent is understood. I'm really curious to know if running, etc., is harmful to kids or merely unpopular. If they are harmful, at what age do they transition into the healthy category? </p>

"How to help a seven year old with unrequited love?","<p>My son turned seven two months ago, and will begin his second year in elementary school after this summer.</p>

<p>Yesterday he received a love letter by one of his class mates, a girl of the same age. She wrote that she is in love with him and asked if they could meet in secret. She also asked him not to tell their class mates or parents. I learned of the letter, because I was sitting at the table with my son when we opened the day's mail, but I suspect he would have told me anyway, because he was clearly out of his depth with that declaration.</p>

<p>You might think the whole matter cute, but the problem is that my son vaguely dislikes this girl and at the same time is the kind of person who strongly feels the pain of others and does not want to hurt her.</p>

<p>The girl lives two houses away from us and visited the same kindergarten as my son. When we moved here, four years ago, we tried to get the two kids to befriend each other and went to the playground, swimming and elsewhere a couple of times with the other family. The girl very much liked and wanted to spend time with my son right from the beginning. But my son soon lost interest in her as he made other friends, and his initial openness slowly turned into a mild form of dislike as he realized a basic incompatibility between them, yet she kept attempting to connect with him.</p>

<p>My son is quite popular with his peers, and he has a score of close and favourite friends, about a third of which are girls. The girl in question, on the other hand, appears to have only a few, exclusively female, friends. My son and his friends are of course interested in each other's physical differences and show their private parts to each other when they believe no adults are watching, but as yet none of them have shown any signs of attempts at romantic love.</p>

<p>Against this background the love letter is doubly incongruous: because my son is not yet interested in girls in this way, and because he is not interested in this girl even as a friend.</p>

<p>Since my son did not know how to deal with this letter, I helped him compose a reply. I thought and told him a reply is a necessary courtesy and that he should make his disinterest in a romantic relationship unmistakeably clear. I'm the kind of person who immediately gets cured of an infatuation upon being refused, so I try to quickly set those free who are unlucky enough to fall in love with me and not encounter a corresponding feeling.</p>

<p>To my surprise my son also said he would be willing (not interested!) to go swimming with the girl. So he added that offer to the reply. He went and put his letter in the girl's mailbox this morning. Her reply promptly arrived around lunch: she asks if he wants to go swimming tomorrow, which is fine, but covered the letter in lipstick kisses, which clearly shows that she did not understand (or believe) my son's refusal and that she lives in a fantasy world quite unlike that of my son, in which love letters covered in kisses don't yet exist. He knows of love, of course, but in his conception it is something that adults do and he is interested in it in the same way that he is interested in where money comes from or what cancer is: as something that does not directly affect him.</p>

<p>My son is gone for two weeks now and won't receive the girl's second letter before he returns. I have called the girl's mother and told her that my son won't be able to go swimming with her daughter tomorrow (and nothing else).</p>

<p>But the question remains how he (and I) should deal with this matter. I am worried that the girl will keep pressing for my son's affection and make both herself and him unhappy with her dependence. But should I interfere? Should I tell the girl's parents and hope they will be able to help her accept my son's disinterest and turn her desire for, I guess, friendship to more likely candidates? What kind of advice can I give him, who is not only not interested in this girl, but also not even interested in the problem of love, and now has to deal with emotions that are not part of his current stage of development?</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I was so unsure about this that I did not do anything at all at that time. The summer holidays and a lengthy trip came on between the two kids going swimming together, and then I forgot about it all until, a few weeks ago, a second letter arrived. I hesitated to deliver it and put it among my paperwork, where it remains unopened and unread. I felt and still feel that the letters take this all to a different level and put more pressure on my son than he deserves. The two kids are in the same class, so they meet and interact almost daily, and twice in the intervening time my son came home telling me that that girl is in love with him, and after a short pause, but he not with her. Then he proceeded to tell me that another boy from his class is in love with another girl, but she not with him either. And then he turned to other, more immediate matters. So I feel that it is not such a big issue after all, neither for him nor the girl, and I do not interfere as long as it remains so.</p>

"What is a fair way to punish a sibling who unintentionally erases another's Saved Game?","<p>TL;DR: Question title. (What is a fair way to punish a sibling who unintentionally erases another's Saved Game?)</p>

<p><del>So this question could (should?) perhaps be posted on <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/"">Parenting</a>, but I thought users here might have some personal experience with this.</del></p>

<p>I recall two incidents from my childhood where I erased my younger brother's saved games, both times unintentionally (in my mind).</p>

<p>The first time was when I somehow deleted all the files for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimTown"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SimTown</a>.  Game files, saved games, and all.  We re-installed the game, but no saves to be found.  My brother was devastated and demanded my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_Coaster_Tycoon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Roller Coaster Tycoon</a> files be erased in retribution.  My parents did not think that erasing save files for a game I'd played many more hours on was fair.</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple years and we're at daycare beefing up the kids starting lineups with the 3 starter Pokemon for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon_Red"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Red and Blue</a>.  I was the cool kid with the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00AYQRGFW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link cable</a> that let us trade, and I volunteered to get everyone set.  Not even considering that there is only one save file and that to make a trade you need to save, I overwrote my brother's 100+ Pokedex to trade a Charmander for a Rattata.  This horrific act again resulted in no punishment for me, but I did offer to help my brother with a new game.</p>

<p>Looking back, I got off easy.  I would have been pretty vengeful if I had been my little brother, and maybe that's why we aren't close today (or because he lives a couple hundred miles away) and he's not the gamer type.</p>

<p>Still, that leaves me wondering what an appropriate punishment would have been?  Is erasing the saves of the offending sibling really making things ""fair?""</p>

<p>What would be an appropriate punishment these days?</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to clarify, both of these cases were unintentional.  The first one due to not understanding how to properly use a computer at the age of 8, the second time just forgetting (and not reading the warning message) that you have to erase the saved game to do the trade.</p>

"My child is constantly hungry. How do I keep her feeling fuller?","<p>I give my daughter lots of healthy foods, including those that have fiber in them.  She gets veggies and fruits, proteins, dairy, she has a water bottle with her wherever she goes and yet this week she is waking up in the middle of the night hungry and honestly wanting food as well as needing something to eat almost every hour during the day.</p>

<p>Breakfast often includes eggs, sausage, ham or other such foods (often in an omlette, frittata or quiche.  We do oatmeal a lot along with some fruit or a yummy shake and once a week or so we have muffins, pancakes or waffles (which almost always have a little flaxseed thrown in.  She loves both the eggs and oatmeal and eats plenty at breakfast.  </p>

<p>Lunches usually include a homemade burger (I have a recipe that includes blackbeans, soy and ground beef together I use), deli sandwich and/or some sort of soup or chili (especially this time of year).  This is also when I might do what most people in the US would have for Dinner.  Stir Fry (again, brown or wild rice or a mixture), Porkchops and root veggies, Meatloaf and mashed potato.  We might also get something at McD's or Panda Express if we are out and about (she loves the orange chicken).  Almost every sauce I make has veggies in it as well as what she eats on the side.  One of her favorite veggies is broccoli so <strong>she often asks</strong> for half veggies/half rice when we are eating at Panda Express.</p>

<p>Dinner is often a lot simpler and might be rice (I never use white) and beans, a nutty cous cous concoction that is a family favorite that includes a little quinoa with the cous cous and pistachios or something more traditional like spaghetti (without all the extra trimmings though) and a side of veggies such as roasted squash or zucchini, green beans, peas and carrots. . . (you get the idea).</p>

<p>I don't do desert very often, but she does get chocolate milk some of the time (2%), has access to candy (but rarely chooses to eat it - seriously, I don't even tell her she needs to ask anymore) and when we are at the theater often gets the ""less healthy"" stuff for dinner because we are out OR I'll pack sandwiches with carrot sticks, jicama and fruit and a cup of pudding or yogurt.</p>

<p>She is six, tall and skinny, and pretty active, so this is not an over-eating thing (or an infant thing).  I don't believe it is medical because there is no genetic history of such things and we've actually gone through similar periods of time before.  The pattern often is that it lasts about a week or so.  Then, she suddenly grows some (and we have to pull out the hand-me-downs in the next size) and then her appetite goes back to normal.</p>

<p>In the past, having some extra apples and grapes around (or other fruits) along with some yogurt or cheese and a piece of toast or crackers for her to grab has worked.  She also can make herself a peanut butter sandwich at any time really (and I'll help with other ideas if she wishes for them).  The getting up in the middle of the night so hungry she can't get back to sleep part is new though.  I'm expecting it to pass any day now (and to suddenly need the new PJ's, shirts and leggings I got to put in presents under the tree sooner rather than later) but in the meantime I am starting to get concerned about her sleep.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Pre-bedtime snack ideas that are healthy to try?  Tricks-of-the-trade for helping her sleep even after she gets hungry?  A Snack that won't be bad for her teeth and gums she can just have by the bed so she doesn't even have to get up and can fall back asleep faster? . . .</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>8:30am ate 3 servings of egg, cheese, sausage fritata that also contained zucchini, and summer squash.  Along side had a smoothie with yogurt, spinach, strawberries, blackberries and a banana.</p>

<p>9:35 - ""Mom, I'm hungry.  Can I have some yogurt raisins and an apple?""<br>
""Sure Hon.  Do you want a bowl of peanut butter to dip your apples in?""
""Yumm.  That sounds good mommy.""</p>

<p>11:00 - ""Mom is it time for lunch yet?""
Daddy responds, ""Do you want to go get a burger? - Have a little Daddy time?""   Apparently she ate all but two bites of her cheeseburger and a sizable amount of fries.</p>

<p>1:30 - ""Mom, did we have lunch?  I'm hungry.""  She had a little chocolate milk and a pear with a small handful of crackers and a few slices of cheddar.  Half an hour later we added a granola bar.</p>

<p>Just now - ""Mom, I'm hungry again.""</p>

<p>FINAL Update: without a lot of change, but with a peanut butter and jelly protein shake (and the diet outlined above) just before teeth brushing and bed - she slept <strong>Really Well</strong> last night <strong>YEAH!!!!</strong>.  The shake had crunchy, all natural peanut butter, frozen strawberries, Greek Yogurt, spinach (I know - but she likes one I make with spinach and pineapple in it and when I was making it said, but mom what about the spinach?) and soy protein powder in it.</p>

<p>By bed she was SUPER tired anyway, and she has awoken with visibly longer legs (when viewing where the cuff falls) than the ones she started the day with yesterday morning.  Can't really tell if its anything we did differently or if it was just time, but I'm keeping all the ideas in mind and getting some great ones on the cooking site too.  I'm sure it will come up again.</p>

"In the USA in the year 2014, does the law forbid children from being out and about without close adult supervision?","<p>My wife and I are set to become parents within the next few months.  One thing that frightens me about the prospect of being a parent in today's world, and specifically, in Littleton, Colorado, USA, is the recent spate of reports of parents being arrested and having their children taken away because the children engage in activities on their own that would have been considered normal a few decades ago.</p>

<p>I was born in 1983.  Much to the dismay of my parents, I preferred to constantly amuse myself with Nintendo games throughout my childhood.  However, I was certainly allowed and encouraged to play outside any time I wanted to.</p>

<p>In today's United States, it appears that many people in law enforcement and the courts see it as a parent's duty to keep their children under close supervision at all times; they see anything else as criminal child endangerment.  </p>

<p>See this <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/07/14/and-now-the-criminalization-of-parenthood/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">report</a> by the Washington Post: A boy in Ohio left church one Sunday morning to go play with friends.  Someone saw him at a ""Family Dollar Store"" and reported this to the police.  The police arrived, took him home, and arrested his father for ""child endangerment"".</p>

<p>Google will find you many stories like this, so I'm not going to post them all here; I believe that the above story is a good example of what I'm concerned about.</p>

<p>Are parents required by law in the United States in the year 2014 to closely supervise their children when they are out and about, or else keep them at home?  It sounds like the answer is a resounding ""Absolutely, yes, and you can go to jail and lose your family if you don't obey!""  Are these reports typical of how the law is applied in the USA today, or are these reports outliers?  Finally, if I don't want my children to be developmentally stunted by being placed under close adult supervision at all times and ""house arrest"" when supervision isn't available, what can I do about it?</p>

<p>I would be particularly interested in an answer that cites the law as applied here or how the courts have interpreted the law.</p>

But every once and a while I don't hear my alarm clock and I wake up feeling like the worst mother for letting him sleep 8 hours! He has been gaining weight perfectly, weighing about 13 lbs now.

"Is my 7mo ready for solids?","<p>We've had my 7mo old on pureed foods for about a month now (she had a week off while she was sick). Prior to this she was exclusively breastfed and continues to be breastfed for at least a year. She doesn't open her mouth for me to feed her. She will take the spoon (knocking off most of the food in the process) and bring it to her mouth, but she doesn't open her mouth to put the spoon in it. She sticks her tongue out just a little to taste it, she'll kindof lick/eat the food slowly off her hands and the spoon and then mostly smears it all over her face. (It's actually quite an adorable mess!) I can sometimes sneak the spoon in her mouth if she opens it to smile, but I don't want to startle her or cause her to choke if she's not ready for the bite. When she gets food in her mouth she sticks her tongue out a little. It looks like she's moving around in her mouth, but I can't tell. I don't think it's a taste preference because she does this for all food we feed her, not just certain ones. I can't tell if this is normal and she's just experimenting with this solid food thing... or if she's not ready for solids?? I know she doesn't NEED the food because the breastmilk is enough to satisfy her nutritional needs. Thoughts?</p>

"""Secret"" correspondence with a child","<p><strong>A</strong> is parent of <strong>B</strong>, let's say in primary school age. <strong>A</strong> invents fake profiles of <em>n</em> realistic, inspiring characters and starts sending anonymous letters from each of these <em>n</em> characters to <strong>B</strong>, at different times, with different styles, such that each character behaves according to their own profile and each with their own story to tell; <strong>B</strong> starts a private correspondence with some of them without realising <strong>A</strong> is behind them.</p>

<p><strong>A</strong> makes use of these correspondences for genuine educational purposes (i.e. <strong>A</strong> is not a psychopath). Let us assume no actual manipulation is involved: each of the <em>n</em> characters will actually behave independently and without any hidden goal apart that of being <strong>B</strong>'s good friend and having some good time together.</p>

<p>Of course, these characters may decide to uncover their true identity, more or less gradually, more or less explicitly, entirely or just partially, perhaps maintaining the correspondence and continuing it as a ""game"".</p>

<p><strong>A</strong>'s behaviour presents obvious ethical dilemmas (starting with children's right to privacy, their right not to be deceived/misguided). Can it be ethically acceptable or is there a way to make it ethically acceptable? Is it even legal?</p>

<p>Is that worse than parents pretending to be Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Following answers by jker and Ines, I try to clarify my question</p>

<p>What is the purpose of these correspondences? Expose the child to great personalities, fictitious but realistic, inspiring, able to communicate with the child and teach them something in a context that is outside what the child perceives to be ""family"" or ""school"".</p>

<p>Why, can't <strong>A</strong> do the same without this <em>bewildering</em> trick? Yes, of course, <strong>A</strong> can play <strong>one</strong> character: the parent. Unfortunately parents are not enough: all children need many good quality one-to-one interactions with as many different educators as possible, and from as many different cultural backgrounds as possible; however educators, relatives and friends are usually not able or not willing to engage, cooperatively with the families, in activities so much tailored on the needs of one single child. This <em>trivial</em> trick would allow the child to interact with astrophysicists, musicians, artists, philosophers, mathematicians, neuroscientists, etc. - and these would not be just ""mum"" or ""dad"", they would have an aura of magic, they would be fascinating - which parents cannot usually be. And having real pen-friends is such a great educative experience for children of that age, expanding so much their normal, little microcosms.</p>

<p>It seems necessary to highlight that the purpose is cultural, not psychotherapeutic.</p>

<p>Genuine educational purposes are perfectly compatible with having a good time as friends - I feel a bit uncomfortable having to state that.</p>

<p>Why secrecy? Because children need lots of good educators, and school educators, relatives and friends are not good enough, they are not astrophysicists, musicians, artists, philosophers, mathematicians, neuroscientists, etc. Often they don't even have time for individual children. For parents it can be much easier, they just need to get to know their child, pick some good book from the local library and write few pages per week in interaction with the child, mostly following the child's interests. If there is no secrecy or at least some degree of complicity from the child, the game cannot work.</p>

<p>""Genuine educational purposes"" might count as a ""hidden goal"" (?), what is important is that the parent behaves ethically and does not attempt to manipulate the child in any unethical manner. An example of the latter would be a parent trying to extort information from the child or exert psychological pressure on them: that would be very, <em>very</em>, <strong>very</strong> unethical.</p>

<p>How long would the ""deception"" last? It depends on the maturity of the child (weeks, I would say, perhaps few months, just the time to conquer the child, convince the child that the game is fun). The deception can be removed very easily and the game can continue with more awareness (and more fantasy/imagination on the side of the child who would try to attempt impersonating their <em>own</em> fictitious characters, great exercise).</p>

<p>By the way, yes, I confess I do believe that children have the right not to be deceived/misguided, at least to some extent that is not easy to define/quantify.</p>

<p>Also, Santa Claus <strong>is</strong> a false persona, and I can't see any educational value in it, it seems to me a triumph of conformism. Children can be distracted from falling teeth in many ways other than the Tooth Fairy tale.</p>

"9 month old with an imperative to sit","<p>I though it was just a phase, but it's been two or three weeks already and doesn't stop. My 9 month old has an imperative to sit. She absolutely has to sit. When put to bed, even if extremely sleepy, she will try to roll to her belly and push herself up to sit. When laid down again, she will sit again. The process will repeat until she is tired and sleepy enough to fall asleep when on her belly, still half trying to sit, but failing to.</p>

<p>Sometimes at night she wakes. And then she sits. After a few seconds she either starts complaining or falls asleep again. If she falls asleep - she is in some really weirdly bent positions (she once fell asleep with her head between her legs - she was sitting then she just laid her torso and head). I am fairly certain I once found her sleeping while sitting.</p>

<p>She also hardly lays when awake. She only does it when we give her something to eat, and we do it only to make her lay for a while.</p>

<p>Advice I could use is:</p>

<ul>
<li>did your children behave the same way?</li>
<li>can we somehow encourage more laying on her back or belly time?</li>
<li>how to effectively lay her down to bed?</li>
<li>is so much sitting (95% of awake time, 10-11h per day) safe for her spine?</li>

"How to make my 5-year-old speak in first person when she speaks in second person?","<p>My 5-year-old daughter talks a lot. But when she does, it's in second person (i.e. the second person in the conversation), saying what she expects I would say when directed towards her. So she's not speaking in first person, but in first person from my perspective.</p>

<p>For example, she will say ""I will take you out to a bike ride this evening"" pointing to me, as she wants me to say that. What she means is ""Let's go on a bike ride,"" or ""Take me on a bike ride"".</p>

<p>Another example is when she wants to comment on the temperature of something. She will say, ""Is it hot?"" as though I am asking the question, when in reality she is trying to say, ""It is hot"".</p>

<p>It has been rather cute, so we kept going like this for the last couple of years. But she is growing up now and needs to talk normally in social settings.</p>

"How do I tell my 14 year old niece that her mom is kicking her out?","<p>I'm a 30 year old guy, and I'm single, never had a real girlfriend to speak of. My sister's first born is in some trouble and she has decided that her daughter cannot live with her anymore (there's been some lying, stealing, running away from home, and, well, sexual activity). So it's either she lives with me (I'm not exactly a short drive away) or she gets sent to a foster home, or basically a prison for teenage girls.</p>

<p>I'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep that girl safe, as my family is very important to me and I especially adore her. I took her in as a visitor for the past month or so, and things have been fine so far, we get along great and I haven't had any problems.</p>

<p>As it turns out, her mom has basically told her nothing of the seriousness of the situation, that she is kicking her out. It's apparently up to me to tell her, or have her mother tell her, and I'm not sure what's the best (least bad?) way. I kind of get the feeling that they're not communicating very well, and that they tend to fight a lot, so I'm not sure if her mom should be the one to break this news, or if I should be the one. I'm sort of an easy going guy that tends not to get too worked up, I don't judge, it's all cool by me, I usually just coast through life in chill mode (even though it sometimes bites me in the ass when I get kinda lost).</p>

<p>In this case, I'm definitely kinda lost. I've never had a kid. I don't know how to raise one (I don't know if I can ever ""know"", is that something you pretty much just have to wing it?). I don't know how badly this is going to mess her up, if it will cause her to misbehave with me the way that she seems to with her mom. I guess there are so many questions that I ultimately have, but it starts with the big one first</p>

"How to handle child's apology for something he says he didn't do","<p>I have a nephew who's in kindergarden. He's shy and dislikes conflict, when other boys get loud, he goes away to where it's quieter. Another boy accused him of having kicked him; he says he didn't do it. Now I don't know what exactly happened, of course, but from what I know about my nephew, I think it's extremely unlikely he kicked someone. The kindergarden teacher seems to agree.</p>

<p>However, the mother of the boy who accused him made a big deal out of a (in my eyes) small issue and demanded consequences, and the kindergarden teacher made my nephew apologize to the other boy. From what I was told, I'm getting the impression she just wanted to get the mother off her back and that was the path of least resistance and the simplest thing that would do it.</p>

<p>My nephew came home and told my sister he was told to apologize, and that he did, but he didn't know what for.</p>

<p>Now I don't want to get involved in this, but if my nephew was my son, I would have requested a talk with the kindergarden teacher and demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>Two kids who tell different stories about what happened in a small-scale fight (if you can call it that - I really doubt they actually got physical) seems like something that would happen all the time in kindergarden. I know it happens often enough with my own kids, at home. How would you expect the teacher to handle it, especially with one party's mother demanding consequences? And would you talk to the teacher about the forced apology, or let it go?</p>

"How should I deal with a 3 year old storming off and sulking over minor incidents","<p>I have three children, a five year old, a three year old and a 10 month old baby.</p>

<p>At the slightest thing, the three year old will get annoyed and storm off in a sulk. It could be anything from being told that he can't do something (such as take a hard toy onto the trampoline) or it could be something like his food is slightly too hot to eat. Sometimes there doesn't seem to be any particular reason, <em>something</em> will upset him, his face changes into a sulky face, then he will run off. He will often scream and slam doors on the way out. I guess you could describe it as kind of a tantrum but it's more like a sulk.</p>

<p>Other times it will manifest as a rebellious sulk in a public situation, like today in the park, he refused to slide down a big slide halfway down, for some reason - holding up the other children. I have no idea what was even the problem. I feel like in many situations he often chooses to not conform.</p>

<p>I've tried various ways of dealing with it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I've tried, going to get him, being nice and carrying him back - he will just run off again.</p></li>
<li><p>I've tried being playful, laughing and tickling him in the room he's stormed off into - but I think he quite likes this, now if I go into the room, he goes all giggly and silly in anticipation. But it doesn't really solve the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>I've tried asking him what's wrong, he just ""growls"" at me and won't say anything.</p></li>
<li><p>I've tried ignoring him completely. He will usually come back into the room, and maybe open and re-slam the door as if to make us notice him. This isn't always possible, e.g. in public he might be in danger if we let him walk off and we're not supervising properly.</p></li>
<li><p>For the last two days the thing I'm trying is to bring him back and really trying to settle him by hugging/holding him very firmly, until he calms down - which does kind of seem to work, but he gets SO angry and exhibits more of a traditional tantrum in the meantime, and I'm having to hold him quite tightly. Even though it's not aggressive in any way and it's not done in anger it does feel like I'm using my size and strength to control him, and I'm not sure my wife would be able to do the same because he's very strong.</p></li>
<li><p>The thing that usually always works is trying some kind of happy distraction, like for example once when he stormed off about not wanting the dinner I'd made, I made a face out of the vegetables, and he came back happily and ate it then. Or today I pointed out how much his runner bean that he's brought home from pre-school had grown. But it's not always possible to do something like this, or to think of or have the means or time to do something that will get his attention.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>His vocabulary is pretty good, but when he goes into this mode he seems unable or unwilling to articulate what the problem is; instead he just goes into this silent sulk and won't say anything. He will sometimes explain afterwards what the problem was.</p>

<p>I really don't know what the best thing to do is. Should we ignore him completely or should I continue with the holding method to get him to calm down? Or should I even try to punish him, by putting him on the naughty step? I'm trying to not do the naughty step (positive punishment) at all now and only use positive reinforcement instead (a star chart).</p>

"How can I help my 9 year old son fall asleep and stop stuttering?","<p>My 9 year old son has always had a bedtime routine and has never had a problem falling asleep. However, during 3rd grade he began stuttering routinely and also began having problems falling asleep. </p>

<p>We did find out that he was being bullied by another boy (who happened to stutter).  His teacher did nothing to help with the bullying until I threatened to go to the principal (after 3 complaints). She also told him to save his tears for something really important. His teacher would reprimand my son if he raised his hand to ask a question when she was working with another reading group. </p>

<p>My son was in an advanced reading group which met once a week while two other groups met every single day. He was expected to ""figure it out"" instead of asking her a question about the work she required to be done by the next time they met. It was after he told me she hated him that I really noticed a change in his sleep patterns. </p>

<p>The stuttering began about three months after the start of school and by the third nine-week period he was no longer able to fall asleep per his usual schedule. Despite the change in his sleep pattern, my son was able to excel both academically and on standardized testing for which he was identified as AIG. </p>

<p>He is still stuttering, though we have been working on this ourselves as he has requested that I not take him to a doctor. I haven't been as concerned about the sleep pattern as I am a stay-at-home mom and it's summer break.  </p>

<p>School starts in three weeks and I don't know what to do about getting him into a better sleep pattern. Often, 5 nights a week at least, I will find him awake at 1:00 a.m. He will then sleep until 11:30 or later in the morning.  I recognize that he still needs a certain amount of sleep. What can I do to get him back on the pattern he had before the bully and the bad teacher? I've heard about melatonin but am unsure as to whether I want to start giving my son a pill - even if it is safe. Has anyone had success with that?</p>

<p>I normally try to have him in bed with lights out at 9:00. He is allowed to play quietly and/or read until then. All screen time ends at or before 8:00 p.m. I just don't know what else to do to get him to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I would also be grateful for any recommendations regarding the stuttering.</p>

He kept his diaper dry for a whole week at night. He can go 3 to 5 hours at school without a wet diaper, and he constainly would take his diaper off around the house if he peed in it. So last weekend we had a long weekend and decided to start the potty training process. I heard that going completely naked the first day and constantly bring him to the potty and showing him is the best method so that is what we did. He had many accidents on the floor and went about 11 times in the toilet. But day 2 and 3 were better. By day 2 at night we added in him wearing underwear and pull up for night and nap. Then the 4th day he goes to school. He refused to use the toilet at school and acts as if he is afraid of it. He only has about 2 accidents at school a day which isn't bad. But how do I get him to actually tell me when he needs to go, and not me or the teacher having to take him to the bathroom every 45 minutes to an hour? Teacher thinks I need to do pull ups first and then underwear do you think  I progressed him to fast to underwear, I just think pull ups prolong the process?

"Teens concerned about impregnation through clothes","<p>How active are you online? How much do you browse the internet?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>dry humping is the process of two people repeatedly moving up and down and back and forth on top of each other fully clothed( or missing various pieces, but the penis must not come in contact with the vagina with out some sort of fabric seperating them ex: boxers,panties, or even sheets!!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all know that the basic rule for impregnation is that the sperm must come in contact with the egg, and even be able to fertilize it. While sperm can get through clothes, semen (but this is yet been proven or disproved) gets stuck, thus the sperm dies.</p>

<p>She says no to everything, and however I ask her, gently, angrily, explaining the goals, etc. it does not work. I have to ask her almost 20 times to put on her shoes, to dress up, to brush her teeth, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes she does things when asked, but a strategy that works the first time may cause a tantrum the next time, with cries and screams.</p>

<p>What is new now is that she agrees to do something at first, but then refuses, as a kind of test, I guess. For example, she asks to have a banana, and I ask her if she is sure. She says yes, I peel it, and then she doesn't even take a bite.</p>

<p>I (try to) keep calm and explain to her why I want her to put on her shoes, for example, but I always end up raising my voice at the end, and asking 1000 times a day is exhausting...</p>

<p>Aside from that, she can be very good. I think she is a little above average for her age: she speaks very well, is not overactive, goes to sleep well, and eats very well too.</p>

"How do I figure out which infant formula is the healthiest?","<p>With so many formulas out there, I am not sure which is the healthiest. Are there any studies that show which formulas are the best?

<p>Just to clarify, im not looking for <em>specific</em> formulas. Im looking for what makes formulas healthy. For example ""X formula contains Y and Y has been shown to be better than Z which most other formulas have""</p>

"How do you train an infant or young toddler to swim?","<p>I recently saw a video on Facebook (see it <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI_XzNfxjlY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here on YouTube</a>) that involved a young boy, approximately 18 months old, that literally <em>dived</em> into a pool, was fully submerged for at least 7 seconds, and kicked/swam his way to the surface of the water. At this point, he spends another 2 full minutes on his back, staying afloat and keeping his face out of the water. (A parent was in the pool, off-camera, the whole time. This was an educational/informational video.)</p>

<p>It also appeared to me that while the child was underwater he was covering his nose and/or mouth with one of his hands, and so returned to the surface using only his legs and one arm to swim.</p>

<p>I'd heard of babies being train to keep there heads afloat, and I know there's a reflex that causes them to hold there breaths when submerged. But, I'd never been under the impression that diving (practically head first!) was part of that training?</p>

<p>What are the safe techniques used to train such a young child in that way?<br>
What type of background or certifications should you look for in an infant swim instruct to achieve this?<br>
How much in-the-water time does it take to teach young ones this particular skill?</p>

<p>Here are some stills from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI_XzNfxjlY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the video</a>, which illustrate the type of techniques I'm asking about:

"How do we help our toddler to sleep through the night?","<p>My 14-month old daughter is no longer breastfeeding, and sleeps happily in her bed, although it is still in our room. But she wakes up around three times at night, and as far as we can determine it's because she is hungry. A bottle of milk formula is a necessity to get her to sleep again.</p>

<p>We tried getting her used to not eating by making the formula slowly weaker, but that just means she wakes up quicker after each bottle. We do try as hard as we can to make her eat as much as possible during the daytime (especially just before going to bed), and she seems to eat a reasonable amount of food during the day, so now I'm at a loss at going forward.</p>

"When should a small child get out of the oral fascination?","<p>Our boy is a few months away from his 4th birthday... but he still puts darn near everything in his mouth. We are constantly talking to him about what should and should not go in his mouth, only food and your toothbrush... not toys, not sticks, not random junk you picked up off the floor, not napkins, etc. But it seems to just go in one ear and out the other. Even though he's told me he understands, and has sat there and told me ""not in mouth"" for various things, he still does it. </p>

<p>He's well past teething; they're all in. (Our dentist has even taken an x-ray to confirm that in the front since he's only got 3 front incisors.)</p>

<p>It does not appear to be hunger related. He routinely eats a good breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. There doesn't seem to be a difference between days that he eats at day care and days that he eats with us; they report that he usually eats his whole meal, sometimes asking for more... pretty much the same thing we see. On several occasions when he's been seen chewing on toys, he has had the partial remains of a meal sitting on the table that he walked away from saying he was done.</p>

<p>When should we start to get worried? Any other suggestions for helping him stop this? (Aside from the choking concerns, the cleanliness/disease issues, and the various bad things that could happen to his GI tract if he swallowed something he shouldn't... there's some concern about what he's doing to his teeth... daycare just called and informed us he's had a piece of random blue pastic stuck between his front teeth for a while before they managed to get it out.)</p>

"How much time, energy, and money should an adult child give to struggling parents?","<p>I've got a friend who is asking me for some advice. He does very well. He is 26, owns a house, and has a really good technology career.</p>

<p>However, his dad spent four years trying to find work and ultimately landed a job in the same city as him. His parents and younger brother temporarily moved in with him, although that is never a single guy's dream. The parents tried to sell their house but the escrow devastatingly fell apart the day before closing. Long story short, the buyer made them spend thousands of dollars in minor repairs only to walk away because he could not fund.</p>

<p>It has been nearly three months since they moved in. He lent his parents thousands of dollars to help them with the repairs hoping it would expedite the sale and get everyone to move out. He also flew home three times to help stage the house, then move everything out, and then move everything back in. </p>

<p>His parents, brother, and their dog are all invading his lifestyle. They are short a car so he has to taxi people as well as deal with the clutter and mess of a crowded house.</p>

<p>He is about to lose his mind and says he feels trapped. He says none of this is his problem, although his parents gave everything to pay for his private school tuition growing up. But he did not anticipate helping his parents would turn into a bottomless pit sucking his time, money, energy, and social life.</p>

<p>Finally a cash offer came in for the house. His parents are now looking for a home as escrow nears closing. He is frustrated again because his parents want him to help move a fourth time, but he feels he has done everything he can and just wants his time back. He also is frustrated that his area is the only affordable one, and his parents may move only blocks away. He wants distance and a healthy single life, and worked hard to get distance from his family's drama and chaos. Ironically, his success, resources, and stability has made him the go-to person for every family problem. He'd like to start a family of his own, but his parents and brother are always following him for help.</p>

<p>What can he do as the only stable person with resources in his family, which he is now saying is a curse more than a blessing? Should he go and help them move or has he done enough? Should he be concerned about his parents moving close to him because that is the only area they can afford?</p>

"What do we do if our children don't like the nanny?","<p>So I just came back to work after a long discussion with our 4-year-old. He complains (more to the effect, he had a meltdown) that he doesn't like our nanny, and would prefer to have our neighbour watch after him instead. It's not like she's behaving inappropriately or abusing him in any way, he just doesn't like her as much as the neighbour. He, on the other hand, generally behaves poorly with temper tantrums, bad manners, and throwing things at her (not constantly, just once a day or thereabouts, and she disciplines him appropriately).</p>

<p>To be honest, we've had better daycare providers in the past, but my wife says the problem isn't with her, it's with our son, and he'll get over it eventually. She has prior experience as a full-time nanny, and we both like her (in fact, she's a friend of ours), and we don't really have too much of a problem with the way she cares for the kids. It seems to just come down to a personality conflict. Our second son is only 14 months old, but he goes into a fit every time we leave him with her as well. </p>

<p>What do we do in this situation? Look for another daycare provider, or stick it out and hope things just get better somehow?</p>

<p>I recorded her cry for a while. Once she was relaxed again, I reproduced it next to her so she could hear it. I did this a couple of times on different moments. Surprisingly, in most of the cases she started to feel a bit anxious and, eventually, started crying again. Stopping the audio relaxed her again within seconds.</p>

"Why would a primary-schooler want to kill himself?","<p>My nine year old nephew told his (single) mother tonight that he wants to kill himself. What would prompt that?</p>

<p>backstory:</p>

<p>His father is ... upstate ... for a little while longer, and they do have regular face time with him, as often as they may. He and his mother at times get a little heated with each other, but by and large they get along well. I'm generally the closest thing he has to a positive male role model, but I don't get to see him near as often as would probably be best for him. He's going to spend some time with my wife tomorrow (that was already planned before this evening).</p>

<p>He doesn't have a history of that sort of attitude in general, and altho he's had a few bouts of anger in the past, by and large he's a pretty well adjusted little kid. He's incredibly gifted for his age, compared to his peers.</p>

<p>I don't know what was going on between them tonight, I just heard from her what he said, and she didn't want to talk about it too much, he was probably in the same room. I'm sure I'll see him at lunchtime tomorrow.</p>

<p>Do nine year olds ever talk like that as a way of pushing their boundaries? </p>

<hr>

<p>Update</p>

<p>So I had the chance to sit down with him and ask him why he said that, which was probably the wrong way to approach it, but never-the-less, what his own admission was after-the-fact was that he was pretty well just doing it for attention. We then had a short chat about how that's about the worst possible way to get attention, and we discussed the story of the boy who cried wolf, again, and I re-affirmed with him that if he ever felt like that, he could always talk to me about it.</p>

<p>There was some other conversation about kids and bullying tactics (name calling, picking on, general young boy activities) and so ... yeah.</p>

The account seems to have limited functionality, but still be in existence.  When I try to choose ""Manage Apps,"" it says ""You have not authorized any applications to access your Instagram account.""

<blockquote>

"potty training 3 days method - 22 months old - daycare problems","<p>We started potty training (22 month-old boy) about a week ago using a variation of the 3 day potty training method. 
He was ok at home: 5 days diaper free, about 1-2 accidents a day. Usually I ask him if he needs to go potty and then he sometimes agrees and may go again in a couple of minutes, because he likes it.
He's diaper free at naps and cries hard when I put diapers on him for a bedtime.</p>

<p>So it's not going badly at home, but in daycare he refuses to cooperate. </p>

<p>The problem is that after he had 2 accidents in daycare, they decided to put a diaper on him and continue the training with a diaper.
Also, their strategy (to put him on the potty every 30 min) apparently doesn't work for him. He sometimes cries when they try to put him there and lately he has stopped peeing in a potty.</p>

<p>Is it going to work? Should I insist and ask daycare to change their strategy? (not sure if that's possible)</p>

<p>Or should I just accept him being in diapers in the daycare until he moves to the next room - that's in 2 months?</p>

<p>P.S At home we constantly observe him, and notice when he signs or says that he needs to go potty. I'm not sure that at daycare they pay very much attention to him (10 kids in a room, 2 teachers)...</p>

"What to do about 13-month-old who cries and whines all the time?","<p>My 13-month-old daughter was very well behaved up until about 11.5 months. I guess it's separation anxiety but I've come to a point where I don't know what to do. It's making me miserable, exhausted, and, to be honest, resentful. I am also 16 weeks pregnant which is why I further need help in not allowing her to equate crying 24-7 equals getting whatever she wants. Or is she still too young to understand this?</p>

<p>She pretty much won't even let me use the bathroom without a fuss/whine/cry. About two weeks ago my family started noticing her change also. It took me by surprise that my then perfectly behaved baby has become this needy, clingy toddler without much warning. Like she started off only doing it to and around me, and not so much around my parents or my aunt when they babysit her for 1.5-3 hours.</p>

<p>She's started becoming more vocal to my parents recently, but even then it's not as bad as how she cries hysterically for like an hour or more when it's just us. I don't know if she's throwing a tantrum and I need to/should ignore her or if she's still too young and just wants my attention?</p>

<p>I'm honestly scared to death of it getting worse rather than progressively better by the time #2 arrives. This is my dilemma otherwise I'd spoil her and not blink because it would only be her to deal with, but it's not. I need more than just ""it's just a phase. It'll pass..."" so if you have specific examples, that'd be great. </p>

"17 Year Old Moving Out or Staying Home?","<p>I'm 17 years old, progressing through High School and a local ATC.</p>

<p>I have had some typical ""Grr teenager"" problems in the past that I really think I've moved past. I don't get into big fights with my parents, although I do have heated conversations with them from time to time.</p>

<p>While my parents insist otherwise, I feel the only option post-high school will be to move out, get a car/utilize public transit and finish out my ATC schooling before moving on to a college. They have said in the past I am welcome to continue living with them, but here's the problem: we don't see eye to eye on some key points.</p>

<p>This is mostly due to me having different religious views than my parents, and the way that they raised me. They're very disappointed, and as much as it hurts to see that, I get that part of being an adult is doing things regardless of social pressures.</p>

<p><em>So where is this all leading to?</em> you might ask. Well, I feel if I stay at home, I will still be treated like a child, for example, I would still be expected to arrive home before curfew. This is an example and I'm trying not to be specific.</p>

<p>The obvious con to moving out is it will cost me. Nobody else is going to be paying for me in the future, but is it worth it to really be the person I am? Right now, I'm going through the motions and living as a ""character"" if you will: something my parents are ok with that won't get me severely punished, etc.</p>

  <p>Even if a child doesn't show any such interest, family nudity could become a problem by age three, when it's believed that some children unconsciously become sexually stimulated by parental nudity, and are confused and embarrassed by these feelings.

"Is it bad being a ""bad influence"" for my younger cousin?","<p>First some background information:
I am a young woman in my early 20s, I lived alone since I was 18 relatively far away from home. 
I graduated top of my class and I am studying and working in IT. (side note: I am not financially dependent on my family)
My cousin is 14 (almost 15) and he visits a higher school where he struggles to keep passing.
No one in his close family graduated Germany’s most difficult school (in Germany there are 3 levels of difficulty to choose from), but they want him to study hard to make it. 
I am emotionally close to him and his grandmother, but no one else in his family.</p>

<p><strong>Now the story starts!</strong></p>

<p>My first cousin once removed and I used to play together when we were younger and I still lived with my parents. His family used to visit mine around 2-3 times a year. I was always like a bigger sister to him. </p>

<p>Naturally when I moved out he still wanted to meet me. His mother allowed it, and he also was allowed to go by train by himself. It is around a 5h trip.
He visited around once a year. He is really mature for his age and I was able to take him around the city show him places, go to fancy restaurants and play videogames in the evening. He could also eat chocolate and chips and drink Coke as much as he wanted. (he is doing different kind of sports 4 times a week and is a naturally skinny child; he also eats healthy the rest of the time).</p>

<p>We also discuss his future plans, I help him with bigger school projects (also via Skype when he is at home) because his parents can't. I am always there for him if he needs academic, emotional or any other kind of advice. </p>

<p>Now that he got older and went through puberty his mother keeps saying that he wants to be like me when he grows up and that I am being a horrible influence. She blames ALL the negative side effects of puberty on me, even though he sees me 2 days a year and her 363 days a year. We do message each other every other month. Also she doesn't forbid him to visit me but she talks bad about those visits in front of my family. I was always the black sheep in my family because I chose a ""male career path"" but I never cared what they thought.</p>

<p>Sadly, now I care. Because I care for my cousin. I personally believe that having a weekend of fun once a year can't possibly harm him, and that his mother is just looking for someone to blame instead of blaming her way of raising him.
At home he isn't allowed to drink or eat any sweets. He is only allowed to see friends if he passed all his classes with good grades. So that hasn't happenend in a long time. Video games are completly forbidden.</p>

<p>Now his father games a lot, he has been unemployed for a few years and played games almost the whole day. He even brags about doing so on social media. 
His father smokes a pack a day and recently my cousin told me he sometimes steals a few cigarettes and smokes them. I explained how harmful they are and that I wouldn't want him to smoke so he stopped. (At least that is what he told me)</p>

<p>I have the feeling his bad habits come from his dad or are just naturally because of his age. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Am I being a bad influence?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I restrict my contact to him?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I help him or his mother in any way? If yes, how?</p></li>
<li><p>Even if I am being a ""bad influence"", is it harmful for his<br>
development?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I do not have any children on my own but I am a godmother of one (2) and have 1 niece (7) and 3 nephews (1,4 and 9) which I spend lots of time with. 
I know it is not the same as raising the kids but being in a parenting like role is nothing new to me. </p>

<p>tl;dr:
Is gaming and eating junk food with an almost 15 year old once a year harming his development? </p>

I was overwhelmed by the maturity of our talk and the deepness of his thoughts. 
However I also found a time to talk to his mother in person and she did promise me to stop spreading any kind of information about me. Here a big thanks to <strong><em>Shauna</em></strong>! It really helped me seeing the role of a mother who wants the best for her child even though his mother was bad at showing so. </p>

<p>Even though the whole thing wasn't ""only"" a big understanding and there are still some kind of hard feelings on both sides, we (his mother and I) now do communicate more and I try to do some more things she also approves of. </p>

<p><strong>To answer my own questions:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Am I being a bad influence? </li>
</ul>

<p>No, I am not. Even his mother agreed after our talk.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I restrict my contact to him?</li>
</ul>

<p>No, I actually do have more contact with him and his family now. </p>

<ul>
<li>Can I help him or his mother in any way? If yes, how? Even if I am
being    a ""bad influence"", is    it harmful for his development?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I am now a part of his weekly school routine as a compromise, I get to continue with ""spoiling"" him, but also help him catch up with his school (even though I still think he shouldn't be there, I understand now that it is not my decision to make, so I am making the best out of it).</p>

<p>No it is not harmful to his development, see the accepted answer.</p>

"Does the Montessori method allow a child to choose the same lesson every day without guidance?","<p>My 7-year-old daughter goes to a Montessori school. For at least 3 months now, she has been choosing the same lesson every day. There have been new lessons given by the teacher, but it seems the level of interaction between the two is non-existent otherwise. </p>

<p>Montessori says it is child led, but there is no clear answer on at what point the teacher needs to drive the learning path to continue forward momentum. I want to understand the philosophy better for my parent teacher meeting in two weeks. I am going to discuss it either way, I know the response I get is ""Montessori is child led"", but I still believe there needs to be an adult in the room and I cannot find confirmation that at some point the teacher should guide her to try new challenges.</p>

<p>I know the program is child led, but does the teacher have a responsibility to guide her to something else? I am concerned that the teachers are just passing the buck to a 7-year-old. Is the Montessori method that hands off that she is free to do the same lesson everyday without guidance?</p>

"How to help a toddler go to sleep on their own?","<p>Our toddler is 2 and half, and has just started to become difficult at bedtimes.</p>

<p>We have always given her milk and held her until she goes to sleep. Once she goes off, she usually sleeps very well. However the last 2-3 weeks she no longer wants the milk, and no longer wants to go to sleep. As she is used to being held to go to sleep, if we put her straight into bed she goes mad; shouts, cries and quite quickly makes herself sick. We have never once got her to go to sleep like this. At the moment we are persevering with holding her, despite the struggle to go and play in the sitting room. Eventually she will go to sleep after an hour or two. However it seems like now might be the time to get her (and us) into a better sleeping routine/habit. </p>

<p>I know we have probably made a rod for our own back, by not tackling this sooner (in terms of helping her go to sleep on her own), but what would be the best way to transition?</p>

<p>She is still in her cot bed (which turns in to a bed once we lower the sides). Would it be better to turn it into a bed at the same time as getting her to go to sleep by herself? Or could this be worse?</p>

<p>Any other suggestions or ideas on how best to help our daughter go to sleep in her bed, rather than being held?</p>

"Are there adverse effects on a baby to see their parent talking to a toy?","<p>I have a small cuddly bear from very young and have had it for over 20 years. I have it on my pillow every night and talk to it just like I do to a pet cat. I have a very close bond to it and can't imagine living without it.</p>

<p>My wife thinks this is borderline mental disorder. She asked me to make binary choice of the bear or her early in our marriage, which led to a massive fight. Finally she was OK to live with it. </p>

<p>Recently we had a daughter. Now wife thinks my behaviour to the cuddly bear will make our daughter a psycho since it will make the baby believe cuddly bears talk back. So she demands I put it away.</p>

"Crying during bed-time routine?","<p>First time parents. We are sleep training our four month old daughter using CIO (full extinction), out of necessity as both of us need to work during the day. We started about 2 weeks ago, and so far it's going well: first night she cried for 23 minutes, fusses for 15 mins then falls asleep. And that was the longest cry. Now it's stabilized around 10 mins of moderate, on and off crying, followed by 10 mins of quiet fussing, before falling asleep. And she does not wake up crying during the night, except for 1-2 night feedings. Overall good improvement from before CIO.</p>

<p>But, 3 days ago something different started happening: she would start fussing and crying DURING her bed-time routine, in which her mom or I read her a picture book then swaddle her. It's not full crying, but a single cry here or there during reading. And she has a very serious and tense look. It's as of she knows she's about to be put in the crib in a dark room soon. Once put to the crib, everything is still as usual: she cries on and off for 10 mins, fusses quietly for 10 mins, then falls asleep, like clockwork.</p>

<p>She's otherwise fine: wakes up in the morning not crying, naps 4 times a day for 1-1.5 hrs each, smiles when played with, etc. While we both work, my in-laws are caring for her during the day and they didn't report any abnormal crying during the day.</p>

<p>Should I be concerned ? Is she developing negative association with sleep? Is she dreading sleep every night and knows it before being put to crib?</p>

"What if my parents get a divorce?","<p>I’m a 14 year old girl, and I was wondering what I should do if my parents want a divorce?</p>

<p>My parents (50 and 55) have been married for over 20 years. But I’ve noticed some things in the past year or two that put me on edge. Like they’d fight about the smallest things, like “Did you do this yet?” or something along the lines, then they’d fight back and forth because they misunderstood each other (this could be due to the fact that my moms second language is English). This happens every other week or so. Especially when our family goes on vacations, they fight even more.</p>

<p>My dad is more of a guy who plans things way ahead and gets upset and angry if things don’t go exactly his way. My mom is a little more flexible. Though, she just blames people for problems she created a lot of the time.</p>

<p>They both have a narcissistic parenting style. They never really gave my brother or I emotional support, but instead give us financial support, and so they ignore any mental illnesses that I tell them I have, no matter how much I explain. I know this, because about a year ago, our family went out to dinner. My brother told us that he’s depressed because we live in such a rainy place. My dad got angry, and threatened to leave the family. My mom made me swoop in, and fix everything. What if I had told him that I was actually depressed, would he have divorced my mother?</p>

<p>And ever so recently, my brother (16) has been playing video games, and his grades have been dropping. We aren’t supposed to play video games on the weekdays in the first place. My mom and dad have been arguing what to do with him. My mom told me my brother is going to be the reason they divorced. All of 3 of my dads siblings have gotten a divorce, so the signs are not well.</p>

<p>Another problem is, my mom is a stay at home mom, and didn’t finish college so if they divorce, it’s be hard for her to get a job. Because I do not plan on staying with my dad, despite him being the money maker. We disagree on things religiously and politically.</p>

<p>Sorry this is pretty long, any tips on what I should do? Thank you.</p>

"3-year-old says they need to go, then don't go","<p>My three year old daughter has routinely needed to use the toilet once at the beginning of bed time routine, and again at the end of the routine. However, she's started to say she needs to go at the end of the routine without actually producing anything. This has started happening at nap time too.</p>

<p>I don't want to discourage this kid; she basically trained herself starting almost a year ago, and has had nearly zero accidents... If she's little, and still figuring out the signals, and sometimes thinks she has to go but doesn't, then that's that, and we just have her go when she says she needs to. But the timing and lack of production are getting suspicious, and she's started the normal 3 year old developmental stage of manipulation... </p>

<p>Anyone else encounter this? Do we have her sit (for a timed amount) every time she says she needs to go? Or do we have her try, and not let her interrupt her quiet time to try again later? With the risk she'll go in her pull-up?</p>

"Is (supervised) play time alone beneficial for an infant/toddler?","<p>My son (currently 8 months old) is quite content to sit by himself and play with toys (blocks, toy cars, etc.).</p>

<p>We make sure that he spends time interacting with other children, and we also make sure that we spend one-on-one (and two-on-one) time playing with him, reading to him, singing, etc., and he clearly enjoys those activities.  However, he seems equally content to be on his own.</p>

<p>My assumption has been that play time without interacting with other people would help him develop some independence, and hopefully help teach him not to be bored when no one is actively entertaining him.  However, I don't really have any research, or even experience, to back this assumption up.</p>

<p>Is there benefit to him spending time playing solo?  Is there a certain amount of time he should spend playing by himself each day (or a limit to how much time he spends playing by himself)?  Does this change according to developmental stages?</p>

"How to encourage 9 year old to stop whining and independently practice their math?","<p>I live with my 9 year old cousin who dislikes and has been doing poorly in math.

<p>He seems to think he knows the material (the grades beg to differ, especially at this level when there shouldn't be part marks), and claims he knows the technique but just makes mistakes.

I was looking for any way to help make the kid less whiny about it to reduce what I perceive to be friction being generated in the household.

"When to allow children to consume sugar/candy/sweets/junk?","<p><strong>We have so far not allowed our toddler (20-months) any foods that contain sugar</strong> (chocolate, cake, sweets, sweetened juice, etc.) on the premise that consuming sugar is not <em>needed</em> and only causes trouble for the parents, in terms of risks of making the child a picky eater, trouble at mealtime caused by sweets in between meals, and health concerns like tooth decay. This also means that we politely turn down any sweets offered to the child by third parties. (It's amazing how rudely insistent strangers (e.g. waitresses) can be!)</p>

<p>We do allow normal healthy foods that taste sweet, like fruits and teas, but no fruit juices and no deliberately sweetened foods. </p>

<p>When we prepare meals, we add the seasoning/spices fairly late. This allows us to prepare some of the not-yet-seasoned food and prepare it for our toddler. We will then add spices to the rest of the food and finish cooking. I think the baby food we make is too bland for my (adult) taste, but then again the baby food you can buy in small jars is bland too. One reason is that small children should not consume too much salt. Another reason is that the child should have an honest chance to learn what the individual parts actually taste like: vegetables, potatoes, meats, all have distinct tastes that would be somewhat camouflaged behind seasoning. I'm sure my wife can think of a few more reasons.</p>

<p>So just like the sugar question, this begs the question:<br>
<strong>When to introduce spices/seasonings into a toddler's diet? Why <em>then</em>?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not deliberately taking any extreme stance; I am not asking <em>why allow children to experience spices.</em> I do believe that children have a right to experience spices at some point, just as much as they ought to learn the foods' individual tastes.

<p>(In our case, they will probably be primarily homeschooled... that probably changes some things, but the responses do not have to be limited to our situation.) </p>

<p>Do you have any siblings? Or children? What are the age differences? Can you reflect on any specific problems in your experience that an empathic parent might want to take into account?</p>

"How do we make our toddler less afraid of robots?","<p>I'm sure the headline made you curious? :-) But I'm serious, and I am not referring to toys but actual household machines. We have a Roomba floor vacuum cleaner and a lawn mower. </p>

<p>My 20-month son is afraid of these machines, even when they're parked and turned off. He will back away from them and start to whine. I've told him, and shown him, that the machines are harmless and not evil, but that didn't convince him.</p>

<p>He is not afraid of kitchen machines that are much more noisy. He's also (mostly) not afraid of the regular vacuum cleaner and the regular electric lawn mower that we also use, nor of other machines or cars, mopeds, bikes, etc. even if they are noisy. But he is afraid of the power drill. And terrified of mascots operated by a person inside (as in Disneyland).</p>

<p><strong>Do you have experience with similar situations? What can be the cause? What helped?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just to be clear, I'm well aware that any lawnmower can be very dangerous, and we make absolutely sure that there is no way for the lawnmower to get near our son. But he can still see it.</p>

<p><strong>Is it common behaviour in pre school kids? 
Do I need to forcefully control his watching habits or should I let him watch?</strong> </p>

<p>This may be a silly question to ask but might be faced by many of us. </p>

<p>Please help me in identifying problems in this, please let me know if I am worrying too much; TV, mobile phones and internet are all available to him at home. I am sure this must not be a new problem, I just need to know what should be my right behaviour on this, if someone had cracked this puzzle share your thoughts.</p>

<p>He is a single child at home, this may be the reason he is so attracted towards cartoons.</p>

<p>He hardly sits in one place, he continuously runs from one place to another. It's only television which keep him in one place for hours, sometimes both my partner and I allow him to watch TV just to avoid the running around.</p>

<p>I grew up in an age where we could barely watch TV or cartoons but these days I am not sure how to control it as so many options are available.</p>

"How can we discipline a strong-willed, misbehaving 5 year-old?","<p>My 5 year old son receives and fears punishment but repeatedly exhibits the same unacceptable behaviors.  He's always been strong-willed, and is usually the kind to view a statement like ""Don't do that"" as an open invitation to do it.  We've tried redirection or distraction tactics, but he is still so narrowly focused on doing the original behavior.  Even worse, he will typically do the prohibited behavior and flagrantly tell us or show us that he's done it.  Repeatedly, even after punishment.  (He's in time out right now for this very thing).  He's consistently punished, yet he continues down the same self-destructive path each time.  When he is punished, we explain what he did wrong, why he's being punished, and why he shouldn't do what he was told not to do.  Sometimes he'll even tell us first why he's in trouble, so it makes me wonder if he's acting out for the inevitable negative attention he gets.  I think he gets plenty of love and positive attention- he's an only child and stays with a relative during the day.  We're trying to give him a good, fun childhood, but we need to figure out how to effectively discipline him.  </p>

<p>His repeated misbehavior includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yelling at the top of his lungs in public (stores, friends' houses, etc)</li>
<li>Running away from us (at parks, stores, parking lots, etc)</li>
<li>Talking back and disrespecting authority figures</li>
<li>Hurting animals even after we explain why it's wrong</li>
<li>Repetitive nuisance behaviors (repeating himself, banging his fists, kicking walls, intentionally crumbling food on floors, etc)</li>
<li>Repeatedly asking us why he can't do something even after it's been explained to him</li>
<li>Basically, most bad behaviors that young children may do, but repeated over and over again, even after discipline</li>
</ul>

<p>He gets a warning to stop the behavior, then depending on the severity of what he's done (and where we are), he'll either go to time out or lose a privilege (such as taking away a favorite movie or missing out on an activity).  Going to time outs and losing privileges really upset him, but still do not ultimately deter him from the bad behavior.  It's like he can't help himself.</p>

<p>My spouse and I are getting worn down.  We try to model good behavior and encourage him to be well-mannered and respectful.  This behavior mortifies us.  It seems we can't even enjoy life as a family because our son is so disruptive and unresponsive.  Most public outings have to be cut short or eliminated because he consistently misbehaves and doesn't respond to our discipline.  After he's misbehaved, when we try to have heart-to-heart talks with him about his behavior and why we expect him to mind us, he usually has a little trouble expressing himself, and a lot of times we get the same nonsensical responses from him (Us: Why did you do [bad behavior]?  Him: Because I didn't want to).  He also doesn't like to make eye contact.  We don't usually feel like we've gotten through to him.</p>

<p>Is there another discipline tactic we could try?  Or does it sound like we need to see a professional at this point?  We're at a loss, and don't want things to spiral further out of control as he gets older (and even begins school).  We just want him to understand that his behavior isn't always acceptable.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Update (from comments below): My spouse and I disagree on spanking, as we had different experiences with it. He feels it's necessary sometimes. Since our son failed to improve after time outs and taking away items/privileges, I grew to agree with him and we used it for select bad behaviors. It didn't work any better. However, when he was spanked, he was always told why. I didn't mention that we have used it because I was afraid it would distract from the original question, but since it has already come up [in comments], yes, it has been explored, but with no better results than our other tactics.</p>

"Poop-training and cleaning up","<p>My three year old is 100% pee trained, even at night, but as with many little guys is not poop trained.  We started him in underwear, partly because preschool encouraged it and partly because he pee trained better - and we hoped poop would come faster.</p>

<p>Nope.  He's now in full resistance mode, ie, mommy sees him squatting, takes him into potty, he screams and stops pooping and then goes right afterwards in his underwear.  (Yes, we know this wasn't the right thing to do.)</p>

"How should we prepare for a parent-teacher consultation in preschool?","<p>Our very first parent-teacher consultation for our pre-schooler (almost three years old) is coming up. Because of that I'd like to bring some more attention to this question:
<a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/321/how-to-maximise-the-usefulness-of-parent-teacher-consultations"">How to maximise the usefulness of parent teacher consultations?</a>
 which had until now only one answer (albeit an excellent one from HedgeMage), but I would like to make it also more specific about preschool.</p>

<p>In our experience communication between teachers and parents in (this) preschool is quite different from daycare. It's not impossible to have contact with the teacher during the schoolyear but it takes more effort then at our daycare where we regularly had an informal conversation about our child with the caregivers. Altough we have the impression she is doing ok, this lack of communication makes us a bit unsure about what our child does at school, how she behaves and if she feels well. In a way we expect to get more insight in how she is doing.
Altough we have some small comments on how things are going I have no reason at all to distrust the school or the teacher. Still I have some irrational ""first child paranoia"" and I would like to gain some trust in the school.</p>

<p>I know I can not expect to change all this with this one consultation but still I want to take as much out of it as possible.</p>

<p>Which information should the teacher give us?</p>

<p>What questions should we ask to make sure our child is feeling well at school and is getting the education (as far as education goes at preschool) she needs?</p>

<p>Which questions illuminated things for you, about the time your child spends at school, or exposed aspects of your child you did not know of?</p>

"No BM control; what does this mean for training?","<p>My daughter is 2 years, 7 months old, and we started potty-training her two months ago. She's gotten to the point where she's great at peeing - not only no accidents, but all-around promptness, awareness and control - but has no control at all over bowel movements. This might actually be a full-blown regression, since she used to sometimes make them on the potty, but in the past couple of weeks she never does. Also, her BM timing is extremely unreliable - she seems to need to go at vastly different times from day to day.</p>

<p>I'm not seeing any obvious problem. She's generally cheerful and likes going to the potty; she doesn't seem anxious about it (though sometimes she is not shy about not wanting to go :P). We're always encouraging and we try to avoid any sense of pressure. A lot of the <a href=""http://www.supernanny.co.uk/Advice/-/Health-and-Development/-/0-to-4-years/Elizabeth-Pantleys-Potty-Training-Tips-part-two-poo-problems.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">online advice I've found</a> says the likeliest culprits are stool consistency, and discomfort on the potty, but I'm not seeing any signs of either of those. Possibly she isn't ready yet, and we've simply started too early. It's very hard to say.</p>

<p><strong>This being the case,</strong> and assuming we don't see drastic improvement quite soon - <strong>how should we continue with her training?</strong> We've heard a lot of advice frowning on returning to diapers, and that seems like it would undermine all the progress we've made over the past couple of months. On the other hand, I don't know that it's good for her to be ""missing"" all the time - all the cleanups, ""boring"" time waiting on the potty, a sense of failure, getting asked if she needs to go... I'm worried that if this builds up over time, it might stress her out.</p>

<p><strong>What options should we consider?</strong> Tough it out? Take a break? Or is there some middle-way compromise, something we can do to take the pressure off of pooping without going back to diapers?</p>

"How to teach tact and empathic understanding based communication to an INTJ (overly honest) child?","<p>My daughter is in her early 20's. She has proven to be ""overly honest"" time and again. She has pretty much remained at an even level since around 10 years old, though, in terms of this issue. While this personality trait has been a joy in many regards and has allowed extremely high levels of trust and even a loving relationship that I think would not be possible otherwise, it has caused a lot of social pain within and without the family.  </p>

<p>It has just now become something that I feel like I must address as it is causing a lot of relationship issues that reach outside of our personal sphere of influence. She has expressed her desire to change if she could understand what to change and feels that no one has been able to explain to her, with enough precision, the problem so that she can actually pursue a change and still feels others should be the ones doing the changing.</p>

<p>The tendency to think that she's always right is compounded by the fact that she very nearly is always correct.  This then has caused her to approach things in a <strong><em>slightly</em></strong> less than socially acceptable way, especially with those who are (perhaps overly) sensitive.  Usually she is cognizant enough to not be outright mean, but tone has been her particular downfall.  It is easily perceived by the recipient of her suggestions that she is harsh, angry, uncaring, insensitive, or otherwise harbors negative will in her (generally accurate) assessment.</p>

<p>While this amazingly insightful input well surpasses her years and personal experiences, it has gotten to the point where correctness and insight no longer matter since it is breaking down and poisoning relationships both within and without of the family.</p>

<p>I wanted to get a little more foundation on my approach to the situation, so I suggested that she take a personality test.  I was little surprised when she came back with an INTJ personality (even though women of this personality type are especially rare, forming just 0.8% of the population).  Interestingly she was about at a 1 on the T aspect and so she could have nearly fallen into the F category there and thus is quite balanced between these two aspects in her personality.</p>

<p>I had a very lengthy (elevated) dialogue recently with her wherein we reached quite the impasse.  The only thing that I could suggest for her was to try to build an allegorical comparison of how her communication is more like a person who is standing in front of someone and shouting at them to ""look over there at this thing!"" vs standing beside the person with her arm around them while saying, ""look over there at that thing.""  I tried to explain that it is not about changing her message, but rather to simply change the way the message is conveyed and / or its frame of reference.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately she expects (more than several) other people in our family, and out of our family, to try to change to match her communicative needs vs attempting to understand how to modify her own output and, possibly, expectations.  I fear that this is about to cause an overwhelming emotional explosion or implosion for her.</p>

<p>Our debate ended with my suggesting that she read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" by Dale Carnegie.  This was countered with a severe questioning of how a book can change the situation and cause others to change their minds and negative reactionary response to her input to them.  I could only really tell her that it will do so by helping her to understand other people's communicative wants / needs on a different level that will help her to change her approach.  This was not very palatable for her and she has little to no confidence that this can help.</p>

<p><strong>What suggestions (<em>especially in the realm of self help</em>) might you have regarding dealing with such a particular situation in terms of helping a loved one, like this, to understand their own personal need to change in order to effectively participate in familial and societal relationships?</strong></p>

<p>I am, obviously, particularly interested in actionable material that would help one to change their personal frame of reference and help them to understand how to properly frame their output for others.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other books or training material (video, audio, etc.) that you think could help that go above and beyond Dale Carnegie's book?</strong></p>

<p>I am desperate to help her to move through this and I know that if she can simply discover the solution herself by consuming proper information and insight (vs my trying to ram it down her throat), she'll be absolutely one of the most remarkable people with whom to associate for others.</p>

"As an adult, how to react when parents try to micromanage","<p>I’m 26 and have a turbulent relationship with both my parents (who are now separated). For example, my dad was just helping me move some boxes and my bike with his car. Parts of it were nice, he bought me a couple slices of pizza and we talked. Parts were not so nice, he got really mad and accused me of not having my things ready.</p>

<p>When we arrived at my home I took the bike off the car and went to lock it up. My dad got really mad and told me not to waste time locking my bike and come help him carry more things. I asked why he was mad and he said he shouldn’t be the one lifting my boxes while I locked up my bike. My home is shared with lots of people and I think I was in the better position to decide to lock the bike right away, and I think my dad was out of line telling me what to do (anyway, it takes just 2 minutes to wrap a lock around the bike). Then we went inside the house and I took off my boots. My dad got mad at me for taking my boots off, as he thought I had forgotten to bring in some boxes that were sitting right at the door. So I kicked him out. He asked if he could use the bathroom and I said no (though I do feel bad about it), and I locked the door behind him. Did I do the right thing? I’m not sure what other options I had? I find it very disrespectful of him to talk to me this way, especially in front of the people I live with. In general I find both my parents extremely bossy and don’t know how to react to it.</p>

<p>The reasons I kicked him out were a) I didn't like the way he was talking to me b) I wanted to teach him a lesson so he wouldn't do it again. c) I wanted to make clear he was in my place and he's a guest there and had to follow my rules, not the other way around.</p>

<p>I know when someone does you a favor, it’s nice to help them back, but you do reserve the right not to. I definitely feel bad about kicking him out, and have thought of apologizing, but then I realize I probably did the right thing. </p>

"How to react to my 9-year-old excessively pouting and trying to get away?","<p>My son is 9 years old. I would describe him as emotionally immature for his age. </p>

<p>He gets upset easier than other kids and tends to pout when he is especially upset about not getting his way. I do not cater to this or comfort him, but I do sometimes get mad. I realize that pouting will go away on its own if it gets ignored (something I'm working on). But what really gets to me is when he tries to create physical distance. </p>

<p>Here's an example - We're sitting at a parade and he and his sister get into an argument. I tell him to stop what he's doing and then out comes the lip and the smooshed up eyebrows. I could handle ignoring that if that's all that it was. But he has to take it further by moving his chair far away from everyone, despite me telling him to leave his chair where it is. He also accomplishes this distance gain by walking at snail pace and dragging his feet, and sometimes even crawling on the floor, again super slow. </p>

<p>Do I treat this all the same and ignore it altogether? What do I do when he's about to make me late, etc. because I have to wait for him to slowly crawl to the door, slowly put his shoes on, and finally stand up to leave? It drives me MAD!</p>

"What devices should toddlers be allowed to use?","<p>There has been some work on the use of technology by toddlers (for example, <a href=""http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/95402302/revisiting-early-use-technology-critical-shift-from-how-young-too-young-to-how-much-just-right"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paper</a>). By and large, there are some advantages to the use of some of these technologies by children. For example, even two-year-old children started collaborating more and working in concert even when they were using their personal iPads (see link above). But there are other disadvantages that might arise through technology use such as access to violence (<a href=""http://www.children-and-technology.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/children_0-8_and_digital_technology_UK_report_2015.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>).  </p>

"Effects on children and parents of marriage breaking up","<p>Me and my wife have a two year old son and he is amazing and I love him wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the relationship between my wife and I has frayed to the point where I no longer see a good outcome. Some of the issues are old, before him, and have been brought back up because of added responsibility and my unforgiving work schedule.</p>

<p>I can't tell if she's talking or not.  When family members are around or babysitting they will say ""she said hi, and ball, and daddy"".  But I have never heard her say any of those things.  She says ""da"" a lot, but rarely exactly twice (sometimes ""Da"" other times ""dadadadada"").  Sometimes she says it when she sees her daddy, and sometimes when she sees her mommy, and plenty of times for no particular reason.   A few weeks ago she said something like ""book"" while we were reading, but she hasn't said it since.</p>

<p>So my question is.... how do I know when she is actually talking?  Since ""da"" has been her favorite syllable for months, how will I know when she says ""dada""? </p>

We have one that we borrowed from friends, but it takes up a fair amount of space in our tiny apartment. Plus, the ground is cold right now, so he seems less inclined to spend time on there. Since he is not yet sitting up, it seemed like I could string a makeshift gym across the top of his crib to put up for him to play with in there. A few questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Any major safety concerns with this I might not have considered? I plan to take it down when baby isn't playing (e.g., when sleeping), will discontinue use after he can sit up, and will ensure that the toys are out of reach.</p></li>

"Is crib use (mostly) universal?","<p>We have friends who decided against a crib in favor of a futon mattress on the floor. This idea came from the book <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805211128"" rel=""noreferrer"">Montessori from the Start</a>. The benefits for the baby are that they aren't confined and can start exploring their (safe) room as soon as they can crawl and it's supposedly safer since they aren't going to fall from high up. The benefits for the parents supposedly are that during sleepless nights you can lay on the floor next to them instead of staying bent over the crib for a long time.</p>

<p>We've been considering doing the same once our boy is too big for his bassinet but I'm somewhat skeptical considering that most people in the world who live in houses or apartments use cribs. So, there must be major benefits to having the baby high off of the ground and surrounded by bars, right?</p>

<p>Of course, this is based off of my assumption that crib use is universal (for people who have the room and can afford them). Is this truly the case? What are the popular alternatives?</p>

She said that she now has thoughts of girls kissing and it makes her sick, she sometimes gets butterflies in her tummy when she sees girls. She is terrified to being lesbian. She asked me if she might be. I said that those feelings would not make her feel bad if she were.  I believe that those feelings would make her feel good. We are tolerant to gay and lesbian community, but we don't know anyone who is. She said she has feelings like this with boys also.  She is so anxious about being gay that she keeps asking for my reasurance several times a day.  When I said to her that she may feel that these feelings are normal, she is terrified that she will change and like the thoughts about girls.  I just want to help my daughter.

"How do I get my father to stop making everything about him","<p>My father is a very demanding person, to the point of being unreasonable a lot of the time IMO. But lately it has been getting worse and I feel like i just don't have the energy to deal with it because it all seems so petty.</p>

<p>I am married with two children, a 4 year old and a 3 month old We live about 2 hours away from him. Most of the disagreements we have are about him being able to see our children, basically he can see them whenever he wants but he demands that we take them down there to see him, which is difficult because of the distance. He is divorced from my mother, who sees the children more often because she lives closer.</p>

<p>Some specific examples of his behavior I have a problem with are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>when our youngest son was born he had a serious heart condition that needed several risky operations. We choose to stay in hospital with him in case anything went wrong, so we could say good bye. During this time my eldest son was being looked after by my mother because it was the easiest and most convenient option at the time. My father took this as some sort of personal insult that we didn't let him look after our eldest son and actually phoned me to discuss it with me which I thought was very selfish and inconsiderate of him considering what we were going through at the time.</p></li>
<li><p>when we came out of hospital my father wanted my eldest son to go and spend a couple of days with him. We didn't think it was a good idea because he had already been away from us for two weeks and we didn't want him to be insecure or feel pushed out by the new baby. It might have felt like we were sending him away. So we told my father that he would be able to visit only after a couple of months had passed when he was on summer holiday from school. In response to this my father wrote me a letter accusing me of wanting to punish him by stopping him from seeing his grandson. </p></li>
<li><p>He asks us to go down there at short notice, this causes two problems. The drive down there causes my significant neck and back pain and usually triggers a migraine which will stay with me all weekend. I have a very stressful job and I need to relax to be in any fit state to go to work the following week, taking a 4 year old and a newborn away for the weekend i find very stressful and does not allow me the time I need to decompress. So when i refuse to go he asks me why I don't want to go and see him, I do not know how to respond to that because it isn't that I don't want to see him just that we have other things that have to be the priority.</p></li>
<li><p>He instant messages me at work and if i don't respond almost immediately he will ask me why I am obviously ignoring him. I answer him when I can, but my main responsibility is to do my work and I cannot always answer him right away.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Am I being unreasonable? If not, how can I get him to see that his behavior is inappropriate and to back off?</p>

"Toddler won't swallow or spit out food sometimes","<p>Sometimes around dinner my 21 month old toddler will eat reasonably well, and we don't try to force him to eat if he doesn't want anymore.  He loves fruits, grains and meats and seems to tolerate vegetables.</p>

<p>We will let him down from his chair when he starts playing with his food, or throwing it at the dog, that is generally when he is not hungry anymore.  We usually keep his plate up on the counter though because he doesn't always eat everything and 10 to 30 minutes later he will often try to reach for it because he would like another bite.  When we give the other bite, he will just kind of let it sit in his mouth and he won't swallow it, sometimes for a half hour or more.</p>

<p>We have tried convincing him to swallow, giving him water or juice, bribing with a cookie, convincing to spit it out into our hands, he just doesn't seem to want to.  I am not sure if it is a burgeoning rebellion in him but when we ask him to do something like this he gets this devious smile and joyfully tells us ""NO"".</p>

<p>It is concerning for me and I press it because he plays very rough and I am afraid he will choke on it.  Thank god this hasn't happened yet.</p>

<p>I have also tried timeout but when I put him in his timeout chair he breaks down into a complete tantrum with wildly throwing his body back into his chair further increasing the risk he is going to choke.  The last time I did this he begrudgingly swallowed but then gagged and threw up everywhere.</p>

<p>Is this behavior normal?  Do you have any advice or suggestions to help with this situation?  I don't want to not feed my child when they ask me for food.</p>

"Letting a newborn sleep - bassinet or full-sized baby bed?","<p>Is it a bassinet really necessary for a newborn? </p>

<p>We are expecting our first in a bit less than half a year. We have been asked if we want to use the family heirloom bassinet, and we really can't decide what to do, and lack of experience doesn't help. The problem is that my sister-in-law is expecting her second one only three months before us, and will use the bassinet for at least the first three months, depending on whether or not we want it too. It feels like snatching it from her, even though she kindly offered it to us.</p>

<p>We were originally thinking about going straight to a full-sized baby bed, partly because we don't have much space and we'd like to cut back on anything that isn't essential; however, my mother-in-law told me that a bassinet would be more suitable for a newborn as it fits snugly around the baby. </p>

<p>Is this true, does a newborn really sleep better in a bassinet?</p>

<p>The other thing we're wondering about is where the baby would sleep, and this might also influence the question if we need the bassinet, as our bedroom is so small that a baby bed won't fit, but a bassinet will. Our bedroom is one floor above the rest of the apartment incl. baby room, and the spiral stairs are pretty narrow. This makes me anxious about having to go downstairs 3x or more every night for feeding. If the baby room had been right next to ours, I would probably let the baby sleep in the baby room pretty quickly, but as it is with the stairs, I am strongly considering keeping it in our room for at least the first few months. On the other hand, I know that many baby sleep experts do not recommend this, and I'm really hoping we can get our baby to sleep well once it's a few months old. </p>

<p>What are your experiences, will keeping the baby in our bedroom for the first few months affect it's sleeping pattern beyond a few days/weeks? In a scenario as ours, will keeping the baby in our bedroom vs going downstairs be a big difference?</p>

<p>Instead of chewing, she usually uses her tongue to eat rather then chew the food with teeth. I try to encourage her as much as I can by showing her, playing with her, showing how other kids are having food but still she is doing the same thing.</p>

<p>I am becoming so fed up with her actions. She either keeps food in her mouth or spits it out. I told this to the doctor but the doctor said let her feed herself. By doing that I see that she is remaining hungry whole day. She does not understand the feeling of hunger so either she is sleepy or getting cranky. It is frustrating too. It has been 3 months since I started this process of giving her totally solid food like we have. </p>

<p>My 7 year old son goes to a good school and has slightly above average grades. but the teachers almost certainly don't realise the amount of private lessons he is taking to augment his learning.  It is quite probable that without these extra lessons he would fall towards the bottom of the class.  </p>

<p>Other possibly relevant information -
My son loves reading.
My son speaks English natively, and we live in an English speaking country.
My spouse and other family members do not speak English natively - English is not typically spoken at home except by/for me.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is Kumon English lessons which he <strong>hates</strong> (and has hated for the 2 years he has been doing it)  It is always a struggle to get him to do it - to the point I feel its breaking up our family.  No amount of incentives can get him to focus on it.   My spouse - and her  community (of rich parents of the same ethnicity)  is, however, insistent that my son needs to continue with Kumon.</p>

<p>Sitting down with him over the last few days to try do it with him, I discovered that it is extremely repetitive.  I don't have a background in education and repeating the identical questions multiple times does not make a lot of sense to me - and sadly, my son does not seem good at remembering previous answers.</p>

<p>So My questions -</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it actually beneficial to force my son to continue to do Kumon ?</li>
<li>Would replacing Kumon with reading books have a similar benefit ?</li>
<li>Are there other programs which take a different approach which may be 
easier and as beneficial to my son ?</li>

He says a ""switch goes off in his brain"" when he comes to my place and although he tries to be good, he can't.</p>

<p>He isn't horrifically bad - just you know, whines for junk food even after I say no, takes me five times to instruct him before he does something, gets too rambunctuous and after several ignored warnings ends up hurting himself, or the baby or breaking something -  that sort of thing. But at the end of a long day, I'm yelling, he's crying, everyone is hot and bothered - and it isn't pleasant at all. And bad role modelling for the baby. </p>

<p>He is quite a sensitive soul, but has loads of energy and often acts before he thinks. </p>

I tried to engage him into eating or drinking something since last Friday, but for the last twenty-four hours, he's refused to eat.</p>

<p>I read that nobody can survive without water for three days, and food for three weeks, but I can't explain to him that if he doesn't at least drink something I will have to take him to the hospital. What's more, he won't let anyone poke him or prod him while he's awake. :/
Normally, we would know if he was sick or had an upset stomach, but he appears to be well, otherwise. I wonder if the experience with the new assistant had traumatised him to where he's depressed? This kind of behaviour has never happened before. He's always had a good appetite, grabbing for food whenever he was hungry. He has no other condition that I am aware of that could hinder his ability to feel hunger or pain.

If he doesn't eat in an hour, I will call his on-call physician.</p>

"4 languages... are we going to overload our child?","<p>My husband and I are native speakers of 2 different Languages. Lets say mine is A and his is B. We both can speak and understand the other language - with varying fluencies. He speaks my native language (A) better than I speak his, so we speak ""A"" at home. It's become the dominant language for us now. So our child will definitely first learn A, and probably learn it the best. His parents though, speak only his native language - B, and we'd want our child to be able to communicate with them comfortably when we/they visit. So that's the story of A and B.</p>

<p>Now, we have just recently moved to Italy with our 4 month old. Once we get her into a day care and play groups, she'll naturally pick up Italian. That's already 3 languages. But we may not always be in Italy, and when we move to an English speaking country, we don't want her to be at a disadvantage. Especially if we move once she's a little older, and unable to learn a new language as easily as a toddler would. So we'd like to try and teach her English too, at which we are both quite proficient.</p>

If not, how do we go about incorporating both English and our secondary language B into her everyday life?</strong> (I'm not asking specifically about language A and Italian, because I figure those will happen naturally)</p>

<p>Are we dealing with separation anxiety or is this closer to night terrors? She always seems awake and aware when she has a screaming jag. We haven't had trouble waking her, so I am thinking it could be separation anxiety. We recently took a 3 week vacation overseas and it was hard for her to adjust to the time change and jet-lag...could that be the reason for these outbursts?</p>

<p>Whatever it is, these tantrums are very scary...I am not sure now whether I should pick her up at night or not. I can't stand the thought of letting her scream alone...and when I go to her and try to comfort her while leaving her in the crib she becomes even more angry.</p>

"As an agnostic how to respond to my toddler who points out to god and folds her hands to pay respect to it?","<p><strong>Child is 2 years 2 months old.</strong></p>

<p>I am an agnostic.<br>
I don't want my child to believe in God until she is 20 years old. Reason is that I believe that if the child below that age is repeatedly told by her elders to pray to god, that the god exists, and the god can punish them if they don't - then I think the child will follow what the elders say because of her lack of world experience and because of her trust in her elders. </p>

<p>After she is 20, I can reveal to her the world history (wars, natural calamities, gas chambers etc.) and I can tell her why I turned agnostic. Then if she thinks it is wise to pray to god or to demons - I simply won't interfere. It would be totally her decision.</p>

<p>I live among believers. My in laws have shown some photographs of Hindu gods to her and have taught her to fold her hands as a mark of respect.  </p>

<p>Child has learnt that and follows the practice whenever she sees a photo of those gods.</p>

<p>I live in India. There is a huge cultural difference as compared to western countries. Therefore it is simply not possible to tell the in-laws to not talk about god to the child.</p>

<p>The in-laws don't live with us. They live far away. But, every year for 2-3 weeks we have to visit them, and they also visit us the same way.</p>

"Babbling - encourage babbling in 2 yo with glue ear?","<p>What does the best research say about babbling, and whether it should be encouraged, ignored, or discouraged?</p>

<p>Would early deafness make a difference to that advice?</p>

<p>I've been told that babbling is fine; and to repeat the sounds back sometimes is good.  Babbling lets children explore and develop their tongue and mouth.  And repeating the babbling back to them lets them know that they can make a noise that people will respond to, which encourages them to talk.  If they try to say a word you model the correct word, and reply to the question / demand.</p>

"How to tell my parents I want to marry my girlfriend","<p><strong>Background info</strong></p>

<p>I'm a 20 y/o guy living with my parents in the Netherlands. When I was 16, I unintentionally met an American girl online whom I fell in love with and we have had a great relationship for 3 years now. We've seen each other a lot of times (usually 3 times per year for around 3 weeks per visit, during summer usually longer). She has been at our house for a long period once and I have been at their house many times. Her family loves me very much, has given us financial support so that we can be together more often and all the signs say that I want to be with her forever. I love the U.S.A. and I would love to live and work there after we graduate.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Her family loves me, but my parents don't really seem to like her. Due to the language barrier and her having some social awkwardness issues, she isn't very close with my family. She has been at our house for 4 weeks when the two of us really enjoyed our time together. When she went back home and I asked my mother afterward how they experienced those 4 weeks, the reaction I got back from her made me feel depressed for about two weeks, not exaggerating (it wasn't anything positive at all). It basically came down to the fact that they had a terrible time because she was here, I still don't really understand why... I never asked my dad what he thought because I'm afraid to get burned to the ground again. My parents tell me that she is still welcome over here, but that they hope things will be different next time.  But my girlfriend doesn't feel welcome anymore (which I understand) and I'm afraid to get her at our house again.</p>

<p>During Christmas, I was over there and I really enjoyed my time there and so did her family. They always tell me how welcome and loved I am in their family and that they will do anything for the both of us. I want to propose to my girlfriend and she wants to be engaged, too, thus I asked for her father's blessing behind her back which was a big ""yes absolutely""  and it made him very happy. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I'm afraid to tell my parents I want to marry her. I don't feel like they are supporting us in our relationship at all. I don't have a great relationship with my parents (and never had), have small fights with them every now and then, they seem to care barely about me and I don't really feel like they see me, especially since my sister got married and moved out and now I'm the only child in the house. </p>

<p>How do I tell my parents that I want to marry her and move over there in a few years? I'm afraid they will start yelling at me, disallow me to do that, or that it will make the relationship with my parents even worse than it already is. I don't know what to do or how to tell them that I even asked for her dad's blessing. I'm afraid I will mess up things and make things only worse when I tell them. Do I even need to tell them my plan of proposing at all? I don't know what to do in this situation and it's really stressing me out. Any help is appreciated.  </p>

In those cases he would just walk up to his sister (or mother on one occasion) and just swing at them without any apparent provocation from their side. </p>

<p>This is worrying me, so I wanted to get advice on how to deal with this as he is too young to take any conversational feedback besides just saying ""No"" but that doesn't seem to be stopping him so far from doing it again.  I can't see timeouts or similar things working for a 16 month old.</p>

"How to stop 1-yr old from kicking us while sleeping","<p>Our daughter is one year old.  We've been co-sleeping, but about two weeks ago we started transitioning her to her own room.     We rock her down and put her to sleep in her room. When she wakes up (usually in 1-2 hours) and starts fussing, we get her and bring her back to our bed and go back to sleep.   Sometimes she gets to a full cry before we get to her, but usually we are there before she's too upset.</p>

<p>However, despite our attempt to be as non-traumatic with this transition as possible, she's suddenly gotten very squirmy when she's cosleeping with us.   She'll twist about till she's lying perpendicular between us, and then start kicking her dad. A lot.   </p>

<p>I don't know if it's related to the transition to her bed, or if it's just a natural development for her age, but I don't know what to try to get her to stop.</p>

<p>It's almost always when she's nursing - she used to nurse very easily lying down.  She'd be lying parallel to me, she'd be mostly still, we'd both drift back to sleep ... Now, if she's nursing (or just before or just after), she's in constant motion, either maneuvering herself into the perpendicular, head twisted position that she favors now (cannot understand why, but there it is), or kicking her dad, or hitting me.   </p>

<p>She doesn't hit hard - just a rhythmic, keep-the-beat kind of thing.  But she kicks a lot harder.  Usually she is drumming her poor father in his chest, but she's managed to kick his face a few times, as well as lower.  Which makes sleeping pretty difficult for him.</p>

<p>We can't tell her no; she's not really awake.   And I can hold her hand while nursing, but I can't hold her feet as well or keep her from twisting all around.   If I sit up and pull her into my lap to nurse, she is still - but then I don't get any sleep.</p>

<p>How can I get her to stop kicking and stop squirming when she's sleeping?   Or how long should we expect this phase to last?   Is there anything my husband can do to keep the kicking at bay?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<ul>
<li>Far the 'how long will this last??' question - just a few weeks.  2 months later, she's almost completely transitioned to her own bed, and the few times she does sleeps in our bed, she is good.</li>
<li>We found that giving her a high-protein meal soon before bedtime helped her reach a sound sleep faster and stay there longer.   The schedule is a scrambled egg, bath, nursing and reading, and then bed.    That gives us 4-6 hours before she rouses (yah!)</li>
<li>I did finally figure out that the trade-off with sleeping in her own bed is that I can't do the lay-down nursing anymore.    When she wakes at night, she needs the comfort of being held in a lap as much as anything else - the comfort of lying down again doesn't cut it.   This is much easier to do now that I'm getting 4-hour stretches of sleep  :)</li>
<li>We also found the right comfort items to put in bed with her and her preferred sleep temperature.  She also sleeps better (ie, without kicking and thrashing) if she's had her naps, and when she isn't teething.   So many variables!</li>

"How to address preschooler lying","<p>My 3.5 years old recently started lying. Up to now, they where mostly ""I didn't do this"" type of lies. For exemple, he would unroll the toilet paper in the bathroom or put play-doh in the washer (!) and then pretend he didn't do it. Sometimes he would even come get me to look at his wrong doing and then tell straight to my face that he didn't do it. I didn't make a big deal of it because I figured he was experimenting with lies and it was pretty much inoffensive. My typical reaction was to say something like ""look, I now you did this, now help me clean"". He then stopped pretending he didn't do it, helped me clean and sometimes said he was sorry.</p>

<p>But yesterday, there was an incident at daycare. When I picked him up, there was a bracelet hidden in his case. He said a friend (let's call him John) gave it to him. Something was strange with his behaviour but I went with it and he brought the bracelet home. Once home, he wanted to hide it in his room and didn't wear it at all, which I found suspicious. This morning, at breakfast, he asked where was his bracelet and when I asked once again where he got it, he finally admitted that the bracelet belongs to Claire. John took it from Claire's case and gave it to my son, then he hid it in his case. Claire was giving the bracelets to her friends and my son wanted one, John knew and they did this. </p>

<p>So I explained to him how it was wrong to take other people's things and that he will have to give the bracelet back and apologize to Claire, which he did. I think he understood this part well (clearly he knew it was wrong, because he lied about it). However, I'm a bit at lost when it comes to make him understand that lying was also wrong. He lied to me by saying that John gave it to him and not saying the truth that they took it from Claire without her knowing. I think he doesn't really understands the words ""lie"" and ""truth"" and I struggle to find simple words to explain to him that lying is wrong, it upsets people and it could get him in much more trouble. It's somewhat of an abstract and new concept for him.</p>

<p>How can I address the lying? Do you know of any good resources (books, etc.) that might help?</p>

"Explaining Teen Pregnancy to Young Child","<p>So, my six-year-old daughter has understood that babies come from a ""special kind of hug"" done between the mommy and daddy.  I should clarify that she has actually seen sex on a farm between animals and labeled it ""hugging"" herself when she saw it (though she couldn't really see the exact mechanics).  I should also clarify that she already knows all the terminology for both the male and female anatomy and that the ""special hug"" requires no clothing and an older age than she is at now.  I have used the term sex with her, but she prefers ""special hug"" and has clearly shown she isn't ready to fully grasp the mechanics part yet.  </p>

<p>However, she put two and two together herself when she asked how babies were made and I answered something akin to when two people really love each other, they can get together and choose to make a baby together.  She actually asked, ""is it like the special hug the donkey's did?"" I answered, ""It can be.""  The confusion lies in the ""choice"" part.  She understands this hug cannot be made accidentally and even that requires removing clothes, but is now confused because her youngest aunt (my youngest sister in law and who ran away from home) has now sent out an announcement and photo to all of us that she just had a baby.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of conversation about it now over the holiday.  My daughter has always just figured that special hug happened between two people that were married and though I didn't purposefully plant this idea, I didn't correct it when she expressed it either.</p>

<p>Needless to say, my six-year-old has some questions:</p>

<p>""Why did Auntie do the special hug when she isn't ready for a baby?"" being one of the main ones.</p>

<p>I do want her to get the idea that the ""special hug"" is generally reserved for much older members of society and that have a monogamous relationship without getting into too much detail or sounding too judgemental while also answering her question honestly.  </p>

<p>My youngest sister in law is getting a lot of critique, because she is young, without an income, and without the means to truly care for this baby - subjects that are complex to broach with a six year old especially when sex is wrapped up in an already complex topic.</p>

<p>""Your aunt made a dumb-f*ck decision"" - The answer my lovely father in law inserted and that thankfully, my daughter didn't quite catch - seems highly inappropriate to me as I'd like to be a little more sensitive to my sister-in-law and her baby even if it wasn't the smartest choice in the world.  After-all, we all make mistakes. </p>

How does one go about this when these are his only friends? (Please see edit based on comments before answering. Thanks.)</p>

<hr>

<p>My son is ten years old and will be eleven this summer. For the past half year he has been playing <em>Clash of Clans</em> and <em>Clash Royale</em> on his mobile phone.</p>

<p>For those of you who are not familiar with free-to-play mobile online games, search for ""Clash of Clans addiction"" or ""Clash Royale addiction"" to learn more. In short, the games are designed specifically to induce addiction-like behavior in its players. For example, certain quests can only be played on certain days and the trophies that you have won are not available immediately, but on certain other days, so that players want to be online to play and claim their trophies, making it difficult to abstain. There are other attractors, such as an in-game social network, ""clans"" that you must regularly participate in, time sensitive enhancements, and so on. On top of that, game play is significantly obstructed if you don't buy certain enhancements, and my son has begun to spend his pocket money for them.</p>

<p>I have observed how my son and his friends, who all play the game too, have changed over the past months. My son can no longer think of anything else. Everything he says or does, outside of school and homework, is related to the game. When he visits his friends, or they come visiting, they all sit bent over their mobile phones and play. When they are not allowed to play, they do not know what to do. Literally. They sit and wait for the time to pass until they may play again.</p>

<p>When my son has to stop playing, for example to eat or go to bed or go to school — yes, the game is the first thing he needs in the morning — he becomes irritable and angry. When I forbid him to play, he lies and tells me he goes outside (for example to play basketball), but I then find him standing in front of our house, where he has WiFi access, playing <em>Clash of Clans</em>.</p>

<p>I don't know how the other kids behave at home, but my son is clearly no longer in control of his life. I have therefore uninstalled the game from his mobile phone and blocked Google Play, so he cannot install it again.</p>

<p>This was fine for him for a few days. But all his friends still play the game and talk about nothing else. And again I mean that literally. There is no male child his age or older that I know who does not play the two games. All his friends boast of their ""achievements"" in their WhatsApp group, and whenever they meet my son in my presence, I hear how they talk of nothing else.</p>

<p>So basically, my problem comes down to this:</p>

<p>I don't want my son to play these games because they change him in a way I find alarming. At the same time, these games are the only thing all his friends and classmates are (currently) interested in, and I don't want to destroy his friendships for him.</p>

<p>What can I do?</p>

<p>I am quite convinced that some of his friends' parents don't see the problem I do. Some of his peers have TVs and game consoles in their bedrooms and parents who are ""avid gamers"" themselves. Maybe other kids aren't as addicted as my son is. I found someone online saying that creative kids with a lively imagination are more in danger than those that live more solidly in the real world. However that may be, I don't see the other parents taking the game away from their kids.</p>

<p><em>I have given this question the tag of ""video-games"", although those are distinctly different than the mobile games of today, but there was no other more fitting tag. Please edit, if necessary.</em></p>

<li><p>""But the game needs a credit card for purchases.""</p>

<p>I don't know how these things work in the part of the world where you live, but here every kid can buy a Google Play gift card at any supermarket or kiosk and enter the code on it in the game without any kind of authorization required except their Google password.</p>

<p>I have blocked Google Play, so this is no longer an issue.</p></li>
<li><p>""Your child has unlimited access to the internet.""</p>

<p>No, he doesn't. I had allowed the games to connect to the internet. Apart from them he only had email and WhatsApp. I have uninstalled and blocked the games, so all he can do ""on the internet"" is send email and write WhatsApp messages. I don't call that ""unlimited"".</p></li>
<li><p>""Block his ability to install apps on the phone, uninstall all games, lock it down.""</p>

<p>I already did.</p></li>
<li><p>""This particular game is not the issue.""</p>

<p>Maybe not.

But maybe that research is wrong.</p>

<p>However that may be, my question wasn't whether or not those games are problematic, but how to deal with the fact that I have excluded my son from an activity all his friends partake in. I would greatly appreciate it if answerers attempted to actually answer my question instead of forcing their unfounded opinion on me.</p></li>
<li><p>""He'll need ... other kids to be around""</p>

<p>They are his classmates and neighbors. There are no other kids, unless we move to a different town.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure that would help. Here, every boy plays those games. All the older siblings play. And I'm sure other towns have smartphones, too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So the real problem is how to deal with the fact that my son cannot partake in the favourite activity of his age group.</strong> </p>

<p>Sure, there certainly are some other kids his age who don't play. But at 10 years, I can no longer force him to be friends with kids he isn't interested in. These are his friends for a reason. It took many years for him to make them his friends, and I can't just replace them with random other kids.</p>

"Getting grandparents to accept parents' choices","<p>I understand that what children are supposed to eat is a bone of contention between parents and grandparents 
in many families. However this is not the main point of my question. I would like to describe a bizarre stalemate
situation remotely related to the ""proper food"" question:</p>

<p>Due to a medical condition my son had (sort of an eccema on a finger) that did not improve my wife suggested to
try a cow milk-free diet, or at least keeping cow milk to a minimum. We went ahead with this and things seemed
to improve, but then it was Christmas eve and big showers of milk chocolate were to be expected from all sides.
So my wife called my parents in advance and kindly asked them not to send milk chocolate this time.
My parents seemed to be a bit puzzled by that request, but did not object. Yet. </p>

<p>It was not until a week later that my father called my wife. That's where things are getting complicated. The
content of said phone call is being recalled fundamentally differently by both parties. My dad says he just 
stated his concerns about the measure we took. My wife says, the call was one long stream of accusations, culminating
in the claim that not allowing milk was ""neurotic"". My dad denies to have said that, saying that he stated that
the measure ""would make our son neurotic"". </p>

<p>I talked to my dad, but we could not find a consensus on this issue. He asked me if I had a suggestion on how to proceed.
After quite some thinking I suggested to him to call my wife - telling him that I only had second-hand information and
apparently could not contribute anything meaningful to this conflict. I asked him twice, but to no avail. He claims not
to have done anything wrong.</p>

<p>My wife is not really motivated to approach my dad herself, since I asked her to do this in previous conflicts already,
where my dad's response was something along the lines of ""gee, what conflict? do we have a conflict here?""</p>

<p>Has anyone had similar experiences where family communication got totally stuck? I'd be happy to learn what your solution
was, if any. </p>

"Is it normal for a 16-month-old to always wake up at the same time no matter what?","<p>I have a 16-month-old daughter. I'm 5 months pregnant with her baby brother. No matter what time I put her down for bed she wakes up at 12:30 am. I've tried putting her in bed at 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm, 10 pm and even as late as 11:30 pm and no matter what, she's up at 12:30 am screaming. I have the monitor on by my head and I'm a super light sleeper so I really don't sleep, any noise in her room wakes me up. She only gets 1 nap in the day and that's 12 pm to 2 or 3 pm but that's it.</p>

<p>I don't think daylight savings effected anything - no change, she still wakes up at 12:30 am. I've tried letting her cry it out when this started and she would cry for 10 min then go to sleep then wake up again half an hour later, stand up in her crib and scream again for another 10 minutes. After the 5th time we sat in the living room watching food network (nothing too exciting ).</p>

<p>It used to be she would wake up around 2 or 3 in the morning and I would hand her a bottle and she would fall right back to sleep but now she wakes up and won't take a bottle. When she got sick I gave her some Zarbees Night Time which is supposed to help them sleep, but she still woke up.</p>

<p>He is generally well-behaved among strangers and among caretakers (sitters, kindergarten staff, etc.). At home with his parents is where he tests his limits and our patience -- he is also very strong-willed, stubborn, hyperactive, destructive, and absolutely tireless.

"Why does my son (5) suddenly provoke me although everything seemed to be perfect before?","<p>My son (5) sometimes changes his mood suddenly. Sure this is somehow normal human behavior, but it can drive us mad.</p>

<p>This morning everything worked great and ""peacefully"" until breakfast. After having breakfast, we went to the bathroom: he was supposed to was his hands/face and he just didn't do it (instead did other things like hiding somewhere behind a towel or rolling up the carpet )  although I told him calmly several times to firstly clean his hands.</p>

<p>It seemed to be fun for him to see me getting more and more angry until I was really really angry.</p>

<p>I don't like arguments like that, because even if <em>he</em> gets normal quickly afterwards, <em>I</em> am angry quite a long time and can not easily forget that I was provoked for nothing (at least that's my point of view).</p>

<p>I have the impression, that if the situation gets too perfect, he purposefully tries to destroy it. This sounds strange to me - could this be true?</p>

<p>What could be the reasons for such behavior and what would be a good reaction?</p>

<h2>Highly sensitive persons</h2>

<p>Some time ago we learned about highly sensitive persons (I had never heard about this before) and that our son might be one of them. This helps me a lot understanding his often ""difficult"" behavior, also like what I described in this question.</p>

<p>As far as I understood this might explain that he very suddenly gets kind of ""information/stimulus overload"" (especially if we had many activities during the day) and then the situation gets out of control.</p>

<p>... and this also explains, why his behavior and reactions might be different from that of >80% of the other children and therefore maybe different from the experience of 80% of other parents.</p>

"How should I respond to a 6 year old's dark drawings?","<p>My 6 year old nephew likes to draw. Most of the drawings have been of the family, animals and locations we visit or that he would like to visit. Until recently, I wouldn't describe any of these images as being dark.</p>

<p>Over the last fortnight, some of the images have been dark. To cite 2 examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>One drawing was of a saber-tooth tiger surrounded by 3 human hunters with spears. There was a lot of red on the page indicating blood</li>
<li>One drawing was of the family dog, who sadly passed away in October last year. Most of the drawing was fine, except the dog was urinating heavily. My nephew thought this aspect to be hilarious</li>

<ol>
<li>He is actually very kind. He treats younger children very well and likes meeting the neighbours' friendly pets</li>
<li>His parents are going through a rough patch at the moment. His father (my brother) is suffering from a midlife crisis and is having an affair. This is well known to everyone in the family except my nephew</li>
<li>There has been bereavement in the family. As mentioned, the family pet died a few months ago, and his paternal grandfather died 2 years' ago</li>

"How to handle a toddler's infinite cycle of hand washing - getting hands dirty - putting hands in mouth","<p>My almost 3 year old nephew keeps touching the floor, dusty corners, door mats and other generally not too clean things around the house.

(He doesn't respond to a ""No"" either, if you want to stop him, you've to physically do so). And then we wash his hands. And repeat.</p>

<p>Its worse when this happens in the middle of nibbling some snacks. He's at an age where he wants to eat everything on his own instead of being fed. He has a bite, runs around and touches some dirty stuff, and comes back for the next bite. Even if we wash his hands then, the same cycle is going to repeat before the next bite.</p>

<p>I'm not sure washing hands every 10 minutes is efficient or healthy, specially during the cold seasons. We do keep the house as clean as possible, but there's always an errant corner or doormat. </p>

<p>a) Should we not care too much about the dirty hands and eating with them? We haven't had many cases of an upset stomach.. But I don't know if its because we keep cleaning him up, or because a toddler's body is equipped to handle things being put in the mouth all the time.</p>

"Visiting my mother causes problems for me. How can I handle her behavior and attitude better?","<p>My mom has a puppy dog, who is a lot of fun and I enjoy taking on walks. However, he’s not very well trained and tends to chew things up. On a number of occasions he has taken my shoes and hid them or chewed on them. My mom told me I had to put them on the stairs leading up to my brothers room (my brother still lives with her) out of the dogs reach. On a number of occasions my brother has gotten mad when I leave things on a chair or on the stairs and throws them around the house.</p>

<p>Tonight when I went to visit this happened, and I couldn’t find my shoes. My brother went to his room and closed the door and when I asked if he knew where my shoes were he didn’t reply. I told my mom that I couldn’t find my shoes and needed to leave and she said to go pound on my brothers door. </p>

<p>First thing that bugs me is, whenever the dog has gotten into my stuff or my brother has moved it, my mom laughs and has a very flippant attitude. Second thing is, I don’t know what to do in situations like this? On one hand it is my brother’s fault for moving my belongings without asking me. On the other is that my mom probably should train her dog better so I don’t have to leave my stuff in awkward places. I don’t really want to be caught in the middle.</p>

<p>I eventually found my shoes and my brother had moved them not to far from where they first were but still enough so I had trouble finding them (he basically put them underneath a near by pile of shoes). The first thing my mom said was “so whose fault was it?” I find this question very immature and don’t want to play the blame game.</p>

<p>Also my mom had asked me to take the dog for a walk earlier. I told her I didn’t really have time and she said “just a 5 minute walk”. I agreed but when I wasn’t able to find my shoes I told her if I don’t find them in 2 minutes I won’t be able to take the dog for a walk. Since it took more like 15 minutes to find them, I ended up not taking the dog. My mom said if I’m going to act this way I’m not allowed to come over. While it’s true I was mad for having my stuff hidden, I wasn’t really mad at her and know that I can choose not to walk the dog. I told her to remind me not to come over as we usually don’t get along.</p>

<p>I know it kind of sounds silly as this huge ordeal was over a pair of shoes, but still they cost $200 and I use them in my running group (most of my shoes aren't the expensive). Also the dog (and my brother) has gone after my jacket, which has my cellphone and keys in it, so I see this as a very serious problem. </p>

<p>I find I communicate with my mom best by email so I’m thinking of sending her this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hi mom,</p>
  
  <p>If I come over could you please ask me to take the dog for a walk in
  the first 15 minutes of my arrival? Otherwise I might not have time.
  Also, I can say no for any reason and this needs to be ok.</p>

  have been misplaced or (almost) damaged by the dog or my brother. I
  can’t afford this. What can be done so this doesn’t happen? Until this
  gets solved I won’t be coming by your place to visit.</p>

"Is the 'naughty chair' an effective strategy to punish children?","<p>I am a great skeptic in punishment in general as the most common methods seem to become irrelevant when the child grows up (confiscation of games, threats, verbal or corporal reprimands...). Since all these methods will no longer be present when the child becomes an adult and leaves the home, it seems to be that they will not be long term solutions. </p>

<p>What I mean by this is if you confiscate a game when a child does something wrong, when he is older he will know that if he does that activity there will be no punishment as he is no longer at home and so will be tempted to revert to negative behaviour.</p>

<p>An idea that seems to make more sense to me is to deal with negative behaviour by isolating the child in a 'naughty room' or 'naughty chair' and encourage them to think about why they behaviour was bad. When a certain amount of time has elapsed the child should be asked why they think their behaviour was bad and, if they can't figure it out by themselves, it would be explained to them as an anecdote or story. </p>

<p>This way when they are out of the house and tempted to do such negative behaviour they will remember the reasons why that behaviour is not necessarily a good idea based on factual anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>Thus, my question is: Is this method sufficient and effective? (I am particularly interested in views from parents whose children have now moved out, or young adults who have moved out from home.)</p>

<p>We have a baby (4 month old) that has trouble sleeping (very light sleeper). We are trying to put her for a nap three times a day and each nap lasts around 40 min. It takes usually 15-20 min to make her sleep (rocking, lullabies etc.). The baby sleeps on an attached bed.</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>

<p>The baby is sleeping (20 minutes already), the mother is beside the baby, the door is closed, with light background music. The grandma (mother of my wife) needs a bag weight scale and is outside the door and calls the mother. Each call is getting louder cause she doesn't get a response... Now I am downstairs hear her calling and I tell her that the baby is sleeping... (I am sure that the Grandma knew that the baby is sleeping as the lullaby song was on and door closed, but she still insisted on a response)</p>

<p>They tell my wife that I was extremely rude to do that cause I would never tell an older person to ask to be quiet...</p>

<p>Also, it was not like that they needed the scale right now. They were making already bags but only going to the airport in another week...</p>

<p>I think this is totally non-sense and I think that I have the right to say or ask them to be quiet in that case.</p>

<p>What do you think? How is it in your country/culture?</p>

"How do I stop my daughter from hitting another child?","<p>Recently my daughter started to hit another girl with whom she is currently sharing her nanny. My daughter is 2 years and 2 months now, the other child is 1 year 3 months. The nanny was our daughters only nanny until 5 months ago, when we started sharing with the other family. We had a few trial days and it was perfect, but after a few proper days it became clear that our daughter is not very happy with the arrangement - probably she was jealous. </p>

<p>A few weeks ago the problems grew more serious, and our daughter started hitting the other girl much more often. Part of the reason might be that the younger girl is interested in everything around and in particular in the toy that our daughter is playing with (natural at this age I guess), so our daughter was fighting back. But now she became so aggressive that the nanny and all the parents involved are very worried: often she would attach the little girl when she just passes by or waves her hand. </p>

<p>We are trying to figure out how to improve their relationship and how to make our daughter stop violence. Gentle explanations don't seem to work - I believe she understands she does the wrong thing, she says sorry, kisses the smaller child etc., but 3 mins later the same thing happens again.</p>

<p>Could anyone recommend anything we could do about it? And what could make it worse? The real question is should we try to punish our daughter in any way (e.g. do time-outs: stop the play and take her to the other end of the room for a short while), or is it going to have the opposite effect?</p>

"How big should solid food for the infant be when doing baby-led weaning?","<p>Our son has been supplementing his formula with solid food for several months now.  We started him on simple cereals (rice cereal, oatmeal, etc.), then added basic jarred baby food.  Now he's eating blended jarred baby food, and we've been giving him selected ""adult"" food off our plates on occasion.  </p>

<p>Toast and french fries/potato wedges appear to be his favorite foods, mostly because he can easily grip them and enjoy them for 5-10 minutes at a time (before they become too mushy and disintegrate or he drops them).  He has no problem ripping off small pieces to chew (well, mostly gum; he has his 2 front bottom teeth, with his 2 top front teeth just coming in), but sometimes the pieces he gets are much bigger.</p>

<p>My wife constantly worries about him choking, and starts whacking on his back any time he shows any difficulties.  What information I could find on the subject (<a href=""http://www.babyledweaning.com/some-tips-to-get-you-started/"" rel=""nofollow"">for example</a>) seems to indicate ""easy to grip"" is a good criteria for baby led weaning, and that gagging is ""their way of moving food around in the mouth and don’t panic"".  That site in particular highlights a variety of photos of very young children eating adult-sized portions of everything ranging from broccoli to pork chops.</p>

<p>I've seen other sites that state that babies should only be fed solid food if it is in tiny pieces, to avoid choking.</p>

<p>How big should solid foods be?  Is toast a choking hazard?  </p>

"How to deal with a separated family as an adult child when my parents want me to spend more time with them?","<p>I am a 23-year-old male, my father is working in Town B (for about 2 years now) and he tries to come home every weekend (Friday night - Sunday night), so it's just me and my mother at Town A during the weekdays. </p>

<p>I don't know what I'm feeling at the moment, but I feel very angry and confused, not directly at my parents but somewhat indirectly at them. When I go to work, I keep thinking of my mother and I feel guilty (although it is not my fault) that she is alone at home. Sure she has friends but she can't seem to keep herself occupied for the whole day, and she resorts to watching TV. I also feel guilty when I want to stay back later at work and come back home at 8pm instead of 5:30pm-6:30pm, as I want to accompany her. Also, during weekdays after work I might have gatherings and outings with friends and I would come home normally around 11pm+. So my mother will be asleep and I won't see her until the next morning briefly. This has lead to me cancelling some of the events that I attend with my friends as I want to spend time with my mother. </p>

<p>Then the same problem comes on the weekend. I normally would have my own plans on the weekends to do my own things, but since my father moved to Town B, I always feel guilty if I go out on weekends and not spend time with my parents/my father. So this has led to me also sacrificing alot of my own plans.</p>

<p>In short, I just feel so constrained by my parents and both of them even made some remarks about not seeing me a lot during the weekdays//weekends. I get so angry and fustrated because I want them to understand I am not a child and I have my own life now. I don't go out for the whole day/go out excessively, it's just maybe in the morning and afternoon I've got my own plans with my friends and such but I do try to come back for dinner with them or at least one meal a day. Even then, it's not enough for them and they would like to me to spend the whole day with them (ever since my dad moved to Town B to work). Moving out is not an option at the moment because of my finances, but even so, if I did move out it would cause more guilt as my mother will be living alone.</p>

<p>How would I deal with this? Is this my fault? Or should I put aside all my emotions and do what I please. Should I confront my parents? I was thinking of it, but I don't think it will change anything.</p>

"Which music is suited infants and toddlers?","<p>I wonder which kind of music is well suited for infants and toddlers.</p>

<p>I'd assume those criteria are important: </p>

<ul>
<li>the <em>change of loudness</em> is not too big (so that the child does not get shocked by a sudden fortissimo)</li>
<li>the music is not too <em>dramatic and ""bombastic""</em>  (like e. g. Richard Wagner's Operas)</li>
</ul>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What <strong>other criteria</strong> make music suitable for a child?</li>
<li>Can you give <strong>examples</strong> for music matching the criteria? </li>
</ul>

<p>I'd assume that some classical music might be well suited, but for sure there might be alternatives.</p>

"Can Not Speaking Be Due To Just Plain Refusing To Speak?","<p>I have a 20 month old who quite clearly understands spoken language and commands.

<p>He has had no signs from an ENT specialist, 18 month autism inventory, or other medical indications of speech impairment, and his hearing has been measured as a-ok a few times now.</p>

<p>Also, despite starting to walk sort of late, he is quite mobile; but he would prefer to be carried most of the time rather than to use his own two feet-- he throws tantrums to demonstrate this point.  </p>

"Should my children steer clear of the ""bad kids""?","<p>My kids are 9 and 7, boy and girl, respectively. They're nice, spunky, forgiving, and open-minded. They're hardly perfect; they're also sassy, sarcastic, and demanding.</p>

<p>Because of their willingness to play almost any game with anyone, we know a lot of people. Unfortunately, there are a few kids with moderate behavioral problems--and perhaps a conscious or unconscious ability to manipulate--who like spending time with them.</p>

<p>When I say ""bad kids,"" I mean disrespectful to adults in general especially a parent, conduct issues such as petty theft or aggression, emotional disinhibition such as tantrums over minor issues, entitlement issues such as we have it better than them, and a general lack of age-appropriate empathy.</p>

<p>I want my kids to make good choices about peers, and we talk about how easy it is to do ""bad things"" when you see other kids doing them. The worst culprit, I gave my kids the choice, and they agreed to not be friends with this boy. He was violent with my kids.</p>

<p>But there are two others that fall just short of violent aggression. My concerns are</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Where there's smoke, there's fire</em>. A child with serious problems on the periphery is probably worse when you really get to know him</p></li>
<li><p><em>Peer pressure</em>. At 9 And 7 I'm not too worried about sex and drugs, and in the long run my kids will have to make their own good decisions by high school--there is still a lot of trouble preadolescents can get into.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Scapegoat</em>. Bad kids love to spread the blame to make themselves look less bad. This manipulative approach can cause emotional harm in and of itself.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Risk of physical harm</em>. Bad kids are far more likely to freak out and cause physical harm over a mild slight.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't want to frustrate my kids, but I'm struggling between guidance and restriction. Should I actively tell them ""Johnny can't be your friend""? And if that's the case, do I passively ignore requests for play dates, or do I lay it out to the child's parents?</p>

"How do we break the cycle of misbehavior when trying to discipline our 3-year-old?","<p>My wife and I have gotten into a bad habit with our 3-year-old.  When he misbehaves, sometimes he bites or otherwise physically assaults one of us in frustration, particularly when we are telling him he cannot do something he wants to do.  We will then tell him he shouldn't bite, that it hurts, and then he'll laugh at us and act as if it's a hilarious game.  </p>

<p>These aren't little bites or hits, mind you; they're very painful, and they often make the recipient quite stressed out.  Further stressful of course is the laughing and gamboling about.  This usually happens when he's a bit tired (and thus hyper).  We will then make some effort to take him to a time out, but it won't work; it will devolve to that parent having to physically restrain him to keep him from running around and ignoring us, which just leads to another biting or hitting incident, and the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>We're well aware that essentially none of this works, but we haven't been able to come up with something that does, and is reasonably doable during these times.  Our son is pretty mature and able to be talked to when he's not over tired, and normally behaves quite well; our discipline usually only has to be occasional time outs, and the worst thing he does on a normal day is complain too much that his screen time is over.  But when these incidents occur - probably 2 times a week - it's a completely different story.  Once we do get him calmed down - often after getting him to go elsewhere - he's able to understand that he shouldn't lash out in frustration and talk about it, but getting <em>to</em> that point is what we can't seem to do in a calm manner.</p>

<p>We've discussed all sorts of options, and don't really like any of them.  We don't like having nonimmediate penalties (i. e., removing privileges), as he's just barely three - from what we've read (and seen) he isn't old enough to understand them.  We're considering star charts, but we don't have a lot of confidence there; the core of the issue is that he gets tired, either because he misses his nap (which he does fairly often, as he's not a good napper) or just because it's 7 or 8 pm.  </p>

<p>What should we consider to deal with these outbursts?  What works well with otherwise well behaved children who have lost control over their behavior?</p>

"How do I help our 3/yo go through stress","<p>We have a 3 y/o daughter. A few months ago her and I thought it would be best to try and work out our differences by moving into separates homes. </p>

<p>Since then my daughter, now 3 who has always been a really good kid, has started acting out in ways than seems like regression. She is peeing on the floor, yet been potty trained for quite some time, hitting kids at day car, and throwing sand at other babies. It seems like an obvious sign of her stress with our separation, but I don't really know how to handle it. My wife I am brainstormed for ideas and came up with a few, but I wanted to reach out to the parenting community also and and for any thoughts, insights, ideas or suggestions. </p>

<p>Its not a problem about lack of discipline or she would always act like this. From my perspective this is a transitional problem and an overwhelming inability for her to cope with so many changes using regular methods.</p>

<p><strong>Some ideas we came up with:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set firmer boundaries.</li>
<li>Connect with her more individually, when she is only with one parent, lots of one on one time.</li>
<li>Be attentive as she needs, give here extra guidance and support right now. Undistracted time and attention. (i.e. no tv, or work while we are with her)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How can we prevent this?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Help remind her of our expectations. be close when she is around the cat or people to help her do the right thing and physically stop her from hitting if need be. No kid wants to keep hitting or feel out of control. </li>
<li>remind her to pee often or offer diaper if necessary.</li>
<li>Lots of patience, love, and empathy. </li>
<li>talk openly about changes to house and routine and how it's a hard transition. let her know she can feel sad, mad, scared and she is always safe with mom or dad and we love her unconditionally.</li>
<li>Verbalize what she can expect for the day (i.e. we will be together until after your nap, then you will go see mom.)</li>
<li>self care for myself and my wife to prevent added anger and frustration. She needs us to be as calm and loving as possible in order to feel safe.</li>
<li>More time outside to get fresh air, sunshine, and play in the dirt.</li>
<li>Try to have more fun with her. laugh, play, lighten up a bit.</li>

"23-month-old no longer napping in her crib","<p>My kid is 23 months old and turns 2 in 2 weeks. She is able to sleep at night on her own since we used the cry-it-out method late last year. She usually has one 1.5-2 hour nap after lunch. However, she has been refusing to nap in her crib for the last 2 days. She can't go to sleep on her own for her naps so I have to hold her for about 10 minutes before putting her in her crib. It used to work but the past 2 days, she'll sleep in my arms but will wake up the minute I put her down. </p>

<p>Anyone else faced this or know how I can help her to nap in her crib again?</p>

<p>We recently came back from a 4 day overseas trip. On that trip she napped, but the timings were not the same. However, the 2 days after we came back, she was able to nap fine. So I'm not sure if the issue is caused by the trip or a 2 year old sleep regression. I'm under the impression that a sleep regression is refusal to sleep. However, she's not refusing to sleep. Just wakes up when I put her down.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: She stayed asleep for her nap when I put her in her crib on Sun and Mon. Thought I was out of the woods, unfortunately I was wrong. Last 2 days I couldn't put her down so I tried cry it out. First day she cried for 50 minutes napped for 40 minutes. Woke up crying. Second day cried for 50 minutes and napped for 50 minutes. Woke up crying. Anyone know if the duration will get longer and she will not wake up crying? She didn't wake up crying when I used to put her down. And her naps used to be longer.</p>

We have a Bugaboo Buffalo at home and we are still considering if it's best to just travel with it instead, but taking into account its bulkiness, weight and the whole lot of horrible stories of airlines destroying strollers, I am more and more doubtful.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of questions that still plague me about using an umbrella stroller (albeit a mid/high range price one):</p>

<p>• The best strollers I am seeing do not recline completely horizontal (though they recline a bit) therefore in the specifications they say minimum age is 6 months. Do you think is OK to use them with a 5 1/2 months old? Anyone have a similar experience? Or could it be problematic for the muscle development of the child?</p>

<p>• We will be traveling for a whole month, so is expected that our daughter will spend a fair amount of time on the umbrella stroller, even combining it with a carrier (at least she will use it for couple of hours every day). Is this type of stroller OK for this amount of use? I wouldn't do it with a cheap umbrella stroller, but hopefully a better one would be almost as comfortable and good for the baby as our regular day to day stroller.</p>

<p>On the other side, this might be a normal experience for boys in infants school where writing is hard work. (I recall years of pain doing cursive writing). It might be that sitting still all day is hard work as well. </p>

<p>(I'll note that my daughter two years older loved kindergarten). </p>

<p>The thought still lingers. Do I need to help my son get better at writing his name? Can I encourage him to delight in it? Is there a way I can make it fun? Should I just get over myself and not worry about it?</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>My son started kindergarten and doesn't like writing his name. How should I think about this?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
I wanted to thank everyone for their comments. His sister was at a friends place yesterday so I took him out for a milkshake. He confessed he'd made a mistake the first time he wrote it and didn't like that very much. He also hangs out with his best buddy from preschool, and he said his buddy likes to complain about having to write his name. We're all good!

<blockquote>
  <p>I do not agree with the current trend of validating every single feeling a child might have. I think it leads to entitled adults who think that their feelings are above everything else, adults who think they have the right not to be hurt or offended, ever.</p>
  
  <p>There's a difference between acknowledging a child's feelings (""I understand how you feel and why you feel like that""), and telling them it is OK to feel like that when it isn't.</p>
  
  <p>It is OK to feel hurt when someone insulted you. It is OK to feel sad when your friend moves to another town. It is OK to feel anger when you see someone abusing somebody else.</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>It is not OK to feel envy of your friends toys. It is not OK to feel rage because you didn't get cake for dessert. And it is not OK to feel apathy because you had to write your name 5 times back at school.</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>Sure, it's not easy for a child to discern when it is OK to feel some way, and when it isn't. That's why we parents are here: to help them learn.</p>

"How to encourage a child to self-edit and take criticism positively?","<p>Our eight year old daughter writes well for her age, and has produced some really spectacular pieces in class. She's not terribly interested in writing for fun at home, though. When she does, what she puts down is often pretty awful, even by the standards of an 8 year old.</p>

<p>Over the weekend she spent some time putting a poem together and she's really pleased with it, and proud of what she's done. Today she wanted to take it into class and show her peers and teacher, but honestly, a lot of it is drivel. </p>

<p>I put her off by saying that some of it is very good (which is true) but other bits could use some more work. She's not going to let it drop, though: she wants to know which bits need work, and why.</p>

<p>The truth is that most of it would benefit from rewriting, but I don't feel I can tell her that, nor would I want to squash her enthusiasm. She's very easily deflated and prone to taking even gentle criticism very harshly. But it's terribly frustrating: we know she can write so well for her age, but she has no concept of self-criticism, so often doesn't.</p>

<p>While I've given a specific example here, this is a topic I've started to struggle with as my kids have grown up. With little ones we've offered unreserved praise for all their efforts. But at what age is it reasonable to expect children to start to take critical comments constructively, and to start being a little self-critical about what they produce? How can parents, generally, encourage this process, especially with kids who don't tend to take it well?</p>

"What to do with a child that won't sleep, to the detriment of their day?","<p>There are many questions on here asking about sleepless children but my wife and I are starting to come to our wits-end and none of the advice we've found (here or otherwise) seems to fit our situation or no longer works.  </p>

<p>I think this is because as our four and a half year old daughter is getting older her will and determination is getting stronger. She is a rather stubborn child and, to be fair, she gets that that from both parents. We've read most common advice and tried it all.</p>

<p>Here is how this plays out.  My wife and I follow our normal night-time routine, starting at 7:00 PM.  We sit down and read to both of our children* and they get a final, small snack while we read.  After corporate reading and snack, we head to potty-time, brush teeth, and put both kids to bed.  For our daughter, this involves reading a short book, singing a song with the lights out and walking out of the room.  My wife and I rotate who takes which child every other night.</p>

<p>This has been a mostly-successful routine but, progressively as our daughter has gotten older and smarter, she's found ways to try to get out of bed and come out of her room.  I'll spare the stories but she's smart enough to discern potential parental ""loopholes"" and will try to exploit them.  After a round of two of sending her back to bed, she resolves to laying in bed from 15 minutes to an hour and then cuts on the lights to read.</p>

<p>Let me be clear-- the 7:00 PM bed time routine is very-well crafted. Wait until 7:30 PM and, based off of behavioral observation, you've waited to long and she'll be over tired.  On those nights you know the task of getting her to bed is going to be a struggle involving tears of at least 2, if not 3, individuals in our household.</p>

<p>We've tried to follow the advice of other's and just ignore her behavior that happens in her room. Usually she quiet and not causing problems.  We have no clue how often she does this throughout the night, but on multiple occasions we've found the light on in the middle of the night, and she's surrounded by books or toys.  Also, she will wake up early in the morning if she hear's me getting ready.  I leave the house at 5:30 AM, and she's often up with lights on, some times clothed and ready to start her day!</p>

<p>This wouldn't be a problem but all of this sleep deprivation is starting to dramatically effect her attitude.  After a couple of good AM hours, the tiredness starts to kick in and she becomes cranky and hard to deal with, and understandably so.  She's exhausted!</p>

<p>We've long given up on a nap time because that became a fight over a year and a half ago.  Instead, it's a ""rest time"" where she has to be quite and in her bedroom for an hour where we encourage her to read on her bed.  About once every  2 weeks she will nap (and nap hard.)  Those become good evenings because she get's some of the catch-up sleep she desperately needs and we'll often put her to bed closer to 8:00 PM because we don't want her to go to bed and not be tired.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rather long post but the bottom-line is that our child is refusing to rest at night time if she can prevent it.  When we catch her awake, we try to cut off the lights, and reset the room to a sleep-time state. This always results in an angry toddler, who often ends up crashing, usually within 10-15 minutes of us cleaning up her room and cutting off the lights.</p>

<p>My wife and I are fit to be tied.  Our rather well behaved &amp; good daughter is stealthy and hates sleep.  However, this comes at the expense of my daughter (and wife's) day-time sanity.</p>

<p>What should we do?  Is there a point when we should see a doctor about this?  IMHO, this is completely behavioral stubbornness but you can't force a child to sleep.  This is an issue of control and the kid just won't sleep, and no amount of consistency, routine, loving reassurance, or autonomy seems to help her help herself and GO TO BED.</p>

<p>*Our other child is a 2 year old boy.  We have no problems with him and his sleep routine.  He doesn't sleep as much as the average child his age but he does handle our routine well and sleeps when he should sleep.</p>

"Bully broke my sons bone, what next?","<p>While at school my son has been getting bullied by a boy. They are both in 6th grade and used to be friends until recently, not the boy bullies him. Today I got a call to come get my son because he had been in a fight. At the time my son was in pain but it wasn't bad. By 8pm he was sweating really bad and in a lot of pain. We noticed a large lump on his collar bone and knew he had broken it. We took him to the ER to confirm his collar bone was broken and to get him a sling,  the limited but proper treatment. </p>

<p>Tomorrow he is staying home but I plan on going to the school to speak to the dean. I wanted to get feed back on the proper way to handle this situation. </p>

<p><strong>What happened?</strong>
In short, the boy snatched things from my son then pushed him really hard into a car. This broke his collar bone. A teacher saw it happen before my son got to react other than running from the boy.</p>

<p><strong>File charges?</strong>
Should/can I file assault charges? He is only in 6th grade and I don't know of i want to be the person to give him a record. Though he did break my son's collar bone while bullying him.</p>

<p><strong>Who pays the medical bills?</strong>
I do not feel we should have to pay the medical bills. The boy did this to my son, is the school or boy's parents liable? </p>

<p><strong>Should I get an attorney?</strong>
Is the school or parents liable? Who will ensure proper justice is served? This will cause unneeded stress in my families lives between restriction on my son's activities to financial costs and missed work. Am I getting a head of myself?</p>

<p><strong>Proper school punishment?</strong>
Should the kid not be punished? Should he be suspended or expelled? He is in all of my son's classes so he will always be around him. </p>

<p>Is there anything else I should know or consider?</p>

<p><strong>Kind of answer I was seeking.</strong>
I was not looking for legal advice. I wanted to hear from another parent who had unfortunately went through a similar experience and how things worked out. Maybe some opinion on if I should drop the ban hammer or show some leniency because they are young kids.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: The Outcome</strong>
The boy will have 7 days of suspension, the school will pay for anything my insurance won't cover. They will monitor the situation between the boys to make sure there are no more occurrences. We are not pressing charges due to boys being boys. If something else happens I will explore more serious action.</p>

"How long should a pediatric dental cleaning take?","<p>Due to some insurance changes we switched our children (ages 9 and 16) to a different dentist last year.  The new dentist is a pediatric dentist who only sees children.  Our prior dentist was a general family dentist who saw the whole family.  Our prior dentist is a bit old-school:  he does everything himself and seems very thorough, with routine cleanings typically taking 45 minutes to an hour for everything including X-rays if needed.</p>

<p>I was pretty surprised that the pediatric dental cleaning appointments seemed very short.  I timed our last one.  The hygienist spent a total of 9 minutes polishing and flossing my daughter's teeth, followed by less than 5 minutes with the dentist who did an inspection and applied fluoride.</p>

<p>Is it fair to judge the new dentist based on the duration of the cleaning?  My initial reaction is that it can't possibly be as high quality or effective as our old dentist.  But then again, our old dentist is certainly outside of the normal curve of typical dentists, maybe we are just accustomed to his lengthy and perhaps over-the-top thoroughness.  Maybe he is more thorough than he needs to be and is pushing the cleaning past the point of diminishing returns.</p>

<p>If it is fair to judge based on the duration of the basic cleaning procedures, how long should it take?  If 9 minutes is too short, what is appropriate...15?  30?  Are there accepted standards of practice for what constitutes ""good enough""?</p>

<p>I understand each situation is different and calls for different degrees of cleaning.  But this is a pretty ""normal"" case where the child has good brushing/flossing habits and is going in for cleanings every 6 months.</p>

"What to do after my nephew showed a graphic video to my 9-year-old son?","<p>My 12-year-old nephew ""Bob"" took my 9-year-old son aside and showed him a video of ISIS beheading a victim. I am just flabbergasted that Bob would do that. Interestingly Bob did not show the video to my older child who is Bob's age. I suspect this is because my older son would stop him and inform the adults immediately.</p>

<p>My 9-year-old made me promise not to tell Bob off or to complain to his mother before he told me about the incident. I am not close to this nephew but understand from his mother that conventionally ""scary"" stuff does not bother him. Ghosts, blood, gore etc. </p>

<p>However I am very disturbed that he showed it to my little kid, and <strong>only</strong> to my little kid. Shouldn't he know better? It makes me feel like I should not leave him alone with my younger child. I shared my concerns with the grandfather, however grandpa is more concerned about Bob's wellbeing (he is losing weight) than my son's! Grandpa feels that it was just thoughtlessness on Bob's part. </p>

<p>Am I overreacting? If my older son had done that, he would have received a real shelling from me with phone privileges removed and the sender of the video blacklisted. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I realised what bothered me most was how manipulative Bob was. Bob basically sat my son down, said it was something that may be scary and he had the choice of whether or not he wanted to watch it <strong>without telling him it was a graphic video</strong>. When my son came to me, he emphasized that it was his own fault for deciding to watch it, and Bob was totally blameless. </p>

<p>After reading through the various responses and mulling for a few days, I finally sat my son down and told him </p>

<ol>
<li>nephew did not really give him a choice and he should smell a
rat in future if anyone present him with incomplete information</li>
<li>there is no shame in walking away from such videos at any point
in time </li>
<li>it was most definitely not his fault for watching it and to never
pass such videos on.</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided not to inform the parents as they are unlikely to do anything beyond mild chiding and I suspect Bob's dad treats him similarly, which is another can of worms. In other words, informing the parents will either make me angrier as a parent or reinforce an unhealthy environment for Bob. </p>

"Handling toddler aggression towards my child","<p>My 2yo daughter was playing on a playground, rotating on a kind of one-person carousel. A 2.5, maybe 3yo boy approached her, obviously (to me) wanting to sit on it and use it. The boy immediately started hitting my girl on the head with open hand. Before his parent approached and stopped him, he managed to score a few hits. I didn't intervene, since there was no real danger of her being hurt and I usually try to let her resolve her own playground ""trouble"". They used to be toy-grabbing problems until then, however. Afterwards, she looked at me, puzzled, showing me how the boy had hit her (gently hitting herself on the head). She's one of the non-violent, passive kids. She won't hit anyone, she doesn't bite or hit when she's angry. She will sometimes try to grab other kids toys when they are using it, but most of the time she sticks to those left free.</p>

<p>A day after that I started thinking and reconsidering that situation.</p>

"Should I stop my 2-month-old from sucking his thumb?","<p>My 2-month-old has recently discovered his thumb. He used to often suck his hands, normal baby behavior, and occasionally would ""find"" his thumb and happily suck for a while - usually when he was starting to get hungry. However, in the past few days he has started to suck his thumb much more often, almost constantly. </p>

<p>At first I let him do it because it was occasional, he seemed to enjoy it - and because a 2-month-old sucking his thumb is just adorably cute :) But now I'm starting to get concerned. Should I leave him and assume he'll grow out of it, or will this just let him cement the habit and suck his thumb for years to come? (I really don't like seeing 3+ year olds still sucking...) </p>

"My daughter bites her nails - me too and my husbands says its my fault....?","<p>My 4 year old daughter recently started biting her nails. Not seriously short or bleeding but I never have to cut it. I've been a nail biter since I can remember but now my husband says she is biting because I bite mine. I have a 11 year old son as well and he doesn't bite his nails....I was just wondering - is this really my fault? You know...monkey see, monkey do? </p>

"My father just gets mad when there's a problem instead of trying to resolve it","<p>I think it's best to tell the story before asking the question.</p>

<p>I live on my own now and my dad said I could have a spare bed he has. I didn't ask he offered. I am very grateful for this, beds cost a lot of money. He arranged a time to drop it off and I was home waiting for him.</p>

<p>He got really mad that my old bed was still in my room. He had agreed to help carry the new bed up the stairs so it seemed logical to assume he would help carry the old one out. But he insisted it was my responsibility to already have the old bed moved out.</p>

<p>I admit, maybe it was my mistake. I certainly didn't intend harm. What I didn't like is how he started swearing and telling me I should yell at my landlord because I'm doing her work. We got in an argument and I told him he can go yell at my landlord if he wants because in my opinion she has done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>He got mad and helped take my old bed out but left without helping put the new one in. He even commented how he's screwing me over.</p>

<p>It turned out I was able to carry everything by myself so that was no problem. If I had known my dad was so against carrying the old one out I could have got someone I live with to help or a friend. Or I could have just put the new mattress on top of the old one.</p>

<p>My dad then sent me a text message saying how manipulative I am and how I'm just using him. It then occurred to me, I am just using him. He's a very unpleasant person to be around and whenever I see him it's because he's offered to do something for me. If he hadn't freaked out at me I would have been happy to have a conversation with him and relax.</p>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>My dad owes me an apology. How do I get it from him?</li>
<li>I need/want more respect from my dad (and my mom) how should I get it from them? Fail that, how do I effectively distance myself from my parents?</li>
</ol>

<p>The above (and my other questions) are examples of my dad's continuing behavior. I guess we're living in the same city now so that's why it's on my mind. I can't help but notice a lot of answers to my questions seem to take my parent's side. Why? My dad blatantly swore at me and because he had offered to do something for me isn't an excuse. Anyone who thinks it is, is childish them self. </p>

"Why is my 4-year-old child more aggressive now?","<p>My child recently turned 4 late this summer. We've noticed he has been more aggressive lately.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong>
I've pretend wrestled, boxed, and sword fought with my child before his third birthday. I started to see signs of him testing his limits outside of our pretend plays; one thing he would do is rush at me for a take down without warning or punch or kick my wife out of nowhere. I told him he can only display these behaviors when we're rough-housing. If someone bites, pinches, hair-pulls, punches, or kicks him after he warns them, and if an adult is present, to let them know; if that child hits him again, he can defend himself. So far, there have been no known cases of him harming another child at the daycare on campus at the University. They are very strict about children being physical.</p>

<p>At home, he is different. He continues to his aggression. My wife and I have come to the conclusion that it might be because he has too much energy. In his first three years, we did outdoor activities everyday since we were able to have enough savings to care for him for those years. Afterward, we are now back full-time working or studying. Monday to Friday, he stays at daycare from 8 AM to 5 PM. From 5 PM to 9:30 PM, we dedicate quality time with him since work or homework stays at the workplace or school; we finish before we pick him up at the daycare.</p>

<p>When he rushes, jabs, or kicks us, I tell him to stop in a calm demeanor that carries disappointment and he <strong>knows</strong> what he did is inappropriate. Wife raises her voice at him which I remind her sometimes that that's not necessary because he laughs when she reprimands him. We tell him that it's disrespectful and he needs to stop doing it. We follow that with different ways he can vent his energy. He tells us he's sorry for his action and lets us know next time, he will stop, breath, walk away, and then he will feel better. Later that day or the next, he does it again. Either we are not getting through to him or he is at an age where he wants to see how far he can push our limit. We stay consistent each time for the last few months that this have gotten to be a daily thing.</p>

<p>One thing that has worked is when we take him outdoors like how we used to, he gets all his energy out of his system. He wakes up for a nap, we take him out again because he is <strong>full</strong> of energy and loves the outdoors. We work/study full-time so it's a challenge to do outdoors on weekdays. </p>

<p>Sometimes we feel we need to get a TV, cable television, and allow him to watch movies. Other times we feel he should  be able to play his tablet more than two hours per week on the weekends.</p>

<p>Is him testing how far he can take his actions a sign of his developmental stage or are we not doing enough? We are not doing something right, what can we do to help him <strong>control</strong> his actions? Are we going at it the wrong way?</p>

"13-year-old sister dating elder (16 y.o. or more) guys","<p>To begin with, I am 22-year-old girl who studies far away from home town for 4 years by now. All my family lives in Russia, if this is important.  </p>

<p>I have <strong>13-year-old sister</strong> whose relations with our parents are not that good. To understand the situation better, the dad behaves like he's only interested in TV and occasionally our school marks; the mom is more emotional, but often gets captious towards my sister.<br>
One more problem is that I was a ""good child"" (excellent marks for every subject + afraid of parents scolding me so very obedient). My sister is not that good at school and more rebellious, perhaps because everyone used to tell her how good I was in comparison. So she often gets scolded.<br>
We are <strong>not very close</strong> with her, just chatting from time to time.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, I noticed on social media that she seemed to keep company (more probably, she had a crush on him) with a boy whose age I don't know but he seemed no less than <strong>16 year old</strong>. There were some... objectionable groups on his list -- with vulgar pictures of ""loli"", anime style preteen girls. Then one day she asks me to block him (we never talked about him before, he doesn't know me) because ""they had a quarrel so he can send me some slander about her"", maybe fake nudes or so. I told her whatever he sends it's him being disgusting, not her, and parents won't know and I won't shame her even if there were real nudes. The guy never contacted me.  </p>

<h2>----------</h2>

<p>Then soon after this story she meets <strong>a guy in her school</strong>. She
   doesn't tell parents but mom sees them walking together near our
   house. She says he's <strong>16</strong> but his social network page says he's
   <strong>18</strong> (usually in Russia school graduates are 17-18 year old), though he of course can put fake info on his page to look elder. He
   looks older than 16, but who knows. She denies having him as
   boyfriend but she changed her last name on her page to the same as
   his, and her profile pic is them taking selfie. Well, not going into
   details, it's obvious by her page that she at least has a crush on
   him or <strong>they are a couple</strong>.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Then one day dad sees them just staying together on stairs next to
our apartment door <em>(in Russia, residents usually are unfriendly and suspicious
to anyone spending time there, almost no one does it)</em> and yells at
the guy, telling him that he shouldn't be seen there anymore. It's
the first time dad sees the guy. Dad always yells a lot, of which I
am afraid but my sister isn't.  </p></li>
<li><p>Then one day mom comes home earlier than usual and sister doesn't
open the apartment door (so mom has to wait on stairs) for some
minutes which is pretty uncommon. When she eventually comes in
everything seems ok but the restroom door (very close to apartment
door) is closed. She proceeds to the kitchen and <strong>hears the
apartment door closing</strong>. Clearly my sister had a guest she didn't
want mom to see. Mom decides not to talk about it with my sister but
calls me the next day being worried that my sister had sex with that
guy.  </p></li>
<li><p>Then sister tells mom the <strong>teachers grumble</strong> about her having ""just
a friend"" elder than her.   And this guy also has ""loli"" groups. And
my sister too. Perhaps it's popular in teens nowadays.</p></li>
<li><p>Then mom gets a sneak peek of sister's messages (I think it's
absolutely wrong, but it was mom not me) and sees something about
this guy having problems with his sleep due to some <strong>drugs</strong> (for
context -- ""light"" drugs like Spice or naswar are sometimes heard to
be used among ""bad"" teens in Russia; drugs are illegal here but sellers often hire teens as couriers). I don't know the exact text mom
has seen. Supposedly my sister doesn't know mom saw her messages.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>----------</h2>

<p>So what should I do now?<br>
1) <strong>Can I somehow discourage her from having affairs with older guys at that age?</strong>   I've heard it's common for teen girls to like boys older than them, but I feel that 16-year-old boy being interested in 13-year-old girl is creepy. My sister is definitely not too mature for her age, neither in mind (not the kind of a kid who's bored with coevals) nor in body (very slender, tiny breasts). What I'm afraid of are ""unequal"" relations when he can press on her ""being elder and thus knowing better"".<br>
What makes things a bit worse, I have a boyfriend since I was 14 (he was my classmate), so if I tell her something like ""maybe it's not the time"" it may sound like some double standards (even if it's not, she's 13 and having a crush).<br>
2) <strong>Should I hurry to tell her about contraception?</strong>   My parents think that there's no need to tell children about sex (it's quite common in Russia: they told me nothing and always avoided the theme, so it was me who told my sister about menstruation). No sex ed in school also. Now I feel I have to tell her about contraception but we're not going to meet in person until summer at least. Before that I can visit them for a week at most, it's expensive but I have the money. Mom won't ever tell sister those things (I asked).  Moreover, I'm probably the only relative who can ever say to her she can have sex before marriage and even have an abortion if she doesn't want the baby.  </p>

<p>Or is it too late to do anything? I guess, for instance, if I tell her <em>withdrawal</em> is not safe at all but the guy tells her it's safe and he doesn't want condoms, she will listen to him, not me. And so on.  </p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong> 13-year-old sister seems to have 16-year-old boyfriend. <strong>Can and should I do something?</strong></p>

<p>Obviously it shouldn't be <em>my</em> problem, but the parents prefer to either be angry at her for keeping company with any boy or pretend nothing happens (that's their strategy when she has problems in school). But I feel things aren't alright and it's wrong for me to just look. Or am I wrong?</p>

<p>P.S. Feel free to ask if something is unclear: my English is not so good.</p>

"Toddler extremely reserved around others","<p>I have a 21 month old daughter. She started talking when she was about a year old; right now she's extremely talkative and energetic around us. My wife has been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born and I also spend plenty of time at home interacting with her.</p>

<p>We noticed that in any environments where there are other people, she becomes very reserved. At first we thought she was just a little bit shy and she'd get past this once she becomes familiar with other kids and grown-ups (we're not very social either although, once she was born, we tried to change this).</p>

<p>She now knows all of the other kids on our street, she talks about how she'll play with them and always asks us to go outside and play with them. Every once in a while she actually does play with them and she even becomes talkative. But, most of the time, she doesn't do anything, she only wants to sit in our arms, staying quiet the whole time.</p>

<p>Is this normal behavior? Is there any way of getting her to open up and start interacting more with others?</p>

I am an immigrant IT professional who speaks fluent English, but who learned his English as an adult. My child was born in America. I can easily communicate on work-related topics. But when my child asks me ""What is this?"" or ""What are you doing?"", I often find myself at a loss. For example, I am playing a tune by drumming with my feet, the child asks ""What are you doing?"" -- and I say ""Err.. I am making music by..."" [Hitting? No; Knocking? No; Stepping? With? Ugh...] Instead of a single word, all I can offer is a lengthy explanation that relies on technical or generic terms or ill-suited synonyms. With other adults that had been OK, but not with a preschooler. A related problem is figuring out pronunciation while reading children's books aloud. I've never heard these words spoken! Is there some online resource, a textbook, or a word/phrase list that I can memorize? Something more efficient than writing out phrases by hand from hundreds of children's books? Thanks!  (PS. I do speak in the native tongue too, but unwilling to curtail the rest of my child's development for the sake of bilingualism.)</p>

"How to help my 11-year-old daughter who is confused because she likes a girl?","<p>My 11-year-old daughter came to me and told me that she thinks she has feelings for another girl. She explained it as she has the same feelings for this girl that she has had for a boy all school year. By feelings she explained that she gets kind of nervous, happy, and her body just feels funny when she is around the girl and also the boy she likes. This girl is also one of her best friends. All 3 of them are in the same class at school and all 3 sit at the same table together. She is very confused as am I. I have tried to explain to her that her body is going through all kinds of changes because of puberty, she is getting older and growing up.</p>

<p>She told me that she has talked to her other two best friends at school about this. And one of the friends told her that she has felt that way about another girl also but she just told herself didn't really feel that way or couldn't feel that way because she also liked a boy. Do you think the conversation with her friends confused her also?</p>

<p>I don't know what to say or do or how to help her. I just want her to continue to feel comfortable enough to talk to me. What do I say or not say to help her? How can I help her understanding her own feelings when she doesn't understand them herself? I don't want to make her uncomfortable. </p>

<p>She is very open with me and her father. She has always been very open with her questions about boys, problems that she's having, and questions about her body. She has asked me to tell her Daddy about all of this because she wants to be honest with him but she is afraid that he will see her differently. How do I explain this to my husband when I do not understand all of it myself?</p>

"Getting real answers from a 3 year old","<p>Whenever we ask our 3-year-old an open-ended what or why question, he will usually just ask ""Why?"" or ""What?"" back. Examples:</p>

<p>(He seems like he doesn't feel well.) Do you not feel well? ""Yeah"" What doesn't feel well? ""What...?""</p>

<p>If you expand on those, e.g. ""Does your tummy hurt?"" he will just answer Yes, regardless of whether it actually hurts.</p>

<p>He's very well-developed in terms of speech, so it's not that he doesn't know the words. Are these questions just too open-ended for him to be able to comprehend what the actual ""answer"" is? Any way to help him develop this skill, so he can tell us what's actually wrong?</p>

"How should we address stuttering in a toddler?","<p>My 2.5 year old has recently developed what can be best described as a stutter.</p>

<p>It only seems to occur with us, and mostly when asking a question (""Wh, wh, wh, wh, what's that Daddy?). It's especially pronounced if he is tired.</p>

<p>It doesn't concern us greatly yet, he's happy and sociable. In fact it doesn't tend to occur around strangers.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: He's started to garble whole sentences recently, again mostly when he's tired, but he's also started getting noticeably frustrated.</p>

<p>His vocabulary is very wide and still growing quickly - if anything, it feels like his mouth can't keep up with this brain!</p>

<p>Is this similar to others experiences - how did you approach it? Should we ignore it (for now) and make no special effort, or would simple speech therapies help?</p>

The books she has available here at home are, 'Monster High' (Dolls and cartoon character) books. But are these types of books good to read?! She is currently in the fifth grade, but she is on a third grade reading level. I'm assuming this is what strays her away from reading.

"How can we potty-train our pre-schooler outside the home?","<p>We're having problems with our 3.5 year-old boy concerning potty training:</p>

<p>Since his birth it seems, that being cleaned is much more unpleasing to him than running around with brimful diapers for hours, other parents always said that their kids even request fresh diapers themselves, as they can't stand it, if it's full. For him, that seemed to be no problem. Not only that he did not let us know, he even denied it if we asked him directly if he has poo'd in his diaper.</p>

<p>He is now in the <strong>kindergarten</strong> for 9 months and it is especially pronounced there:
He he says when he needs to pee but does not say when he needs to poo. </p>

<p>In contrast <strong>at home</strong> it works very well:<br>
He runs around without diaper and since some months he reliably goes to his potty in time and is even proud of his poo (we are also honestly and happy with each of them landing in the potty and show him.)</p>

<p>However, when we are <strong>in town</strong> or somewhere on the way, he would not tell me that he needs a toilet, fills his diaper clandestinely and normally would not tell me - sometimes even deny if I ask him, if ""something is in his diapers"".</p>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Does anyone else have similar experience and how could that be solved?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>More information:</p>

<p>I often tried to talk to him (and the kindergarten teacher) why he does not go to the toilet in time or at least tells somebody if it's too late already.
From his comments (and my experience) there are several possible reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>He <strong>fears to loose his toys</strong> or that someone destroys e. g. his building brick construction when he goes away to the toilet (the kindergarten teacher then tells him that it will be still there for him, when he comes back). </li>
<li>He is <strong>""too busy""</strong> (does not want to interrupt playing).</li>
<li>He does not want to disrupt a <strong>group activity</strong> like singing or reading a story or lunch by saying that he must go to the toilet</li>
<li>He <strong>seems to not like the little toilets</strong> in the kindergarten, but I could not find out why. At home he has his potty and seems to be happy with it. In the kindergarten this is not possible unfortunately (not even an exception, otherwise all other kids would also want their potty being there). The kindergarten teacher however assured me that she even checks for him it its clean before he goes in.</li>
<li>Maybe it is his way to gain some <strong>extra care and attention</strong> by the kindergarten teacher.</li>
<li>He said to me once, the other (mostly older) kids are saying <strong>""ick!""</strong> if he has a full diaper and if it stinks. So it might be <strong>embarassing</strong> for him what happens, but that seems not to help him to get rid of the situation...</li>
<li>Getting cleaned seems to be unpleasant for him, but surely it gets worse if he run around in his full diaper for an hour or more and he also knows that. He knows perfectly well that it might be less painful if he told us sooner, but he does not. If his full diaper is ""detected"", he then proposes on his own that I shall clean him in the shower instead of just taking a wet washcloth which might cause pain for his (then) already red skin)!</li>
</ul>

<p>We had <strong>tried it without diapers</strong> in the kindergarten for some time (some months ago) but we gave up, as we had again and again several dirty trousers per day and so he has diapers in the kindergarten.</p>

<p>It adds to the problem, that his digestion seems to be somehow special, so he sometimes poos a <strong>great amount</strong> at once [the last two days we had dirty trousers for this reason, although he had worn diapers! it just flow out, as he did not tell anybody so that he even had to take a shower in the kindergarten] and on other days it's the <strong>frequency</strong>, so we have up to 4 more or less small amounts of poo per day.</p>

<p>The kindergarten teacher which is his psychological parent is very friendly, nice and cooperative and I admire her patience. However, she is at a loss with the situation as we are - she says she talks to him nearly each day about that, but it does not seem to change anything.</p>

<p>Our son is quite clever and often knows quite well what he has to say as an excuse to get out of something, so it seems to be even possible that he might be ""manipulating"" what he tells me about what happens in the kindergarten or about his reasons not to go to the toilet.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
The <strong>problem seems to be solved</strong> - however we'll have to see if it is a permanent solution.</p>

<p>One day, 2 weeks ago, it happened that the diapers in the nursery went out (for children older than 3 years, the parents have to supply them and we were not informed that there were not enough any more), so the kindergarten teachers let our son stay some hours without diapers and he managed that without big ""accidents"".</p>

<p>I seized the opportunity and asked him the next morning to go to the nursery without diapers. He agreed and now he is without diapers in the nursery since one week and it works (apart from some small accidents with poo'ed underwear, but sh*t happens ;-)).</p>

<p>Also when we were in town or in the circus in the afternoon, I let him without diapers and it worked very well, he was able to control himself and the pants stayed dry.</p>

<p>So that seems to be big step forward. Sure, this is only for one week now and there might be ""relapses"", but we're optimistic.</p>

<p>(Of course, when he sleeps he's not yet aware of peeing and needs diapers, so that will be the next step when all works well reliably during daytime.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong></p>

<p>At the moment, there are <strong>many ""relapses""</strong>: wet underpants during our trip yesterday, later at home even a small poo in the fresh underpants, today poo'ed trousers and underwear in the kindergarten...</p>

<p>All that was in the course of a series of days with really bad ""mood"", where our son quickly overreacts if the slightest thing is not exactly how he wanted to have it. We used to have that often in the first 3 years until some months ago when those phases seemed to get shorter and less pronounced.</p>

<p>We'll have to see how it continues...  </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong></p>

<p>(2 months later)
Well, we finally have made good progress:
We've been on holiday abroad for 2 weeks with our son and everything worked perfectly well (during daytime): he went to the toilet together with me and also told us on his own if he needed a toilet. No accidents at all. :-)</p>

<p>The diapers were only needed for the night, where he apparently is not aware of peeing before it starts. So because of the lack of washing and drying facilities we did not want to risk wet beds.  </p>

<p>We'll have to see how it will work now back in the kindergarten...</p>

<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong></p>

<p>5 days at home, 3 poo'ed underpants. :-(
At least he seems to tell us by himself now, when the underpants are dirty.
... It's not over yet.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 5:</strong>
Well, we had 12 days with no accident (neither at home nor in the kindergarten), and then 2 days with ""accidents"" (but small amount of poo in the underwear) again... 
... and now even 2 big ""accidents"" (one at home and one in the kindergarten).... :(</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong> (2 months since Edit 5 and 7 months after original question)  </p>

<p>We had some phases where everything went well for some days, but already before christmas the number of accidents in kindergarten increased.
During the christmas holidays at home it went quite well (apart from 3 ""accidents"") and then back in the kindergarten we're now moving step by step <em>backwards</em> ...
Very full panties, tights, ... and we don't see any regular ""pattern"".
The worst is, that he still mostly does not tell the teachers if the pants are dirty and that he even often is lying and denies that he has to be cleaned and then even spreads it more and more everywhere in his clothes.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 7:</strong> (10 months after last edit and 1.5 years after original question)</p>

<p>Our son is now 5 years old.
We had hard times in between - it got better, than it got worse again, we had many problems with the kindergarten, because the kindergarten teachers were not willing to support us any more and finally wanted us/our son to wear diapers during the day again - which he did not want (and we did not want either, because then there would have been no more motivation to go to the toilet at all...).</p>

<p>We had consulted different doctors (2 pediatricians, one ""expert"" for digestion who proved to be a charlatan which made some very expensive but totally useless analysis and convinced us giving our son medicine to ""stabilize"" the gut flora... with no effect at all).</p>

<p>Finally, by hazard we heard the term <strong>""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encopresis"" rel=""noreferrer"">encopresis</a>""</strong> and with this new search term, we found out:</p>

<ul>
<li>it is an illness</li>
<li>there are specialists (doctors) who know about it<br>
(before, no one understood us or our child - neither in the kindergarten nor the pediatrician..., nobody took us seriously, everybody thought about psychological causes for the problem - the child ""seeking attention"" by his behavior... )</li>
<li>we went to a special ambulance for such problems</li>
</ul>

<p>We learned from the doctor, </p>

<ul>
<li>that our son must have had obstipation, which finally explained why he always made very small amounts of poo in the underwear - sometimes several times a day, which we had considered being diaarhea</li>
<li>that our son has to learn to control it and that it may take a long time...</li>
</ul>

<p>So since some months now, we are doing a <strong>toilet training</strong>, which means:</p>

<ul>
<li>after each meal (breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, diner) our son has to go to the toilet and stay there for 5..10 minutes</li>
<li>for each day, he did <em>that</em> (no matter if pants got dirty or not!!!), he got a sticker which he could paste on a kind of calendar sheet (one field for each day) for documenting how it worked</li>
<li>we had a list marking when it worked well and when it didn't (e. g. he refuses to go to the toilet after the meal or also what happened when (poo, pee, in the toilet/pants...)</li>
</ul>

<p>We apologized to our son for setting him under pressure and for having him punished because of the dirty underwear...</p>

<p>Now it works much better, there are only small amounts of poo in the pants maybe every 1..2 weeks, but <em>no large ""accidents"" any more</em>, where a large amount of poo is distributed everywhere in pants/socks....</p>

<p>One large problem we could not solve up to now: our son does not tell us/kindergarten teachers directly, if he has poo in his pants... in the kindergarten he might hide it for hours, at home if playing or activity is too interesting, he won't tell us... that's a big problem for us..</p>

<p>EDIT 8<br>
(10 months after last edit and >2years after original question)</p>

<p>things did not change much since the last edit:
in general it works quite well (with some ""accidents"") but there are phases, when it does not really work any more: small stains of poo in the underwear nearly daily, rarely a large amount and nearly never he tells anyone to help him :( </p>

<p>EDIT 9
(5 months after last edit and about 2.5 years after original question)  </p>

<p>not much news: often it works quite well, but there are phases of sometimes several weeks, where there are at least small stains of poo in the underwear 2..3 times daily and nearly each day and even sometimes a large amount...<br>
Situation in the kindergarten is still difficult, there are sometimes problems with young or unexperienced teachers (mostly interns) which show even less understanding for the problem than the experienced teachers...
And he often avoids being ""caught"" and hides himself, so that my wife or I have to clean him when we pick him up and often he's apparently been around with dirty pants for quite a long time there...
The therapy in the specialized hospital has brought us forward a lot, but it is still very hard to cope with this issue and the consequences.</p>

<p>.. as he'll soon go to school, here's my new question: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/11762/how-to-deal-with-encopresis-in-primary-school"">How to deal with Encopresis in primary school?</a></p>

<h3>EDIT 10</h3>

<p>(10 months after last update, 3.5 years after original question)</p>

<p>There followed many difficult months - if my notes are correctly the longest durations with no soiled pants were about 7..10 consecutive days, and there were phases where it happened several times per day and also on the following days.. 
After the time in the day care was over, it also continued happening during our holidays when he was at home or when we were on holiday travelling.</p>

<p><strong>Positive:</strong> he now (during the last 2 months) told us much more often when he needed help for cleaning and he sometimes also felt that he needed at toilet before it was too late.
Even when invited on a birthday party he told to a parent that he needed help (we're very proud). </p>

<p>We were very concerned how it should be when he would be going to school in autumn. We informed the teachers in advance. Up to now all went quite well, it was only once that he had a soiled pants during school hours, maybe a dozen during the daycare after school and some more in the afternoon or during the week end.</p>

<p>The longest ""clean"" phases without soiled pants were about 2..3 weeks, and there were not many of them. :-(</p>

<p>So the problem is still not solved, but it is much reduced and we get along with it much better now, but it is still a burden for him and for us and restricts his life:</p>

<ul>
<li>he/we can go nowhere without having some backup underwear with him (or placed somewhere)</li>
<li>if no one from us (parents, grandparents) is with him, we have to talk to the adults he'll be with and have to rely on him telling them by himself if he needs help in case of an ""accident""</li>
<li>nocturnal enuresis is still there</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>EDIT 11</h3>

<p>(2 years and 10 months after last update, 6 years and 4 months after original question)</p>

<p>Our son is nearly 10 years old now. We still have the problem, that he sometimes soils his pants.<br>
I've given up trying to do statistics or understanding something. It just happens sometimes (estimated every 7..10 days). Luckily, the cases when the amount of poo in the pants is high seem to happen more rarely, but they still happen. And he still often ignores it and just walks around like that until his mother or me smell it and tell him to clean himself.  </p>

<p>It happens especially often in situations, where he (I suppose) just not wants to listen to the signs of his body (and in consequence go to the toilet), but concentrate on something else - e. g. birthday parties of his friends or our family, play dates when he has invited friends to our home or is invited by a friend, ...</p>

<p>I let him wash his pants himself.</p>

<p>He also still has no control over bedwetting at night and still needs to sleep in diapers.</p>

<p>During the last years I came to the conclusion, that he very often ignores the signs of his body and has to learn to take better care of his body and his body's needs (like not ignoring hunger and not forget eating because he wants to play or work on something, ...)</p>

<h1>Summary: General remarks for other parents from my experience</h1>

<p>(3.5 years after original post)</p>

<p>What I learned during those difficult years (which are still not over):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>don't blame your child</strong>, just calmly help him clean up things (without any negative comments about how much work this is for you)!</li>
<li><strong>relax</strong> (I know how difficult this is!!) and try to avoid the stress which such situations can cause to you and your child, because this stress even can make things worse in a vicious circle</li>
<li>seek help from doctors and psychologists</li>
<li>I try to help my son to build self-confidence and learn being positive about his life and his chances.</li>
<li>I now start believing that there are very often (if not always) relations between health/ physical aspects and psyche, so don't ignore the psychological help (thinking that your child is ""normal"" and does not need a psychologist. Your child might be perfectly normal, but the circumstances of his life might make him/her do strange things or have health problems)! The ideas and meditations from <a href=""http://www.louisehay.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Louise L. Hay</a> were very interesting for me in this  context.</li>

"How do we determine what school is best when a child is high performing on the Autism Spectrum (Aspergers)?","<p>I have two children at primary school (5 and 7, primary school is from 4 to 11 in the UK) and there is a possibility of moving them both to a different school in the same area (we're not moving house). The eldest child is currently being assessed for autism, specifically Aspergers. </p>

<p>What are the most important criteria we should evaluate when considering which school is best for the family? If we decide to change what steps should we consider to prepare? How can we best handle uncertainty and disagreement between parents?</p>

<p>If anyone has any links to articles about Aspergers and changing schools that would be useful.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>The full story.</p>

<p>My wife thinks the new school will be better at helping with the Asperger's (although there's no evidence to support this and I think the current school will be just as good in this regard) and is smaller (one class per year). However, the current school is better academically (he's incredibly bright, especially at science and maths) and has better facilities, and he has several friends there.</p>

"What are the chances that my wife will give birth vaginally after having a caesarean section in a previous pregnancy?","<p>My wife is now 4 months into our second pregnancy. Our first child was born via caesarean section. Our doctor told us that since the second child will be born within 2 years of the c-section, the second child will be born via c-section as well. Actually, this is sad news for us, because we really want our children born vaginally.</p>

<p>I would like to make sure that what the doctor said is right. Is there any valid research which shows that the minimal range to give birth vaginally is 2 years after having caesarean section? What are the chances that my wife will be able to give birth vaginally?</p>

"Should I let my child play with gun toys?","<p>I've noticed a great many parents do everything within their power to prevent their children playing with toy guns and weapons. As a 30-something, I grew up with toy swords, bows and guns, action men (GI Joe's) and ninja turtles etc. I'd hope most people who know me would consider that I've turned into a reasonable and well-balanced adult, just as those who I grew up with have also done.</p>

<p>My son recently turned 1 and currently doesn't have any gun / weapon toys, but as he gets older I suspect there will come a time when he wants to play ""Cops and Robbers"" or similar. Currently I'm not against the idea of him having toy weapons, but at the same time I don't want to expose him to anything that'll turn him into a violent or aggressive adult.</p>

<p>Most sources I've read state there's no correlation:    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No study has yet linked pretend gunplay to future violent behavior,
  and most child experts agree that by forbidding gunplay entirely,
  parents give it far more power and will probably drive it underground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.babycenter.com/0_boys-and-guns-okay-to-play_3656152.bc"">Source 1</a></p>

<p>I've always thought that children don't really relate this type of play to violence and that it's more about good verses evil - but it's important to ensure they have some context / awareness of how to role-play those scenarios appropriately. Echoed by this article: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That doesn't mean this type of play is about violence, however.
  According to Thompson, it's really about dominance and heroism,
  winning and losing, and who gets to be the good guy in the end.
  Sometimes ""there is aggression and hurtfulness, and that must be
  stopped,"" Thompson says.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/parenting/features/toy-guns-do-they-lead-real-life-violence"">Source 2</a></p>

<p>Is preventing children playing with toy guns more a projection of the parents views or is it from a genuine belief (or study) that it is likely to harm the child's development?</p>

<p>If you don't let your child play with weapons, can you explain your rationale?</p>

<p>Likewise, if you do - why? Also, do you impose any controls or limits around play ""violence""?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>A few people have asked for background information on my location and laws here:</p>

<p>I'm from the UK, so access to a real gun by a child is very remote. Toy guns are legal, but almost all I see for sale are in bright / unrealistic colours etc. As others have mentioned, wherever you live, it's probably wise to ensure a toy can be identified as such from a distance.</p>

<p>However (despite the title), my question isn't gun specific - I'm interested in how to ensure ""violent"" play (including swords and bows etc.) doesn't encourage real violence or aggression. So, as one answerer touched upon - how they teach a kitchen knife isn't for playing with is valid in this context. </p>

"Is it wrong for a parent to partake in screaming/dominating competitions with their kids?","<p>I'm not the parent and I don't have any kids, so this is just based on what I observe.</p>

<p>There's this mother who, when her daughter (about 3 years old) starts crying and making a fuss, she'll lose her patience and try to ""out scream"" or ""out annoy"" her. In other words, she starts crying and screaming, and the mother will tell the child, ""I can scream louder!!!!!!!!! AH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" and give those sort of responses, basically over-yelling, etc., as if it's some sort of dominating display attempt to teach the kid (e.g., ""I'm the parent and I can scream louder and I'm in control!!!!!!""). </p>

<p>From what I notice, the child will keep crying and having a tantrum, and eventually the mother will completely neglect/ignore her by scaring her and yelling at her to stay in her room and will tell the daughter that she'll refuse to listen to her or get her anything unless she ""shuts up"" and stops crying. My assumption is the child stops crying when she's physically exhausted from it; not because she learned anything from the method. In short, the behavior doesn't change and it's not something I like being around.</p>

<p>What happens next is the daughter keeps screaming, crying, etc., and as the duration increases, the mother will occasionally enter the room and continue screaming very loudly and angrily at her, near to the point where it's heard houses away. </p>

<p>My question is, is this damaging/unproductive in raising a kid? Is trying to ""defeat"" your children harmful by trying to illustrate to them that you're, say, louder, can yell louder, can be more annoying, can pull harder (in, say, a tantrum when the child is yanking stuff) or even throw stuff after the kids do it to try and ""teach them"" it's wrong by doing the same thing to a greater extent.</p>

<p>For another example, a child has a tantrum and starts breaking stuff, and the parent gets explosively angry and starts screaming and breaking stuff in a more vicious manner.</p>

<p>What are the consequences of this, and how would this affect kids? More importantly, is this bad 100%?</p>

"How do you teach your children about regional colloquialisms?","<p>We live in an area that is relatively new to me.  Since moving here, I've found that there are some colloquial phrasings specific to this region that are particularly jarring to my ear.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/5407/central-pennsylvanian-english-speakers-what-are-the-limitations-on-the-needs-w"">if a verb like needs is followed by a passive construction in the infinitive, the ""to be"" portion is left out</a>.  </p>

<p>Then again, I have my own regional colloquialisms that are grammatically incorrect, yet to which my ""syntax ear"" is apparently deaf.</p>

<p>Given how pervasive some of these are, I suspect that the public school system will not put much, if any, effort into enforcing the more ""standard"" phrasings.</p>

"How much should you buy for your child to keep up with their peers?","<p>How should you go about balancing the possessions you buy for your child against peer pressure from other children (particularly at school) and parents?</p>

<p>Many parents feel the need for their children to keep up to date with whatever other children might have, be it the latest trainers (sneakers), smartphone or tablet computer. The fear being either their child will be bullied or they'll miss out on educational or social opportunities.</p>

<p>I'm conscious of the effect of this ""have / have not"" scenario on both my child and other children - where if say, I jumped on the bandwagon and bought my child an iPad, chances are there'll be one or more children who won't get one because their parents can't afford it.</p>

<p>I'd imagine none of us want to have their child be the ""odd one out"", but what is a sensible balance?</p>

<ul>
<li>Having (practically) everything? This is the expensive option, plus it puts more
pressure on other parents and children. I'd also assume this would make it difficult to make the child appreciate how lucky they are if they get everything automatically.</li>
<li>Have some of the things from their peer group? What would you prioritise, bearing in mind children can be very brand conscious and their attention / interest in the latest craze may be short-lived.</li>
<li>Have very little of the ""in things"", trying to teach the child to appreciate what they do have and explain that there will always be someone with more than them, so they have to learn to accept that?</li>
</ul>

<p>With the following in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Like any parent, I want my child to have every opportunity and the best education.</li>
<li>Like most parents, our family has a limited budget with a balance of priorities.</li>
<li>We don't want our child to be bullied or excluded from social situations.</li>
<li>We don't want other children to be left out or increase the pressure for their parents.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Some people commenting and answering have misinterpreted my intentions - I'm not proposing spoiling my child by buying everything they want on a whim. My question relates to situations where all or most children in their class already have something and my child doesn't. The people preaching about how bad it is to hand children everything on a plate have missed the point of this question...</p>

<p>I'd agree with the sentiment that children should be taught not measure their worth in possessions or what they have. However, the further away they are from the situation of their peers, the more difficult they'll find being included and socialising at school. As one answerer already mentions, this really breaks down into two areas: possessions purely for status and prerequisites for participation.</p>

<p>Whilst it's easy to justify not buying fancy shoes, but when all the other child communicate after school using an app, play on-line together on their consoles or ride to their park on their pedal go carts (and your child has none of these things), the other children not playing with mine isn't bullying, it's situational. Ignoring that would just leave my child excluded.</p>

He is now in Kindergarten, and my wife and I hoped that with his recent diagnoses, medication and change of scenery to ""big boy"" school he would show signs of improvement.  He hasn't.  School is in its fourth week and he has been sent to the principal's office every day but 3.  He has run out of the class.  Dumped things out of their containers in the classroom and principle's office.  Thrown various tantrums.  Threatened teachers and the principles.</p>

He said he was thinking about what it would be like to have a lose tooth so he wanted to see if he could make the other kid's tooth loose.  So he's been suspended from school for a day.</p>

<p>He's a very smart kid.  He already does pretty much everything they're supposed to be doing at the end of the school year, so he's not suffering academic-wise, yet.  At home, he's really well behaved most of the time.  When he does start acting up it's usually later in the day, and he's tired.  So this doesn't seem to explain his behavior in the early afternoon when he's at school.</p>

<p>We've tried every type of reward/punishment we can think of to do.  Right now he has the incentive of hosting a party which he can invite anyone he wants to where we'll have a movie night with popcorn and decorations and whatever else he wants, if he can go one week without being sent to the principal.  His teacher knows about it, and reminds him about it when he starts to act up, but so far it hasn't stopped him.</p>

<p>He's told us that Kindergarten is boring and that he wants to go to first grade.  We told him that's fine, but they're not going to let that be an option until he shows that he can be in class and behave.  We have run out of ideas.  The psychiatrist keeps saying to ""look for the triggers"", but there don't seem to be any.  Sometimes he literally looks for something to upset him.  His trigger is getting what he wants, when he wants, by whatever means necessary.  He doesn't seem to care about rewards or punishments when he's set his mind to something.  Has anyone dealt with something like this before?  Any advice?  We really need some outside the box thinking here, because we've tried everything we can think of.  We've even read books about ""kids like him"", but nothing has helped.</p>

"Caring for the Children of Deceased Parents","<p>I am really wrestling with an issue that recently came up. Here is the background story: My brother-in-law (my wife's brother) has talked to my wife and said that he wants to name us as the care-takers of his children in his will if anything was to happen to both him and his wife. Here's the footnote to that, though. They have five young children, and one of those five is a special-needs child. To get a better idea of the social element between my family (wife and two young children) and theirs, we live on the other side of the country from them and it would be a huge stretch to even remotely say that we are ""close"".</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the typical obligation would be here at this point. It's one thing if we are talking about one child, or even two children. But five children (one with special needs) is quite an undertaking that I'm not sure is reasonable or even possible. Here are some points I struggle with:</p>

<ul>
<li>I work hard to provide for my wife (stay at home Mother) and my two children. Truth is, I'm not sure if my income could provide for an additional 5 people.  My children would do without in many aspects of their lives.</li>
<li>Accommodations simply aren't there. Yes there is a spare bedroom, but talking about the magnitude of five extra people to provide sustainable and long term living quarters, I just don't see it.</li>
<li>Family element. Call it what you want, but as a father and a husband I enjoy spending my life with my wife and my children. Realistically speaking, adding five additional children to which I have no real bond to will most definitely change everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we were the only other family to where these kids could go to, I'd say that's one thing. But we are surely not. In this family there are also my wife's parents (which would also be the same parents of her brother -- the kids' grandparents), my wife's brother's wife's sister (sorry for the confusion, could also be referred to as my brother-in-law's sister-in-law, the aunt of the kids on the other side of the family), and my wife's brother's wife's mother (the other grandmother, on that side of the family).</p>

<p>To undertake this responsibility alone just doesn't seem possible, appropriate, or feasible. What is the typical thing to do here? Given the quantity (five) and the requirements (one special-needs child), I would think this hardly fits in a ""typical"" scenario of care takers in the event parents pass away. But I would truly like to hear thoughts on this.</p>

<p>Am I wrong for thinking the way I'm thinking?</p>

<p>Is this just simply an inappropriate request from my wife's brother?</p>

"How to handle a 1-year-old pointing at and wanting things?","<p>My 1-year-old daughter has started pointing at things. Sometimes she ""wants"" them, to either hold herself or just touch, sometimes she seems to be satisfied with simply having the thing named. </p>

<p>Depending on what we are doing we either fulfill her ""want"" - give her the teddy bear or show the picture, etc. - or not. Then she often gets upset and keeps pointing and wanting for a while. Then, sometimes, stops and engages herself in another activity. Or one of us gives/shows her the thing.</p>

<p>In general we try to use common sense and don't let her start ruling us. I was wondering however, whether there is some well accepted way of handling this kind of behavior, since most (all?) kids go through this phase? Are there any studies about it?</p>

<p>Each time she is awake she gets some ""tummy-time"" where we put her on her stomach on a play-mat, to build up her neck muscles.  She doesn't like it that much and usually ends up crying after a few minutes of this.</p>

<p>Also, when we hold her so she is facing us, against our chest, she often jerks her head back like she doesn't enjoy being held that way.</p>

"Kids and tidying up with KonMari method","<p>I have found an interest in the <a href=""http://tidyingup.com/"">KonMari method</a> of tidying up.

"Hobby vs. baby balance","<h3>Some context</h3>

<p>During the week, I work every day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. About once a week I finish about two hours later because I’m visiting a client in another city.</p>

<p>When I am not working, I’m at home where I take good part in the chores and taking care of the baby.</p>

<p>This week, the sport I am doing will resume after the winter break. I’m doing it one evening a week. It is weather dependent, so the duration is variable. Sometime it could take the whole evening (from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.), and sometime it could last less than an hour or even be cancelled.</p>

<h3>Now the parenting part</h3>

<p>I am the happy father of a 1 ½ month old baby :)</p>

<h3>And the problem</h3>

<p>My wife says I should stop doing this sport for at least a year. She says she needs more help at home, and that going to this sport shows a lack of involvement in our baby and family. On my side, I have the feeling that this is giving me a rest from work-baby-sleep-work-baby-… I believe that it’s good for me, hence for them, to maintain a minimal activity outside home and work.</p>

From the Wikipedia article linked above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between 0–3 months, infants make what Dunstan calls sound reflexes...There are other reflexes that all babies experience, and when sound is added to these, a distinct, preemptive ""cry"" will occur before the infant breaks into what Dunstan calls the hysterical cry. Dunstan claims that these preemptive cries can indicate what the infant requires (e.g., food, comfort, sleep, etc.), and they escalate to the hysterical cry if they are not answered.</p>

"How do I get my parents to let me vacation by myself?","<p>I'm planning to take a vacation next month. Since I started planning for it, my parents have continually expressed doubt and concern and generally interfered in the plans. They want to know where and with whom I'm staying, and recently have even begin pressing me for contact information and other details. (Though I'm a legal adult, housing costs in my country make it unfeasible to move out on my own without being married. As a result, I still live with my parents.)</p>

<p>The truth is that I'm going to a pony convention with a friend from America. Though I haven't met them in person yet and though they're reluctant to share their real-life information (and even more reluctant to get involved with my parents), I've known them for a few years and I trust them. At the insistence of my parents that I spend more time abroad than just the convention, I've also planned to stay with another American friend for about a week. (I'm also planning to engage in activities of an adult nature with my friends while I'm there.)</p>

<p>In previous attempts to appease my parents, I've told them that I'm going to the convention in order to showcase things of a technical nature, and that I'll be sharing a room with project staff. This worked fairly well initially, but they've become increasingly agitated lately and have even begun expressing a desire to go along with me. I fear that that won't end well, or will at least ruin my enjoyment of the trip. How do I reassure them and convince them that I'm perfectly capable of handling myself and should be left alone?</p>

<p>Some extra details: I'm male, 21, living in an Asian country. I'm attending university and have a part-time job, which nets me enough for me to save up for personal things, but I still live with my parents and by extension their food and lodging. My culture is ""traditional"", to the extent of being ignorant of homosexuality and (at best) thinking transsexuality is strange. As for my relationship with my parents, I mainly want to avoid conflict. I feel like deception is preferable.

"How can I tell parents of a 1-year-old that they're doing it wrong?","<p>Without getting into the circumstances, my wife's step sister and her husband are living with us while he's between orders with the US army. She's 28 and he's 42. </p>

<p>While they're living with us, it's very obvious that <strong>they don't know how to handle a baby.</strong> I'd be more than happy to share some wisdom, to offer suggestions, to just help, but I don't want to overstep the boundaries and make an already crowded and tense situation even worse. </p>

<p>How can I help these people <strong>how to be parents?</strong></p>

<p>As a father of 5 (the 21 yo has his own place) I've been around that block a couple of times and my opinion is that they're doing it wrong. Of course I wouldn't tell them that in so many words, but it is what I think: if you're not truly <em>trying</em> to do it right, you’re doing it wrong. </p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There's <strong>no baby level stimulus.</strong> They will watch adult (not porn lol) streaming shows all day and holler at their kid for getting into my kids' things (I've told them it doesn't matter; the things won't be damaged). <em>Not even so much as Dora or even Pixar or the odd baby centric website.</em></p></li>
<li><p>They have actual <strong>expectations on the baby's behavior</strong>... ""you know better than that"" with pulling the laptop off the couch and ""screams and screams when he doesn't get his way"". <em>At 1 year old, no baby is capable of knowing better than anything other than what you teach them on a very basic level, nor is he capable of any level of manipulation. At all.</em></p></li>
<li><p>There's <strong>no attempt at routine</strong> nor any baby level interaction. At that age, my kids were amazingly easy to care for once major daily rituals were developed. <em>Want him to go down for the night without a fuss? Start doing about a half hour bedtime ritual.</em> </p></li>
<li><p>And therein lies the prompt for this post. Tonight, the baby lay there crying for prob 30 minutes in bed. It was a different cry... wasn't pain, but something was wrong. They said, ""he's just crying because he didn't get what he wanted"". <em>Dude, he's 1, man... he doesn't <strong>desire</strong> something, he <strong>needs</strong> something.</em> </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have attempted to talk about these things once or twice, but the response is of the ""he's just"" type. <strong>Dismissive.</strong> Yes, he's their kid and no I'm not the parent. I can accept that. However, being in the unique position of knowing that the approach I'm using for my 9 yr old was successful for my 19/21 yr old, I do have a little experience. </p>

<p>I can just see where all this is going to be in 4, 8, 15 years, and I'd like to help the boy by helping his parents. How?</p>

<hr>

<p>[update edit june 20 2013]</p>

<p>I had to actually confer with the wife and it was only 5 weeks ago that this whole thing came to a head and I basically told them I'd had enough and it was time to go. The wife was 100% with me. It was the week of the Boston stuff, and the mother was irate that she couldn't talk about having a bad day. You know what? Sure, you can have a bad day. However, basic decorum says that you should just keep that to yourself while the news of extraordinary suffering is fresh on peoples minds. <em>Bottom line is that I don't want to be around the person that I have to explain that to nor do I want them around my family.</em> And with that, they were gone the next day.</p>

<p>Sad thing is that as good as I felt about not having to deal with them any more, my heart goes out to that child.</p>

"How does one address Christianity with their children in a mixed faith marriage?","<p>I am Christian (though admittedly, liberally so) while my husband is Agnostic.  He agrees that it is appropriate for our child to receive some education in my faith, but we have been unable to find a Church community in our area that we both feel comfortable regularly taking our child to as most of them would not teach tolerance of, and respect for my husband's beliefs (we've tried, we are in a VERY conservative area).</p>

<p>For this reason, we are not attending church regularly so teaching my daughter about my faith and beliefs is largely up to me.  I want her to know about Christianity (as well as other faiths for that matter) and to teach her how to think about faith, belief and values that allows her room for some choice when she is older.  Of course I hope my example will also have a positive impact, but I do specifically feel she needs to know that stories and traditions that make up part of her heritage (and a large part of our culture) in both an <strong>academic</strong> (most Sunday School Curricula don't seem all that ""academic"" to me) and ""fun"" way.</p>

<p><strong>What kinds of things should I consider when choosing books</strong>, videos, games and activities to use with her while teaching her values both my husband and I share as well as the more faith-based values only I hold to?  </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Due to ""questions"" asked about why teach it then?  I thought this further clarification was needed.  I will reiterate the wish for an ""<strong>academic</strong>"" look. This isn't about discovering faith, it is about having a relevant literary background.  I believe knowledge is key in understanding.  This relates to building empathy toward others and combating prejudice based in ignorance.  Knowledge can be used to defeat fear mongering against ""the other"" whoever that ""other"" may be.  I believe in also exposing her to other world religions, but I believe in starting with what you know best (as a teacher).  She has even joined in with friends for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah"">Hanukkah</a> this year, and knows a little about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali"">Divaali</a>.  We both have learning to do in regard to non-Christian religions.  As a scientist, (Botany) I believe in evolution and can also explain this standpoint easily.  I want her to know The Bible well - whatever her choice about it.  Eventually, I intend to have her read at least some of the Koran as well.  When you know some of the basics, it is a lot more difficult to be overly judgmental about those that believe differently than you and a lot easier to find the commonalities as well as easier to make an informed decision about what you accept yourself.</p>

<p>Finally, she is moving into a study of Medieval Europe.  She is a huge History connoisseur and just can't get enough.  At six, she can rattle off names of Greek Philosophers, Roman Emperors, describe Myths from both traditions as well as from Babylon, Egypt, China and Japan.  She can't necessarily remember every date and every name, but she can offer a surprising amount of information from any Human History between the first farmers to the Fall of Rome.  Ancient India and China have not been forgotten in our studies either.  To fully grasp the upcoming period in her history studies, she has to have some understanding of the basics of Christianity and its story and will also need to gain some understanding of Early Islam as well.  ""Skipping it"" until she is an adult is not realistic even if I wasn't Christian myself if she is to be well-informed in the subject she loves most, History.</p>

"Is 5 Year Old Exhibiting Bullying Signs?","<p>My SO and I are concerned about his 5yo's recent behavior.  She has become sneaky, rebellious, defiant, manipulative, and slightly physical with her 4yo sister, but never with other children. It truly feels like we are dealing with a teenager.  </p>

<p>He and their mother divorced almost a year ago, and we know the disruption of what was once their normal life has some place in blame (even though the mother was very absent.)  When they are with us (50/50 custody,) they have a clean home, daily routine, balanced meals, family game/movie/story time.  We are strict but also very loving. At the children's mother's home, however, she has basically moved in her boyfriend of 3 months, who has 4 VERY rambunctious children, she does not promote routine, allows her children to eat only what they want (fast food, mac-n-cheese for all meals, etc,) only pays attention to them when there is a camera around, the list goes on.  She has also began emotionally caring for her new beau's children more so than her own.  There is no talking to her about this issue, as she swears it only happens in our home, and it's the 4yo that acts up.</p>

<p>When she doesn't think she can be seen or heard, the 5yo attempts to make her sister do things she knows are unacceptable.  The other day she quietly told her sister to mess with the bathtub faucet, while the 4yo pleaded with her ""No, I don't want to get in trouble! I don't want to!"" And she kept trying and trying until we walked in. When her sister asks her questions, she either ignores her or yells at her.  She'll lie several times to our faces and say that her sister did something we caught HER in, and when she finally stops lying, she rolls her eyes, huffs, and says things like, ""Ok, look,"" or ""Fine, I did it.""  When she's put into time out or privileges get taken away, she is well informed on what she has done wrong, but when we ask her what she did, she looks away, smirks, and just says, ""Don't we go to mommy's today?"" or ""I don't know"" until we sit there for 5 minutes, and she decides to admit she knows what she did. Even when we have our heart-to-hearts and she starts acting like a well behaved child again, she explains, in great detail, why NOT to do things, but not why she did them.</p>

<p>I'm a full advocate of spanking, as it was done to me twice in my life, and it only built respect, not fear, for my grandmother, however, we both feel it inappropriate for a non-blood relative to physically chastise a child.  He is nervous to spank because the ex would probably claim he was being abusive so she could get full custody. (Luckily we are in a state that wouldn't go for that, but it would still be a hassle.) </p>

<p>Does anyone have methods they have tried for these behaviors and the kids who JUST DON'T get it? We know she's seeking attention, but she gets so much positive attention from us, that we don't know why or how to deal with her acting out like this.  I've been a professional nanny for years now, and I've never experienced such manipulative and dismissive behavior from a child, even ones from divorced homes... My SO says the way she boldly manipulates others, and lies so quickly and firmly reminds him of his ex.  HELP!</p>

"Just found out my daughter might be gay. Now what?","<p>I recently came across a photo on my 14 year old daughter's iPod of a letter from a girl friend of hers that expressed her feelings for my daughter.  Words like ""I do melt in your eyes"" and ""I can't stop thinking about you"" were in the letter and I was quite shocked.</p>

<p>I thought the time they were spending together were like most girls…just friends and someone they would hang out with and talk. But when I saw this, it obviously is a little concerning for me…on so many levels.</p>

<p>From a religious perspective, we taught our kids to be tolerant and that being gay shouldn't be looked at as a bad thing and that we should all respect each other. But something inside me is saying that this type of behavior at this age can be confusing and I'm not sure if I should encourage these two spending so much time with each other. I know I'm going to have to bring it up at some point and my reaction needs to be one of support, but I think I need to ensure she is aware of the complexity of such emotions and that making a commitment at this age is just too soon. It's not that I'm against that lifestyle, I'm just not sure that at this stage that I need to be encouraging it either.</p>

<p>Also, what of the other girl's parents? Should I bring it up to them? I know as soon as I say something to my daughter, she'll text the other girl and if it gets out, I'd hate for her parents to be blindsided or even worse, she may do something drastic. Not sure what I would say, but again, trying to minimize the interaction with each other might help them to step back and reflect of these emotions and not jump into anything without fully understanding the affect on them. Being a teenager is already stressful enough without adding the emotion weight this can carry.</p>

"How do you teach a toddler not to share?","<p>Normally, my son (2 years old) does very well sharing with other kids.  In fact, he's remarkably social, even with children he's never met before.</p>

<p>And therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>On a recent trip to the museum, he was very excited by everything that was going on, but mostly by what the other kids were doing.  The problem is that he wanted to play with other kids, including older ones, but not everyone takes kindly to a 2 year old running over and ""helping"".</p>

<p>I definitely don't want to discourage him from the idea that sharing toys is the best way, but how do we address him running over to strangers and expecting to share?  In some cases, that's appropriate, but when an older child is carefully arranging velcro stars into specific constellation patterns, my son running over and moving stars around or slapping new ones over the other child's isn't appropriate.  Similarly, if there's a bin of blocks or Legos, my son wants to contribute to the other kids' projects, even though there's enough space/materials for him to play on his own.</p>

<p>Some kids are going to be alright with this, but others may not be.</p>

<p>How do I approach this with my son?  Ideally, I'd like him to ask the other kids if he can play with them, but at this age not all of the kids he wants to play with are verbal enough to respond appropriately, plus he moves so fast that its difficult for us to anticipate where he is going, in order to get him to ask first.</p>

<p>What if the child he asks says ""no""?  When we taught him how to share, we tried to be clear that he doesn't <em>have</em> to share, but he <em>should</em>.  This may be a little harder to grok coming from the other direction, particularly if the toys and designated play areas clearly are communal.  Its much easier to say ""this other little boy/girl is playing with that now; let's find something else to play with"" than ""this other little boy/girl is playing in this area; you can play too, but you have to stay over here and leave them alone.""</p>

"Baby awake in the morning but quiet?","<p>Our baby is nearly 6 months old, and generally when awake during the day (from 8-9 AM) he needs attention and care (at least periodically, otherwise he is pretty good at inventing occupation for himself). However I recently noticed that he is also awake around 5-6 AM when we are mostly sleeping, without trying to get our attraction (just grabbing the rails of the bed, rolling, or just staring around).</p>

<p>What do you think, should we convert this awaken period into a playtime, or just let him observe the world as he wishes? Any similiar experience?</p>

"How to handle my baby boy urinating in bath?","<p>I bathe my two weeks old baby boy every evening. Very often he will urinate as soon as he touch the water, obviously because of the temperature change.</p>

<p>What <strong>should</strong> I be doing? I considered using a towel to absorb the urine but is it really necessary?</p>

"Can a son share a bed with his girlfriend, at 27?","<p><strong>Your son is 27 and due to financial problems, you've invited him to move home. His 30 year old girlfriend is coming to stay. Should you oppose them sharing his double bed during her visit?</strong></p>

<p>This question involves much older people than most others, but, I feel it is very much related to parenting, since, this behaviour isn't shared by wider society/friends/relatives.</p>

<p>I ask because my parents are asking (if not telling) me to sleep on the floor downstairs.  Am I unreasonable to expect both us and my folks to respect personal space?</p>

<p>None of us are religious and I'm unsure of the origin of their concerns.</p>

<p>How would you handle this discussion?  My parents and I have an otherwise happy relationship.</p>

  <p>Babies who watch tv (more than 1 hour per day), starting speaking late.</p>

"Explaining a c-section scar to a toddler","<p>Our 3-year-old son noticed his mother's scar from the cesarean section and wondered what it was. We didn't really give him an answer but diverted his attention instead. Now we're talking about how should handle that question.</p>

<p>On one hand, we don't want to tell him exactly what it is because we don't want him to think all babies are born that way (even though both our kids were). On the other hand, it's a reasonably natural thing - but he's too young to understand it.</p>

<p><strong>When's the right time to explain this?</strong> I figure there'll be a point where we feel he's mentally ready to grasp the idea.</p>

But recently she keeps moaning and complaining she peed in her underwear but upon checking, she's completely dry. This is an ongoing thing that can last hours where she'll repeat the same thing every three minutes. We tell her to go to the bathroom and she'll pee or claim she doesn't need to. It's exhausting.

I've had a lot of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">urinary tract infections</a> and it doesn't seem to be the case for her, as she's not in pain or anything of the sort.

Why is she waking up an hour later? She has a full bottle before going to bed and doesn't need to go to the washroom when she wakes up (she's partially potty trained).</p>

"How to kick a twelve year old's shopping ""addiction""?","<p>My family has never had much money, so I'm quite concerned about my sister's shopping habits. I assumed it was quite average behavior for a young girl to plead for money for the school book fair, the ice cream shop, makeup, etc., but she recently was given a dog-walking job by our neighbor and has starting spending every cent she makes. </p>

<p>Almost as soon as she's paid she'll bike over to the mall and start buying little trinkets and things. Sometimes she'll lie about how much money she has and beg our mother for some amount of money to buy something she <em>desperately</em> needs. She does the same once she's spent all her money and there are often long circular arguments that end with our mom getting too stressed out to continue and just caving in.</p>

<p>I've tried talking to her as her older brother and explaining why she needs to save money, how she'll want things later that she'll need to save her money for now, and how it's unwise to be wasteful of any resource, especially one that for us is scarce. This didn't work.</p>

<p>I tried explaining to my mother that arguing for hours about the same thing and then just giving her money is counterproductive and that she needs to make a decision and then consistently follow through with it. This didn't work either.</p>

<p>How normal is it for a preteen girl to spend money like this and to beg for that money when she doesn't have it? What can I do to stop it? </p>

"Sleep training and consistency","<p>Our son is 7 months old, and as he frequently still needs our presence to go to sleep at night, we've decided that it's time for sleep training. The problem isn't that he needs our presence - the problem is that he will wake up after one sleep cycle, and need us to fall asleep again. And again. And again. A little more than a month ago we've transitioned him from falling asleep while sucking our fingers (god, this sounds embarrassing) to falling asleep with us present, and that transition went fairly quick, so we're hoping that he'll adjust quickly again. We're planning to use the controlled crying method and go in after 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 minutes.</p>

<p>However, we're not quite sure what to do during the day. Once we start controlled crying, we feel we would also need to do apply the controlled crying method during the day to be consistent. During the day he will often, but not always, fall asleep on his own. In addition, he still only naps for about 30-45 minutes - he's never been a brilliant napper -, and as per <a href=""https://childsleepscience.wordpress.com/2014/03/24/nap-101-post-3-how-do-i-teach-my-baby-to-sleep-more-than-one-30-45-minute-sleep-cycle/"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog</a>, we've been trying to teach him to connect sleep cycles by going in as soon as he wakes up and soothe him back to sleep (her options 1 &amp; 2, waiting X time before going in, didn't produce any results for us). For the midday nap, this works about 50% of the time. I'm worried that we won't be consistent if don't also apply controlled crying during the day, but that if we do, he'll be crying 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>So, what should we do during the day, if he doesn't fall asleep on his own? Controlled crying, or help him fall asleep by going back in and staying until he's fallen asleep (usually about 10-15 min max)? And should we continue to try to teach him to connect sleep cycles? If we do and he doesn't fall asleep again within a reasonable amount of time, how long will we need to do this? Until he finally falls asleep whenever that is?</p>

<p>The behavior of the 5-year-old kids is somewhat understandable. I guess those 5-year-olds can manage when to turn the switch on and off. But my daughter and another family who had a 3-year-old haven't matured enough. We are both seeing much increased impulsive behavior in our daughters.

<li>For future, should we not communicate with parents that have older children (We do see them bi-weekly, but it's just only for 2 hours. The duration of our visits, was never 2 days)?

"My parents are upset that I don't visit enough. I live four hours away and I do not want to spend time with them. What should I do?","<p>I am 26 and I moved out of my parents' house almost three months ago. I am happy that I am finally out on my own, supporting myself financially and starting my life as an independent adult.</p>

<p>My parents are upset that I ""never"" visit them. I did visit them for the holidays, and it is clear that they would like to spend more time with me than I am comfortable with.</p>

<p>To be clear, I love my parents and we keep in touch. My mom and I frequently text each other and speak on the phone every week or two. My dad and I have phone conversations every week. This is more than enough contact for me. Oftentimes when we talk it is just idle chitchat as none of us have a whole lot going on. Our conversations usually cover how we are doing (always ""good""), how our jobs are going (""good"") and if I'm seeing anyone (""no""). Still, it is nice to keep in touch and I know that they enjoy these check-ins.<br>
Even when I lived in their home my parents felt that I did not spend enough time with them. I spent most of my free time with my friends, on the computer, or playing video games. I would always talk to my parents in the evening when we were all home from work, and again before going to sleep. We would often have dinner together as a family, but some nights it would not work out.<br>
I figured that this issue would stop when I moved out, but it has not. If anything being four hours away has only made the problem worse, and in hindsight I can see why.</p>

<p>Recently my parents have been pressuring me to visit them. I do not want to do this. I live over four hours away from my parents and I do not like to travel. They have offered to come to my apartment but they insist on sleeping in my bed and booting me to the couch.<sup>1</sup> These issues aside, the main reason I don't want to visit is that I do not like spending time with my parents.</p>

<p>The major reason that I do not like spending time with my parents is that we often argue. We have not argued since I have moved out, but it was so frequent while I lived with them that I fear it will continue when I visit. Without getting too far into the details, my arguments with my mother are usually civil but often end with at least one of us crying. My arguments with my dad are not like this.<br>
My dad would often get mad at me for things outside of my control, or be mad about something else and redirect it at me. One time he got upset because I had plans for my long weekend and he had expected me to clean the garage that weekend. He did not tell me until I was walking out the door Saturday morning and expected me to cancel right then, even though my friends were waiting on me to pick them up. During this argument he told me to get out of ""his"" house<sup>2</sup> and then got angrier when I left.
This may sound extreme but this is an average case. The only thing making this particular argument any different is that I stood up for myself and left for the day.<sup>3</sup><br>
To be fair, I also redirect my anger at people when I shouldn't. We are both working on this problem. Still I would rather not spend too much time with them because I think that the odds of this happening is too great and outweighs the positives of my visit.</p>

<p>I have explained to them that I do not want to travel just to come visit them. I have explained that I would rather that they not come to my apartment just to visit. They do not seem to care.</p>

<p>One of my parents' birthdays is coming up soon. I knew this, and I had made plans for the weekend before as I had not planned on going back for the birthday.<sup>4</sup> After my parents found out I had plans, they moved the date of the celebration to another weekend in hopes that I was available then.<br>
To be absolutely clear, I do not want to go back and visit for this birthday. This is not a party for our extended family and friends just my parents, my brother, and me. We will be going to the beach<sup>5</sup> for the weekend and I get the feeling that they expected me to come even before checking with me.</p>

<p>What should I do? I feel like I am on the hook for the birthday weekend now, despite not yet committing to going. I do not want to set the precedent that I will come back every six weeks. I don't even want to set the precedent that I will come back for everyone's birthday. I was hoping that living far away would exclude me from being expected at events like these, and I do not think that it is unreasonable for me to skip these events.<br>
Am I in the wrong here? Should I go back for the birthday? Should I tell them that I don't want to go back because I am avoiding arguing with them and hurting our relationship, in addition to the other reasons I've already explained to them? Do you have any other advice for me in this situation?</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read though my post.</p>

"Baby sleep associations - how important are they?","<p>We are working to try to help our 9 month old baby sleep better. I have read a lot of information online as well as baby sleep books such as Weissbluth, Ferber, Pantley. We are not interested in leaving our baby to cry at this stage but prefer to try more gentle methods and we understand this can take longer.</p>

<p>However, my question is, most of the sleep experts talk about sleep associations i.e. that the way the baby goes to sleep to start with is the way he will need to go back to sleep when he wakes at night. I am not convinced. A few examples why not:</p>

<ul>
<li>although I am breastfeeding, we have had some success with separating the feeding from baby going to sleep (e.g. as proposed in ""the no cry sleep solution""). However, this doesn't mean he doesn't look for milk when he wakes at night. I think most sources agree that a 9 month old shouldn't need to feed at night so why is he still looking for milk? He eats reasonably well in the day.</li>
<li>I know many people are not keen on the idea of co-sleeping but in the case that I am desperate for sleep and don't have the energy to try something else, if my baby can go to sleep with a cuddle and not be picked up, why does he not go back to sleep with a cuddle if I am sleeping next to him even when he has been recently fed?</li>
<li>often during daytime naps, my baby wakes up after the first sleep cycle, crying and seemingly not ready to finish his nap. However whether this happens or not doesn't seem to relate to how he went to sleep.  </li>
<li>sometimes when our baby wakes at night, he can be settled easily with a little patting in his cot. Other times he cries a lot and needs to be picked up. This happens for different wakings in the same night or wakings at a similar stage of different nights and seems independent of how he went to sleep.</li>
</ul>

<p>So are sleep associations as big a deal as everyone seems to say they are? Is there actual evidence for this or is it just something convenient that people have made up to try to explain the mysterious world of baby sleep? Does anyone know of any studies on baby sleep associations? How can we tell if sleep associations are causing our sleep difficulties or if it's something else? </p>

For example if she's being mean to her younger brothers over and over again or doing something that she isn't supposed to and ends up going on time out. Once she's on time out I'll hear her saying things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You can't do <em>anything</em> right!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You are always <em>bad</em> {her name}""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn't happen every day - maybe once a month? And it only seems to be on the days where she misbehaves over and over again. I suspect that it has to do with the fact that she's being told her behavior isn't acceptable over and over again, but no one has ever said anything like that to her. We've made it clear to her that no one is perfect and that we all make mistakes from time to time and that no matter what happens we will always love her.</p>

<p>Time outs are usually 2-3 minutes. Afterwards we talk about why it happened and what we should do next time instead (""Instead of hitting your brother come and tell daddy that he took your toy"" etc.)  We give each other a hug and go back to our day.</p>

<p>It really has her mother and I freaked out. There is some depression on my mother's side and I worry about this being some sort of early sign of that.  </p>

<p>I've never really heard of this type of thing in children this young before. Is anyone aware of reputable sources that discuss why this might happen and how to address it? Should we consider taking her to see a child psychiatrist? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

"How to explain the ""brutal"" ways of wildlife and nature to a kid and when?","<p>I would like to expose my kid to a lot of different animals quite early on (starting from 2-3 years), mostly through telling them about it and showing photos/pictures. Even though screen would be limited, I would like to show them wildlife shows too, like those on NatGeo and animal planet. (Not a parent yet, this is all just a plan)</p>

<p>But I started wondering if and when this would be appropriate for kids when I was watching one such show with my 3 year old nephew. They first showed a mother owl and her chicks, and how she goes out to look for food for them. He related to that pretty well, observing thats the way things work with people too. Suddenly, a bald eagle swoops down on the mother owl and makes a meal out of her. </p>

<p>He's seen wild animals eating other animals before, and didn't get too worked up over it, though he did seem surprised. But this was different because it had a familial structure that he could relate to. He seemed very distressed as he asked what will happen to the baby owls now, they're waiting for their mother! He was about to cry when I blurted out that this was probably a different owl, and that the mother owl is fine. Disaster averted.</p>

<p>He hasn't had to deal with death yet, but he seems to know that when you end up as a meal to another animal, you're not coming back anymore. Now, when I raise my own toddler, should I wait for him to be familiar with the concept of death and how its the natural way of things before showing him shows like this which depict animals hunting each other? What age/developmental milestone would be appropriate? How do I handle stressful situations arising from this?</p>

<p>P.S: There are many questions on here about dealing with death, but I find that the deaths associated with natural food chain of animals in the wild is very different from dealing with the death of a person or a pet.</p>

"A religious teacher slapped my son twice for refuting God, what should I do?","<p>First, I am an atheist and so is my husband, and our 8 year old son is taught religion in a school since it is mandatory for all students, we didn't object because we thought that we could tell him about the ""fallacies"" later when he grows up to become a teenager. </p>

<p>But he didn't need us for that and during a class in which the teacher was explaining how ""kind"" and ""merciful"" God is, my son raised questions and then making the conclusion that God is not at all merciful, leading the teacher (who is extremely religious) to angrily go over to the seat of my son, grab him by the shoulders and slap him furiously TWICE.</p>

<p>The teacher then accused us of ""degrading"" his mind and that it is ""not normal for such a young boy to naturally behave in such a way, unless he has been taught to do so"", when we haven't done nothing. My son has never used a computer so he did not get the ideas from the internet, and he has no friends in the class as he's very introverted and usually extremely quiet. And I do understand that perhaps his words may have been inappropriate, but for the teacher to just abuse him like that is totally unacceptable. </p>

<p>We argued with the teacher since I was very angry, and the principal intervened to let it go and advised us to correctly teach him the Bible and to teach him some ""manners as well"". This ofcourse came to us as extremely offensive, why should I teach him the Bible? The school is entirely on the teacher's side, and I feel that the teacher will continue to misbehave with my son. And I think we should report him to the police for this. But...would it be right to do so? Are we just really making a big deal out of this? What if the teachers behave rudely or just don't give enough attention to my son after this, should I say something to them?</p>

<p>I must also stress that we cannot take him out from the school since we live and work in a very small town distanced away from the city, and there's only one elementary school here.</p>

"What factors should I consider when deciding to let children fly unaccompanied?","<p>Some family members have invited my two older kids to visit for a week next summer. The plan is that the children would fly there, and then we (and the youngest sibling) would drive up a week later to pick them up, visit a few days, and then drive home again. While they've been on vacations without us before (the same relatives drove them to Disneyworld a year ago), neither one has flown on a plane.</p>

<p>We are (happily) not being pressured to send the children if anybody is uncomfortable with the idea. I've spent the last few months going back and forth in my mind. I think this could be a fun adventure and positive experience for them, and a way to help them both feel responsible and mature. On the other hand, I'm freaking out about plane crashes, kidnappers, what happens if they get in a fight -- mostly things that my logical side considers to be overprotective and dramatic, but my emotional side can't stop fretting over.</p>

<p>My daughter will be 11, and generally responsible and conscientious. Her younger brother will be 8. He's terribly forgetful and doesn't like being in unfamiliar situations, although with his sister along he'll probably cope. I am assuming that parents will be able to escort them to the gate and other relatives will allowed to the gate to meet them, so really the only alone time will be on the plane itself.</p>

<p>I realize that there's no ""right age"" at which kids are old enough to fly on their own. What are some things I should be considering as we come to a decision? Since neither has ever flown before, how can I help prepare them for the experience -- particularly the younger who might freak out about pressure changes, thumps as the landing gear deploys, turbulence...?</p>

Ours are age 3 and 2 now. Whenever we don't however, we seem to find a common ground and we both agree on the rules and a parenting style. The problem is that I still see my kids doing things we agreed they wouldn't do but not because my wife let's them, it is because she doesn't see them. for example, we agreed no sharing food with kids who are not close friends at the park but the other day I arrive and the 1st thing I see is some strange girl sharing her food with her. What should I do about this if it happens all the time. I get upset with her but maybe I shouldn't because she doesn't do it on purpose she just is less of a control freak than I. Must I just back off and accept that she is going to be less vigilent and more relaxed than I and see less of the things we are trying to avoid our kids doing? Or should I insist that she get her act together and stick to our agreement? I make a great effort to teach my kids so if they get to do these things in her care, it seems like a waste of effort. </p>

"At what age should I enroll my child in dental and vision plans?","<p><strong>Background:</strong>
Most insurance coverage in the US has separate policies and payroll withholding for health, dental, and vision insurance plans. One can typically decide who's covered independently for these plans (or pick and choose these plans from one spouse's employer to the other's). Coverage is usually either employee, employee+spouse, or employee+family (spouse and children).</p>

<p>One can also typically change these things after a life event (birth of a child, marriage, etc.) or annually during the enrollment period.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
My wife and I had a daughter last month. We're obviously enrolling her on our health plan immediately. She doesn't yet have teeth and is too young for any vision correction (or even to know whether she'll need any), so it doesn't seem to make sense to include her on the dental or vision plans yet. At what point would it typically make sense to do so? Is there any compelling reason why she should be included on the plans now? We'd just be paying the higher family withholding without being able to take advantage of any of the services, right?</p>

"How to encourage speech of minority language for bilingual child?","<p><em>Note:</em> I am going to use 3rd person plural pronouns (e.g. ""they"", ""their"") when referring to my child as I think gender is not important here.</p>

<h2>Situation:</h2>

<p>My wife and I are using the One-parent-one-language (English &amp; Hungarian) approach to raising our child bilingual (since their birth) in a country where my wife's language (English) is the official language.  I am the only one who speaks Hungarian in our environment (house and community), besides the occasional video-call to my parents.  As our child did not start speaking until after we started wondering whether their non-speech has any other causes besides the two languages being used, to encourage their speech, I did not ""demand"" Hungarian to be spoken to me (essentially interpreting the child's English words as if they were spoken in Hungarian).  Our child is now 2-and-a-half years old.  I am spending about 30% of my child's awake time with them (more on weekends, less on weekdays).</p>

<p>This approach was effective enough that our child understands both languages, but when speaking, they prefer English (which is to be expected, given the above).  They do use Hungarian words sporadically in their sentences (mostly ones they do not seem to know the English equivalent of, and mostly nouns).</p>

<p>My wife is fully supportive of our approach and goals so far, although she does not know Hungarian (due to busy schedule this isn't going to change anytime soon).</p>

<p>We are not planning to move any time soon, although a short (e.g. one- or two-week long) trip about once a year to Hungary (to visit my parents and other relatives) is planned.</p>

<p>My mother is currently scheduled to help us out for two months (my wife's usually part-time work schedule will increase during this time), arriving in a week's time.</p>

<h2>Goal:</h2>

<p>I would like to encourage our child to start speaking (more) in Hungarian to me (and to my parents).</p>

<h2>What I have tried:</h2>

<p>Speaking and reading a lot of Hungarian, and playing/singing Hungarian folk and child songs to our child.  I am planning to start playing some (read-aloud) children's stories in Hungarian as well to introduce a variety of voices speaking the language.</p>

<p>My attempts to suddenly ""enforce"" the use of Hungarian (wanting to hear them ask for their wants in Hungarian and/or ""not understanding"" non-Hungarian) was met with active resistance on my child's part to the point where they would rather chose to abandon their wants instead of speaking the words in Hungarian, even when all they would have had to do was to repeat the (Hungarian) words I intoned to them back to me.  As this ended in a lot of frustration (on both ends) and in even less exposure to Hungarian, I gave up on the idea in a few day's time (further reinforced by comments to other questions on bilingual child raising on this site). (*)</p>

<p>(*) The above behavior on our child's part might not be (solely) related to speaking in Hungarian as they today exhibited the same behavior (refusal and giving up on the object of ""want"") when my wife wanted them to start saying ""please"" and ""I would like"" instead of ""I want"".</p>

<p>I tried to look for other Hungarian-speaking people in my community, but I was so far unable to find a community that would regularly organize meetings where we could go to for more exposure to Hungarian (I have heard of other Hungarians being in the area, but it appears there is no ""organized"" community to speak of).</p>

<p>Sometimes when I genuinely did not understand what our child was saying, I told them (in Hungarian) that I did not understand, and sometimes they repeated their request in Hungarian.  I have not yet tried to actively ""exploit"" this as an attempt to get them to speak in Hungarian.</p>

<h2>Questions:</h2>

<p>What options/methods do I have to encourage our child to start/try to actively use their knowledge of Hungarian?  The result does not have to be in the short-term (although that would be preferred).</p>

<p>How can Grandma's upcoming visit support the above options/methods?  Besides the obvious benefits (she is going to be with her grandchild almost 24/7 while visiting, so exposure to Hungarian will be increased), how can we transition these benefits to after her departure?</p>

"How important is the pronunciation of an infant's first words?","<p>My 11 month old son has started to talk.  He currently has a two-word vocabulary: ""uh-oh"", and ""balloon"".</p>

<p>He clearly understands the meaning of the word balloon, and uses it appropriately (his use of ""uh-oh"" is a little less consistent, but it is improving).  </p>

<p>However, his pronunciation of balloon is, well, bad.  Usually it sounds more like ""boon"", although sometimes there is a buzzing ""raspberry"" sound to it (""bzzoon""), and sometimes it does sound like he's trying to extend ""boon"" to two syllables (it is hard to tell if there's an ""l"" sound in there or not, but it is the version that most clearly sounds like ""balloon"").</p>

<p>Given that he is only 11 months, and he <em>just</em> started talking, I am not particularly worried that the mispronunciation indicates any problems.  It is my understanding that many, many toddlers come up with their own unique pronunciations of words they have difficulty with (and it is also how many people I know got their nicknames: younger siblings were unable to pronounce their names, and instead came up with unusual nicknames).</p>

<p>My question is: should I put effort into trying to correct his pronunciation, or is it okay to simply accept that balloon==""boon"" (or any of the other variations)?  Should I continue to use ""balloon"" myself, rather than mimic his mispronunciation?</p>

<p>Basically, instead of the parent dictating to the child what he <strong>should</strong> and <strong>should not</strong> do, the parent educates, but ultimately lets the child decide what to do. Of course, when health/potential accidents are involved, the parent should take in control.</p>

<p>We have a quiet time every day for a couple hours, when my wife naps or takes a bath, my elder daughter takes a nap, and the other two kids can do pretty much what they want, subject to the following restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>They have to be quiet enough not to wake anyone.</li>
<li>They can't go into each other's rooms.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter rule is all the time, not just at quiet time, and is mostly so my younger daughter can get some personal space when she needs it.  She plays with her brother most of the day, but likes to use quiet time for her ""introvert recharge"" period, which means my son doesn't have anyone to play with during that time.</p>

<p>Yesterday, my daughter started screaming.  Turns out, she had locked her door to keep her brother out, but he had used a comb to unlock it and was forcing his way in.  He only has benign intent.  He says he feels ""lonely"" and wants to play, and honestly doesn't understand why his sister wouldn't want to play too, despite the screaming.</p>

<p>Still, using force like that and completely ignoring his sister's screams gives his behavior a very creepy vibe.  We have to remind him to leave his sister alone two or three times a day, which I don't find particularly unusual, but this is the first time he has gone so far as to ignore her locked door (to our knowledge), and it feels like he's not getting any better at taking a hint.  He <em>has</em> grabbed her before to keep her from leaving.</p>

"Can you get a toddler to be nice to his friends?","<p>My 2-year-old son is in daycare with several other boys.  He seems to spend the most time with the two boys who are closest in age to him (and who are also the most consistent in attending).  </p>

<p>One of these two boys (the one closest in age to my son, being only one month younger, who we'll call ""Joe"") is clearly very attached to my son.  He gets extremely excited when my son arrives, and sometimes gets very upset when my son has to leave.  The moment we walk in the door, he runs over to greet us.</p>

<p>Which is actually part of the problem.</p>

<p>Joe has some developmental delays (he was several months premature, and is still completely non-verbal), and has some trouble understanding social boundaries (perhaps even more so than is normal for a two-year-old).  As a result, he tends to immediately run up to my son, get right in front of him before we can even get my son's coat off, and starts reaching for whatever toys my son has brought with him for the day.</p>

<p>My son picked up the concept of sharing fairly well maybe 6 months ago or more.  Joe is still working on the concept, although he's very much improved over the past couple of weeks/months.  Most days he starts off by handing my son whatever toy he's brought with, and only <em>then</em> reaching for what my son may be holding.  Usually my son will share his toys in return, although he always shows a preference for the older boy who isn't nearly as pushy (if my son brings 3-4 toys, he'll give the older boy several, and give Joe only one, and only after sharing with the older boy first).</p>

<p>All of this sounds well enough; however, my son has pretty clearly demonstrated that he doesn't like Joe's behavior at times (which is fair enough).  The problem stems from how my son expresses that.</p>

<p>For a while, my son would respond to Joe running over to greet him with ""No!  Go away, Joe!"", while holding up a hand, palm facing Joe's face.  I told him repeatedly that that wasn't very nice, and explained that while I know he doesn't like that Joe is so pushy, all he has to do is say ""wait, Joe, wait!"".  That, coupled with the daycare provider consistently telling both other boys to give my son some room when he comes in, seemed to have helped.</p>

<p>However, I have noticed that my son frequently isn't very nice to Joe.  Sometimes he'll yell ""No, Joe!"" and point angrily at Joe.  Sometimes I'll see him sharing with the other boy, but refusing to share with Joe.  Most recently, I saw him put his face right in front of Joe's and growl loudly at him (!).</p>

<p>None of this seems to deter Joe, or even upset him, but it bothers me.  I understand that Joe doesn't respect boundaries as much as my son would like, and I think it is appropriate that my son stand up for himself, but I feel there may be more constructive ways to express it, even at his age (my son has a pretty good grasp of language for his age, and regularly uses fairly complex sentences; sometimes he will use sentences of a dozen words or more).</p>

<p>The thing is, I'm pretty sure my son <em>likes</em> Joe.  Almost every day when we ask him what he did that day, he says he played with Joe.  He almost never mentions the other boys, and when we ask him if he had a good time playing with Joe, the answer is almost always an enthusiastic ""yeah!"".  Of course, this is frequently followed up by complaints about Joe ""taking his toys"".</p>

<p>The daycare provider has told me several times that the problems we see in the morning almost always resolve themselves within a few minutes, and they (all three) seem to get along very well throughout the day.</p>

<p>Is it possible to get my son to be nicer (no yelling/growling/comments like ""go away!, etc.)?  How?  <em>Should</em> I be looking to fix this?</p>

"How to bring my 23-year-old daughter to an adult discussion with me and her mother about issues?","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I was witness to a banal argument between my 23-year-old daughter and her mum which has lead to a three month impasse, whereby my daughter has installed herself in my small apartment with the intent of ejecting me from it. She refuses to make peace with her mom in order to move back and is putting me in the difficult position of needing to evict her.</p>

<p><strong>Background to Issue</strong></p>

<p>Up until two months ago, my 23-year-old daughter had been living with her mum and her 11-year-old brother in a large 4 bedroom house without much quarreling. She is a ""full-time"" student (5 courses for a total of 15 hours in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEGEP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cegep</a> [between high-school and college]). </p>

<p>My daughter approached her mum two months ago for advice about whether she should take a part-time job (15h) offer with a bank. I told her that it might be good for her to realize what it is about, to eliminate a field of study. Her mother was equally not keen on the idea as it was a selling job and it would be stressful for my daughter, bringing this stress home to the family as she already did in the past. My ex-wife was concerned about her youngest son who has Autism. At this point my daughter unexpectedly, exploded in anger, shouting, slamming the door and breaking it. </p>

<p>The next few days consisted in her continuing the dispute coming out of her room to challenge her mum while I was a witness. After 4 days, her mom decided to put an end to this by saying that if she didn't want to talk about issues instead of shouting about them, she would have to go stay with me for a while, with which I was in agreement. She said she wouldn't leave but made no attempt to explain her outbursts which continued. Her mom then decided to give her a week to decide whether she wanted to stay under the condition that she talks, or to leave. She also gave her a professional therapy toll-free line in case my daughter needed to talk to someone. In addition, her mom also called a family therapist to ask advice on the impasse. The therapist advised that the daughter, since she was 23, should leave the house. </p>

<p>After one week of ignoring everyone, she called a friend to take her to my place, expecting to take over my bedroom. I was annoyed at this and refused to give her my room, having decided to put a lock on my bedroom door when I found out her plan through my 21-year-old son, who shares the apartment with me. She had ordered her older brother to dump my stuff on the balcony, in the snow, while I was out. I still don't understand how she thought it would be OK to evict her father from his appartement, and that I would comply. But when she saw the lock, she started to cry and left to stay 3 weeks with the friend. After 3 weeks, her friend said that was enough and that she had to go back and stay at my place with me and her brother. </p>

<p>Her mum reminded her by email, that all she had to do was talk to her or apologize and she could come back to the house. She told her mum that she is tired of apologizing for things and that it is the mother who has to apologize to her instead (for what, she won't tell her). I have never heard my ex-wife ask my daughter for an apology about anything. This was the first time. If anything my ex-wife is quite a tolerant person, in fact too tolerant one could say.</p>

<p>Presently she is camping out in the living room of my apartment under cramped conditions and is refusing to negotiate with either me or her mum. I cannot have her living there indefinitely and have repeatedly asked her to just talk to her mum or find her own place. She did end up taking the bank job and is able to afford a modest rent.</p>

<p>We are at a loss as to how to handle the situation with my daughter as she is not flexible. I don't really want to force her out but I have given her 4 months to find another accommodation or to address her issues with her mum or with me. For the moment she is refusing to budge or talk constructively to us and continues acting out. She pays no rent or utilities at the apartment except for her own food. On the other hand I think that it is maybe time for her to grow up and to become an adult and learn to be appreciative, and that a belated adolescent outburst went too far. </p>

<p>She still refuses to this day to communicate with her mum stating that her mum has first to apologize. I don't know what she is complaining about and don't think that her mum should apologize - for what? She gives no details, just this blanket demand. The long term issues that she is complaining about are not going to get resolved if she doesn't want to enter into a discussion and even seek a free therapeutic advice. </p>

<p>We did already try family therapy in the past but after a few sessions the therapist said that the two older kids were not invested in it or interested to solve issues with us.</p>

<p><strong>How can I convince my daughter that it is in the interest of the whole family to communicate our issues without me resorting to drastic measures like forced eviction?</strong></p>

"How to teach greater attention and the ability to delay gratification?","<p>The school recently held one of its regular parents' meeting, the first after our 8 year old daughter started her new class with a new teacher. She dislikes this teacher, complaining she is overly strict.</p>

<p>The feedback we go is that while our daughter is very clever, she does not pay attention, and is prone to minor misbehaviour. This is beyond the standard ""bright kids get bored in class"". She does it at home, for one thing. And the teacher gave other examples, such as daughter sitting reading a book when the rest of the class had been called to attention. She is very unaware of her surroundings, often lost in her own world.</p>

<p>he knows what the ""right"" thing to do is, and I suspect the root cause is essentially being unable to delay gratification. It's more fun to read a book than listen to the teacher. It's so tempting to whisper with your friends rather than paying attention. It's great to go whereever you want in your head rather than pay attention to the here and now.</p>

<p>I know this is very common in children, and it's something they learn as they grow up. But the teacher seemed very certain she expected better at this age. I was very much like this as a child myself. But my parents were never able to successfully teach me how to be more focussed, better at delaying short term gain for longer term rewards.</p>

<p>I'm still not very good at it now, and I often wish I could have learned more about how to do it as a child. But I'm not sure what my parents could have done differently, or what I could do as a parent myself. Lectures and positive reinforcement have had only minimal effect. What else can we do?</p>

<p>I found this question on the subject:

"
"How do you curb ""tattletale"" behavior in a toddler?","<p>My 2-year-old son seems to be fascinated by the behavior problems of other children.  He will tell anyone and everyone around that such-and-such was bad, and if he sees another child having a temper tantrum, it's almost impossible to put a stop to the ""what's wrong with him?"" questions.  </p>

<p>I understand his need to understand the behavior of his peers, and that this is no doubt influenced by the fact that he is still learning about what is and is not acceptable behavior, and the best way for him to do so is to observe the behavior of others.  However, it can be awkward and embarrassing when my son is loudly demanding explanations for other kids' (or parents'!) behavior. Worse, though, is when he goes around repeating everything ""bad"" other kids have done, including behavior from hours earlier.</p>

<p>What is the best approach to dealing with this?  Will it sort itself out on its own, or is there something I should be doing to keep his observations a little more private?</p>

"My toddler seems unable to pay attention for longer than 15 minutes; should I worry?","<p>My son is 16 months old now. He is a very energetic boy. </p>

<p>When he hears music, he automatically will shake both of his hands as if he is dancing. There is no TV in our house, but sometimes, we watch youtube. While watching youtube I noticed that my son can only focus for around 15 minutes. </p>

<p>After 15 minutes, he will get bored and want to move on to other activities. Based on this first finding, I tried to do some investigations as to whether it is true or not that my son is only able to focus for around 15 minutes. </p>

<p>The result is that this is true regardless of whether he is playing with a book, his toys, etc. Should I be worried about this?</p>

<p>What is actually the average attention span for his age? If it needs to be improved, any suggested ways to improve his attention span?</p>

"What are the risks of surgery for a tongue-tied toddler?","<p>My son is 22 months old and he is several tongue-tied. We only found out because I have a 4 month old and when he was first born they noticed he was tied, and asked if our other child was. </p>

<p>My 22 month old is having problems with speech, which he is working on with a speech therapist now.  It is hard for him to eat, so he just throws food on the floor. We had to go back to baby food. He has lost weight, so now we have him on pedia-sure to help him get what he needs. </p>

<p>He is having the surgery on march 7th 2013. </p>

<p>I wanted to know what are the risks? My husband took him to the appointment and didn't ask ask any of the important questions. I couldn't get off work to go otherwise I would have asked all these questions. </p>

<p>They also found out my son is partial deaf in the left ear but they could not tell us how much of a loss it is. But they know it is not 100 percent because his ear drum was responding. Could this all be connected/related? </p>

<p>He will be retested for his hearing before and after surgery. </p>

<p>What are the odds that my next child will be tongue tied?  How do you deal with your baby being so frustrated?  Any tips are greatly appreciated.</p>

"Why do kisses stop a child from hurting?","<p>Whenever my son gets a minor injury (scraped knee, stubbed toe, bumped head, etc.), the fastest way to get him to stop crying is to kiss wherever he got hurt.</p>

<p>It almost always immediately stops the crying, and when asked ""does that feel better?"", he'll almost always say ""yes"".</p>

<p>Why does this work?  I'm interested in answers that address both the child's perspective (i.e. if a child asks why kisses from mommy and daddy make small hurts feel better, how do you answer?), and the psychological perspective as to why this approach is so effective.</p>

<p>Are there any down-sides to kissing injuries to make them feel better (aside from the pitfall I ran into where my son fell on his butt, then pointed to it and demanded that I kiss it, that is)?</p>

"Anxiety, Anger, and Major Sleep Issues in 2.5 Year Old Following Long Holiday – Is This Normal?","<p>We went to Australia from Canada for two months to visit (and stay with) family when our son was 2.25 years old. He is now 2.5 years old.</p>

<p>Now he is terrified to go to sleep, screams if we leave him (even if we keep the door open) and wakes in the night screaming for mama (me). I have taken to sleeping on a mattress next to his crib when he wakes in the night because he becomes so hysterical and seems confused – screaming, crying, banging the wall, jumping up and down, demanding things that seem to make him even more upset – that I cannot leave the room because it’s so distressing to everyone and only makes him worse.  We have never seen him so angry – he almost seems possessed. He also wakes up very angry in the morning and after nap, throwing his stuffies and drink.</p>

<p><strong>Some background</strong>: He was successfully potty trained a month before we left. At six months old we sleep trained him using controlled crying/CIO and then again when we night weaned him at 14 months. Both occasions worked effectively and quickly and he slept like a dream from 7:30pm–6:30am every night, happily putting himself to sleep in his crib with the door closed, and very rarely waking at night. He would also go down for nap in the same manner and sleep for up to three hours, usually waking up happy.</p>

<p>During our trip he had a few experiences that we think may have caused some prolonged anxiety:</p>

<ol>
<li>Our flight to Australia was awful, he barely slept the entire time and vomited all over himself. It was his first real vomit.</li>
<li>He then vomited in his sleep one night when we were at his grandparents’ house (a month after we arrived). I brought him into bed with me that night and from then on, for the rest of our holiday, had to sleep with him from some point in the middle of the night because he would wake up crying and we couldn’t let him disrupt the people we were staying with. He still talks about when he vomited at his grandparents’ house.</li>
<li>The day following the vomit in his sleep, he fell and hit his head on the concrete and vomited twice right afterwards. After monitoring him for signs of concussion (of which there weren’t any that stood out) we decided to take him to a doctor, but the doctor didn’t think he had suffered a concussion.</li>
<li>There was an occasion after the night-vomiting episode when I went out for dinner with a friend and his dad put him to bed. He was hysterical and nothing his dad did helped him, so dad left him to cry himself to sleep. This took over an hour. </li>
<li>Behaviourally, he seemed to change in Australia. We stayed with various family and friends and in a few hotels, and travelled a bit but still tried to keep our routine as close as possible to our regular one. Tantrums and mood swings started and he seemed quite unsettled. He also started biting his nails (which he saw his cousin do) and still does. </li>
<li>We have been home six weeks now and we were making progress where we could leave the door open and he’d fall asleep without me, but he got a terrible flu two weeks ago which has set us further back and added this night time anger to the mix. </li>
</ol>

<p>Prior to our trip he was a very happy, kind, well-behaved child who never had sleep issues or displayed any separation anxiety. I am his primary caregiver; he does not attend daycare; his dad works away for weeks at a time; and we have no family close by to help. </p>

<p>Our bedtime routine is solid: book and milk, brush teeth, pee pee, bath, PJs, white noise, night light, goodnight song, kisses and down. </p>

<p>We thought things would return to normal when we got home to his familiar surroundings. We are at a loss as to how to handle this. I am <em>exhausted</em> and worried he will never return to the great sleeper he used to be.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> How can we help him get back to sleeping well again (going to bed and sleeping through the night without me)? And how should I be handling these distressing nighttime wake-ups? I want to be firm/not give in all the time, but I also don't want to exacerbate any fears/anxiety he's experiencing. </p>

"My 5-year-old son seems to lack in comprehension","<p>My husband and I have 7 children ages 24, 18, 12, 12 (adopted niece), 5, 3, 2 (adopted niece).  All of our biological children who are school aged and beyond are well above average in school except for my 5-year-old.  </p>

<p>He seems to have issues with comprehension.  I said to him yesterday, ""a big purple elephant rides a green bike.""  I then asked him what color the elephant was - I cannot recall the exact answer, but it was not related to the question at all.  He seemed like he had something else on his mind (like he had some playing to do); but the question seemed so simple...why couldn't he answer it?  </p>

<p>He just turned 5 in March and started school this year.  His comprehension papers are always low scores; like a 75%!!  I admit there was some neglect during his most crucial years (19 months to present) because we had to take in my 9-year-old niece nearly four years ago with severe behavioral problems (and all symptoms of Asperger's that I feel was due to neglect at home from an eccentric, overreacting type of mother who took Rx meds, illicit drugs, and slept all day).  We spent so, so much of our time trying to correct her that I feel my son was neglected; and that kills my heart to know he was sacrificed for her! </p>

<p>Since my son was 2, he has known his colors, ABCs, and numbers because I always put on videos and would sing and dance with him to learn these, he can write letters, he knows their sounds, etc., but it's just comprehension he struggles with. </p>

<p>I don't know if this matters much, but he loves hugs and kisses and loves to snuggle; but I do have to force him to look into my eyes.  He whines about having to do that, squints his eyes, and makes crying sounds.  If I don't force him, he seems to have his eyes to the side like he's really taking in what you're saying (or maybe he's thinking of the toys he wants to go play with, I don't know...)</p>

<p>He's also a very picky eater...very!  I have to force him to eat dinner every night!  I have a suspicion he's not eating lunch at school, so I send him with an extra snack...that he isn't eating because it comes back home.  When I ask him what he had for lunch, he'll say milk - when I ask what else he had, he'll say, ""I don't know.""  How can he not remember??  </p>

<p>Some days he comes home whining, pitching fits, and screaming about whatever it is that's not going his way.  I notice on those days, he falls asleep early (he usually gets about 10 hours of sleep per night). He wakes up every morning saying he's not going to school...but once he's up and ready, he runs toward the door.   </p>

<p>When he comes home moody and whiny, it's hard to get him to calm down because everything I say he misinterprets and gets more upset!  Why can't he understand simple comprehension?  I have started reading 2 to 3 books to him per night in hopes this will help.  I ask questions (that he answers incorrectly), I animate the story, use voices, and even sing and clap.  I suppose only time will tell if that helps any.    </p>

<p>My husband is extremely upset about this and very remorseful for adopting my niece, who he says essentially put a dark cloud over our home since day one.  We adopted her mainly because I am very loyal to my family...but my husband did not want to adopt her and wanted her gone (we found out she was secretly hurting our son when no one was looking).  Either way, I couldn't just let her go (the state labeled her as ""unadoptable"") and my husband reluctantly agreed to adopt her for me.  He is now regretting allowing the adoption because he feels our son's issues are related to him seeing my niece's behavior the last nearly four years, and I think he's right. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any insight, input, suggestions, or even possible reasons for his lack of understanding?  I love my son so very much!!  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!! TIA</p>

"How do I handle my toddler's temper tantrums?","<p>I have a 19-month-old daughter. She is a very active child, and usually very well behaved. But in recent times I have noticed that she is constantly whining and also throwing temper tantrums - if she doesn't like something, if she doesn't get something she wants, she starts to hit herself. Very badly. Or she ends up hitting me, her mother. I have tried telling her she shouldn't be doing this, I have tried being firm, I have also expressed my displeasure. She immediately cools down, and her immediate response is to try and appease me because she thinks I am angry with her, but the behaviour continues. </p>

"My 13 year old daughter says she wants to be a boy. This is out of character for her. Is this a phase?","<p>My daughter, 13, has said she wants to be a boy. A little background: we moved to a new state a year and a half ago. In her new school, she felt isolated among her peers until she met a girl in art, and became good friends. She joined the drama club, and made  friends with some 8th graders. They joined “the diversity club”. This club is a LGBT club. The kids put on a play they wrote and starred in, which had homosexual connotations. “Romeo and Juliet”, but script  rewritten to include  2 females as the couple, for instance. </p>

<p>My daughter got so wrapped up in it, that her life was as if she was copying the play. She’s no longer friends with the friend from art, but remains close with the 8th grade crowd. They all labeled themselves. One week, my daughter said she was gay, then, changed to bi, then onto pan. (I had to google that one). Now she is emphatic about being disgusted with her body and wants to be a boy. She wants to donate all the “girly” clothes she picked out last year, and tossed out all the makeup she bought a few months ago. </p>

<p>All her life, she was the classic girly girl. She had crushes on boys, and she and this boy were inseparable since first grade. She was sad when it came time to move away. When we settled here, she became sullen and angry, putting herself down. She now sees a therapist who she really likes. We’ve been working on her self esteem issues. She’s wanting us to call her “he” and by a male name. I can’t do that. She’s my daughter. She is female. Had we seen this coming, maybe I could come to accepting. But it happened out of the blue.</p>

<p>Sometimes the old her comes back-I got a makeup sample and she was interested in trying it, looked at me, then quickly put it down and said “ewww, makeup”—just a few months ago, she bought a bunch. She’s now wanting to wear boys clothes and talks of wearing a suit to her prom. She is very impressionable, and seems affected by viral YouTube videos about kids coming coming out to their mothers, and the mothers gleefully embrace with happy tears. She has told me when she’s 18, she’s having her breasts removed.  </p>

<p>Nothing seems normal to me anymore-in terms of how she always was-this new situation just doesn’t fit.</p>

<p>My gut tells me this is a phase.  I’m hoping it’s a phase. But with all I’m seeing in the media about this, I’m not sure. I love her; this is too much for me to process. I’m a stay at home mom; we were inseparable. I knew her. Until now.:(  She cut off all her beautiful hair, and wears boys shorts, baggy tee shirts, and bought this awful men’s deodorant spray. Please help me sort this out. I’m at my wits end.</p>

"My toddler wants to watch the same shows over and over","<p>My son (2 and a half) watches about 3-6 hours of television a week at home (usually closer to 3 than 6).  However, most of that time is spent watching the same shows or movies time and time again.</p>

<p>We generally let him pick what he wants to watch (so long as its something we approve of), and he has some clear favorites.  However, even within those favorites, he'll have specific episodes that he wants to watch (for example, almost every time we watch <em>Dinosaur Train</em>, he'll want to watch the ""spooky Night Train"" episode; any time we watch <em>Mighty Machines</em>, he wants to watch either the train episode, or the race car episode).</p>

<p>It's the same way for movies: he has a handful of movies that he wants to watch over and over again.</p>

<p>I try to get him to watch new shows, rather than the same over and over, but he usually is very insistent that we watch the favorites instead.  I feel that if he's going to watch TV, it should at least be something he can learn from, but how much does he learn if its the same show he's seen 20 times?</p>

<p>Granted, the movies aren't educational, but in those cases its more about my not wanting to have to sit through viewing #18 of <em>Cars</em>.  With a movie, usually I can get him to watch something new if we can make it through the opening credits (during which he'll be protesting loudly, and sometimes on the verge of tears), but I usually relent if he gets too upset.</p>

<p>I want to ensure that my son grows up willing, or, better yet, eager, to try new things.  Perhaps this is too early to really matter, but I'd still like to encourage him to try new things.</p>

<p>How can I best break him out of this pattern?</p>

"When should we transition second child into first child's room?","<p>Our first child ""A"" is 3½ years old and has his own room in our apartment.<br>
Second child ""B"" is 3½ months old and sleeps in a crib in the parent bedroom.<br>
<sup>I'll use letters for names to make it clearer in the text below whether I'm referring to the older or younger boy.</sup></p>

<p>""B"" will soon outgrow his newborn crib in our bedroom, so we need to get a crib that has room to grow and has taller sides so he can't climb out (once he starts to move on his own). Such a new crib will have to be larger and therefore can't fit in our somewhat cramped bedroom. <strong>We need to move the crib out of our bedroom.</strong> </p>

<p>We want to put the new crib into ""A""'s room although it will become a little cramped and won't leave much space for playing on the floor. We are also going to move from an apartment into a house, but the move will be after ""B"" outgrows his current (small) crib. <strong>We want the boys to share a bedroom</strong> in the house, too. That leaves another room as their shared playroom where they can be loud (that makes their bedroom a <em>quiet room</em>).</p>

<p>The move will have essentially zero social impact (neighborhood, playground, friends, kindergarten, etc.) because the house will be within walking distance of the old apartment but any move is a big change and <strong>""A"" has a significant aversion to change.</strong> 
Every toddler benefits from solid routines and structure &ndash; ""A"" very much so but not quite to an autistic degree. Still, change is difficult, and he is not old enough that we can rationally discuss options and opinions with him.</p>

<p><strong>Should we move the crib into ""A""'s room now (before we move), simultaneously with the move, or some months after the move?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We're thinking that moving the crib into ""A""'s room at the same time as the home move would be too much change at once for ""A"".</li>
<li>However, if we move ""B"" into a separate space for now (in the apartment) and move him into ""A""'s room some time after the home move, then how do we ""sell"" that idea to ""A"" when he has had his own room in the house for a while?</li>
<li>Finally, ""A"" is not a deliberate bully but he doesn't yet understand that he must be careful with the baby and that he can't step on him, for instance. We're worried that ""A"" might hurt ""B"" in the crib when they share a room, and that we might not be able to protect ""B"" enough. </li>
</ul>

<p>Because we're both twins, neither we nor our parents have relevant experience we can use. We still have some months before we need to decide, but we need to consider our options now in order to prepare for the change.</p>

"My 11 year old step daughter is making troubling comments about my newborn twin daughters, her half sisters","<p>My husband and I have been married for 5 years. It was my first marriage and I did not have any children. He was married before and has three children with his ex-wife. We had tried for 4 years to get pregnant and decided to go through IVF which resulted in a pregnancy with twins! </p>

<p>During my pregnancy my 10 year old step daughter made several alarming comments, such as ""What would you do if one of the babies were dropped over the banister?"", ""What would you do if a poured cleaning solution in their mouths?"", ""What would happen if someone gave them a whole bottle of drugs?"" </p>

<p>Now the twins are here and are 3 months old. She has continued the scary comments and questions, with the last being when I said I might leave the babies in their car seats to sleep for a bit if they were still sleeping when we got home. She said if you leave them in the garage to sleep we should pour gasoline over them and it might start a fire"". </p>

<p>All of this is very stressful and keeps me awake at night when she is here. Her two brothers (one older and one younger) ask similar questions, but not as often as her and not a violent. </p>

<p>My husband won't talk to them about it because he says it's just their way of dealing with jealousy toward their new siblings. I just don't think it's something to take lightly and I don't think it's normal!</p>

She can buy something like a watch or other personal items and will not say or show them to me. We are on small budget so I am not giving her money every day. She has her own small savings though.

Also culturally and by mental development of people, it is not a safe place. This is the reason of my concerns and I am attentive to the environment my daughter is in the school, school mates and friends she connects with etc.</p>

<p>Related to hiding things from me, I don't want her to make poor or bad choices or get in dangerous situations. Most of all, I am worried she distrusts me which can cause more closeness of her and facing issues alone that can lead to incorrect direction, behaviour, mindset. I totally understand that she is 16 and can have some freedom, but it is unnecessary to hide things and items from me, and if told and shown it will avoid both of us fussy and unpleasant situations. </p>

"What kind of obedience is to be expected from a 2-year old?","<p>My daughter is 2-years old, with what seems a good development overall. We also have a 7-month old son. My wife takes care of them at home most of the time, and they also see their cousin (also 2-years old) one day a week, and my own mother 2-3 times a week.</p>

<p>We are reading a lot about child development and it seems quite important to give the kids some discipline so they have some sort of frame to build upon.</p>

<p>We try to put ourselves in the middle about discipline, and her granny is very cool and patient with her grandaughter.</p>

<p>The question we keep asking ourselves at the moment is <strong>when is discipline useful, when is it too much</strong> ? And how is this going to change in the next years, i.e. <strong>what should we enforce when she is 3 or 4 ?</strong></p>

<p>Some examples of situations where we wonder if insisting to have her obey is a good idea :</p>

<ul>
<li>At every meal, she takes off her slippers (which she never takes off herself at another time) and puts her feet on the table</li>
<li>Since 3 weeks, she does not want anymore that I give her bath, she keeps asking (crying aloud) during 30 minutes for her mother if I take her to the bathroom</li>
<li>Sometimes, randomly, she stops to obey when asked to go to the bathroom to change her diaper, or to climb up the stairs with us, or to tidy her toys, or any simple activity she used to do willingly the past months. Instead she runs away from us in the house</li>
<li>she would roll on the floor and cry when she is forbidden to go to a game such as bouncing castle</li>
<li>she wants to jump on beds</li>
<li>she sometimes completely refuses to use her potty (baby toilets, I miss the word in english)</li>
<li>when my wife is on the phone, she climbs on the table which is quite dangerous! (no really doubts on this one)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, here are some situations in which we found her well educated :</p>

<ul>
<li>she usually repeats some sort of polite sentence when asking for something, and repeats thank you, hello, good bye and so on</li>
<li>she keeps our hand outside the house</li>
<li>she usually agrees to tidy her room and her toys</li>
<li>she gives some toys to the little brother and gives some kisses to say hello and good night</li>
<li>she sleeps well and very rarely disturbs us during the night or her nap</li>
</ul>

<p>Note : I have seen this good one about <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/2417/how-can-we-discipline-our-toddler"">how to enforce discipline</a>. My question is really about which subjects are suitable to enforce at the ages of 2,3,4 ?</p>

"Kid standing up in crib but unable to get back down, affecting sleep","<p>Our 10-month old child up until recently slept pretty well.  We had an established nighttime routine that she reasonably quickly adapted to and eventually (by about 5 months?) went to sleep without fuss when we would put her down in her crib.  And then, about a month ago, she started sleeping through the night after a gradual night-weaning process.  For both going to sleep and staying asleep at night, a pacifier is an important comforter for her.  By this point, she is able to find pacifiers in her crib and put them in her mouth herself.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago though she started climbing up on furniture.  Then she learned this neat little trick where when she woke up in the morning before her normal wakeup time, instead of finding a pacifier and going back to sleep, she gets up on the side of the crib and cries.  She isn't confident in her ability to sit back down yet after standing up, so she just stands there and cries.  And no, she is not waking up because she no longer needs to sleep: she is very drowsy and cranky when she gets up, and will fall asleep with one of us if we get her out of the crib.</p>

<p>And in the last few days, she's started doing this same thing (stand up in crib, unable to sit back down) when we put her down in her crib to go to bed, and it takes several times of laying her back down (waiting 10 minutes or so in between putting her back down) before she falls asleep.  And again, she is actually tired when we put her down to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>How can we re-sleep train our baby?  How can we get her to go to sleep again without fuss at night, and (more importantly, see below) get her to sleep until her normal wakeup time again?</strong>  She wakes up 0-2.5 hours early, it varies from day to day.</p>

<p>My question is different than <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/2946/how-do-i-deal-with-my-baby-pulling-herself-up-in-her-crib"">this one</a>, since that question focuses more on baby's safety when climbing up on the crib wall rather than how to get baby to sleep.</p>

<p>My question is similar to <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/20390/how-do-you-get-your-kid-to-lay-in-the-crib"">this one</a>, but the specifics of the situation are different enough that I didn't find an answer there particularly useful for my situation.</p>

"My daughter repeats the same 2 numbers and when asking me questions tells me what to say and how to say it. Is this just a phase?","<p>I'm looking for some advice. My daughter has just turned 5 and from her being very young she has always known how she wants things and what she likes and dislikes. She's been repeating the same sentences in the same tone over and over, singing the same songs many times, putting certain toys in specific toy boxes or sitting in a certain chair to eat and having tantrums if things aren't done her way. </p>

<p>I used to think that behavior was normal but it's becoming progressively worse as she's getting older. For the last 3 months or so I've noticed she's become fixated on 2 certain numbers (89,000 &amp; 189,000) and randomly puts the number into any sentence she can. An example would be if I said: ""Do you want to wear this dress?"" And she'd reply ""Yes, it's been one hundred and eighty nine thousand days since I wore that dress!""; if she's coloring she will randomly say ""what if I had eighty nine thousand crayons!""</p>

<p>She makes me say the same sentences over and over again. For example, if she says to me ""do you know what animal I'm pretending to be?"" Or ""where have I put my shoes?"" If I reply with anything other than a very animated ""I don't know, what animal are you pretending to be/where have you put your shoes?"" She says ""no you have to say…"" and tells me what I have to say and how I need to say it.  If I repeat it, but not in the same tone or speed she used, she makes me say it again until she's satisfied. It's the same with other questions she asks, it's as though she's asking the question to answer herself but she needs me to say that in between her asking and answering. </p>

<p>I'm not going to lie - this is becoming really frustrating on top of other issues we've had to come to terms with in the past (behavioral problems, high energy levels, and an eating disorder). I'm concerned this might not just be a phase she's going through and would appreciate any advice from others who have experienced this kind of behavior. </p>

"Shall I be worried about my 6-year-old girl still sleeping with us from time to time?","<p>My six-year-old younger daughter still sleeps with us from time to time at the early morning hours.</p>

<p>She gets to sleep in her own bed each and every evening (with the exception of some rare cases, like when I am on a business trip away from home for a few nights). She sleeps very well through most of the nights and wakes up happy in her very own bed.</p>

<p>But from time to time (I'd say once per a month or once per 2-3 weeks) she gets up some time between 3 AM till 5 AM, grabs her pillow, ""checks in"" to our bed and immediately falls asleep as if it was as normal a situation as can be in the world. No arguing, no asking questions, no nothing. Sometimes she does this as silently as possible and I simply wake up in the morning, finding her next to me, to my extreme surprise.</p>

<p>(I'm a bit worried about her security due to my oversized body and high weight, so most of the time, when I'm aware that she came to us, I'm packing myself and I'm going to the living room to sleep.)</p>

<p>Her older sister (now 9) is not doing such things at all (again, except for my business trips, when both my daughters sleep with my wife for an entire night) and was not doing so when she was at her younger sister's age (5-6 years). I don't quite recall this now, but I think that she stopped coming to our bed around being 4 years old.</p>

<p>Shall I be worried with this situation, by any means? Is there any ""scientifically proven"" age when such behavior should stop? Or when it should become a concern for parents?</p>

<p>I recall a book that I read some time ago (around eight years ago, when her older sister was around 1 and younger one was not with us yet) which <em>possibly</em> claimed that an over 2 years old baby, still sleeping with their parents, shall be a concert. But, I must underline that since it was around 8 years ago, I might have forgotton or messed up things that I read.</p>

<p>My wife claims that this not only isn't a problem, but it is in fact a good blessing for us. That I should stop worrying or even thinking about this and cherish each of such nights, because it might not last for long (giving our older daughter as an example).</p>

"Is there any scientific evidence for TV being intrinsically harmful to children, or is it the loss of what TV replaces that is harmful?","<p>It’s commonly accepted that responsible parents should regulate children’s amount of TV time closely.</p>

<p>Is this because there is something particularly problematic about the actual act of watching television that is problematic?</p>

<p>Or is it rather a problem simply because of what the children might otherwise be doing if not watching TV (e.g. reading, socializing, physical activity, and so on)? Does this imply, for example, that even “large” amounts of TV can be benign if, say, the TV is enjoyed with others (a form of socializing), or is itself educational (a partial replacement for reading)?</p>

<p>For the purposes of this question, let’s assume that any and all material seen on the TV is entirely appropriate for the child’s viewing, and that the parents are aware and involved enough to be monitoring and ensuring this fact. I am particularly interested here in any scientific literature on the subject; any personal stories or anecdotal evidence would have to be very clear-cut and explicit to be of interest to me.</p>

<p>My interest here is in encouraging “careful thinking” with respect to TV. Certainly, we can agree, there are some children who spend “too much” time in front of the TV—but I think it’s important to distinguish between that being inherently bad, and that being bad solely because of what it means they aren’t doing. Is it sufficient to simply limit TV time, or is there an implied assumption that limited TV time implies more time spent on other, more beneficial activities?—and if so, does that mean that parents ought to be not only limiting TV time, but also either providing superior alternatives, or monitoring how a child spends their time away from the TV to make sure the child is actually finding their own alternatives?</p>

<li>One of the times she threw up was on herself</li>
<li>She didn't have a shower or bath afterwards</li>
<li>I found puke in her hair</li>

<li>Her hair wasn't combed during the visitation (she has long hair and it should be combed at least twice daily)</li>
<li>She didn't have lunch</li>
<li>Didn't have anything to drink on Saturday or Sunday before I picked her up</li>
<li>Her half-brother can't sleep without a TV on and she can't sleep with a TV on; my daughter was the unlucky one and stayed up a few hours extra because of that</li>
<li>She was awakened a few hours before her normal time and had to start her day accordingly</li>
<li>She watched a lot of TV</li>

"As a step parent, what should be my role in dealing with a volatile five year old?","<p>About a year and a half ago I met a woman who was going to school full-time and raising a 5 year old little girl. I really just fell in love with both of them and we all bonded relatively quickly. We spent a lot of time together going on outings and enjoying life together. After about 6 months we began to consider moving in together. We both recognized that things were moving fast, but it felt right and circumstances aligned such that it seemed to make sense. We found a new place and moved in together. </p>

<p>We have been living together for about 8 months. I have committed myself to being a good Parent and partner, and they are both a huge priority in my life. I really want our new family to be happy and to thrive.</p>

<p>The fist month of co-habitation was a little rocky, but we got through it relatively easily. The next couple of months were actually pretty great (in hindsight). However, over the past few months, while my girlfriend and I have grown closer and more connected to one another, my relationship with her daughter has become somewhat un-stable. </p>

<p>She has frequent meltdowns that culminate in her breaking things, stomping around the apartment (wood floors), banging on doors so loudly that the neighbors have complained, screaming at the top of her lungs, throwing things at us and our dog and trying to hit and kick us.</p>

<p>These episodes can last for 30 minutes sometimes and usually happen as a result of either her mom or I asking her to help out with something such as cleaning her room or saying that she can't do or have something that she wants. </p>

<p>Early on, I tended to not get too involved in these situations. I would let her mom handle it, simply because I wanted to focus on building trust and a stronger bond before becoming an authority figure. Her mom does tend to get a little wrapped up in the drama and she is working towards handling these situations with more patience and thoughtfulness. That said, I always support what her mom says and back her up 100%. We are working together on this.</p>

<p>More recently, I have stepped in and have begun to handle more of these situations. Sometimes I'm able to get in front of a meltdown to divert it and other times she seems entirely bent on causing havoc. I never raise my voice or treat her un-fairly. I stick to the original point and focus only on the fact that I am simply asking her to do something or I'll explain why she isn't allowed to do something. That has been my approach thus far. </p>

<p>If she get physical with me, starts pushing furniture around, knocking things over or throwing objects I will tell her to stop and go to her bed to relax. This typically only enrages her further or causes her to out and out mock me. We just can't have a child breaking a bunch stuff in the house, so if she doesn't listen I will pick her up and move her to the bed and tell her that she needs to stay there until she is calm. It is then that she will kick, scratch and hit. Once on her bed, she will jump off it and run around screaming in a piercing tone. It is unbelievably loud! I know my neighbors can here it and one of them has complained about the noise.</p>

<p>I will admit, I am getting frustrated by this. I want to have a calm, loving house and this little girl seems to want the exact opposite (though I know that she really wants love and attention). I spend a lot of time with her doing art projects, playing in the park and building things (she wants to be an engineer, which I'm really excited about). We can have stretches of days that are really enjoyable for all of us.</p>

<p>Lastly, she has never met her bio-dad. The only male role models she has had in her life have been her grandfather who only recently moved to the U.S., a previous boyfriend of her mom's and an uncle or two that she sees periodically. </p>

<p>We did try some family counseling but the emphasis was on play, which didn't seem to address the behavioral aspects. I am completely open to other types of counseling though. </p>

<p>My questions are: 
What can I do to get this child to treat me with the same respect that I show her, to listen well and to help out? Where should I focus my efforts in terms of bonding, direction and discipline? What kinds of counseling would be most effective in this case?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"Is a parent expected to be emotionally and socially supportive for the child?","<p>I'm 26, and feel the need to sort and process my childhood. I grew up in Norway. I have always felt a bit low, passive and lacking self-confidence growing up. I was polite, kind, and quite normal; I was okay at sports, good at music and school. I feel I wasn't able to accomplish even 10% of what I wanted to do. I felt stopped.</p>

<p>My first question has always been, ""What's my problem? Why am I not able to accomplish more?"" I've been undergoing treatment for anxiety and depression for the last 1.5 years, so that subject is already being treated.</p>

<p>The second question has been, ""What's wrong in my family?"" As long as I can remember, something felt wrong. I feel I'm getting close to answering this. My parents were very good at some things, not at others. They were good at caring for us financially, our physical health, and our intellectual development.</p>

<p>I feel that they were less successful at being ""there"" for us emotionally and socially. The things they could easily understand, they've sort of been there. But once it became difficult, they came with all kinds of apologies, but never tried solving the problem. It was simply forgotten.</p>

<p>I've never felt openness to discuss anything that really matters, only school, economy, practical and material things only, never more than that. The most consistent topic was ""how was school today?"" (asked by my mom; my dad didn't participate much in this respect.) However, my mom was very interested in the superficial stuff; she just wanted to hear that everything was okay, and that I did something fun with my friends. (The truth was, I found it hard to communicate with others in my class.) I needed her to listen to what I talked about, not ignore me or get tired and leave, then just forget about the topic like I never talked about it. So I started to not talk. I avoided the question. I started to say ""Great!"" ironically, or just barely answer at all. I had nobody to talk to.</p>

<p>And my father wasn't there. He went down to his office almost all day. And if it were something he wanted to be a part of, it was very specific topics. He wanted to tell me about mathematics, or he wanted me to go to football training and speed skating. Never wanted to talk, or establish a proper two-way connection with me.</p>

<p>Actually, that goes for both. Lot of them, little me. Not much communication, and if there was some, it was one-way. From them to me. And that stopped me from talking quite quickly. I felt inside me, are you not gonna listen? And so it went.</p>

<p>I've been talking to my parents about my feelings about the family growing up. They sort of simply didn't/don't accept my version of the story. I can count on one hand the times my mother was a tiny bit open, but it never went anywhere. My mom listened to me (kind of stony-faced), but didn't really engage. I felt that she believed everything she did was perfect, and she wasn't open to hearing anything else. I had proper hopes for someday establishing honest communication with my mom, maybe in 10-20 years, maybe confirming some of my feelings, but then she got cancer and died two years ago..</p>

<p>My dad is worse. He gets defensive immediately, derails the conversation, twists things I say, often interrupts me telling me ""how it was"", seems unable to talk about relational difficulties at all, and defines my subjects as ""useless"" and ""meaningless"". He has a small set of things he thinks is important as a parent, and the rest he strictly and firmly doesn't want to think about. This is very difficult for me to deal with.</p>

<p>I've concluded that for some reason both my mum and dad failed in some important parts of parenting, namely the emotional and social support of me and my siblings. My father did what he felt was important to do, but the emotional and social part that I needed, being me growing up here in this place, he feels he had no responsibility to provide.</p>

<p>I feel that I see this in other families as well, and that it's somehow accepted by many parents here in Norway. It's a one-way communication, and you're not responsible for being totally present as a parent, like emotionally and socially, and the more abstract things.</p>

<p><strong>Are parents supposed to be emotionally and socially present and supportive, or is it enough that they are physically and materially supportive and generally just kind?</strong> </p>

"How can I help my 6 year old learn patience","<p>My 6 year old daughter could use some help developing her ability to wait or be patient.  Understanding that most of us, and especially children, could use help with that, she does need some help beyond her peers.  In fact, it's enough so that her first grade teacher asked to have a meeting about it.</p>

<p>She is almost always great and wants to please, so I just want to help her let that part shine through more often.  She often struggles with raising her hand and waiting her turn in class.  At home, she struggles to wait for her turn to talk, resulting in interrupting others (usually my wife and myself).</p>

<p>Obviously, all of this gets magnified when she's tired, so we will often have a sense that it could be a rough day when she's heading off to school (though she's working at it and getting a bit better).</p>

<p>Interestingly, she is pretty self aware of this.  Her teachers had picked a couple of things with her for her to work on, and she is responsible each day for giving herself a grade.  Currently, her tasks are raising her hands and being respectful.  Each day she talks with the teachers about her rating for those things, and they have commented that she pretty much always picks the same grade they would have given her.</p>

<p>I take from all this, that she is generally a really good kid who wants to be a good one, but who doesn't posses the skills to handle herself when things start going bad.  I think patience and being willing and able to wait her turn are the main things that will help her (as do her teachers).</p>

<p>We do our best to recognize when she does well and comment on it to her.  When she interrupts we point out that she has to wait her turn.  We had also started letting her earn a sticker for each ""good"" day at school, and had been talking with her about letting her buy things she wants with (like having a ""downstairs campout"") after she gets enough stickers.  (Her teachers didn't seem to like that idea as much, seemingly thinking it separates the reward too far from the act--though I think I disagree with that since she loves getting the sticker itself each day as well.)</p>

<p>Are there other things we can do to help her develop those skills?  Are there good games we could play or activities that will help?  Aside from attempting to be patient and show ourselves to be waiting for things we want to model the desired behavior, are there other things my wife and I can do to help her?</p>

"How to talk to my 6-year-old son about his biological father?","<p>My husband and I have been married for 10 years, and we have three kids.  He is not the biological father of my oldest son, who is 6.  I am confused about the best way to talk to my son about his parentage. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The biological father of my son is black. My husband is white. Naturally, my oldest looks very different from his brother and sister, who have blond hair/blue eyes. Because of his different coloring, my son has had people ask him if he is adopted. As he gets older the difference between him and the other kids only becomes more pronounced. </p></li>
<li><p>I have no contact with the biological father. The biological father does not know my son exists. It was an isolated incident about which I have some personal confusion. I was overseas away from my husband. I was very drunk, I told the biological father I didn't want sex, but he had sex with me anyway. I have wondered if I was raped, but to call it rape seems like a cop-out since I was acting horribly and am responsible for being in that situation in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>I have thought about the fact that if I call it rape, then that looks better socially for me (with my in-laws, etc). But then what does it feel like for my son to eventually hear that his biological father raped me? Besides, as I said, I was very drunk and cannot be 100% certain that it was rape. I also want to make allowances for the possibility that my son way want to contact his biological father when he grows up.</p></li>
<li><p>My husband and I reconciled shortly after I found out I was pregnant. He is wonderful and loves my son as his own. He is the only father my son has ever known. </p></li>
<li><p>I am biracial myself. When my son was born we thought his darker coloring might be due to my mixed heritage. However the subsequent birth of two very white children now has everyone wondering. When my mother in law suggested my husband might not be his father, my husband got angry and basically told her to mind her own business...which she does for now. I don't think we can avoid it forever and and still have a relationship, though. Especially if the child himself knows.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am feeling very confused by all this. Please, does anyone have suggestions about a non-damaging way to explain to a 6-year-old why he looks so different from his dad, brother, and sister?</p>

"My 13-year-old daughter is talking to a 20-year old girl on the internet. Is this normal?","<p>She’s not very open so I have no idea whether their conversations are age-appropriate. She is a really intelligent and responsible kid, and she's definitely smart enough not to give out any personal information, and to disengage if things got creepy. But I also feel like an adult who chats with 13-year-olds on the internet can’t be normal, and might not have a normal sense for what is socially appropriate, so I'm pretty concerned about what they might be talking about.</p>

<p>She lives with her mother, so I can't take away internet access. I could tell her mother, but I don't want to break her trust. I know telling her mother would completely destroy the trust she has for me. I could talk to her about the dangers of talking to adults on the internet, but she already thinks I overreact to everything, and in the future I doubt she'd tell me anything anymore.</p>

<p>So 1) is it normal for a 13-year-old to be friends with an adult? And 2) if not, what can I do about this?</p>

"Why is my eight year old daughter trying to hurt my feelings - and how should I respond?","<p>I am the father of two children - an eight year old daughter and a four year old son.  I have been very close to them, in that they both play,share and trust me.  Both also have special activities that they engage in with me specifically.  As a rule both children are are also respectful and caring, both towards others and towards their parents. </p>

<p>In the last couple of months, though, my daughter, while continuing to play and talk with me, has started suddenly inserting comments into conversations that seem clearly intended to hurt me.  She always does it with a big smile like she's joking, and she clearly knows she is crossing a line, but she does it anyway.  Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>""When you're unhappy, I feel happy""</li>
<li>""You're leaving [for out of town] in half an hour? Why don't you go now?""</li>
<li>""My brother might miss you, but I'm not going to miss you""</li>
<li>""Mama is nicer than you anyway""</li>
</ul>

<p>I emphasise that this is combined with other loving and normal behaviour - this is only about 5% of the interactions.</p>

<p>The obvious connection here is to the fact that I am in a somewhat complicated marital situation at the moment.  My wife (w/ the kids) lives in a different city from me, and I visit almost every weekend. My wife was emotionally abusive for the last several years (see for instance <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/30629/stories-to-help-children-learn-how-to-tackle-passive-aggression-and-emotional-ab"">this question</a> or <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/30856/setting-boundaries-with-an-emotionally-abusive-coparent-in-a-way-that-helps-ki"">this one</a>) and in November last year I took a separate place to stay for the days I come to their city.  Since then however my wife's behaviour has improved, and while she still is egoistic and distant, she is no longer openly contemptuous and does not engage in threats or abusive language etc.  I think chances are higher than not that our marriage will survive.  I now spend more time in their residence then in mine when in their city, and my wife has started joining the kids in coming to my residence as well.  My daughter was initially very frightened by the possibility of us breaking up, but doesn't raise that now.  But it is in fact as things were improving between us that this behaviour has now started.</p>

<p>How should I respond to this?  I tackled the first statement (""I am happy"" etc.)  by saying I didn't think that was true, and I really hoped it wasn't true.  When she interrupted me repeatedly with ""BORING"" while I was talking, I told her this was disrespectful conduct, and she has largely stopped that.  </p>

<p>What else should I do?  On my next visit I think I may take her aside when this kind of thing happens, tell her that if she is angry with me or scared about us she needs to tell me, and that trying to hurt me is not acceptable and doesn't work in a family either. </p>

"How to encourage a 2 year old toddler to complete colouring a sketch?","<p>The baby is 2 years 3 months old. She is utterly interested in drawing. She has now been put in a playschool where I was told that she will be given homework regarding colouring pictures.</p>

<p>I have noticed that the colouring books meant for small children contain giant drawings. Most of them have big square, cirle, and other shapes etc. Other do have some animals but they are also very big.</p>

<p>My opinion is that if someone asks me to colour a big rectangle, I won't be interested because:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is very big so it will take a long time to colour it.  </p></li>
<li><p>It is does not represent anything so it is not interesting.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now considering the above logic, I have brought the colouring books meant for bigger children for my toddler. These books have smaller pictures of animals, birds, and people.</p>

<p>I show the parts of body of animals, birds, and people to the child and then ask her to colour the specific part. </p>

<p>She seems to enjoy this. She enjoys colouring horns, eyes, feet, hands, ears. The problem starts when I ask her to colour the torso. She loses interest. I can guess that the reason is that the torso is big whether it is of an animal or a human. It is big.</p>

<p>I have tried the following to encourage her:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have given her oil pastels instead of wax crayons because of the smoothness and bright shades they have. She loves them.  </p></li>
<li><p>I tell her that I will colour x part of the body, and then ask her which part would you colour? She responds happily to this too.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But these steps do not work when colouring the torso. <strong><em>Also, according to the second point listed above, I colour half of the sketch and she colours the other half.</em></strong></p>

<p>Right now, she hasn't been given any homework but when she does get the homework <strong><em>I am not sure if the second step I follow will be considered cheating(?)</em></strong> I am also not sure if this is <strong><em>proper</em></strong> way to encourage her!</p>

<p><strong>Also, her school books have big rectangles to colour. I don't know how to force her to colour that giant rectangle, and animals which have giant torsos</strong>, when I myself think that colouring that giant rectangle/area is wastage of time. I never do it myself even though I am very much interested in Arts!</p>

<p>My wife says this is wrong. She claims that we need to keep teaching our kids (that one and younger one) that they should hold in the gas and leave to toilet, but if any escapes, they should remain silent.

<ul>
<li>I view screen time as more of a necessary evil than anything else. My boys get 30 minutes each per day, and I would be happier if it were less.</li>
<li>The interactions we have are not very high quality: occasionally sharing resources, sometimes planning together.</li>
<li>I'm concerned about communicating that interacting over video games is quality human interaction.</li>

"I got a vasectomy after our 3rd child. Now, my wife wants a 4th child, but I don't","<p>My wife and I (both 38 years old) have been married for 8 years now and we have 3 amazing kids (all under the age of 8). We really could not ask for more. Like any couple, we have gone through our ups and downs throughout our marriage. We made a point to see a counselor through our ups and downs just so that we have someone to talk to (like a 3rd party). </p>

<p>In terms of children, our original plan was to have back-to-back kids which I must admit was tough at first but we managed to work things out over the years.</p>

<p>About 4 years ago, my wife shared with me her dream of having a 3rd child. It took me a long time to come around and agree to this. We talked, argued, went to see a counselor. After some soul searching, I decided to compromise and decided to say yes to baby number 3. Part of the agreement was to stop after our 3rd and for me to get a vasectomy. Naturally she was ecstatic and promised me the world! Once our 3rd was about 6 months old, with the consent of the wife and as agreed, I went ahead to get the vasectomy. Fast forward to 3 years later, we have an amazing family and no regrets about having a 3rd. She is an amazing little girl.</p>

<p>Recently my wife shared with me her dream / desire to have a 4th. She asked me if I could make the ultimate sacrifice to reverse the vasectomy, try for a baby and get a vasectomy again. I have been going back and forth for over a month now with my wife about this. Clearly we have different views on this matter and I frankly feel trapped. Unless I say yes (she refers to as having an open mind and trying), there is no way out of this difference.</p>

<p>She continues to tell me this is her dream and I am the roadblock to that. She is disappointed in me that I am not even trying. Personally, I feel that I compromised with having a third child and now she is moving the goal post on me. Everything she is promising and telling me now is a recurring pattern from the time we were discussing about having our 3rd child. She is asking me to make the ultimate sacrifice, again she said the same thing the last time around. How do I know this will not stop after the 4th? She keeps making me all these promises which I have heard before. I went from the guy that made the ultimate sacrifice with having our 3rd (top of the mountain) to the negative/no-can-do person blocking her dream and that I do not love her enough to pursue this dream (I am at the bottom of the mountain all of sudden... How can this be?).</p>

<p>I am feeling very frustrated with the situation. All I want is my wife, back on the path we were on and enjoy the family/life we have now. Also to continue to work on our marriage and deal with all the ups/down coming our way raising our amazing three children.</p>

<p>Up to this point, I have listened to her, we exchanged views many times and we even went to see the doctor to inquire about the reversal of the vasectomy. The bottom line is, I do not want another child, which I have made clear to my wife. I would like her to honor her word/promise to stop after our 3rd child and I feel that it is her turn to compromise and make the sacrifice just like I had to dig deep to come around to change my mind 4 years ago. I understand she is not feeling this way on purpose and I would like to support her 100% to overcome this together. At this point, we are both just hitting a brick wall and I am so lost, not knowing what to do. I am getting the silent treatment now and she is really upset with me. I just don’t understand why I am in this position? Doesn’t her word/promise from 4 years ago mean anything anymore? I have shared with her my reasons for not wanting another child and reminded her about what we agreed on. She seems to think people are entitled to change their mind and I am fine with that. It just baffles me that she can be so casual about going back on her word and I’m all of a sudden the bad guy. At the same time, I think we need to address this void she feels. Clearly, if we were to have a 4th child, this desire of wanting another baby will not go away. Everything I’ve said to her makes logical sense to me but she just doesn’t seem to see my point of view. Or perhaps she is simply blinded by wanting another baby?</p>

<p>Any advice or insight on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

"Take a 3 year old to funeral?","<p>Would you take a 3 and a half year old girl to the funeral of her great-granddad?  </p>

<p>She knows about death and heaven...<br>
Death belongs to life, right? </p>

<p>On the other hand, I don't want to overstrain her... </p>

<p>Edit: I would like to share my experience with you after everything has happened:</p>

<p>One day before the funeral I took her and explained very clearly what we are going to do, why and what will happen. Children have a very clear language. So I explained that he died, that means we will never be able to visit him, talk to him again or even see him anymore. We were going to say goodbye to him. He will be inside of a box that is going to be put under the earth. People are going to be very sad for a while. She accepted all of this easily. So I was not absolutely sure about the grade of understanding, but since I know her and she is pretty smart, I was sure there should not be anymore suprises for her in what is going to happen. So we took her with us. Inside of the church she was pretty calm and curious. Never frightened or something. Sometimes a bit simpering. Lateron during the funeral the same. She dropped some flowers into the grave and said bye. That's it.</p>

<p>I am sure her presence was helpful for some of the relatives although I cared that she was not instrumented for anyone to feel better at any time. She decided herself who to talk to and where to go.</p>

<p>Lateron she explained her little sister that gran-grandad has ""decended in a box and is now gone"". That's it. Maybe she will remember this experience in future, maybe not, but I am very sure she will defenitely not remember it as something very scary.</p>

<p>The benefit is that she was a part of the process and I am sure she will never wonder where he is and why he is not there anymore because she simply knows what happened and was a part of the process to say goodbye. I am happy about the decision.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention and suggestions.</p>

If they aren't done eating within that time or don't eat at all because they don't like what's being served, then they go hungry till the next meal, and learn from the consequence.

"Should I expect my 20 year old son to get a job while at University?","<p>My son is now 20 years old, still living with us at home and goes to University three days a week. He has never had a job. Since he was a child I have tried to encourage him to do tasks for pocket money but he just wasn't interested and he hasn't changed his attitude since. </p>

<p>At junior school he was one of the brightest in his year and showed such promise with leadership skills. He became quieter at secondary school but still did well with his gcse's. By the time he was at college we started having problems with him, getting phone calls from his tutors saying he wasn't turning in for his lessons.</p>

<p>We managed to get him to stick it out although he lied to us constantly, he even lied to us about getting accepted into Manchester university when he hadn't and let his dad look for accommodation for him knowing that he hadn't been accepted. We were gob smacked when we found out he was lying and he only told us the truth because he found out that he had been accepted into another university which is local. </p>

<p>Last year he was only turning up to uni one day a week as he said he didn't need to go in the other two days as he could do his work at home. I have trouble believing him with this as he has lied to us so many times, but I think as uni is costing him so much in loans and that he is hardly there, that he should get a job alongside uni as otherwise he just sits in his room all day playing games and constantly making a mess in the kitchen. </p>

<p>I cook his meals, wash his clothes and don't charge board. I'm getting so depressed about this because I feel like I'm working so hard to earn money to keep the roof over my family's heads but I get no thanks for it.  I feel like I'm the bad guy for bringing it up time and time again that I want my son to contribute and get a job. I'm horrified that my other 18 year old son seems to be showing the same lack of responsibility in regards to getting a job.  Though he has applied for many jobs he just thinks he tried and failed, so what? And it's a constant headache trying to get him to try a bit harder and to keep on looking.  What can I do? </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I cook for him as I cook in large quantities for all our family. It would seem awful for the rest of us to sit around the table eating a nice meal and to tell him that he has to buy and make his own food separately to the rest of us. I wash his clothes as this takes no extra time or effort on my part, and he is expected to bring his laundry down to the utility room and to iron his clothes. He will do, and does do daily chores but only when asked. I can't expect him to take the dog out every day as his duty for example, he has to be asked every day. He doesn't put up a fight or argue, but does the task in whichever way takes the least thought or effort and then goes back to his room.</p>

<p>He is an intelligent boy academically, his teachers used to describe him as being a sponge, soaking up knowledge easily. The problem is in his social skills. He is introverted and likes his own company, dislikes and avoids talking to people if he can help it, and I've tried to encourage him to be more sociable with some improvements but he's very stubborn about it.</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons behind why I'm so worried about him never having had a job yet. When I was young I was also shy and lacked confidence but I'd still managed to find myself several jobs starting when I was 12 and did babysitting. I was motivated to do this as I wanted to earn the money. My son lacks this motivation. When he was at college I stopped giving him money or buying him clothes hoping this would make him desire money and give him the motivation to get a job, but he just made his bit of Xmas money last all year and wore the same old clothes all year.</p>

<p>When he started uni he spent his student loan on a computer, a holiday and the rest covered his travelling fares so there wasn't any left to charge him rent. I was feeling annoyed about the holiday but also thought as he doesn't mix with friends often that the experience might be good for him socially, and I also hoped that having the student loan as a contrast to having no money while he was at college might make him learn to appreciate the difference some money makes, and to give him a desire to earn some for himself.</p>

<p>He has applied for jobs but half heatedly as he is only doing it to appease me and his father, and in the current climate I don't think this is going to land him a job any time soon. </p>

<p>I can't tell you just how relieved I would feel if he just got a job, anything, even just a temp job over Xmas or stacking shelves in a supermarket, just for him to take that first step.</p>

<p>I've tried everything and where I'm going wrong is probably not being tough enough on him. The next thing for me to do is maybe taking away all his games, TV and devices so that his comfort zone is a little less comfortable, and last resort would be to kick him out, which I know I haven't got the heart to do as just the fact that he has made it as far as university is an achievement, (I dropped out of college after one year and ended up in a dead end job working unsociable hours for next to nothing for most of my life so far), so I don't want to do anything that causes him to drop uni, which I'm sure he will if he's pushed too hard as it was difficult enough getting him to complete college. </p>

<p>Instead I think I may have a chat and work out some rent while he's living with us, and then in his next year tell him that I expect him to move into student accommodation unless he has by then managed to find himself a part time job, in which case I'd be more than happy for him to continue living with us. I like him living with us in any case, despite him being messy and unsociable he is still my son and I love him. I just want him to take some responsibility and get a job for his own sake and to ease my worried mind.</p>

Is it Separation Anxiety?","<p>For a while my 1 Year old son has been a bit of a ""Daddys Boy"" and we have had a similar experience to this <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/6220/1-yr-old-boy-prefers-dad?newreg=4e73669c617243eaba5c29bc6ca73db0"">question</a>:</p>

<p>However its gotten worse lately:</p>

<ul>
<li>He cries with his mum (for long periods) while I am at work</li>
<li>Doesn't like me to put him down (he cries and clings onto my shirt/clothes)</li>
<li>Much worse at eating his food (even when I feed him). </li>
</ul>

<p>With the food sometimes the only thing that works is to put food in front of him and ""ignore"" him, he cries for a bit and then starts to eat when he figures we aren't looking (I hate doing this but its better then him not eating). As a weird coincidence, when I make the food (as apposed to his mum) he seems to prefer but I can't imagine he notices ..I think this is just a false correlation we are spotting</p>

<p>Whenever we ask a healthcare professional, the answer is ""babies cry"" but I am worried my wife can't take much more of this constant lack of affection + crying.</p>

<p>Are these symptoms of separation anxiety? Or is it a teething phase (which partly explains the food). Or a mixture of both.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice for this situation? </p>

"How do I handle my Roommates child bullying my child?","<p>I have been living with roommates since March due to financial situations, my roommate has two children 8 and 9 and my child is 5. At first everything was great but suddenly I find myself stuck in a situation. My roommates daughter, 9, has begun picking on my son. It started when my son broke her phone. Of course I immediately replaced it when it happened.  But about a week ago, it had been smashed again. </p>

<p>This time, it happened on a Saturday. My son goes to his dads house on weekends - Friday through Sunday. My roommate's daughter has told everyone my son broke it and demands I fix it again. I said no, because my son wasn’t even home when it happened. He couldn’t have possibly broken it. Ever since then she has been locking him out of his room, telling him it isn’t his anymore. She locked me out of my room. She’s broken his toys, hit him, told him mean things, and Sunday when he gets home he discovers she poured tide laundry detergent and blue food coloring on all of his toys, ruining them. </p>

<p>My child went to her and told her he forgave her for doing that, which was very sweet of him. However, I don’t know what to do? I’ve tried talking to her, she was very rude. Her mother will not discipline her and is not on my side. I can’t afford to live on my own right now, money is tight and it will be a few months before we can afford to move. Until then I feel so so frustrated and angry. </p>

<p>My son loves my roommate's daughter and wants to be her friend but she is so mean to him. The other child of my room mate is very sweet and plays well with my son. I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone else experienced this? </p>

"Can it be unhealthy to deprive a child of sugar?","<p>My youngest son just turned five. For years he's had a relentless craving for sweets.</p>

<ul>
<li>He's constantly requesting/demanding sugary food and drinks</li>
<li>If we walk by somebody eating anything in a wrapper, he stops and stares (at the snack)</li>
<li>His first stop every morning is the pantry</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently, he (Matthew) began throwing a tremendous tantrum out of the blue. Rolling on the ground, crying, heaving, and appearing to have convulsions. My wife and I were about to call for help, but we decided to try a lollipop first. He took the lollipop, calmed down, and within a few minutes was back at play with his brothers.</p>

<p>His fraternal twin brother and older brother (6), also like sweets, but don't have any addictive characteristics (i.e., when we say no, they get over it and move on). </p>

<p>All three are on the same diet consisting mostly of natural, fresh foods, plain water, white milk, diluted fruit juices, and the least sugary, salty snacks. We also allow them to indulge occasionally on sweets (chocolate, ice cream, birthday cakes, etc.).</p>

<p>However, we have never allowed Matthew to fulfill his craving for sugar (assuming that's even possible). There's always been a limit, and he's always unsatisfied. </p>

<p>His craving isn't confined to refined sugar. He devours peaches, grapes, watermelon and other fruits with equal pleasure.</p>

<p>So here's my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Considering that Matthew's craving for sugar is relentless, intense
  and has been ongoing for years, is it possible that his craving
  represents a legitimate nutritional need?</p>
  
  <p>In other words, is it possible that his body genuinely needs more
  sugar, and by limiting his consumption we are actually stunting his
  growth and development?</p>

"What are the pros and cons of colouring books?","<p>What are the pros and cons of colouring-in (as opposed to freehand drawing) for pre-school and primary age children?</p>

<p>I'm asking in response to this question:
<a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/22491/at-what-age-should-i-tell-my-child-to-colour-within-the-lines"">At what age should I tell my child to colour within the lines?</a>

<p>When I was a kid my parents avoided colouring-in - I remember the good old '<a href=""http://www.susanstriker.com/anticoloring.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anti-colouring book</a>' - but it's not something I've ever thought about in a lot of depth.</p>

"Somewhat unemotional, destructive pre-schooler; shows no strong attachment to things. How can we help him?","<p>My 5 year old pre-schooler exhibits some behaviors that have my wife &amp; I a little concerned, but we're unsure whether there's a real problem or not.</p>

<p>I'll try to summarize some of his behaviors and/or personality traits (positive &amp; negative), then go over some of it in a little more detail.</p>

<ul>
<li>Destructive behaviors

<ul>
<li><em>note</em> most of these behaviors occurred between ages 2 - 4; over the last year we've noticed a decline in his destructive tendencies, though he still peals stickers off things, and his toy breakage is roughly on par with his older brother at this age.  Furthermore, as we've tried to understand the ""why"" of this, as best we can tell he does it out of pure curiosity.</li>
<li>Peeling stickers, paint, &amp; other decorations off his property, or off the wall in his room (peeling the paint off his room was one we've only recently arrested; he was regularly destroying the paint job in his room).</li>
<li>Tearing pages out of books, and tearing other paper things (posters, calendars, etc); these are always his property, I've never seen him destroy someone else's property</li>
<li>Breaking his own toys -- usually by playing rough; I don't recollect him destroying / breaking toys just because he was curious.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Personality traits

<ul>
<li>He does not have trouble bonding with people -- eg, he does not avoid physical contact (likes hugs/kisses from parents, sometimes hugs/kisses siblings), and enjoys hanging out with parents / siblings.</li>
<li>He's very curious and talkative; loves to read, play video games, and especially loves cars and other vehicles (tractors, monster trucks, etc)</li>
<li>He doesn't usually understand humor.  He often mistakes playful situations for offensive behaviors.</li>
<li>Punishments generally don't phase him, except to upset him; we learned a long time ago that taking things away, spankings, etc, do not encourage him to alter his behavior.  Furthermore, his lack of interest in ""things"" (discussed below) negates the possibility of rewarding him with treats, toys, etc; however, rewards such as spending time with mom/dad, or doing other things do seem to motivate him more.</li>
<li>He has a very high pain threshold; if someone hurts him (eg, rough-housing), he doesn't cry/scream [typically], he just gets angry.

<ul>
<li>On a related note, there's one particular quirk I've noticed lately that concerns me.  My wife and her [biological] brother have a 'tick': they pick at their thumbs to the point of bleeding/cracking.  This behavior has been around since they were both young teenagers, and neither one can explain why they do it other than it being a nervous habit.  So far as I know, my son has never observed this particular behavior, and now he's started doing it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He's always been very defiant about swallowing his food.  When he decides he doesn't want to swallow something, he'll keep it in his mouth for hours if you let him.

<ul>
<li>This defiance extends to other things as well; when he makes up his mind that he does not want to do something, he'll just clamp his mouth shut and ignore you.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>He does not form attachments to things.  I'll talk about this more below.</li>
<li>Our pediatrician suspects he may fall in the class of children with Opposition Defiance Disorder.</li>
<li>He exhibits ADHD symptoms -- inability to focus / concentrate, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The main thing I want to explore is his lack of concern w/regard to personal property.  We're concerned it may grow into something more serious as he gets older.</p>

<p>Recently he got a ""slot car"" track for his birthday and destroyed it by playing too rough with it (within about a month or two).  He helped throw it away without argument, and kept talking about something unrelated.</p>

<p>My wife was helping him organize his bedroom and purge it of old/unused and broken toys.  He spoke fondly of many of the toys, but showed no interest in keeping them; it didn't seem to bother him that they'd be gone permanently.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if it's something he plays with regularly, how long he's had it, who gave it to him, where he got it, etc.  He's never attached himself to any one thing (eg, a security blanket).  When I've taken things as punishment he'll make a show of being upset, get over it very quickly, and thereafter shows very little interest in getting it back.</p>

<p>He has had trouble getting along with his older brother the past few years, though they've been getting along better the last year or so (we tried having them share rooms a few years ago before they were clashing; we put a stop to that after they destroyed a room (pealed paint, peed on carpet, poop in heater vents, peed in radio, etc) and one of them bit the other).  He gets along with his other siblings quite well (for a 5 year old).</p>

<p>In short, we're worried his behavior could grow to encompass more anti-social behaviors.  My wife says it almost seems like he's less caring/emotional in general, and is worried he has (or may develop) a similar inability to place value on people or relationships.</p>

<p>What are we dealing with here?  What can we do to help him?  If he grows into an adult who doesn't particularly value 'things', but is an otherwise well-adjusted person, I'm ok with that.  However, if there's something going on I can help him with I don't want to let him down.</p>

<p><em>update 8/4/2016</em></p>

<p>A commenter requested an update on our situation so here it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Family dynamic

<ul>
<li>5 children: 2 older siblings (girl, boy) &amp; 2 younger siblings (girl, boy)</li>
<li>1 working parent, other parent part time college</li>
<li>pets: turtle, dog, currently 1 rat (the others have been getting old &amp; dying on us)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Personality traits

<ul>
<li>Emotionally speaking he seems to be developing.  My post has ""somewhat unemotional"" in the title, though I would now amend that to ""emotionally reserved"".  Sometimes he seems not to understand either what he's feeling or how others are feeling, but he does seem to be learning to understand emotions.  This was probably my largest concern when I originally wrote this post and I'm happy to say that aspect of his development doesn't concern me nearly as much as it used to.</li>
<li>He has begun forming some attachments to objects; there's a stuffed seal he carries around everywhere and loves to rub his mouth/nose against it -- especially when agitated.</li>
<li>He's a fast reader and when he chooses to he reads a wide variety of books -- when he chooses to.</li>
<li>Like many children he has explored lying, cheating, stealing, etc.  I do not feel as though these behaviors are more or less pronounced than any of his older siblings has been.</li>
<li>He tends to be more willing to take responsibility for poor decisions as compared to his older siblings.  We had an incident earlier this year with money missing from my wife's purse.  Since I didn't know who was responsible I stopped paying allowances.  He didn't fess up until I helped him realize everyone would be punished.  I was concerned at first he wasn't responsible and was just trying to spare his siblings' the punishment but he knew details no one else had.</li>
<li>On the one hand I feel as though it's not usually obvious to him when an action or situation will cause someone discomfort.  On the other hand, when he <em>is</em> aware of it he'll usually go out of his way (sometimes a little too far) to make them happy; exceptions being anyone he perceives as a perpetual irritant.</li>
<li>He tends to be rather easy to take advantage of; some examples:

<ul>
<li>Kids in school have been able to convince him to do inappropriate things (eg, pull down pants in class)</li>
<li>His brother convinced him to pay $5 to hear a ""secret"" that wasn't useful</li>
<li>Our children were participating in an AWANA group at a local church we don't attend.  He had difficulty getting along with some of the kids and they started bullying him.  He would become aggravated then they would complain to leaders &amp; their parents that he was upsetting them.<br><br>A few incidents in particular made it fairly clear they were intentionally egging him on so they could get him in trouble.  We tried to work with the leaders but they eventually asked us not to bring him back.<br><br>We felt as though they had less interest in his welfare and more interest in getting rid of a difficult child; we removed all of our children from their organization.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Destructive behaviors

<ul>
<li>He still exhibits some destructive tendencies but they're far more infrequent.  The paint peeling in particular is still a problem and mostly manifests when he's agitated.</li>
<li>He likes to fidget and we've found it's been more constructive to allow him access to things he can destroy than trying to teach him not to</li>
<li>When reading books the book often doesn't survive.  If you watch him while reading he'll be absently bending/unbending, wiggling and sometimes tearing pages.  He's usually not aware he's doing it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>His school has put him on an individual education plan (IEP).  Among other things they've begun using <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">occupational therapy</a> techniques when he seems agitated or is struggling to concentrate.  They finalized everything at the end of the school year and we're on summer break, so we don't yet have a clear idea of how much it's helping.</p>

<p>In addition I've been trying to apply the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nurtured_Heart_Approach"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nurtured heart approach</a> as described in the book ""Transforming the Difficult Child"", though I'll readily admit I've struggled to be consistent.</p>

<p>Overall I feel as though things are going rather smoothly all things considered.</p>

<p>While it's sometimes difficult to work with him I also feel encouraged; some of the things that make it hard to work with him can be leveraged as strengths instead of limitations.  As an example my brother once remarked that he considers his (and my) ADHD to be like a super power: yes it's quite hard for us to concentrate, but when we can pull it off we become hyperfocused (concentrating to the exclusion of all else).</p>

<hr>

<p><em>update 8/9/2018</em></p>

<p>We believe we're dealing with Aspergers.  Some years back we tried to get an official diagnosis from a trained psychologist but we couldn't afford the test (~$1500).</p>

<p>There's a charter school nearby (K-12) that specializes in dealing with children on the spectrum, but they allow any student into the school that expresses an interest.</p>

<p>I believe transfering him to that school was the right move as they're far more patient with him (eg, if he wants a wobble chair, they provide it) and provide him with regular access to an occupational therapist.</p>

<p>He has a hard time interacting with kids his own age mostly because they don't have patience for him (he always has stuff to talk about with anyone who'll listen), but overall things still seem to be progressing smoothly (relatively).</p>

"Why is my one month old kicking, grunting and eventually crying when I hold her?","<p>My 1 month old daughter has starting something I am trying to understand.

"Why does my toddler pull hair to calm himself? How can I make him stop?","<p>My 2 year old toddler loves to pull on hair. 
He pulls on mine and his own, usually to calm himself to sleep. </p>

<p>He has always loved pulling hair - which most babies do, but he didn't stop. I tell him gently he can't pull my hair, and he usually stops, but then soon he does it again. </p>

<p>I am especially concerned about the fact that he does it to calm himself (I wonder if it is a form of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichotillomania"" rel=""nofollow"">Trichotillomania</a>, though it is not that severe). He doesn't actually pull out big chunks of hair, if any. </p>

<p>I usually move his hands from my hair to his if he is about to sleep (I don't want to say firmly 'no' or even talk to him when he is half asleep). I don't know if that just reinforces him in pulling. </p>

<p>As a complication of this, most nights he comes and sleeps in our bed (I am not looking to end the co-sleeping). Around 4/5 he gets half awake, and starts pulling my hair. This makes it hard for me to get my sleep. I usually just remove his hands from my hair. Again, I really don't want to get him to a wakeful state. </p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<p>Why does he like pulling hair? 
Will it stop?
How can I get him to stop, especially when he is not really awake?
Is this something I should be concerned about other than the annoyance for me?</p>

<p>as a side note: He loves the hair of other toddlers too, but mostly remembers not to pull it. 
He also doesn't have any developmental issues we are aware up, and as far as we know all his behaviors and milestones are within the norm. </p>

"How to teach a potty trained 2-year-old, who pees every 20-30 minutes, to ask to go early enough?","<p>We have a 2-year-old son. We have potty trained him when he was about 22 months old and thought we were over the hill - it went quite well although he never learned to ask to the potty, we just put him on the potty often and he peed. </p>

<p>However, after a few weeks, he started to pee his pants and he tells me too late that he needs to go - he either tells me a second (literally) before he actually goes or after he has already peed his pants... he does not mind being wet or dirty, just comments on what he has done. </p>

<p>I have gone through <strong>a lot</strong> of advice and forums and articles and I have no trouble creating a potty schedule <strong>but</strong> they advise every 60-90 minutes, while he often pees his pants like 20 minutes after peeing on the potty and peeing! It is getting unbearable as he pees really often and I feel like it makes no difference whether I pee with him before or not. </p>

<p>The trouble is I think it was like this from day one - he peed very <strong>very</strong> frequently. He goes to daycare twice a week and has almost no incidents there. When we go out, he rarely pees himself. </p>

<p>I guess I am wondering if this could be a Urinary Tract Infection (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UTI</a>) or its consequences. But that does not make sense with how long he can hold it when we go out. I have a doctor's appointment scheduled in two weeks but cannot get to a doctor sooner unless it's an emergency (doctors aren't as accessible where we live. Do you think this could be normal and we started potty training too early? </p>

<p>I <strong>do not</strong> want to go back to napies, like no way after all that trouble! What could I do to teach him to ask to go early enough? Because a potty schedule of every 30 minutes is exhausting! Yesterday he even went number 2 on the floor and hasn't happen in like 6 months...</p>

"Using the sink dish cloth to wipe infants face and hands after feeding","<p>My spouse gets very upset when I use the common kitchen dish-cloth to wipe my baby's hands and face after his feedings!!!

<p>My spouse insists that I use a fresh or separate dedicated baby cloth to wipe my child's hands and face because she thinks the ""general purpose dish cloth is dirty germ factory"" and risks exposing my child to germs and unsafe/unpredictable risks to his health.</p>

"5 month old not eating enough","<p>My 5-month old daughter started taking bottles of expressed breast milk about 1 month ago, since her mother needed to go back to work. Up until 5 days ago, she takes about ~24 oz per 24 hours (3 feedings of 5-6 oz during the day, and 1-2 feedings of 4-5 oz during the night).</p>

<p>Starting about 5 days ago, she would only take about 2-3 oz per feeding (turns her head away or refuses to suck on the nipple after that), with the last feeding of the day (~7pm) being especially bad (only take 1-2 oz from bottle, and her mother then breast feeds her after that, which she does take). The night feeding is ok, once for 5 oz.</p>

<p>As a result, her total intake now is only about 15-16 oz per 24 hours. </p>

<p>She doesn't really cry out of hunger, and does not show any other signs of distress (smiles, no cries for no reason, reasonably energetic) during the day or night. </p>

<p>We checked with doctor. He told us to try and take a video next time this happens. This again happened twice after this, first after a gap of maybe about a month and second after 1-2 weeks. But we were not able to record this as we were not prepared. We spoke to Doctor again who asked:</p>

<li>Was biting his teeth? - No</li>
<li>Was he conscious? - Yes</li>

"3-year-old wants to 'do it herself' when it's already done","<p>My daughter (three and a half years old) has developed a strange behavior recently and I think she's passing it on to her younger brother (almost two). At odd times throughout the day, she decides she wants to 'do things herself'. The problem is that it's usually something someone else has already done.</p>

<p>For example, she needs to wash her hands so I turn on the sink. She has been happy and having fun but suddenly starts crying and, when I can get her to talk, she says she wants to 'do it herself'. I say ok, and she turns off the sink, waits a few seconds, then turns it back on and washes her hands but with sniffling and occasional tears. She feels a little better but is still vaguely unhappy after she's done. Is this a normal development? If so, what should I do?</p>

<p>She's a good kid, pretty clever, listens well, and likes trying to help when adults are doing things. I just don't know if I'm encouraging bad behavior by letting her cry to get her way. Perhaps I shouldn't let her do it but should instruct her not to fuss for silly reasons.</p>

"Should you let a toddler win?","<p>We've started playing some simple games with my 2-year-old son, including a simple age-appropriate matching game.</p>

<p>He enjoys playing, but seems (to me, at least) more focused on <em>playing</em> over <em>winning</em>.  I think that's perfect.</p>

<p>However, I noticed last night that he <em>always</em> wins.  </p>

<p>It turns out that my wife has literally been stacking the deck in his favor.  When the game gets towards the end, she starts looking at the tiles, and checking to see if the next one dealt (she's the dealer) would be the winning card.  If it would end the game with either her or I winning, she sets it aside and picks the next one.  In at least one game she apparently deliberately put all of the tiles that matched her card at the very bottom so they wouldn't get drawn.</p>

<p>When I asked her about it, she said she thought he should win, and that winning would be more fun for him.</p>

<p>Setting aside the implications of lessons about cheating (let's assume that it was subtle enough, and that my son was distracted enough, that he had no clue that the deck was being manipulated), is there any problem with ensuring that he wins each time?</p>

<p>My concern, which I expressed to my wife, is that I want him to enjoy playing games for the sake of playing, and not for the sake of winning.  I don't want him to expect to win each time, and then become disappointed when he doesn't.  Is this a legitimate concern at his age, or is he simply too young to focus on the competitive side of games, and letting him win is nothing more than a harmless incentive to enjoy playing at this age?</p>

<p>If it isn't a problem at this age, when <strong>does</strong> it become a problem?</p>

"Toddler Plays in Bed and Won't go to Sleep","<p>I have a 2.5 year old daughter. She sleeps great once she's asleep. We do the nightly routine and put her to bed. She gets into bed after story time and cuddles her stuffed animals and closes her eyes.</p>

<p>After my wife and I leave the room she will play in bed - sometimes it's kicking the wall, sometimes talking to her stuffed animals, sometimes singing, etc... She may do this for 5 minutes to an hour. Even when we're sure she's tired she will stay up and play.</p>

<p>My wife and I have taken to standing in her room and saying ""Shhh"" or ""Lay still."" when she's been going for a while without falling asleep. Usually after 15-30 minutes of this she will fall asleep.</p>

<p>We got the idea of standing in there from people who's kids kept getting out of bed - recommendations were to put them back in bed and sit there quietly without getting upset or emotional.</p>

<p>Are we doing the right thing by staying in there? I'm hesitant to try any kind of bribery like ""Go to sleep and you get X in the morning"" or ""If you don't fall asleep you won't get Y tomorrow"" since I'm not sure she'll remember the cause or reason for them the next day.</p>

<p>She doesn't show any signs of being afraid or reluctance to get in bed. She's never climbs out and we don't play in bed. We read stories on a rug near the bed and after hugs and kisses she climbs into bed. Any thoughts or suggestions?</p>

"5 year old always yells when excited, and isn't learning when to use quieter voices","<p>I'll start by saying I don't think it's a hearing problem, as she uses a normal voice in non-excited conversation, and can hear questions asked to her in a normal voice (aside from what I suspect is normal tuning-out of my voice...)</p>

<p>When my daughter is in situations where she's excited, she frequently yells at a volume that's way louder than appropriate, given her proximity to other people. It sometimes happens when we're in groups, playing outside, or if she's watching TV and she wants to tell me about something she saw that she really liked. As a specific example, I was helping her off the swing today and her sandal fell off - she shouted ""MY SHOE!!!"" right in my face as it happened. It comes out sounding angry, though I'm pretty sure that's not intentional - it's just really loud.</p>

<p>I know it takes time to learn what's appropriate for a situation, but when can I expect my child to start using an appropriate volume when speaking in excitement? I feel like I'm constantly asking her to speak more quietly, and constantly giving reminders, but any improvement is minor at best, and it usually only applies to her current thoughts - the next time there's an exciting situation she's back to yelling.</p>

<p>Is continual reinforcement and reminders the best approach here? Is she too young to understand the concept at 5, and I should just relax? I feel like I'm constantly shooshing her, and it's not my intent to curtail what she's saying, but sometimes my frustration manifests itself as stopping her speech rather than adjusting her volume, so I'm hoping for a new approach.</p>

"Teaching and enforcing moderation when a kid is given too much junk food","<p>This is a consideration for <em>any</em> event or holiday at which kids are given an excessive amount of candy, sweets, or junk food. However, it's on my mind since Halloween is coming up, and the amount of candy they get is going to be <em>much</em> greater than other occasions.</p>

<p>In previous years, I've let the kids keep all their candy but rationed how much they can eat every day. I hate this for a lot of reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>It takes up a surprising amount of space in the pantry.</li>
<li>There are fights over which bag belongs to who, and the ""better"" candy mysteriously moves from one bag to another.</li>
<li>They take extra when I'm not in the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of learning self-control and reasonable portions, they learned to sneak.</p>

<p>Last year, their dentist had a ""buy back"" program, where they ""sold"" a pound of candy to the dentist for $1 (up to $5 per child), and got a toothbrush and some floss. What I found particularly funny was that I broke this took them weeks in advance, that I had a plan to get rid of the majority of their upcoming haul and they could have lots of candy Halloween night, but the next day we'd be trading it in. They didn't believe I would go through with it -- I pulled into the dentist's parking lot and my nine-year-old commented that I was really committed to this joke-- <em>until we were actually in the dentist's office and they were handed a few bucks</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the dentist's office isn't doing it this year.</p>

<p>I realize that every parent has their own definition of ""too much,"" so I am not concerned with knowing exactly how many candy bars your kids are allowed at any given time -- just what happens when you have to deal with quantities far greater than normal. What are some strategies to avoid having a giant stash of candy in the house for weeks? How do you encourage your children to enjoy treats in moderation when an external situation -- holiday, school party, indulgent relatives -- is creating an opportunity for excess?</p>

"How can parents improve a child's behavior outside their presence?","<p>This question is hard to word correctly without sounding like we're trying to avoid responsibility.  That's not the case.  The issue is that our children behave better for us than for their teachers.  You only have to think about how differently the exact same class behaves for a substitute teacher to show that discipline is highly dependent on the adult in the room <em>at the moment</em>, but obviously parents also have an effect.  My question is <em>how much</em> of a parental effect is reasonable to expect, and how can it be increased?</p>

<p>Some things we have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discussing respect and behavioral expectations before and after school.</li>
<li>Discussing peer pressure and how they should deal with it.</li>
<li>Attaching rewards and consequences at home to behavior at school.</li>
<li>Communicating what works for us at home to the teacher:  motivators, etc.</li>
<li>Trying to uncover environmental factors (are they too tired, hungry, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>What else can we try?  At what point do we just have to depend on the teacher to maintain discipline in her classroom?</p>

"How to get my sister to use correct spelling while typing on computer?","<p>I am sure that I am treading on eggshells here as this is a matter of opinion, but please do read on.</p>

<p>I absolutely resent when people use incorrect spelling for 90% of their words, on purpose. My younger sister, who is a teenager now, has been dragged into this strange world of ""text spelling"" / ""short spelling"" or whatever it is. </p>

<p>This is just one of her written sentences: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i do agree wid dis..coz evn i hav xperienced !! u will defnetly c d change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is probably acceptable when you're typing on your phone where it is inconvenient or if you're typing to save the words (texting) but she does this pretty much everywhere and I'd like her to get back to using her regular language. </p>

<p>When I had a quick chat about this with her, she thinks that it's ""cool"" to write like that, and that google+ / facebook is not an exam so she doesn't have to stick to a format of writing. I didn't want to argue about it because if I do, it would only worsen the situation and she'd probably avoid it when I'm around. Probably.</p>

<p>I think that this way of speaking could seriously harm your real language skills (English is not our first language, but we literally use it everywhere) I have friends who've gone on from, ""it's only messenger!"" to, ""Oh snap, I just mailed my potential employer with my chat language"" (I am not even making that up)</p>

<p>Instead of just telling her what to do, I'd like her to understand why she should avoid writing like that. How can I get her to stop writing this way?</p>

<p>ps: I tried looking up but no one seems to have an opinion on this matter.. may be I am taking it too seriously?!</p>

"Encouraging independence","<p>My seven year-old son is highly dependent on us to tell him what to do.  We had thought it was an age thing, but his little sister already grew out of it.  How can we help him be more independent?</p>

<p>An example from this morning.  This time of year in our area we often have highs in the 80s and lows in the 30s, so it's difficult to keep an even temperature and our house is often cold in the morning.  My son decided to dress himself in shorts and a thin T-shirt, and was huddled shivering in the common area when I came out of my room this morning.  We asked him, and he knew exactly what he needed to do to get warm, he just hadn't done it.</p>

<p>We expected these kinds of struggles for things parents want kids to do against their will.  I'm completely baffled when we have to tell him to do things he <em>wants</em> to do.  His five year-old sister handles those situations easily, and has for quite some time.  What can we do to help him?</p>

<p>What we already do, with relative consistency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Let him suffer the natural consequences.  This feels cruel in cases like him being cold, so we reserve it for consequences that don't cause physical suffering.  It works so slowly that it sometimes feels cruel in other cases too.  For example, it took him 5 months to remember to bring his birthday money when we went shopping.</li>
<li>Ask him questions that lead him to discover the solution for himself.  For example, this morning we asked, ""What should you wear if you're cold?""  He always knows the answer, which makes the questions feel like a slightly more tactful way of bossing him around.</li>

"Is my toddler becoming too concerned with health issues?","<p>My son, 2 years old, has recently started some behavior that is concerning me.</p>

<p>This morning he was upset (this isn't terribly uncommon for him in the morning, when both my wife and I are getting ready for work).  In between tears, and demands for milk and to be picked up, he told me he needed his temperature taken.</p>

<p>I took his temperature (we use a non-invasive <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00005UMZS"" rel=""nofollow"">temporal thermometer</a>), and it was perfectly normal.  He didn't even wait to see my reaction, though.  As soon as I ran it across his forehead, he walked away.</p>

<p>He's also been complaining about stomach aches which go away 30 seconds later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""My belly hurts.""</p>
  
  <p>""Where?""</p>
  
  <p>""Here."" (points to a spot on his belly)</p>
  
  <p>""Do you have to poop?""</p>
  
  <p>""No.""</p>
  
  <p>""Does it still hurt?""</p>
  
  <p>""No.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two things by themselves probably wouldn't concern me, but there's a family history that factors into this which is why I'm worried.</p>

<p>My wife's family is, in my opinion, somewhat obsessed about health issues.  </p>

<p>Illness and injury are perpetual topics.  Any indication of something out of the ordinary seems to result in my wife evaluating symptoms to determine if she should worry.  If he seems unusually cranky, she takes his temperature.  If he seems ""out of sorts"" (defined as any period lasting more than 5 minutes where he isn't smiling and wanting to play), she takes his temperature and asks if we should take him to the doctor.</p>

<p>When he was 6 months old, he was incorrectly diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis.  Our specialist warned us to watch for ""bulky, greasy stools"" as an indication that he might be having pancreatic enzyme issues.  This led to her obsessively monitoring his bowel movements, and asking for constant evaluations of ""does this poop look normal?""  I think that worry was understandable at the time (we tried to get a better description of what to look for, but the best we could get was that it may ""explode out the top of the diaper"").  </p>

<p>However, we verified over a year ago that he doesn't actually have CF, and our specialist agreed that he was merely a carrier.  He's had no symptoms, yet every time I change a diaper, she asks ""did he poop?  How did it look?"".</p>

<p>Granted, I tend towards the opposite extreme when it comes to medical issues.  I don't go to a doctor unless I'm <em>really</em> sick, and feel that I can't get better without a prescription.  I try to be less reluctant to go to a doctor with my son, but I still feel that a cold, for example, is not a reason to go to the doctor.   Yet I fear that my wife's worries about his health push me even further into the ""its not something to worry about"" spectrum.</p>

<p>So, my main concern is that my wife's worry about health issues is not something I want my son to pick up.  My wife's attitude towards health issues is a somewhat watered-down version of my mother-in-law's, and my two sister-in-laws, so I feel that this behavior does seem to be learned.</p>

<p>Is it normal for a 2-year-old to ask for his temperature to be taken when he's upset, or complain about phantom pains?  </p>

<p>How can I make sure that he doesn't grow up to worry too much (or too little) about his health?</p>

"3 year old tantrums in public","<p>Yesterday we (wife, 3 year old son, 6 year old daughter, me) were at a mall. After we stepped off the moving pavement my son decided that he wants to go another direction, and pulled his hand out of mine. I told him OK, but we'll go away, and stepped away from him about 5 meters. He stopped and started yelling: father, come here. I said him without loud voice that if he wanted to come with us, then come to me. But he didn't come to me, he sat down to the floor instead. </p>

<p>Me and my wife started a conversation while my son was sitting there. BTW he is very loud. (I had asked other parents about it previously and they said that it is true; I'm not making it up.) Anyway after a minute some woman wen't to him and started asking him about his father. I told her that he was yelling to me. That lady came to me and said that if I were in Canada - I'm Hungarian - some police man would punish me.</p>

<p>A minute after that two other lady joined her giving me advice what to do with my son. They told me the mall isn't the right place to educate my son.</p>

<p>For me it was a clear situation: my son wanted to go away from safety, after that he had the choice to rejoin us, but he choose tantrum instead. He was loud, he looked desperate, but I knew he wanted to be the boss. But in those ladies eyes I was a heartless father.</p>

<p>So my questions:<br>
1. If I am in public do I have to stop my son's tantrum at all cost, even if I lose that ""battle""?<br>
2. I didn't understand that Canada thing. Did she just make that up?</p>

"When to tell a child he didn't really win","<p>My five year-old son has started this phase of turning everything into a contest.  Partially this a result of our encouragement.  We will sometimes ""race"" him when he is dragging his feet and slowing down the family.  However, I think some of it is fueled by his friends at school, because he's started some unsportsmanlike behavior, like singing ""I beat you, I beat you, na na na na naaa naaa.""</p>

<p>We've been correcting his unsportsmanlike responses, but I'm wondering if we should be looking deeper.  In a lot of the cases, he only wins because one of us has helped him, or because he has two years more experience than his sister, but he doesn't recognize that.  For example, we ""beat"" my wife to church yesterday, but only because she helped all the kids, including him, get ready before she took care of herself.</p>

<p>So my question is, should we burst his bubble about his ""winning,"" or should we let him think he's won and just continue to teach him to be sportsmanlike about it?  We do make a point to praise him for wins due to his legitimate efforts, or even failures if he tried his best.</p>

<p>My question is related to <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/7393/644"">Should you let a toddler win?</a>, but different in that I'm not wondering whether to <em>let</em> him win, but to what degree we should point out when winning had little or nothing to do with his individual effort.</p>

"How do I calm a frustrated 6-year-old?","<p>When our 6-year-old daughter is trying something new and hard (homework, reading a hard word, video games, etc.) she can get into a cycle of frustration and anger that ends with her crying in a ball on the floor.</p>

<p>It starts with her making a mistake, and me correcting it. Normally she's successfully pushed through several hard points already or is tired going in. I've tried variations on ""stop"", ""no"", ""wait"", ""hang on"" and ""just a second"", but they all have the same result: a sharp burst of vocal frustration from her, followed by me realising where this is heading and trying to defuse it.</p>

<p>Along the way she may try and take the work somewhere I can't see, or try and complete it quickly even though it's incorrect. She'll complain about not understanding something, but not allow me to explain anything.</p>

<p>Things I've tried to stop the spiral:</p>

<ul>
<li>Suggesting taking a break</li>
<li>Pointing out that it's easy to rub it out and try again</li>
<li>Walking her through the problem from the start</li>
<li>Shouting back (?!)</li>
<li>Pointing out this always ends with her being upset and we should try to avoid that</li>
<li>Using a calming tone of voice</li>
<li>Suggesting I do it for her and she copies!</li>
<li>Noticing when she's tired and prone to frustration and trying to stop the exercise early (""I can do it!"") (maybe I can try more forcefully to do this? one time it ended with a similar tantrum)</li>

"How can I ask my parents to help us by watching the grandkids on occasion?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am a happily married mother of two, ages 3 and 4 respectively. My parents are in good health, mom is 62 and dad just turned 70. They have a good marriage and my mother lives in a house, which is one hour away from where I live, for most of the year. My father stays there, too (he occasionally travels there), esepcially for the whole summer.</p>

<p>I don't expect anyone to help raise my children or to be a secondary caregiver. My husband and I provide and pay for our babysitting. I have never asked my parents for money.</p>

<p>Even when there's been an emergency, they have not helped. For example, last summer, I was admitted via emergency in the hospital for three days and they never showed up to visit, asked who was taking me home or if my husband needed help. They never showed up or mailed a card when my 3-year-old broke his collar bone. Because of this, I don't even feel like I could ask either of them to watch the kids so I can go get a mammogram, PET scan or a haircut.</p>

<p>At this point, I feel that my parents are a source of irritation, not comfort. They feel entitled to our help when they think they need it and they don't reciprocate. I usually don't have the time to talk to them on the phone, but they don't understand that. Yet they often ask why it might take me a whole day to call back. They refuse to email, to text or to read texts. They've also asked me to bring the kids to visit more this summer, though I went at least once a week last summer. It's just too much this year with current circumstances but they don't want to be part of any solutions, unless the solutions exclude them making an effort. I wished I had any help from them or <strong>felt</strong> as though I could depend on them for help.</p>

<h2>What I tried so far</h2>

<p>I've asked them in the past ""why"" and I get the too tired or too busy excuse. But they are not too tired to travel 2 hours to go to a scrapbooking convention or visit a friend at the same times. </p>

<p>When I ask them what I could do to make things easier for them to be with us, they reply that they think everyone is doing their best and one day things will be easier for me. 
<br>
<sub>In contrast, my paternal grandmother, who was widowed and worked full time, was there for my parents, even taking us for whole weekends several times a year before she retired at age 75. Besides, my parents have raised us to be religious, teaching us that it is ungodly to ignore family needs.</sub></p>

<p>I've tried to explain to them how such would benefit <strong>them</strong>. I've tried reasoning that their help could free up time for me to help them, call them back sooner, or socialize with them more. I've even outright asked for it. Nothing has seemed to work.</p>

<h2>The straw that broke the camel's back</h2>

<p>My parents have been back for over a month and we've seen my mom once during this whole time. I'm overworked due to several events, like our children having been sick for two weeks etc. This month, no one offered to help or agreed to help when I asked. I cancelled us going to a family cookout in 2 days, because I'm simply overwhelmed and it sounds like more work to go at this point. I'm not doing it to punish anyone. It doesn't sound relaxing or fun to me and I told them so without anger. So, my parents are now boo-hooing. Their response shows they obviously value our involvement.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is there another way to get what I need from them, aside from what I've tried? I wonder if, by responding with ""no"" more frequently when they ask for non-essential involvement, they would start missing us and be more likely to drive up here and/or help when asked so we can <strong>stay</strong> involved. Or should I come out and boldly negotiate with them that unless we have more of their presence at our house, we won't be present at theirs? Or is there another way to nicely ask?</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p>The less I'm busy and the more I'm at home, the easier things feel on my end and this is a solution to me feeling less overwhelmed that doesn't involve my parents directly providing help. I personally don't really want to do any of these options or be <strong>that</strong> person, but nothing else has worked for me so far. I have a hard time not believing that there is another, nicer way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>I would <strong>love</strong> my parents to be present more frequently and to reciprocate help, when they are back in the state. We offer to help them and agree when asked because we want to.</p>

"15 mo old son becomes very fussy every evening when I come home from work","<p>​​​I'm a working mom of 15 month old baby. We are lucky to have our grandmas to help us babysit our child while me and my husband are at work.</p>

<p>Recently we had a grandma's swap, one grandmother left for 2 months, and we have another grandmother in our house instead. My son missed his first grandma a lot, she was with him since his birth, and that's the first time when she is not around him for such a long time. He didn't even want to accept his second grandma, was pushing her away and running around the house trying to find his favorite one.</p>

<p>Since that time he got extremely attached to me, would want just me to hold him, didn't want me to be too far from him. he started pushing away his dad if dad was trying to help me carry our son. I understand that it's a shock for a baby to loose a person he got used to, so I was trying to comfort him as much as I can, spend more time with him, hold him and hug. We moved his crib in our room, because there were times he would scream at night.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to get better in 2 weeks: when I'm not around he is quiet with his second grandma, he likes to play with her, eats well, everything good, though he still is very alarmed next to her and won't fall asleep if she is near.</p>

<p>But what started is: he will be pretty quiet the whole day with grandma, but when I come home he will gladly meet me and then he will start whining and fussing, will get very annoyed, won't let me eat or even wash my hands. He would cry while I'm holding him, and would cry even more if I put him down. Nothing works: distractions, another people entertaining him, just putting him on the floor and leaving him. He can cry for more than 30 min nonstop and then he can't stop at all.</p>

<p>I'm lost in guesses what it could be, is it me spoiling him with attention when he cries? Is it just an evening meltdown and if so why it didn't happen before? What do I do to stop it and help him?</p>

"What are reasonable expectations and reasonable ways to be supportive for an young adult with a sleep disorder?","<p>My 22 year old child has recently been diagnosed with a sleep disorder, namely, idiopathic hypersomnia.  What this means is that he sleeps for long periods of time (in my child's case, sometimes in excess of 16 hours at a time), often multiple times per day, and the sleep is largely not restorative or restful.</p>

<p>My child has had these symptoms grow in intensity over a year or two without remitting.  Now, I am in no position to challenge the diagnosis as I am not a doctor, but it seems to me that my child's problem is that he doesn't have any motivation to or doesn't want to be awake.  I've tried talking to him about this and he claims that his sleep issues are affecting his capacity to think (he was a straight A student up until his junior year of college) and that the sleep inertia he experiences stops him from wanting to do anything.  He has no real sleep schedule--it's a crap shoot whether he'll be up at a given time.  He has fallen asleep doing dangerous tasks like driving.  Due to his sleep issues, he has dropped out of college.  The fact that the skills he has that are employable require degrees and he has no such degree implies he has no real future for employment.  He currently lives at home with me and he does not have any source of income.  He does do small tasks around the house, such as fixing things that are broken and cooking and whatnot when he is awake.  I guess I'm just in denial about his sleep disorder.</p>

<p>My insurance is pretty poor for more exotic illnesses and whatnot so some of the treatments that have been prescribed for my son are not covered due to being classified as experimental or not indicated by the FDA for his specific illness.  Some of the prescriptions are very pricey and I can't afford to pay for them.  The few that he has been able to try have been absolutely ineffective for my son.  Outside of the ineffective or expensive medications, there's practically no treatments for people with my son's condition.  The condition itself is also not considered a disability by many, so he's unlikely to get protection from the ADA or to get concessions from any potential employers.</p>

<p>Before the sleep issues, he was set on graduating on time and with good grades, getting out of the house, and being able to support himself financially.  Now, he seems to be stuck here with no way out.  And not to sound like a bad parent, but I want him out of the house; I just don't want to kick him out in this condition.  However, the condition (according to his doctor), in most cases, does not go away or lessen in intensity at all.  It seems like he'll be here forever.</p>

<p>How can I accept that my son really has this illness and isn't feigning it to get a free ride?  How can I be reasonably supportive of my child while not allowing him to get too comfortable?  What things are reasonable for me to expect him to do around the house or towards getting a degree or a job for himself?</p>

<p>I'm not the best writer in the world, so if you would like more information or clarification, let me know and I'll gladly do so.</p>

<p>My mother (50 years old) keeps on telling me that *""Your cousin didn’t have problems with <em>that</em> then why are you having problems with the same thing/situation!""*<br>
*""<strong>I</strong> (Referring to herself) didn't have any problems with <em>that</em>, then why do you have the problems with the same thing/situation!""*</p>

<p>When your cousins don't have a problem going to their house to meet their parents, why do you have a problem to coming to your house to meet your parents!</p>

<p>No, she is not illiterate or step mother. She has two graduate degrees and one master's degree. She is a teacher too.</p>

<p>Example cases:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>During my honeymoon my parents kept on ringing me <em>many times per day</em> to ask whether I had eaten lunch, what I was doing, why didn't or did I go there etc.
When I returned back I told her that she didn't need to keep on constantly ringing me since I was on my honeymoon and wanted some peace alone.<br>
She replied, <em>""I had called your cousin too many times when she was on her honeymoon, she didn't any problems, then why are you having problems?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Now, I have told her that I'll be having a Ceserian delivery and therefore won't be comfortable much and in a presentable situation at that moment so I won't like other relatives to come to the hospital the very same day for seeing me. I requested her to tell them to come some other day. To which she again replied that <em>""I and your cousin didn't have any problems with relatives visiting in the hospital then why are you having problem?""</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Does she actually need to be told that I am NOT a clone of anyone in this world? Is her behavior normal?</strong> HUH! And after all this she keeps on wondering why I don't love her and welcome her in my house!</p>

"Should you secretly drill your children?","<p>A lot of situations we teach our children about come up all the time.  They get plenty of practice looking both ways before crossing the street, for example.  However, there are some situations that you hope never come up:  finding an unattended gun or medication, being solicited for personal information online, etc.</p>

<p>We roleplay these situations, but not very frequently.  It occurs to me that a secret drill might be the only way to really make sure they've internalized your teaching.  Sort of like a fire drill except they don't know it's a drill.</p>

<p>Should you secretly drill your children?  Why or why not?  If so, what's the best way to go about it?  How should you react if they ""fail""?  Is there a better way to test them without <strong>testing</strong> them?</p>

"Punishment for stealing?","<p>I'm in a situation where I'm really not sure what the best course of action is. Today I promised my younger sister that I would give her $100 if she worked up to running 3 miles. As proud as I was that she ran the distance, I was a bit disheartened that she was able to run it on the day I made the deal with her. I was expecting a few weeks of training with the hope of her building momentum towards exercising regularly. Reluctantly, I paid up.</p>

<p>Problem is, just a few moments ago, she was caught stealing makeup from a store. Not a huge deal it seemed at first, but she had about $600 worth and it was apparently far from the first time. She's likely stolen over $1000 worth of it over time.</p>

<p>Our father is deceased and our mother is too lenient, so the responsibility of disciplining this sort of thing often falls on me. So, I took back the $100.</p>

<p>My sister is, of course, in tears about the whole ordeal and accusing me of breaking my promises/going back on my word, etc. Our mother, unfortunately, decided to defend her position and argued that I was now untrustworthy and liar for taking back the money.</p>

<p>I'm trying to teach my sister the consequences of stealing by disciplining her for it. I don't think it's questionable whether this is necessary, but my concern is that there's some truth to their argument and that I'm breaking her trust in me.</p>

<p>My personal position is that this is, if anything, too lenient. Stealing, especially the amount she's stolen, is a very serious problem and by being passive, I believe I would be making it too easy for her to brush this off.</p>

<p><strong>Is taking the money back a fair punishment? Does it damage my relationship with her?</strong></p>

<p>Considering that the answers linked above say that we should not force the child to learn something, I am concerned about my 2 years 3 months old toddler.</p>

<p>Her playschool teacher had given her a colouring homework which my child coloured incompletely. The child coloured only the eyes of the ant, not her body.</p>

<p>I told the teacher today that the <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/22441/how-to-encourage-a-2-year-old-toddler-to-complete-colouring-a-sketch?lq=1"">child doesn't like colouring big areas</a> to this that teacher replied the child doesn't have any problems in colouring big areas in the  playschool <strong><em>since I hold her hand and make her colour that area and you should also do the same.</em></strong></p>

<p>From: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/a/22442/2221"">https://parenting.stackexchange.com/a/22442/2221</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that a toddler is way too young for mandatory homework, so the first thing is not to worry about getting it done or doing it ""right"". It turns something that should be a pleasure into a chore, and will guarantee that she won't want anything to do with art in later years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also told the teacher that I can draw the object myself at home and have her colour it. She didn't want that. She said that the rule is to color what has been told, though she agreed that she will draw smaller objects for homework in future.</p>

<p>Changing playschool is not an option for monetary reasons as well as I do not expect any different treatment in other schools in India. Education system here is not very great.</p>

"I don't know if I love my parents","<p>I'm 17 now, I was always close with my mother, there was an immediate bond and we got along great, similar personalities, sense of humour, etc. My dad on the other hand was an alcoholic, he will always be even though he's not a heavy drinker anymore. When I was little I didn't know what this was so I loved him, then my mother would start telling me and my older brother horrible things about my father. They don't love each other you see. She stayed with him so we would have a financially secure childhood.  </p>

<p>But she despises him, they can't be in the same room together without fighting, yes me and my brother have had enough money for some of life's little luxuries, but at what cost?<br>
My home is broken, my mother can tell you countless horrible things about anyone in our family, except me and my brother of course.   </p>

<p>I remember, when I was little how she would make me laugh, I can still hear my laugh as a little boy, it's contagious, but now, now it's different. She still makes me laugh but I don't feel quite so, happy.</p>

<p>This may be due to the stress due to exams or my not knowing what I want to do in the future but I also feel a lack of an emotional connection with her, I feel less remorse after an argument, I'm less interested in her stories, i want to say I love her dearly, but I'm not entirely certain what the love a child has for a parent feels like. And you can't exactly google that.
I read online that it may be the developmental schism, but I don't know if that happens to someone my age.</p>

<p>As I've gotten older I've seen more of my mothers flaws, things that as a child you would call mummy's magic powers or something, you'd put it down to how mothers are. But I wonder if it's just her?
There are different rules to her that the rest of us, she can say how something we do is perceived negatively but we can not by any means do the same. She can use attitude with us first but the second we do it back we did it first and it's a nightmare. Then there's after an argument where I've supposedly done something wrong she gives me something, sort of passive aggressively, like she'll argue with me and then come into my room with something small like a toothbrush(new) and say 'I got this for you today because I saw your old one was just about done', and I can hear the venom in her voice and its shocking, when I do something 'wrong' she never wants to talk to me about it first, she just gets angry and it feels like she doesn't listen.</p>

<p>I can't wait to move out, rule free is one reason, another is to want to see a therapist, I want to know what's up with my mind cause I dunno if it's normal, and I don't feel comfortable asking.</p>

<p>I don't feel comfortable telling my mother a lot.</p>

<p>She only discovered about my first 'girlfriend'(together for 5 months, not official, no sexual relations) when I was to emotionally destroy get to hide it, not for lack of trying though and the next week when I could hide it I did, I was only gonna tell her about them if we became official. And even then after a 'safe zone' of time cause a lot of relationships my mates have at my age end after 2 weeks.</p>

<p>I don't always trust her. I don't know if I love her, cause I'm not sure what that feels like.</p>

"TV shows for toddlers that don't teach bad gender and race dynamics","<p>My daughter is almost 1 and for various reasons outside the scope of this question, I like putting on TV shows that she'll watch on and off while she's playing. My current options are things available on Netflix and Youtube but I'm open to other subscription services as long as they're ad-free and reasonably priced.</p>

<p>Anyway, everything I've found so far is pretty disappointing from a gender and race standpoint, even PBS shows which I thought would be above average and designed with these sorts of issues in mind. Here are some examples from things I've found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Super Why: Despite there being 4 super readers, the white male is clearly the hero and the girls are more like sidekicks. There's only one person of color and she's even less of a main hero.</p></li>
<li><p>Barney: Not too bad on gender, aside from the central character and source of knowledge being male(ish). There's not really much of a power dynamic at all between the kids. Having the girl dinosaur be the baby who's always having to learn from others is a bit imbalanced, and there are certain activities like ""playing house"" that seem to be presented as ""girly"" (initiated by girls), but it's all pretty mild. Some of the ""diversity"" and ""sharing culture"" come across more as racial caricatures than egalitarian.</p></li>
<li><p>Sesame Street: Old classic episodes definitely reinforce gender role stereotypes. And there's a big gender imbalance in the characters (almost all male). I haven't really found enough episodes online yet to get a general feel though.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any good shows for kids my daughter's age that normalize girls being center-stage and assertive rather than deferring to the boys (and especially white ones) taking up all the space? I'm sure she'll get shown the latter plenty in real life if/when she goes to day care or preschool and later in school, but when that happens I hope it will come across as abnormal and objectionable rather than just a reinforcement of what she's seen on TV up to then.</p>

"Is it okay to let a baby cry at bedtime?","<p>My 4-month-old has a set bedtime routine and will generally go happily to sleep - but occasionally (for no particular reason) he'll work himself up into a fit and cry for long periods of time, refusing to go to sleep. He can keep it up for quite a while. </p>

<p>My husband believes that we should just let him cry it out. I feel that you can't let such a small baby cry indefinitely without at least coming into the room periodically, although when he asks for a reason I find it hard to put my finger on why. I generally go into the room every few minutes, stand there for half a minute, and then leave, without talking or touching him - just as a sort of ""I'm here"" statement. Of course, when I do this he cries harder. (I think it makes him calm down faster in the long run, but my husband doesn't agree and I can't prove it :) ) </p>

<p>Is it okay to just let a 4-month-old (or even an older baby) cry? Why or why not? Is it something terrible, like I seem to think, or does it make no lasting difference to the baby (besides teaching him to sleep :) ), like my husband claims?</p>

"Should a parent delete a teen's social media account if it was handled badly?","<p>My 15 year old daughter has created accounts with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblr and Wattpad, all without my knowledge, six months ago or more. After discovering her using a laptop in bed at 4am, and probing into the browser history, I found the following worrying issues (below) out last week. <strong>I am currently thinking that it is appropriate to delete the accounts, and that is my question to this community - is it the right action?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Foul Language</strong>: The comments/posts in all those social media accounts included strong profanity that disgusts me; she does not talk like that at home. It is way harsher than necessary. I appreciate we all swore as teens, to our friends, and kept a clean mouth at home, but this is too much. It is my job as a parent to tell her off about this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure to Protect Identity</strong>: My daughter has used her real name in one account, a nickname in another, and revealed her age in some places. In her profile she links each account to her Facebook and/or Twitter account, so anyone can hop from one to the other and make the connection between these disparate bits of info. 
When talking about her school in comments, she doesn't give the name, but gives away far too much other information (school religion, current musical performance, name of courses she takes).
She has failed to take the standard precautions that I know the school have warned her about. Already, one group of her 'real life' friends have discovered something she was trying to keep very secret, because of this online carelessness.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Talking to Strangers</strong>: These accounts have 'followers' or 'friends' who she does not know in real life. Most of the interactions were inane (I've now been through all the inboxes) but some contained advice about serious issues to do with growing up, from people who were adults she didnt know.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sleep</strong>: She has been using these accounts between 1am and 6am when she is supposed to be asleep. No wonder she struggles to get out of bed, and struggles to concentrate at school. This has been going on for several months if not a year.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So...</p>

<p>We warned her about most of this when first given a phone and a laptop. She knew we wanted to look through the records at any time (but we never felt the need, until this 4am revelation). The school teaches kids how to avoid cyber-stalking etc. <strong>She has not acted responsibly at all.</strong></p>

<p>I've explained some of this already (calmly) but there is more to go, and I need to decide on a suitable punishment, so she learns from this. A stern talk cannot be followed by handing the laptop straight back to her. I've already confiscated it until further notice.</p>

<p><strong>I think that these accounts should be deleted.</strong> Not to meanly ""teach her a lesson"", but because their content endangers her, or creates a large risk. She could start again next year - when we think she has matured - and build a more cautious online presence, keeping some bits anonymous if desired, doing it all safely.</p>

<p>However, I can imagine how this would have felt to me at 15. It would have been a massive loss: people I'd struggle to locate again, words I'd written which I thought were clever or profound, links to thinks I'd want to keep. Maybe it is not the right thing to do.</p>

<p><strong>EDITS TO ANSWER POINTS RAISED:</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>I did not talk to her about permission to create accounts, but I did talk about safety online and social media pitfalls.  </li>
<li>Keeping her activities in secret (to me) suggests she knew we would not approve.  </li>
<li>Yes, she can create a new account... but by then I will have hammered home the right way to do it. (Which she may ignore!)  </li>
<li>Yes, she lied. This is a biggie.  </li>
<li>I have now set the router to disallow internet access when people should be sleeping.  </li>
<li>Does she need more privacy? She has proved she wasn't ready for it.   </li>
<li>I am not merely worried about online predators. It is far more likely she will blow all her secrets to school enemies, and be miserable. I doubt she can see far enough ahead to think about potential employers looking at her nonsense.  </li>
<li>She just didn't THINK enough. And whilst all teens do that (and the neuroscience backs it up) it still isn't acceptable for parents to say ""never mind darling, you havent developed your frontal cortex properly yet"". </li>

"Why do kids pick up on violence in cartoons/movies?","<p><strong>Why is it that children seem to pick up and mimic even the tiniest examples violence on TV?</strong> </p>

<p>It's like a golden beacon of what not to do and they seem to be just magnetized towards it.</p>

<p>Let me try to give an example. </p>

<p>I know a younger child in the 4-6 age range. They watched Wreck it Ralph and immediately started bopping everything and everyone he can with anything he can and repeating ""I'm wrecking you."" Why is this the take away from the movie? There are plenty of other activities going on but the kid chooses the hitting other people activity.</p>

<p>A friend of the family (this was a couple of years ago) had issues with older boys maybe 8 and 11 ish in age. The dad likes to watch pro wrestling (like WWE) and at EVERY opportunity those boys would be body slamming each other and any other kid they could. And I mean these were some heavier boys who were slamming all sized of kids by leaping off the couch at full speed. No amount of explaining that wrestling on TV is an act, that these are trained professionals or do it again and you're grounded would make them stop. They finally had to stop watching wrestling all together, it was really a big issue; which is odd to me because I thought at that age they could reasoned with.</p>

<p>I can't even tell you how many times I've been ""Hi ya""ed or karate chopped by kids mimicking ninja turtles / super heroes, not to mention how many times I've been pretend-shot by kids pretending to have a gun.</p>

<p>Why is violent play so attractive to young children? I know the wrestling example is kind of a ""well dua they see it on TV"" moment but why couldn't a 10 year old grasp the concept of falling on and hurting someone smaller? And what about the 4 year old that suddenly starts hitting everything with a pretend mallet? </p>

<p>Before being around kids, most of this TV/media didn't even strike me as violent and now I see kids pick up on these things in shows that I would have never thought about censoring before.</p>

"Challenges of being a step-father","<p>Background:</p>

<p>Almost 6 months ago I met a great woman and she has a son, who just recently turned 7. His biological father is out of the picture, and essentially has been for his whole life.</p>

<p>I am 24 and I have no experience with children, other than having been one once.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that our relationship right now is long-distance and I visit them every third weekend.</p>

<p>Question:
I seem to have a number of challenges arising from my lack of ""knowing"" him, as well as what I'm guessing comes from his expectations on how he'd like to interact with me.</p>

<p>1) Rough Play - I'm not a very strong or physical person, but he seems to like to play-wrestle and I am considerably larger than him. It makes me nervous that I will accidentally hurt him, especially since the playing seems to escalate until basically I tell him to stop. At this point he doesn't stop, and then he gets in trouble for what we were just doing 5 minutes ago. Should I even play this way with him or how do I de-escalate the playing?</p>

<p>2) Attention, possibly jealousy? - Last time I visited I spent nearly the entire weekend playing with him (legos, dinosaurs, etc). Then I try spending one hour with his mom and he can't leave us alone. He doesn't like it when we spend time together without him. One example (which was amusing at the time), is when I'm playing with him, his mother may call for me - to do something or another. He tells me to wait there and goes and does what his mom wanted me to do. I think he believes I'll do whatever she wanted and then I won't come back. <em>Admittedly, it may take me an extra minute so I can give her a smooch, but not more than a minute</em>. At this point it isn't really a problem, but i get the feeling he's developing an expectation that I should spend all my time with him. I've watched some of his movies with him, and occasionally it shows the ""perfect dad"" (to a kid) and he does everything the kid wants. I'm worried his expectations may come from this.</p>

<p>I'm also wondering if there are other things I'm not even aware of that I should be looking out for, since I am becoming a part of his life and I have no prior experience with children.  In particular, things to be aware of since I am coming into his life now (as opposed to when he was born). Any advice is appreciated.</p>

"How do you childproof electrical cords?","<p>I let my 6-month-old roll around on the living room floor.

She doesn't have teeth yet, so I have a little time to figure this one out before it gets <em>really</em> dangerous.</p>

<p>Also, how bad of an idea would it be to get her a toy of some sort that looks like wires? I can't tell if that sort of toy would be a good distraction from the real wires, or an encouragement to play with wires in general. </p>

"Should imaginary friends be accepted or discouraged?","<p>As a professional working with families, I am often asked about imaginary friends. I never experienced this behavior with my own son so I have little personal information to share. </p>

<p>One child required that a place be made for the ""friend"" at mealtimes complete with chair and food. She scolded people for sitting in her friend's chair or sitting in her place in the car. This lasted for several years. She is now a middle age lady who can tell you the names and description of her friends. </p>

<p>This lady has struggled with relationships and inappropriate behavior over the years. I am wondering if there is any relationship between her imaginative friends and her lifelong behavior. </p>

<p>Should parents ""adopt"" their children's imaginary friends or discourage their presence? If they should be discouraged, what strategies are helpful?</p>

"Too many languages?","<p>I am actually a language researcher, but when it comes to my own situation I have a hard time being objective and make some choices for my own family. 
My husband and I are expecting our first child, and I am really confused as to which languages we should speak and when.</p>

<p>I was raised in Denmark, but have Iraqi-Kurdish roots, and my husband was also born and raised here but has Turkish roots. Thus, my native language, and the language I learned first, was Kurdish, and I do speak it with my parents and the rest of my family. However, I am more proficient in Danish. 
I know a little bit of Turkish, but only speak Danish with my husband.</p>

<p>So my question is, would my child be confused if I spoke Kurdish with it and Danish to my husband, and my husband spoke Turkish to the child? Also, if I know myself well, I would probably speak Danish to the child outside our home, since Kurdish is not valued in the Danish society - I know that´s a bad excuse.
What are your suggestions?</p>

"Is my son's school ignoring his intelligence?","<p>I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask and I suppose this is going to be an outlet for my frustration, but I could also do with some advice from people that may have been in the same situation</p>

<p>My son is 4 years old and has always been a quick learner - he was walking and saying words a few months old and now at 4 years old he's a lot further ahead than some other children of his age. He is not a genius, but he's certainly  very gifted when it comes to learning through observation and retaining knowledge.</p>

<p>He's just started primary school after attending nursery at that very school for a year. At the end of the nursery year the workers praised his speech, knowledge, behaviour and reliability and said that he was hitting targets that they would expect at the end of his 1st year.</p>

<p>Now that he's moved into 1st year, his new teacher has started giving him books with no words (where he must describe what's happening in the pictures) and is saying that he must learn phonetics by the end of the school year (we are only a few weeks in at the moment). They are also teaching them how to write letters and numbers and how to count...</p>

<p>This would be great were it not for this tiny detail.</p>

<p><strong>My son can read, write and count already and has been doing so for over a year and a half.</strong></p>

<p>Now let me just clarify:</p>

<p>He is not completely fluent with more difficult words and has to take a moment to absorb them (e.g. Roald Dahl books he can struggle with but kids books he hasn't much of a problem with)</p>

<p>His writing is not perfect, he does need to work on it. The letters are all well formed and correctly oriented but they don't always sit on the line and he occasionally starts letters from the bottom rather than the top.</p>

<p>However, he is definitely much further ahead than some of the other children and often complains that he's bored at school or that school is ""too long"". We all know that days drag when you are bored and fly when you are occupied, so I can only conclude that he is not being challenged.</p>

<p>They want him to learn around 30 phonetic sounds and also learn some other ""tricky"" words such as ""to"", ""the"" by the end of the school year. He can read these words with no problem and he can also spell them (and much more difficult ones) using <em>letters</em> - not sounds.</p>

<p>We've been in numerous times to argue the point that he needs more challenging 
work, to which we are always given the same answer ""he is being challenged"".</p>

<p>I don't agree - he tells me they are learning to write numbers at the moment. He's been doing that for more than a year (and they are all formed correctly with the correct orientation)</p>

<p>The teacher also let slip at parents evening that they ask my son to help the other children when he's finished his work...</p>

<p>Last time I checked he wasn't getting paid a part time teaching assistants wage, I'd rather they gave him additional work...</p>

<p>(interestingly the teacher denied making that statement the next time we met - categorically denied it yet both myself and my wife were present)</p>

<p>My wife made a point that I disagreed with. She was of the opinion that it's the schools duty to push and challenge my child. I'm of the opinion that it's quite the opposite: they don't really care about individuals - as long as they can show that X number of children achieved a certain standard their job is done, if that means leaving the bright ones to their own thing whilst the others catch up, then so be it. </p>

<p>i.e. It's completely up to the teacher to have the passion and drive to deliver what my child requires at school above and beyond what the government require.</p>

<p>Are the school taking me for a ride? Does the teacher really just not care?</p>

<p>I'd love to know if anyone else is experiencing the same problem and how they are dealing with/have dealt with it in the past.</p>

"Can I use an hourglass to make my kid eat faster?","<p>TL;DR version:<br>
My daughter eats quite slowly. Can I use an hourglass to teach her to eat faster? When this time is out, I take her plate away even if it's not finished.</p>

<hr>

<p>Longer version:<br>
My daughter is 4 years old and eats quite slowly. Nothing serious, she's just not very fast (unless it's lasagna or spaghetti). She eats lunch at school every day.</p>

<p>This night she woke up crying, and we (her parents) asked her a few questions to understand what was wrong. She told us it was the school. According to her answers, everything at school seemed fine (teacher is great, she has friends, etc.) except one of the ladies that supervises the lunch time (the other one is fine).</p>

<p>More precisely, she told us that ""she turns the hourglass"" (the other lady does not) and it makes her anxious. It turns out that the kids have a limited time to eat and their plate is taken away when the time is out.</p>

<p>One day, my daughter had to go to the bathroom during lunch time, the hourglass still running. She could not finish her meal.</p>

<p>My wife and I are quite upset about this. First of all, we pay for the meals and we find it unacceptable that the kids don't have time to finish it and it is thrown away. But, more importantly, we feel that this way of doing things is very wrong without knowing exactly why and we'd like to have your insights on this. If this really was not a problem, why would she tell us, let alone waking up crying at night for this?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<hr>

<p>Additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li>My daughter enjoys school very much, her teacher is great and she has a lot of friends. She wants to go every morning and she would like to stay more when we get her back at the end of the day.</li>
<li>Apart from not eating very fast, she has no problem eating. She likes almost everything, she eats vegetables and meat easily, etc. She almost always finishes her plate.</li>
<li>She rarely wakes up during the night, we could say she a heavy sleeper.</li>
<li>She's used to eat with friends. Between the age of 6 months to 2.5 years she was at a caregiver, then at school since she's 2.5 (she's now 4 years and 3 months old)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT (after I spoke with the teacher)</strong></p>

<p>This morning I spoke with my daughter's teacher and she explained to me how the hourglass is used.</p>

<p>In the room where the kids eat, there's a sonometer. When the kids are too noisy, it beeps and the supervisor turns the hourglass. During 3 minutes, everyone must be completely silent.</p>

<p>This technique has been put in place after a training that the teachers had and they think it is effective. They tried the same with a one minute period of silence and it didn't work (the noise came back immediately once the minute was up).</p>

  <li>Stop all reminders about using the toilet.  </li>
  <li>Give incentives for using the toilet.  </li>
  <li>Give stars for using the toilet.  </li>
  <li>Make the potty chair convenient.</li>
  <li>Diapers, Pull-ups, or underwear? (use underwear).  </li>
  <li>Remind your child to change his clothes if he wets or soils himself.  </li>
  <li>Don't punish or criticize your child for accidents.  </li>
  <li>Ask the preschool or day care staff to use the same strategy.  </li>

"My toddler used to love bath time and now he hates it (or is scared of it)","<p>My toddler seemingly has developed some fear to bath time.</p>

<p>My toddler (16 moths) used to love bath time. He would be smiling when I carried him naked to the bath and loved to play with his bath toys. Once or twice he had an unpleasant situation with soap on his eyes but apart from that, bathing him was enjoyable for him and easy for us.</p>

<p>He gets a short bath every other day. Around a week ago, at bath time, he started crying while sitting in the bathtub. We thought that maybe his bum was hurting (it looked a little bit red). We took him out, dried him and put the diaper with some <em>butt paste</em>. Two days later, he started crying as soon as his feet touched the water, and didn't event want to sit an play in the tub. We took him out, but a couple minutes later I put one of his favorite toys on the far end of the bathtub and he didn't mind being put in the tub and helped to reach the toy. He did not seem afraid of the water, just didn't seem in the mood for a bath (which was weird for us after the previous episode, specially since he always seemed to love bath time).</p>

<p>Tonight, after stripping him I held him to take him to the bath and he started crying when he understood where he was going. He was crying a lot and hanged really tight to me, never letting go. He got more upset as he got closer to the bath tub. He never made it to the bath and it took him a while to get calmer. He is not that upset when he falls or the like. Just being taken close to the tub seemed a very upsetting experience. If it wasn't because a week ago he <strong>loved</strong> bath time I would have said he was scared of it.</p>

<p>I don't know if he is going through something developmental at this stage that specifically makes him hate the bath now. He has not had scary or unpleasant experiences in the bathtub before (expect for the mentioned soap in the eyes).</p>

<p>Could it be that he is afraid of bath time now? If so, how do I help him to overcome this fear?</p>

"How do we teach our toddler that it's okay to go on the potty?","<p>My son has been potty-training for about a month or so, with pretty good results.  It started with a few days of wearing underwear instead of a diaper, and having accidents, since he didn't know how to go on the toilet, even though he was pretty good at holding it in.</p>

<p>The big breakthrough came when he learned how to go on the toilet, and since then he's been pretty good, with accidents now and then.</p>

<p>One of the first things he learned was to ""stay dry"" &mdash; in other words, no poop or pee in his pants.</p>

<p>However, this has led to an interesting dilemma for him &mdash; he thinks he can ""stay dry"" forever to avoid ever pooping or peeing.  Lately, he has been expressing just how much he hates pooping and peeing.  He will tell us he ""has wees"" and then run to the toilet, but when he gets there, he changes his mind and gets very upset - saying ""No wees! Stay dry!"" (He wants to try to stay dry and not ever do wees again.)</p>

<p><strong>How do we teach him that staying dry is important, but that he <em>has</em> to go when he feels the urge and that's ok?</strong>  This has led to a couple accidents, because he believes that he can stay dry, but then leaves it too long.</p>

<p>He usually does tell us when he gets the first urge, but then when he changes his mind, we don't like having to fight to force him to sit on the toilet at that moment (though, when we have, once he is on the toilet he will go just fine - it's just the anxiety of expectations that seem to be getting to him).  I feel like a fight to sit on the toilet is a bad thing to associate with something he should be willing to do.</p>

"Encopresis, I'm at my wits end? Does anybody have suggestions?","<p>My 12 year old daughter has been dealing with retentive encopresis since age 6. She avoids going to the toilet at all. This results in soiling and the production of an amazing huge toilet-clogging log-like object every week. We have been trying for years to get her to talk about this, but when we do talk about this, the response is ALWAYS ""I don't know"" despite what her pedi, GI doc and psychologist tried to do or suggested we do to get her to talk about it. We switched psychologists last year after a year of not talking about this, no luck.</p>

<p>We have tried so many treatment plans since diagnosis, specifically tailored to her, such as enemas, scheduled toilet sittings, rewards, consequences, psychologist, etc. she just keeps holding it in. Right before summer, her pedi and the GI doc laid out a clear treatment plan of laxatives, regular bathroom visits, and a rewards program. She did take the Miralax (2 table spoons) but she just kept holding it in and soiling her pants. She avoided going to the toilet. I made her stay at the toilet and told her ""if you poop, I will buy you XYZ"" (something she REALLY wants)"" you can do XYZ only after you poop"" and not letting her do things ""you can't do XYZ until you poop"" and XYZ would be something she LOVES to do. I wouldn't let her leave the toilet until she pooped, so she sat there for hours, no luck. When school started, she refuses to take the Miralax.</p>

<p>Now we laid out a new treatment plan. We TRIED to involve her, the response is again ""I don't know."" She is supposed to take an enema every morning and sit on the toilet, but she fights daily about taking it. When she does take it, she holds it in and won't sit on the toilet. There is also a diet plan she refuses to follow. She is not supposed to drink dairy, but drinks milk at school. Now the past 2 weeks she refused all treatment which we fight daily about. She refuses to sit on the toilet, no matter what we try. 2 years ago we tried ucanpooptoo, didn't help.</p>

<p>We asked her why she holds it in. Does pooping hurt? Does it scare you to poop? Does it feel good to hold it in? The answer is always ""I don't know"" and you can question her for hours and hear ""I don't know"". We explained to her digestion and she knows why she needs to poop. We ruled out any physiological reasons for retention. Luckily her friends don't notice, but one day her friends might smell her soiling, and I talked to her about this, how it would affect, boys , high school, etc. Her response was ""I don't know"" and she would not talk about this.</p>

"Baby takes so long to wind, is there a solution?","<p>Our baby was born prematurely and had to be bottle fed.  The nurses joked that she was a '<em>windy baby</em>' when she was being nursed.  Now she's home and nearly six weeks old, she's devouring ample amounts of breast milk via a bottle.</p>

<p>The problem is that she can take up to <strong>two hours</strong> to burp after a feed.  Sometimes I fear this takes so long she actually starts getting hungry again.  During the night this is reducing our sanity.  All our friends say that their babies burp within a few minutes after feeding.</p>

<p>Can anyone offer any help?  We've replaced the cheap supermarket bottles that were recommended for premature baby, with Phillips Avent, and now with Tommy Tippee <a href=""http://direct.asda.com/tommee-tippee-closer-to-nature-Easivent-Bottle-260ml-x3/002653478,default,pd.html?dual=0"" rel=""nofollow"">anti-colic varieties</a> with a medium-flow teat.  We've also tried Infacol (which made her worse!) and now Dentinox, but we're still not much better off.</p>

<p>She's growing fine, so maybe I shouldn't worry and just deal with it?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I can't believe I only asked this 8 days ago, it feels like a lot longer!  </p>

<p>Anyway, the difference in that time has been amazing.  She's winding loads better (between 5 and 45 minutes) and seems a lot calmer after feeding.  Tommy Tippee was the bottle that made a difference, although I think it was more due to a phase of growth and stomach development :-)
Anyway, I had 6.5 hours sleep last night and feel like a new person :-)</p>

"Are bribery/threats effective and are there alternatives?","<blockquote>
  <p>Don't bribe her <em>(chantage / faire chanter)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>said my sister while I was talking to my almost 3-year-old daughter.</p>

<p>It's bad, but what are the alternatives?</p>

<p>I read that threatening and bribing reinforce a kind of Pavlovian reaction between some situations and their consequences (e.g. quiet => candy, bad action => punishment, etc.), and worse, can give rise to culpability (e.g. a child could make himself believe his parents wouldn't have separated if he had been well-behaved).</p>

<p>On the other hand, a suggested alternative I read, when discussion doesn't work, is to make a rule (the child must obey), which doesn't seem to me like an improvement.</p>

<p>Where does one draw the line when threatening, bribing or rewarding? Are they to be avoided at all costs? What are efficient alternatives to threatening/bribing when the child cannot be convinced and/or there is a hurry?</p>

<p>NB: I can see at least three levels of threatening (level 1) and bribing (levels 2 and 3), but there are probably more:</p>

<ol>
<li>""if … then I call Big Bad Wolf"", phone in hand (found it mentioned in comments of <a href=""http://www.lexpress.fr/education/le-chantage-est-une-arme-affreuse-que-je-n-utilise-pas-avec-mes-enfants_1213213.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an article</a>…) ;</li>
<li>""if you do <em>x</em>, then [reward]"" (the child being asked to do something but not asking for a reward.)</li>
<li>""[I let you do something or we'll go somewhere] if you do <em>x</em> (the child already asking to do something or go somewhere.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Forget about the first category, which seems terrible, and let's focus on 2 and 3. Can threatening and bribing be considered <em>blackmailing</em>?</p>

<p><em>My wife and I babysat 4 children and the parents made it sound like a) there was a schedule and b) if there were difficulties to just say something like 'are you listening', 'are you being respectful', etc. Trying to follow the schedule did not work and the phrases did not work, one child continuously wanted to be not in her room because it was uncomfortable, but didn't have any answer on what would make her comfortable. Our approach was to attempt to block her in her room with our body or the door, but that involved staying there.

"What to do with a first grader who cannot sit still in school?","<p>A first grader (7 1/2 years old) has trouble sitting still.  Often, he stands up when everyone else is sitting, squirms around, but is not verbally disruptive.  At home, he similarly has little patience for sitting still during dinner, standing up frequently, but not always.</p>

<p>In other settings, he has a long attention span, such as when putting together a lego toy or the like.  He can read books (or play video gamesor watch videos) for long periods of time.   He always sits for breakfast.</p>

"Handling husband’s 15-year-old daughter with Reactive Attachment Disorder","<p>Two years ago, I met my husband. We are both in our 30s. He’s been married before. I have not been. He has a teen daughter from a relationship he had in college. The mother of the girl abandoned the girl and him under rather still-confusing to me circumstances when the girl was 2. The girl has not seen or had her mother in her life since then.</p>

<p>He then fluctuated through a bevy of relationships until 2008, when he met his now-ex-wife. The ex-wife and her parents effectively adopted the girl (legally wasn’t possible for various inter-state laws). The new family had the means and interest to have the girl diagnosed with ADHD and RAD. My husband’s marriage with his ex-wife collapsed due to, predominantly, her infidelity. Once separated, the girl came to split time between her dad and her step-grandmother (and no, not her stepmother). </p>

<p>Fast-forward 3 years since his divorce — he meets me. I am a survivor of rather extreme abuse. Otherwise—well-adjusted, eccentric, children-loving educator. Almost one year into our relationship, I met his daughter. She seemed enchanting but I knew very well of her problems — deliberate urination (not caused by neuro or physical problems), refusal to comply with norms, and an aloof persona with most anyone. But she was enchanting with me when we met. </p>

<p>Approximately 6 months after we met, I moved in with them — him and his daughter. Very quickly, I discovered the relationship between them was toxic — constant fighting, yelling, arguing over simplest things (like getting her to pick up anything after herself). I established a rule of no yelling and yes to picking up and being civil.</p>

<p>Initially, the girl mixed compliance with horrific bouts of anger outbursts at me — she would snarl or yell or cry tempestously when asked to do basic things. Keep in mind, I never yelled or raised my voice with her. In between the tempests, she did improve dramatically and showed me quite a bit of affection — that is, in between the bouts of drama.</p>

<p>My husband, with my insistence, toned down his own proclivity for anger and a lot of surprising peace was established. </p>

<p>To get closer to my question — in all the time that I was doing what I did, I was not declared or recognized or defined as <em>anything</em> in the house beyond a “fiancée” and, later, “wife.” That is, no one — including the girl’s therapist — specified my role in the household. I never gave it much thought either but, in practice, behaved maternally. </p>

<p>About a month ago, the tempests from the girl resumed, and, during one, she told me she doesn’t want me to be her mother or to behave like one or to do any of the things I have done so far in the home, such as requesting chores of the girl and such. </p>

<p>I was stunned. Hurt. And I stopped. Since then, things between me and my husband’s daughter have rapidly deteriorated. She has become more rude and dismissive of me — almost as much as when I first moved in. Ironically, she hasn’t lapsed back into toxicity with her father. </p>

<p>What do I do? </p>

<p>Btw., for anyone curious, my husband’s ex-wife does not have any active role in the girl’s life. She <strong>does</strong> get referred by the girl as “mom.”</p>

<p>Does anyone have ideas on how to be a second maternal presence to a RAD teen?</p>

"Why does my daughter spin around for fun?","<p>My 20 months old daughter is in very good shape and is growing very well.</p>

<p>She has discovered how to play the music sound system and we are listening to the same record over and over again. In the course of these moments, sometimes she starts enjoying it very much to the point of laughing, running around the living room and, eventually, spinning around.</p>

<p>This last thing is the one that impresses me the most: how come spinning around is this enjoyable for her? I have talked with other fellow parents and they also recognize this behaviour.</p>

<p>To make my point clear, by spinning around I mean her rotating around her axis many, many times (say ten or so). Then, she tries to walk normally and the effect of the rotation makes her wobble, walk strangely and sometimes even fall down. To her fun, of course, because she laughs while doing it.</p>

<p>Her spinning also includes us, the parents, from time to time: she will grab our hand and start running around us, so we also do rotate. To me this is hard because I get sick after the second turn, so I just stop myself.</p>

"Difficulties in Raising Religious Children With Non Religious Fiance","<p>Background: I was raised in an intellectual Catholic household where religion quietly infused everything we did. At the time it seemed totally normal but as I have grown up, I realized that my siblings and I had a a very good childhood.

"How to deal with children going to friend's houses to bypass rules","<p>In our house, as with most households I assume, there are lots of rules that we decided on, which might not be agreed upon by other families. Our son is 9 at the moment.</p>

<p>For example, to prevent video game addiction, our son is not allowed to play when it's sunny outside. Without going into details as to how we came to this arbitrary rule, it's basically because we want to promote playing outside, but there is really very little to do Inside of our house so disallowing it on rainy days felt unfair.</p>

<p>Another rule we have is that treats should be eaten for dessert. We allow eating between meals only if it's a healthy snack, like fruits or vegetables. Ice cream, for example, is only to be eaten at the end of a meal.</p>

<p>Unlike in <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/questions/7493/how-to-handle-different-rules-about-video-games-at-friends-house"">this question</a>, our son never displayed a problem with that. He usually abides by our rules without complaining. But of course, many of his friends have different rules.</p>

<p>What we have noticed is progressively happening is that our son is going more and more at his friend's houses, especially in summer, and they are coming less and less here. They don't spent more time together overall, but this time is starting to be almost entirely spent at their places.</p>

<p>Of course, I can't decide what happens in another house, and my wife and I agree that trying to tie strings to our son will only result in him lying. We can't possibly check on him, and we can't control the other parents, so either he's allowed to eat sweets and play video games at their friend's places, or he's not allowed but will keep doing it behind our back.</p>

<p>The obvious reason why this is happening is that our son wants to do thèses things, therefore he tries to spent as much time as possible in households where this is allowed. That's totally logical from his perspective, he found a loophole and is using it. If I could temporarily move to a country with much lower taxes for 2 weeks when it's taxes season to save much money, I'd certainly do it too.</p>

<p>But another possibility is that the friends themselves find our house ""boring"", and are pressuring our son to play at theirs, where the fun is.</p>

<p>So my question is vague, mostly because we are constantly second-guessing ourselves with our first kid. What are we supposed to do?</p>

<p>Specifically, should we loosen our own rules at the expenses of what we believe is good for him? Is there a variation that wouldn't have negative conséquences that we could put in place (Ex: ""You can do these things only when there are guests"" would certainly increase the frequency of guests).</p>

<p>We, obviously, do not want to alienate his friends and isolate him, but changing our rules because another family did so seems particularly unfair, as if they were raising our children.</p>

<p>We are open to any and all suggestions, and will try to answer any question raised in the comments without compromising privacy.</p>

<p>When I'm around, I try to respond to statements like the above by asking for more specifics, by talking about my own experience of rejection in school, and saying to my daughter that while she might believe she is dumb or inferior, I don't, and as I've taught her many things I know that can't be true, etc.  But often I feel like I'm going about this wrongly, as she'll just switch off or change the subject.  Sometimes I feel like I get through, especially when I can manage to have a conversation (I try to avoid lectures).  The problem is that I'm not around all the time so I'm not there when these things strike her.  Talking about this face to face itself is difficult and in a phone / video call, which my daughter anyway does not like, it is impossible.  So what can I do to contribute to solving this?</p>

<p>Some more elements of the context are important.  I've posted a number of questions here so my messy situation may be recognisable. My wife has what I think I can best sum up as mild narcissistic tendencies.  She was also emotionally abusive towards me for much of our marriage, until very recently, when I stopped staying with her during the times I visit.  Her abusive behaviour has improved since (we may save our marriage), as well as her aggression with the kids, but with our daughter she still will:</p>

<ul>
<li>React at times to our daughter's tears at rejection / bullying with ""What is there to cry about?""</li>
<li>Harshly rebuke our daughter in front of others for small mistakes like dropping something or being absent minded, including at times using mild force, like squeezing her arm painfully</li>
<li>Internally compare our daughter to some friends of hers in a way that implies the others are superior because they are confident and ""strong"" (she doesn't explicitly say this to our daughter)</li>
</ul>

<p>In these ways I think she is possibly contributing to the problem.  In light of her personality and our marital situation I can't have a really productive conversation with my wife about these issues (<strong>NB:</strong> hence, please don't provide me with advice around communicating with my wife).  What can I do as the long distance parent to help here?  I'm very worried about her. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> An additional question. Would it be helpful to provide books about assertiveness etc? My wife may contradict them, but will that destroy their effectiveness?</p>

"How do I help the neighbor's kids not be so scared of me?","<p>My husband and I are in our early thirties and have no children. I don't really have much experience with kids. I am happy to talk to them but have never had any of my own so don't feel super comfortable around them.</p>

<p>We know the neighbours, have visited with them before, but are mostly on acquaintance-level familiarity. When we've been over to visit, their kids have been painfully shy (which isn't too surprising). I decided it was just because they didn't know us and thought it'd take time and they'd be fine. They're a boy and girl, both ages 7/8 ish.</p>

<p>Occasionally, they'll hit a ball over the wall into our yard and come over and ask to get it back. And even now, they seem really unsure of me. Almost scared.  They'll run in, grab it and run out as fast as possible. We've visited with their parents a couple of times and they've always been really painfully shy. It's been 18 or so months now and it's still the same. </p>

<p>Now naturally, they have their lives and it's not really any of my business. My husband and I are happy to just leave them be. But I don't want to be the scary neighbour that they're too afraid to talk to. Is there anything I can do to be less scary? Or should I not even try?</p>

"Stand or collar to hold bottle for warming in pot","<p>Does something exists for bottle warming that is, essentially, just a collar that attached to the rim of a pot in order to hold a bottle upright while it is being warmed on the stove?</p>

<p>The real need: something hands-free, small or dual-use, and stove top. (Maybe a small double-boiler?)</p>

<p>Does this exist commercially (and what is it called)? It seems like a simple problem: what creative solution am I missing?</p>

"Where should boys aim their urine?","<p>We have been potty training our son. We got him comfortable going sitting down first, and now he is learning to urinate while standing.</p>

<p>What should I teach him to aim for when peeing while standing up, at the water, or at the side of the bowl?</p>

<p>I have always aimed for the water, but my wife just informed me, after 3 years of cleaning the toilets, that she noticed that sometimes there is splatter on the adjacent walls. Does aiming at the water create more splatter than aiming at the bowl? </p>

<p>I tried an experiment in the urinal at work today, and aiming at the bowl seemed to result in splatter also, but my theory is that at least the splatter from the water is diluted (or is pure toilet water), while the splatter from the bowl is at least 99% urine. I couldn't find much research, at least nothing I could take seriously. Is there any evidence to support either argument? I considered conducting an experiment to measure the splash, but having a hard time figuring out how to collect data.. maybe I could hang some sheets of paper around the bowl and look for spots. Any ideas?</p>

"How to constructively play with a one year old?","<p>I keep getting astonished on how my 1 year old LO's mental and cognitive abilities have developed recently. Suddenly she remembers things, understands yes/no, knows some words for some things, understands simple commands, and so on and so on... </p>

<p>But I feel like I could be doing more to encourage her development further, to teach her new things - since she is eager to play with me and learn new things it would be a great time.</p>

<p>What is a one year old capable of learning? In what ways can I work (play) with her to make sure she uses as much of her potential as possible?</p>

"Strong-willed, 14 year old. Caught with e-cigarette paraphernalia and a condom","<p>My 14yr old son, youngest of 4 (other 3 are triplets), has always been a very strong-willed kid.  Over the years we have been able to channel that will thru his love of soccer.  </p>

<p>He plays a very competitive level.  About 6 months ago, his Dad was diagnosed with Bipolar, its been an extremely difficult 6 months of betrayal, loss of trust and emotional roller coasters with his Dad.  I have tried to be his rock, stayed strong and made the best decisions I could during a VERY difficult time.  </p>

<p>I have taken my son to 2 different therapists.  He responded very well to therapy, he actually was the most intelligent and communicative of all 4 of my kids.  Never fought me on going.  At the advice of the therapist, we are down to monthly visits now, prior we were going bi-weekly.  Within the last 3 months, my son has become very defiant.  </p>

<p>Refusing to do chores, refusing to get ready for school in the AM, refusing to be ready to go to soccer practice.  He is VERY lazy, refuses to do chores.  He speaks back to me non-stop.  Tells me to shut up, tells me I'm stupid.  I recently allowed my son to have 2 friends sleepover during spring break.  At 2am, I was awakened by giggling in the kitchen and caught the 3 boys doing shots of vodka.  </p>

<p>I was tipped off by his older brother that he was juuling. (a form of e-cigarette).  I searched his room and found e-cigarette paraphernalia and a condom in his wallet.  How do I now deal with this?  I feel like I need to send him to a boot camp for at-risk kids to nip this in the butt.  </p>

<p>Do I approach him on my own, do I approach him at our next therapy appointment.  </p>

<p>What if he says it isn't his?  Just looking for some advice on the best way to address this.</p>

"How can a single person take care of a fussy 6-month-old baby?","<p>Both my wife and I work full time. So when we had our daughter, for the first 6 months, my in-laws came to live with us and help out. Now, both of them left to take a break. And now my mom is coming for another 6 months to help.</p>

<p>But my baby is now entering a 'fussy' period that is making it hard for my mom to handle on her own during the day (we come home around 6:30pm every night and take over). Three major things that make it hard:</p>

<ol>
<li>She will cry if anyone leaves her sight. Which essentially means
my mom would have to watch her every second of the day. It'll be
difficult for her even to go to bathroom or go to kitchen to heat
milk for her every 4 hours.</li>
<li>She has trouble napping, both going to sleep and staying asleep.
She needs to be held for 15-20 mins and if you are lucky she may
fall asleep. And once she is put to the crib, if you are lucky she
may stay asleep for 30 mins, usually she would wake up in 15-20 mins
and need to be patted and held again. If we need her to nap 3 times
per day, you can see how this process would exhaust all energies
from her care taker.</li>
<li>(This may get better with time). While she no longer cries when
with my mom (she used to in the first day when my mom arrived and
inlaws left), she often doesn't want my mom with her alone for any
extended period.</li>
</ol>

<p>1) and 2) and 3) combined, it seems it's nearly impossible for one caretaker to handle my baby for 8 hours during the day.</p>

<p>Am I wrong in the above judgment? And what concrete steps can we do to address those difficulties, or are they more of a nature of a baby and not much we can do to change it at the moment?</p>

<p>She does not spit up when feeding, she feeds bottles of expressed milk 4 times a day every 4 hours. The first and last feeding are the most difficult (she would stop sucking after 3-4 oz's).</p>

<p>Napping: that is what I would say is the biggest issue. We are keeping her on a 3-nap per day schedule, with the aim of a total of 4 hours of napping each day. This is harder and harder to achieve: both getting her to fall asleep and stay asleep is a struggle.</p>

"Can a 3-month-old baby get addicted to TV?","<p>I know that watching TV is bad for kids and babies, but sometimes I would carry my baby in my arm and then sit down to watch some TV programmes (typically for an hour everyday). I believe that TV is not yet bad for a 3-month-old baby, simply because she is not old enough to grow an addiction to TV.</p>

<p>Or is her sensory already developed enough at that stage to be fully captivated by what she sees and hears on TV, and the TV exposure will thus harm her development in other areas? In other words, can a 3-month-old baby get addicted to TV?</p>
