"How do you randomize within a Qualtrics form without breaking timing?","<p>My current survey has a number of blocks. Each of those blocks contains a bunch of questions, each on their own page with a page break, and each with an associated timing question to limit time spent filling it out. I'd like to randomize the order of these questions, but not randomize the order of the timing questions. Right now, if I just randomize the entire block, the timing questions will get shuffled too. </p>

<p>Essentially my blocks look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>---- (page break)</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>timing question</p></li>
  <li><p>quiz question</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <hr>
  
  <ol start=""3"">
  <li><p>timing question</p></li>
  <li><p>quiz question</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <hr>
  
  <ol start=""5"">
  <li><p>timing question</p></li>
  <li><p>quiz question</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>---- etc..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the above example, I'd like to randomize the order of questions 2, 4, and 6. </p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to do this? Previously when this has been asked it has been suggested to put the questions into blocks and then randomize the order of the blocks, as in here: <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/16930/how-to-randomise-order-of-survey-items-in-qualtrics-where-some-items-have-to-app"">How to randomise order of survey items in Qualtrics where some items have to appear together?</a>. </p>

<p>This is not really a workable solution for me - it would result in a really unwieldy number of blocks and a very hard to modify and upkeep survey. </p>

"What does fMRI data look like after pre-processing?","<p>I wish to know what fMRI data looks like after preprocessing.</p>

<p><strong>My Understanding</strong></p>

<p>My understanding is that fMRI is MRI in time dimension that is we have repeated scans of brain volume. A voxel is a unit if measurement in fMRI because BOLD signal is measured on a typical voxel in different regions of the brain using gradient of the High frequency signal.</p>

<p>For example if we have fMRI scans say of D ADHD patients, V voxels and T time points in a fMRI study then how the fMRI data after pre-processing would be arranged in a matrix form.</p>

<p>If we assume that it is organized in D x V x T then we have a 3D scan of each brain on a time dimension. Since each 3D scan consists of voxels in the brain, and voxels are cubes that have 6 values around them, then where are those 6 values? </p>

<p><strong>If a voxel is a cube, does it have a single value, or 6 potentially different values on each face? I know voxels have coordinates like that in the MNI coordinate system.</strong></p>

  <p>  The example that the problem-solver must follow is set up by the two figures in the top row of the left panel. The figure at the left in the bottom row then specifies what has to be transformed in order to solve the problem. The six figures on the right correspond to the answer alternatives. The solution of the problem requires you to notice that the figure in the upper left of the left panel is a diamond and the figure in the upper right is a square. This tells you that the answer has to be a square. Then you must notice that the bottom half of the upper diamond is divided into two, with the left portion in black. The fact that the left half of the figure on the right is also black tells you that the corresponding portion of the square on the bottom right must match the corresponding portion in the lower left diamond-that is, the entire bottom half must be black. Then you notice that to make the top right figure, one of the bars has been removed from the top left diamond while symmetry of the bars has been preserved. This establishes that you must remove one of the bars of the square at the bottom while preserving symmetry. Now you know that the correct answer must be the square at the bottom right of the answer panel. </p>

"Why aren't any advancements being made in physically diagnosing Bipolar and other psychiatric disorders?","<p>I was involved in a discussion where somebody had asked if others had thoughts of doing risky things during their manic episodes. Two people commented, including myself. I worried that only relying on a specific set of guidelines established by the diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders fifth edition could lead to disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>Let's say somebody came into a psychiatrist's office. The person has previously read the DSMV and understands the criteria. That person played their cards right to convince the psychiatrist to diagnose them with Bipolar Disorder, when in truth that person might not likely have it at all. Instead, their true motive would have been to get free benzos so they could space out and get high.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, some people have been misdiagnosed, leading to unwanted and unnecessary medications.</p>

<p>For both of these situations, why can't blood tests and other physical and objective means be used to insure that neither party is in doubt? You can't lie on a blood test or magneto encephalogram, so why not this?</p>

"What's the psychological concept behind mobile game design and marketing?","<p>I see a very common trend in how every mobile game is being designed and advertised on the market. </p>

<li><p>Very cartoony graphics (big heads small bodies)</p></li>
<li><p>Characters standing on the side of every presentation screenshot</p></li>
<li><p>Overblown attitude of characters, characters show very exaggerated  facial expressions whether it be angry or classy.</p></li>

"When your two eyes disagree sharply","<p>Now and then, the image from each eye is so different from the other that it seems the brain has trouble combining them into a coherent image. You can create this situation by putting a hand or sheet or paper in front of one eye, then moving it about an inch away. If you open one eye at a time, you see the obstruction with one and what it obstructs with the other. If you keep both eyes open, you see a composite where the obstruction appears translucent or transparent in parts.</p>

<p>I've been curious about this phenomenon. Is there a name for it? Is it clear why the brain handles it this way, producing a seemingly impossible object, and not some other way?</p>
"
"Convolutional Operations in the Visual Cortex","<p>One of the fundamental operations in image neural networks is the operation of convolution, where a filter slides across the receptive field, activating on particular features. This is incredibly useful because it allows us to recycle filters, without having to train neurons on each piece of the receptive field. </p>

<p>It seems like such an operation is mechanically impossible <em>within</em> the human visual cortex. From the paper <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306444/pdf/nihms352068.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How does the brain solve visual object recognition - DiCarlo, et. al.</a>, 
the brain opts to instead use a massive amount of neurons in each layer, most of which are redundant in that many neurons detect the same feature at different locations. This is clearly unscalable to apply everywhere, so only about 10% of the visual field concentrates these neurons. </p>

<p>On the other hand, we <em>do</em> have the ability to perform convolutions by moving our eyes. So in effect, we can jitter our eyes thereby applying the same neurons to different parts of the scene infront of us. I would think that this, combined with short-term memory can help us process images. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose I force a subject to focus their eyes on the
  center of some common object (e.g. a car), such that the object is
  within the center 10% of our visual field. Are there situations where
  the brain is <em>unable</em> to process what the object is, <em>without</em>
  jittering our eyes? Said another way, how much visual processing are we able to do without any physical movement of our eyes or head?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm interested in understanding this question because I'm not convinced that even the massive amount of neurons in the visual cortex are sufficient for visually parsing the object. Whereas by (even slightly) shifting the object in our vision, the combined featurizations from each location would significantly reduce the computational complexity.</p>

<p>As an aspiring research scientist, I am curious <strong>what it takes today to resolve competing theories in Psychological science?</strong>  I read that it may take a joint research paper between the authors of the differing theories with conditions of what defines sufficient evidence, but certainly there must be another way, because some authors may be deceased, unavailable, etc.</p>

<p>Moreover, <strong>why might these disputations, it seems like there are 13 of them (26 theories in total), some dating back to the 50s, still be unresolved today?</strong></p>

"Noise ceiling estimate is lower than model prediction in RSA?","<p>I am using representational similarity analyses (RSA) to compare models to some fMRI data. As part of this analysis I have computed noise ceilings for each of my regions of interest (ROIs). What's weird is that, for one ROI, the correlation between my model and the aggregate participant data (RDMs averaged together) is higher than the noise ceiling.</p>

<p>I calculated the noise ceiling by splitting the participant data into two sets, averaging the RDMs from each set and the correlating the two sets to one another. The main model comparisons are done by correlating the model RDM to an averaged RDM from all of the participants.</p>

<p>Given that the noise ceiling is supposed to estimate the performance of a ""hypothetical true model"" and be the upper bound of your prediction accuracy, how should one interpret this?</p>

<p>Given that this is only one ROI, my interpretation is that this region is a little noisier than others and so the between-participant correlation isn't great, but when you aggregate many participants it averages out some of the noise in the data and allows for a decent model correlation. Is that reasonable?</p>

"Biologically plausible models for causal inference in the human brain","<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>In ‘Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?’(2018) Romain Brette argues that <em>the causal structure of neural codes (linear, atemporal) is incongruent with the causal structure of
the brain (circular, dynamic).</em> While he clearly explains how neural codes are inappropriate theoretical constructs for behavioural neuroscience experiments it's immediately clear what he means by <em>causal structure</em>.  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4t4B.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4t4B.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>On the 18th page he explains that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The causal structure of the brain is sketched on Figure 9A. At a
  coarse description level, the brain is a dynamical system coupled to
  the environment by circular causality. At a finer description level,
  the brain is itself made of neurons, which are themselves dynamical
  systems coupled together. To a first approximation, the coupling is
  mediated by spikes, which are timed events. In a dynamical system,
  state variables have a causal role by construction; examples of state
  variables in this physical system are membrane potential and the state
  of ionic channels. Spikes have causal effect, but being events they
  are not state variables; a spike is something that happens, not a
  property of the system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is incongruent with concept of a neural code since: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neural codes abstract time away, but temporality is critical to the
  operation of a dynamical system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's worth noting that Judea Pearl and other computer scientists have developed practical methods for causal inference [2] but no rigorous notion of causality. For this reason, I think evidence of the brain's causal structure would require a practical dynamical model of the brain on which we can perform causal inference to answer questions in behavioural neuroscience. </p>

<h2> Questions:</h2>

<p>This leads me to a couple questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there biologically-plausible dynamical systems models that would qualify? (Might brain network models be sufficient? Ex: [3])</li>
<li>Assuming such models exist, what methods may we use to perform causal inference on these dynamical systems? </li>
</ol>

<p>After further reflection upon comments due to Bryan Krause I think these two questions may be combined to form a single question: </p>

<p><em>Are there biologically plausible models for causal inference in the human brain?</em> </p>

<h2> Discussion:</h2>

<h3>Dynamical Systems that build upon neural coding theory:</h3>

<p>Brette's notion of causal structure for the brain appears to be in direct opposition with that of Karl Friston's <em>Free Energy Principle</em> [4] whose formalism builds upon neural coding theory: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of
  optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the
  sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal
  regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those
  underlying cell assembly formation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in [5] Karl Friston argues that a dynamical system like the brain can encode sequences of events via attractors: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the basic idea is that the environment unfolds as an ordered sequence
  of spatio-temporal dynamics, whose equations of motion induce
  attractor manifolds that contain sensory trajectories. Critically, the
  shape of the manifold generating sensory data is itself changed by
  other dynamical systems that could have their own attractors. If we
  consider the brain has a generative model of these coupled attractors,
  then we would expect to see attractors in neuronal dynamics that are
  trying to predict sensory input. In a hierarchical setting, the states
  of a high-level attractor enter the equations of motion of a low-level
  attractor in a nonlinear way, to change the shape of its manifold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a plausible hypothesis which suggests that a more sophisticated notion of encoding might be used by the brain where state variables emerge from temporal sequences via attractors. Having said that, Brette's critique of the conventional interpretation of neuronal codes by the majority of behavioural neuroscientists still holds. </p>

<h3>Causal Inference vs the metaphysics of Causality:</h3>

<p>We can't know the brain itself, only models of the brain that we may use to do experiments. To clarify my first question: Brette says that models based on notions of neural coding wouldn't qualify so what are concrete examples of dynamical systems models that do? My questions are very much designed to move the discussion beyond theory and what could be useful to behavioural neuroscientists. Furthermore, I suspect that it's not possible to define causality without going into <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-metaphysics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metaphysics</a>. This is probably why Judea Pearl chose to develop a theory of causal inference and not a theory of causal methods. Using methods from causal inference you can argue that two causal structures are distinct if: (1) there is a method for causal inference that is applicable to struct A but not struct B (2) there is a method for causal inference for which struct A and struct B give different answers. </p>

"Cognitive bias believing you are good at the things you are bad at, as successes are more vivid?","<p>What is the name for this cognitive bias?</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>I am bad at socializing with people. For 95% of the time I talked to people, I was very awkward. Yet, mostly only 5% of the opposite time stuck to my memory. Therefore I think that I'm a very social person. Although, overwhelmingly, I'm bad. </p>

<p>My mind is biased. I'm blind to all the times I failed, but can recount the outliers (successes) more vividly as if they were the norm.</p>

<hr>

<p>Replace ""socializing with people"" with anything else.</p>

"Does our consciousness die when we go to sleep or fall into a coma?","<p>I have sometimes wondered if our consciousness dies when we go to sleep at night or perhaps when we enter a deep coma, like from brain damage, for example.  When we wake, or are woken, a new consciousness is booted up with the memories of the previous consciousness, so that it gives the illusion of one continuous consciousness.   This question may be partly philosophical as well as scientific, because it looks at some of the assumptions about the nature of consciousness.</p>

<p>A possibly unfair analogy might be to a computer, when its running it has a memory-set like a consciousness.  And if you shutdown and reboot the computer, then it can continue running as it did before, as if it had never been shut down.  However, once a computer is shut down, its largely inert, though I know there are unimportant edge cases exceptions to this.  The computer is effectively dead when its shut down, its ram has largely dispersed.  We can start the computer back up, but it will really be loading the ram from disk.  The original electrical activity that made up the 'consciousness' of the computer before it was rebooted is effectively dead.</p>

<p><strong>How do we know we don't die when we go to sleep?</strong> I mean even if our consciousness doesn't wholly die, we may suffer a partial death of sorts. I could be wrong, but I believe its possible for victims of brain damage to show minimal neural activity.  Rarely, but occasionally some of these victims recover, but perhaps their brain has rebooted their mental ram (if you will). And they may not technically be the same consciousness who fell into the coma, but merely a copy of that consciousness reconstituted from data held in the brain.</p>

<p>Surely plenty have considered this question, <strong>has there been any research?</strong>  Do we have any kind of answer to this question?</p>

"Are women naturally inclined to expose their skin more than men are?","<p>It is obvious that at least in western culture today, where much personal freedom is accepted or tolerated by society, women often wear clothes different from those worn by men. For example, they tend to expose more skin than men in public (e.g. university, etc.). Here are the links to a few images serving as examples:</p>

<p>How should we interpret such a difference in behavior? Does it reflect some innate difference between the two sexes or is it simply caused by cultural factors?</p>

<p>Two different hypotheses for or against which one may argue:</p>

<p>1) Western women's preference for clothes exposing more skin is at least to some degree driven by their genome, which is, to some degree, different from men's genome.</p>

<p>2) Although women naturally like to be attractive and beautiful, nothing in their genes directly drives them to expose more skin. Social and cultural forces and factors, like peer pressure, are the only major factors which make more exposed skin equal to more beauty/sex appeal in their minds. What is the source of those cultural forces? One possibility is that men's libido has shaped some customs and norms in society through different possible mechanisms.</p>

Yesterday I was shocked when a friend of mine told me that he can see <strong>only</strong> ""completely black darkness"" <strong>when he closes he eyes</strong>.
When I close my eyes, I can see some images or ""movies"" of what I'm thinking of just now. I don't see the real world. I can ""imagine"" anything I would like, e.g., a car crash or a sunshine or someone who I know or who I do not.  I also can control them in any way: change colors, action, everything. I was sure that anybody on Earth can do it.
Indeed, when I asked him if he could ""see"" even a simple figure, e.g., a circle - he couldn't. He said he could not see anything.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p>In classic conditioning as with Pavlov's dogs if we ring a bell just before a dog is given food, the bell will give the same response for the dog as the food alone would have, such as an excess of saliva.

"Difference between parallel processing done by human brain and by computers","<p>I am asking a question regarding parallel processing as done by billions of Neurons inside our brain and parallel processing done by our computers in a cluster for example or even on a Graphics processor having 500 processing cores.</p>

<p>Recently we have seen great success in applying computers to solve complex problems applying parallel processing, such as in the field of scientific simulations, modeling, video/image processing etc.  Also due to limitations on semiconductor devices, chip makers are now forced to develop multi-core CPUs. This encourages and motivates software developers to apply parallel programming to gain the required performance, exploiting all the processing cores inside the CPU. </p>

<p>While people are encouraging to solve problems using parallel programming on the computers, at the same time generally discouraging to do parallel processing inside the brain. Expert say that we must concentrate in one dimension to get best results. Why can't human brains be used to do massive parallel processing in the same way computers are doing today?
The brain is having billions of computational units called Neurons, and thus it provides an opportunity to do processing at both coarser level and at finer level. 
Why can't we use our brain to do certain jobs in parallel in the same way as computers, for example, while I am writing this question using my right hand, why cant I solve a problem in geometry at the same time, using my left hand? Using much less powerful computers having just two processing cores (vs billions in brain) I can do these two jobs of writing and solving geometry problem, in parallel by launching two separate threads. Why it is so?  </p>
"
"How does the brain learn what something is for the first time?","<p><strong>I'm trying to understand how the idea of what a thing is originates in humans.</strong></p>

<p>For example, in computer science, it is possible to know what an object is and what it does, by examining its ""parent/ancestor"" objects with concepts of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28computer_science%29"">inheritance</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a way to reuse
  code of existing objects, or to <strong>establish a subtype from an existing
  object</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming"">polymorphism</a>, where objects may share similar function:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subtype polymorphism, often referred to as simply polymorphism in the
  context of object-oriented programming, is the ability to create a
  variable, a function, or <strong>an object that has more than one form</strong>. In
  principle, polymorphism can arise in other computing contexts and
  shares important similarities with the concept of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_%28biology%29"">degeneracy</a> in
  biology</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes me interested in this is that human children do not learn all words at once - there's a slow, but steady exposure to new stimuli, which are quantified, remembered and become available as concepts and words. The exact order of exposure is unknown, but if I remember correctly, most people know about 20000 words, and use about 6000 in daily interactions. </p>

<p>For example, a child has never seen a potato. A child sees a potato for the first time.  A child has neither an idea nor a word for a potato. Now the child's brain has to create an idea of what a potato is.</p>

<p><strong>The question</strong>: When a child is exposed to a new stimuli, as in the example above, does the child's brain:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a brand new representation of an object</li>
<li>or does a person's brain modify and re-purpose the ""closest matching""
idea and add extra attributes to it? (a potato looks like a brown rock)</li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, has there been any research that found evidence for case 2: a <strong>""common ancestor"" for ideas and objects within a person's mind?</strong> (if a person forgets ""rock"", then the person also forgets ""potato"").</p>

<p>I don't know where to begin a search for the answer. Are there some keywords that I can use? Maybe scholarly articles on cases of unusually high working memory capacity for related objects?</p>

"What causes people to remember events which did not take place?","<p>How do we ""remember"" events which did not take place, or future events? I'm using remember as a way of describing the experience of recalling a future scenario. For instance, when you were little say your mom promised you a soda at the grocery store, but then didn't give you one. You might have created, imagined, a scenario where this did happen, memorized it as such, and then later when you didn't get the soda you remembered the other, expected, imagined. It's not the expectation I'm focusing on, but the act of creating, and remembering something that never happened, and is expected in the future.</p>

<p>Has there been any follow up to this to observe whether psychopaths also take the Kelly Criterion into account?  The participation rate was still only 84% for the psychopath group.  I didn't see any data that shows whether those that stopped participating were ones whose amount of money in immediate control declined to nothing or near-nothing.  If those who lost stopped at some point relative to the amount of money in their immediate control instead of a bad run regardless of money in immediate control, it might indicate that psychopaths are acting more rational than normal because they quit when the Kelly Criterion is being violated, that they quit positive expected values when their ""risk of ruin"" is greater than ~0%.</p>

<p>Later, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O._Thorp"" rel=""nofollow"">Edward O.

<p>A formula was also derived to give a risk of total loss, ""risk of ruin"", from a collection of potential investment choices.  When the Kelly Criterion can be strictly adhered to, the risk of ruin is always ~0%.</p>

I imagine that the ease of interpretation is due to these items being purely visual that we quickly recognise them, and they can make complicated, unfamiliar information (for instance health results) that much easier to comprehend.

<p>If it's any further help I'm looking into this specifically for use in the communication of health results. So for example if you have a 20% risk of developing a disease, a good way to illustrate this could be 100 smiley faces - of which 20 are :( and 80 are :) </p>

<ol>
<li>It has been said that limerence generally lasts between 18 months to
3 years, could be more in some cases. Is there a
way/approach/strategy to reduce this duration?</li>
<li>As per this <a href=""http://www.uncommonforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=48554"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a>, it has been suggested that limerence is
due to low self esteem. This conclusion was based on ""I never
expected anything in return"". I thought this is what most successful
people like Bill Gates, Clinton do with their charity/foundation
without expecting anything in return. How can this be judged as a bad thing?
Is Limerence really due to low self esteem?</li>
<li>I have read that limerence can affect people's mind at a
unconscious level. Is there a way to train the unconscious mind to
get rid of the limerence effect?</li>
<li>I could not find anyone offering therapy specifically for this.
Has therapy been shown to help conditions like this?</li>
<li>It has been mentioned in the Wikipedia article that people with
limerence can become ill. If you are ill, is there a way to find out if this is caused by limerence or something else?</li>

"What is the proper term: optical Illusions or visual illusions?","<p>I answered the question ""<a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/q/260495/129806"">Why aren't optical illusions called visual illusions?</a>"" and would like to get more information to improve my answer.</p>

<p>In doing a search on Ngram for occurrences of the expressions ""optical illusion"" and ""visual illusion"" I saw that ""visual illusion"" appeared in 1900.  It might have existed earlier.</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>When did ""optical illusions"" start being seen as ""visual illusions?""  By visual illusions, I mean phenomena of the brain and visual system.</li>
<li>In your field (cognitive/neuro sciences) is the expression ""visual illusion"" now preferred over ""optical illusion?""</li>
<li>Also, sources say that interest in optical illusions goes back to Aristotle and the ancients.  What were these optical illusions they were interested in?</li>

"Is there such a thing as word synonyms?","<p>I'm an English teacher and participate in the English Language forum.  The question of word synonyms is very frequent.  People ask if words can be substituted in sentences and still retain meaning, etc.</p>

<p>I feel that there is no such thing as ""synonyms"" because the pictures created in the mind of listeners and speakers  are different for different words, and to complicate matters putting the words in sentences will produce different mental pictures / movies.</p>

<p>For example, if I ask 100 native English speakers what they imagine when they hear these two sentences, I feel that very different mental pictures / movies will be produced:</p>

<p>a) Please wash your hands.
b) Please clean your hands.</p>

<p>Some would argue that ""wash"" and ""clean"" are synonyms, and that the meaning of both sentences are the same; remove dirt from you hands in whatever way you choose.  I feel that they are not the same.  I'm sure there are better examples to help my point.  The words garbage, waste, pollution, trash, and rubbish, were discussed in another post.</p>

<p>I read Benjamin Bergen's book.  I am an ESL teacher, and a big problem I have found is that students don't have the same mental pictures as native speakers for words.  If I ask them what a word means they can say, but if I ask them what they imagine, the results don't always match or coincide with what native speakers would likely imagine, and I know that they will end up using the word incorrectly.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>1) Does it really make sense to talk about ""synonyms"" in light of what we now know about how people process language?</p>

<p>2) Are there books besides Bergen's that explore the topic of language processing in the way his book did, i.e. language as a mental movie produced in the listener and speaker's mind?</p>

"What Cognitive/Psychology Theories Are Behind The ""Mind Control"" Magics?","<p>I have seen a TV program talking about an interesting 'mind control' magic/experiment. I cannot find this video clip online so I have to describe what I saw in words. </p>

<p>The video (some sort of documentary?) begins with two persons walking on the street. One person is the host and another is the subject of this experiment. </p>

<p>Both person walking down the street and do some casual talking. While they walk, the host introduces the area and so on, points to some interesting scenes around (for example graffiti and people on the street etc...). Also, an one instance, there was a boy skating and the boy almost hit the subject. Anyway, everything looks perfectly normal and natural.</p>

<p>Then, they reached an art gallery. They walk into the gallery and then in a room, there is a covered painting there. The host asked the subject to tell, what would be on the paint. </p>

<p>The subject mentioned a couple of things, some thing like the color of the paint, the object on the paint etc, etc... Guess what? As you certainly can predict, when the host reveal the paint, it looks exactly like the one described by the subject. </p>

<p>The host then explain to the subject that everything and everybody he had seen during this experiment are controlled and are carefully selected. For example the boy skating, the people on the street, the graffiti etc. The host then suggested that its what he (the subject) saw lead him to think (about the paint) the way the host would like him to think.</p>

<p>So, my question here is that assume this video is not just a fake camera trick, then what psychology theory is behind it? Could anybody offer some links to academic papers in this area? </p>

"Why don't people listen to smart people?","<p>Generally speaking, I feel like there are two things everyone can agree on when it comes to intellectuals:</p>

<ol>
<li>They don't know everything.</li>
<li>They know more than me (at least about a particular topic).</li>
</ol>

<p>It's #2 that's tripping me up. The words of a Know-It-All are usually very poorly received (at least in Western culture). We don't consider intelligence as a meaningful criteria for political office, we bully them in schools, and even tell them to their faces that they're wrong about scientific/mathematical concepts that we admit to not understanding! When a problem arises in our lives, they are the last people we want to hear from. We instead run to the counsel of our family, friends, and other people who many times know <em>even less</em> about the problem than we do!</p>

<p>But why? Everything we have as a species is owed to our brains. If they really do know more than us, it would be in our best interest to revere them, no?</p>

<p>Have there been any studies done that would explain why people generally don't listen to smart people?</p>

"Behavioral and mood differences between D1 and D2 dophamine receptors action in context of monogamy and out of it","<p>Claim: I initially thought of posting this to Biology SE, but the fact that the question finds its resting formation in the area of cognition/mood/personality, I decided to post it here.</p>

<p>It is stated that in respect to monogamic relationships in mammals, D2 receptors activation effect is important for initial male-female pair formation and D1 receptors activation effect is important for prolonging the relationship in time (up to death).</p>

<p>Since potentiation of D1 receptors and decrease in D2 receptors effect cannot limit itself to the context of these relationships, I wonder about how this change in the organism first changes the perception of its chosen mate and, later, affects its overal behavior, mood and cognition.</p>

<p>I would appreciate an answer along one or several of these lines, in the order of increasing interest:</p>

<ul>
<li>What behavioral traits can be attributed to each of these receptors actions?</li>
<li>What changes in mood and mate perception/estimation/assesment can be spotted by a person affected by this process on various stages?</li>
<li>What overall changes in perception of reality can be expected to manifest? I.e. how does this change translate to outside of the context of relationships and overall understanding/perception of reality?</li>

"What is the key elements that make westerners have some better characteristics over asian","<p>I want to get your ideas or any suggestions of references (books, articles..) that I can read to help me answer this question:</p>

<p>We all know that westerners are more open while Asian people are more shy and close this is a real characteristic but not saying which one is better. But  beside many aspects westerners are learning from Asian, I also observed that westerners have some characteristics that not very popular to Asian, the things they often do that end up making their social develops faster and more modern:</p>

<ul>
<li>From very long time before, they make ships and risk their lifes to cross oceans find out new lands. (that's why now US is born, and many asian countries is dominated in the history).</li>
<li>They find new places in the wilds, build good infrastructures, social and laws.</li>
<li>Where they go, they can easily determine where is a good place to stay, as good or sometimes better than the local people.</li>
<li>They quite dare to try new things, get risk of old stuffs and thinkings. Try out new things.</li>
</ul>

<p>But we also know that westerns social also go through the dark period (when there are kings and not very develop social system), similar as Asian.</p>

<p>So is this because of the genes (DNA) or the type of monkeys they are develop from (so the brain structure different?) or the climate, food, environment differences or the social system, different way of education... ? What are key elements that drive the differences in these two culture, people?</p>

"Interpretation & Actual Result of ""10% of your brain"" Myth","<p>It is well known that the common myth that an individual  only ever uses 10% of their brain is.. well, a myth. I had a question about a possible interpretation of this idea, and a follow-up question about the result of that interpretation. </p>

<p>After spending a small amount of time with computational neural networks, it seems that at any given time, a small percentage of neurons are actually firing. All neurons have the potential to be firing, and at some point in execution likely will fire, but due to efficiency, only very few are needed for a particular function. This is my interpretation of what I have seen so far.. is this interpretation valid for the activity of neurons in the brain?</p>

<p>If this is valid, what would happen if 90-100% of neurons were firing at all times? I'm assuming this would be a huge disadvantage to whoever this happened to. Epilepsy? Overheating? Would the body be overworked and go into shock?</p>

"Psychological effects of social nudity","<p>I have been conducting extensive research over the last few years on the history of nudity in social situations, and I am looking to expand my research base now I have come across a few other interesting facts.  I have found a lot of facts stating that although the wearing of clothes is the social norm in most cultures; some cultures, groups and individuals are more relaxed about nudity (for example <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nudists/naturists</a> - <strong>WARNING! - Link is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NSFW</a></strong>), however, attitudes often depend on context.  It is generally agreed by naturist organisations (for example, <a href=""http://www.bn.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">British Naturism</a> and <a href=""http://www.inffni.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">International Naturist Federation</a>) that eroticism and blatant sexuality have no place in naturism and are, in fact, directly opposed to its ideals. Reasons that have at times been given include rapport with other humans including equality and respect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being nude in groups makes all feel more accepted – physically, intellectually and emotionally (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20100408070907/http://www.parama.com/html/body_naturism.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Veltheim, 2010</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, some people feel uncomfortable in the presence of any nudity, and the presence of a nude person in a public place can give rise to controversy, irrespective of the attitude of the person who is nude.  You only have to look at the history of <a href=""http://www.nakedrambler.org/an_audience_with_stephen_gough_by_stephen-slominski.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steven Gough</a> as an example.</p>

<p>Besides meeting social disapproval, in some countries and in some settings within more liberal countries, public nudity may constitute a crime of indecent exposure.  Many people have strong views on nudity, which to them can involve issues and standards of modesty, decency and morality.  Some people have a psychological aversion to nudity, called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnophobia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gymnophobia</a>.</p>

<p>On the flip side, there is a form of psychotherapy I have not long come across called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_psychotherapy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nude Psychotherapy</a> which is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the use of non-sexual social nudity as an intentional means to improve the participant's psychological health.</p>

It developed in the 1960s along with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-groups"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">encounter group</a> movement as a way to challenge preconceptions and promote intimacy and trust, but suffered a decline in the 1980s.

"Is there a game-theoretic explanation for why people do (or don't) participate in community policing/moderation?","<p>My question is closely related to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291680/what-drives-individual-participation-in-community-policing-of-poor-posts"">this Meta post</a> about what drives individual participation in ""community policing"" on Stack Exchange sites (e.g. downvoting, voting to close, participating in review queues, etc.). This is also related to <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/344316/what-are-the-advantages-of-having-badges"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>A few ideas I came up with why people might participate (and this list is not exhaustive by any means):</p>

<ul>
<li>People are naturally biased towards being helpful to others</li>
<li>Gamification</li>
<li>If you have a lot of posts (questions, answers, etc.) you're essentially invested in the community, which gives you an incentive to ""protect your investment"" (so to speak)</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any more I'm missing?</p>

<p>What, then, tends to drive people <em>not</em> to participate? There are certainly a lot more people who have certain moderation abilities (the ability to downvote or vote to close, for example) than who actually exercise those privileges.</p>

<p>My other point of confusion is that it seems like a lot of the reasons I listed for people participating would seem to apply equally to people who are <em>not</em> participating. If you have a relatively high reputation (e.g. the requisite 3000 reputation required to be able to vote to close), presumably you're invested in the community too (and would therefore have the same incentive to participate as other people). So, if these actually explain the behavior, why don't they seem to ""work"" on most people?</p>

<p>Is there a game-theoretic (or other) explanation for what drives people to participate (or not participate)?</p>

"What happens when I speak in these certain situations and how to reprogram my brain?","<p>I want to start off by saying that I have been a stutterer for the most of my life (I am 18) and now it is significantly bad. I noticed that the whole last year was totally stutter-free but this year, it has turned bad once again. 
The stuttering does not differ when talking to strangers, family, doing presentations at Uni or talking in general - I stutter equally in each situation. However, I do not stutter at all when I am alone or talking to my pets. In fact, I have a youtube channel where I upload videos containing several analysis of different scientific topics(devised by me), in which I do not read directly from any paper  but I have all the information stored in my head. I do not stutter in any of these videos and I am talking A LOT so it is really weird to my that I can talk to myself and talk to my pet, and record videos where I theoretically know that it will be heard by others, all without stuttering. But when I am surrounded by people (it does not matter who it is), I stutter. So why does my brain reject to let the words come out/let me exhale fully with the given combination of vibration and position of my tongue etc.. Note: I do BLOCKS as my type of stuttering and not repetitions etc. like some people. I have noticed that when I am alone, my brain focuses at what I am looking at or the actual content of what I am currently saying but when I am surrounded by someone, my brain, in some way, focuses on every single word that I am saying. Sometimes, I even see the words as letters before saying them(if I actually manage to get the word out after a potential block). Anyway, I could explain a lot of my further observations but I do not think that would be beneficial.</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why can I speak loudly to myself without any problems and why can I record yt videos containing long analysis of different scientific topics, where I even know that somebody will listen and ""judge"" it? </li>
<li>Why does my brain act very different when I am together with any human being?</li>
<li>How can I reprogram my brain to do the same thing that it does when I am alone or talking to my pet, when I am together with one or more human beings?
I do not have a lack of confidence when talking to other people.

"Non-computational models of cognition","<p>There is a <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/8133/are-there-any-models-of-human-cognition-that-do-not-depend-on-physicalism-or-mat"">question</a> on this site that asks a somewhat related question, whether there are non-physical models for cognition.  However, that question still assumes a computational paradigm for the non-physical cognition.</p>

<p>Another <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/985/applications-of-computational-learning-theory-in-the-cognitive-sciences?rq=1"">question</a> asks whether computational learning theory has been applied to cognitive science, which would then allow us to say what non-computational learning would look like.  However, there is only one answer that provides a non-computational alternative.</p>

<p>Are there any accepted models that do away with computationalism altogether?  Such a model would depend on cognition performing incomputable feats, such as being a Turing oracle, violating the No Free Lunch Theorem, or reducing NP to P.</p>

"Improving reading speed for complex material for already high comprehenders by eliminating mental vocalization?","<p>I'm a heavy reader, but my reading is limited primarily to non-fiction and scientific material.

<ol>
<li>I vocalize what I read. This of course greatly slows me down (<em>perhaps this helps in comprehension, but I can't believe it does entirely since the mind can process data more rapidly in a visual fashion</em>). </li>

</ol>

<p>Conducting a Google Scholar search for ""collective unconscious"" I stumbled on an article by <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.02.021"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dinan, et al. (2015)</a> which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Gut microbes are part of the unconscious system influencing behavior.</li>
  <li>Microbes majorly impact on cognitive function and fundamental behavior patterns.</li>
  <li>Disorganisation of the gut microbiota can negatively impact on mental health.</li>
  <li>Psychobiotics are probiotics with a potential mental health benefit.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>they also talk about bidirectional communication between gut microbes and the brain occuring via a number of routes including the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and cytokines produced by the immune system.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bacteria also have the capacity to generate many neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. For example, certain <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Bifidobacterium</em> species produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); <em>Escherichia</em>, <em>Bacillus</em> and <em>Saccharomyces</em> spp. produce norepinephrine (NE); <em>Candida</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Escherichia</em> and <em>Enterococcus</em> spp. produce 5HT; <em>Bacillus</em> produces dopamine (DA); and <em>Lactobacillus</em> produces acetylcholine (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.201100024"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lyte, 2011</a>, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003726"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lyte, 2013</a>, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0812874106"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikoff et al., 2009</a>). Some probiotics can modulate the concentrations of opioid and cannabinoid receptors in the gut epithelium (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1521"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rousseaux et al., 2007</a>). However, how this local effect occurs or translates to the anti-nociceptive effects seen in animal models of visceral pain is currently unclear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is <strong>can poor mental health affect the bidirectional communication between gut microbes and the brain, and can consuming products containing probiotics be used to help with mental health problems?  If so, will consuming products containing probiotics when well cause mental health problems?</strong></p>

<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Psychodynamics - Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Psychodynamics, also known as psychodynamic psychology, in its broadest sense, is an approach to psychology that emphasizes systematic study of the psychological forces that underlie human behavior, feelings, and emotions and how they might relate to early experience.

<p>When I was watching <a href=""https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831764-500-swirling-wall-of-moving-patterns-represents-our-thoughts/?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_medium=SOC&amp;utm_source=StackExchange#link_time=1525826213"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this artwork</a>, I didn't know about neurodynamics and thought that it was completely about psychodynamics, because I thought the emergence and dissipation of the waves in the artwork were about consciousness and subconsciousness.

<blockquote>
  <p>Mental awareness and ‘I’ emerge as a secondary phenomenon from the primary stream of thinking-in-movement. </p>

<p>I know psychodynamics is regarded as pseudoscience for the lack of evidence, but it's still useful enough for some specific psychological disorders. And as neurodynamics is about oscillation and psychodynamics was inspired from thermodynamics, if we can find the link between the two in physics (which they should), then we will see the link between the two.</p>

<p>Also, when excluding variables of age and gender, I predict that the negative association between anxiety and life satisfaction will be stronger for those with low sense of humour ratings. </p>

<p>I feel that for most of these questions, the answers could be found using an SMR, and the last question, with an MMR, but is there a simpler and more parsimonious way to do this? Can I gather the data for the first few questions from the MMR analysis, for example?  </p>

Also sometimes seen in social media that moderate autistics (level-2) (claimingly) facing similar issues to disclose their diagnosis. </p>

<p>By ""visible"" I mean the publicly considered easily observable disabilities, such as extreme intellectual disabilities, visibly heavily motor nonfunction or totally unable to move, saliva dripping from mouth, complete nonverbality or observably distorted voice and language, disfigurement or birth-defects, inability to hold urine or stool,  etc. Usually the known to be severe (level-3) autistics have at least one of these ""publicly perceived as disability"" symptoms. </p>

<p>Incidentally, autism is not itself a visible condition at all, and the intellectual disability is not itself autism, its sometimes a co-morbid condition with autism but it is not identical to autism, rather autism is basically the impairment in social cognition. Also some of the symptoms of autism may be actually visible or easily observable <strong>but these are commonly mistaken as intentional inappropriate behaviour or lack of morality or as some mental illness instead of cognitive difficulties or social disablilities</strong>. </p>

<p>Now my question is; Is it possible that someone has level-3 (severe) autism yet on superficial look or talk the disability does not appear? </p>

<p>Theoretically it seems to be very possible that a severely autistic person may lack all of the publicly believed stereotype on disability, also can lack intellectual disability, moreover can apply sharp observations and observation to mask and fit-in, yet can have tremendous problem in social aspects. In such case a level-3 autistic too may face ""you don't look autistic"" situations. And probably all the observable symptoms will be imsinterpreted as mood or behaviour issue. </p>

<p>But does that happen in reality? or all of the severe (level-3) ASD have also some publicly believed stereotype of disability?</p>

There are three levels of ASD recognized by the DSMV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition). The three levels of severity for ASD include: Level 1: Requiring Support: Problems with inflexibility, poor organization, planning, switching between activities, which impair independence. Poor social skills, difficulty in initiating interactions, attempts to make friends are odd and unsuccessful. Level 2: Requiring Substantial Support: Marked difficulties in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills. Markedly odd, restricted repetitive behaviors, noticeable difficulties changing activities or focus. Level 3: Requiring Very Substantial Support: Severe difficulties in verbal and nonverbal communication. Very limited speech, odd, repetitive behavior; many express their basic needs only.""></a></p>

"Informed Consent Research Question","<p>I am a member of a closed, fairly large private group on Facebook of former game show contestants.  Several years ago, another member posted a Google Forms version of the Asperger Quotient test, asking group members to take the test, to report their overall score (anonymous), and to answer a few demographic questions on the form.  After collecting about 300 responses, he shared the composite results with the group (who were enthusiastic about the idea).  </p>

<p>I've since asked the member who composed the original post if he would be interested in turning this idea into a publishable research brief. I am a psychologist and faculty at a small university and could create the IRB/ submission at my institution.  My issue, though, involves about informed consent. The data is collected, but he did not include an informed consent statement with his Facebook post.  Should I scrap his data, create an informed consent, and then re-send out the AQ?  Or do you think I should submit a request to the IRB asking to use the existing data? 
Thanks!</p>

"Excluding psychometry and interview methods, is there any physical or molecular method that can confirm mild autism?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASD</a> is a set of very much heterogeneous symptoms with some common characteristics like lack of eye contact, lack of social guesswork, difficulty in learning unwritten social norms or conventions, missing the sense of personal boundary of other people, lacking or inappropriate gesture, restricted repeatitive and intense interests, etc. </p>

<p>The interview and psychometry methods, sort of, work, still misdiagnosis ain both ways, are common and develop controversies and harasses. Delayed diagnosis is also a fact. </p>

"What's the importance of reward on acquiring expert level skill?","<p>I've been reading into Anders Ericssons work on expertise and as made popular by Malcom Gladwell(though quoted incorrectly) is the requirement of accumulating large amounts of ""deliberate practice""(Practice with a specific goal in mind with adequate feedback). I was also looking into Daniel Coyle's work on skill development and he follows a sort of similar theory in the sense that he does agree with deliberate practice, but puts more of an emphasis on ""reaching"" which can be defined as practicing and pushing yourself slightly outside your abilities with every practice session. </p>

<p>I don't see a reason to disagree with the above, but I pose another question which is how does one achieve consistency in the above described practice, which is usually tiring and require discipline (sometimes the mood just doesn't strike us to practice much less practice at the edge of our abilities). </p>

<p>My theory is that those who persist and are consistent in their practice over a long period of time in pursuit of expertise either deliberately or not have a reward system(Something releases dopamine as a result of practicing). It seems reasonable that people are only motivated to do a task where there is a positive correlation between reward and difficulty. So my question is how important is reward in your guys' opinion in achieving expertise? How can we add more reward to practice if it is important?</p>

"Difficulty of having profound scientific discussions with more than 2 or 3 people?","<p>I am a physicist and the other day, a friend of mine pointed out something that I had never noted explicitly before. This is an empirical observation, but it seems true to me, and it may raise a lot of questions about the current organization of research. I wonder whether this has already been documented and studied, either from the sociological or psychological points of view.</p>

<p>The observation is that fundamental discussions on physics (i.e. implying non-standard physics and epistemology) often occur in discussions involving at most 2 or 3 good friends (all being physicists). The more people you involve (5 or 6 good friends), the harder it is to speak about these subjects. It is not ""explicit""; it is just a personal feeling that a kind of ""social pressure"" appears and tends to bring the discussion closer to ""standard discussion subjects"". And it seems to occur even if all possible subgroups of 2 or 3 people among the global group of 5 or 6 people are OK with having fundamental discussions on physics when they are isolated from each other.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a well-known effect? (Any links to studies?)</li>
<li>What is its origin?</li>
<li>How to avoid it?</li>

"Why do we have so many wishes and desires?","<p>Two years ago I started to learn (as self-education) evolution theory and neurobiology

<em>What is the neurobiology base for a monstrous amount of consumer goods, objects of art etc.?</em></p>

"Is there a ""foreplay"" equivalent, priming activity for thinking or conversation?","<p>I've noticed the following phenomenon and am trying to find out if it is indeed true and if there is a scientific term for it:</p>

<p>When I <strong>think about ideas</strong>, I notice that I can rarely jump straight into ""heavy"" stuff, like thinking about a cognitive neuroscience article I read. Instead, doing another <strong>activity that ""primes"" my brain</strong> first tends to make me more conductive to heavy thinking. This can be watching a talk on TED.com or reading some lighter article.  </p>

<p>In <strong>conversation</strong>, I find that it's fairly hard to have a ""heart to heart"" talk with a person right off the bat, but a casual conversation can evolve in that direction.</p>

<p>I've read that in some asian cultures, it is <strong>traditional to start a business deal with small talk</strong>, or over a friendly dinner. The motivation for this tradition was weird to me, until I thought about it light of the phenomenon described above.</p>

  <p>Foreplay is important from at least two considerations, one of which

  intimacy. Psychologically, foreplay <strong>lowers inhibitions and increases
  emotional intimacy</strong> between partners. Physically, it stimulates the
  process that produces sexual arousal.</p>

How does one study the effects of something like that? <strong>Is there a ""gold standard"" study</strong> that I can take a look at to understand how this is done?</p>

<p>What I'm interested in is how do they account for the time of day, and other supplements/drugs/activity that happened and followed the study.</p>

<p>Over 10 years ago, I started to notice that I can spontaneously recall dreams, and clearly label them as dreams. I may <strong>recall 3 dreams from the past night, then more dreams from weeks or months ago</strong>. Some of these dreams I have written down, others were ""forgotten"" upon awakening, only to be recalled much later. That's a lot of dreams. When in this state of spontaneous recall, I can consciously guide the recall process once the original dream is recalled and recall a number of additional dreams that may or may not be loosely connected to that one.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, these are not fantasies and neither waking memories. I can clearly distinguish a waking memory from a dream memory. The entire dream memory is recalled in a flash with all the details: place, action, characters present. All of this over a second or so, similar in duration to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deja-vu"" rel=""noreferrer"">Deja-vu</a>. </p>

<p>I've looked up and found <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cryptomnesia</a>, which is defined as: </p>

<p>What I'm describing is similar to Cryptomnesia, except that the memory is immediately recognized as a previously seen dream. </p>

"Does anxiety produce adrenaline or does adrenaline make the person anxious?","<p>Its obvious that both are related(adrenaline and anxiety) but which causes which?
What (I think) I know:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Anxiety accelerates the hearth rhythm due to the feeling of fear. It makes the body believe that there is a need to spend an enormous amount of energy getting away(someway) so it cuts the blood flow in the cognitive parts of the brain and sends more blood to the other muscles, it also releases adrenaline in the blood due to the increasing need of energy(even if there is no real need).</p></li>
<li><p>Adrenaline, (when released) makes the hearth rhythm increase and gives some ""extra"" power to the muscles by cutting the blood flow in the brain and giving it to the muscles. With the lost of blood flow in the brain the person loses a considerable part of the cognitive capacity (among other things), causing the person to have some feelings (like anxiety) and unreal thoughts.</p></li>

<p>What if my somatosensory cortex was moved to my stomach (say all dendrites and axons were chopped off and were replaced with wireless hubs that signaled to the newly transplanted somatosensory cortex in my stomach). I would presumably experience no change in consciousness, which indicated localization of qualia is not achieved by the spatial embedding of the neurons, but by their graph-theoretic interconnection.</p>

<p>If I swapped the information processing (in some information-theoretic sense, say graph-dynamics) associated to the smell of strawberry (it's much more complicated than that but just go with it for a second) with the brain's processing of thermal information from afferent skin sensors, would I appear to feel the smell of strawberry all over my body when it's cold and the feel of cold in my nose when I smelled strawberry? I am excluding affect swap here so the qualia of strawberry smell now feels unpleasant like cold and the qualia of cold feels pleasant like strawberry smell.</p>

<p>Now what if in mad science I permuted the thermal sensors all over my body? Say my foot and hand neurons got swapped (say through a nanobot intercepting wireless relay). Would my hand feel cold when my foot is immersed in ice and vice versa? This would indicate these qualia are processed in consciousness in the brain rather than at the afferent sensor sites.</p>

<p>For bonus credit: How does this relate to phantom limb syndrome? Are there other observed processing defects that lead to faulty localization? E.g. Out of body experiences, certain particularly nasty mental disorders like dementia, rewiring of somatosensory map due to stroke, that engineering dean who wanted his arm chopped off (I forgot the name but I heard this from V.S. Ramachandran)</p>

<p>Second bonus credit: I've read ""butterflies"" in your stomach are serotonin releases in the enteric nervous system. Doesn't consciousness have to be informed of this release for you to feel it? If not, how do disconnected information graphs allow you the cohesive ability to feel in love?</p>

"In what ways can someone increase their brain function while reading","<p>On Facebook, someone posed the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In what ways can someone increase brain function while reading?  I like to read but have problems retaining information.  Sometimes I get a headache that seems to bound off anything I read, and the more I read the more it bounces off.</p>

<p>My answer would be:</p>

<p>The gist is: is there any natural inclination in right-handed people, when reading a web page, for example, to prefer those interface elements which lead to actions (e.g. ""print"", ""save"", ""get a link"", etc.) to be placed on the right side of the screen and then, to prefer navigational elements (e.g. menus, especially tree-structured category menus) to be placed on the left side, while the preference for content for reading would be in the middle? </p>

<p>That is: navigation (reference stuff) on the left, content (passive perception stuff) in the middle, action elements on the right, all in this manner because of a potential instinct to reach for anything action related with one's right hand.</p>

<p>Is there any research or at least speculation on the subject?</p>

<p>And a follow-up question: if there is such an inclination does it appear to be reverse in left-handed people?</p>

"What effect do random visitors have on children in orphanages and people in old age homes?","<p>Leading a volunteering team, I've been to an orphanage where the sister (who did a psychology course) running the orphanage was strict that volunteers should spend a minimum of 3 months teaching the kids on the weekends if they wanted to, because kids develop an attachment to the visitors. Another NGO insists that volunteers pledge a minimum of one year if they wish to mentor a child.  </p>

<p>At another orphanage which is frequented by volunteers of many companies, a worker there said that the kids were accustomed to seeing strangers everyday. Girls at an orphanage in Delhi told my friend (head of an orphanage in Bangalore) that they don't like it when (well-meaning) visitors arrive and ask them to stand in front of them and narrate a poem or sing a song for them.  </p>

<p>As a volunteering leader, I encourage people to contribute to society meaningfully. I want to know what the best psychological/emotional effect we can have on the children. Would it be bad for the children in the long-run, to see strangers come to conduct events for them where they sing and dance, distribute snacks and gifts and then the kids never get to see these people again. People from various companies visit these kids. Is it better to not conduct such events, and instead ensure that volunteers visit these kids weekly/monthly, find out what their needs are, become familiar with the kids and help them in whatever way possible?  </p>

<p>The problem here, is that a lot of volunteers see what other companies are doing, and are more interested in conducting a grand event at orphanages/old-age-homes, donate money or gifts and then walk away. They say they don't have the time for multiple visits.  </p>

<p>They claim a strong methodology: they studied during the phaseout of leaded fuel (which was not implemented uniformly across places, crucially) and subsequent violence levels. The same trend was proved across the world. Lead shrinks the part of the brain responsible for empathy, hence where lead poisoning was more common, people are more predisposed to violence. Big cities thus become more violent.</p>

<p>Do widely-spread brain toxins explain more violence? Are many violent criminals people who got their prefrontal cortexes shrunk by toxins? Do big cities make people aggressive and violent due to increased concentration of toxins?</p>

"Evidence that qualia are not the same as physical processes?","<p>With regards to the answer posted by @sandygautman in the question <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/2047/do-feelings-have-a-purpose"">Do feelings have a purpose</a>:</p>

<p>Let me first state that I don't have a problem with either the question nor the answer; I'm only looking for some clarification.  </p>

<p>From the answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If fear circuit is activated, the organism exhibits a flight-fight-freeze response. Conscious feeling of fear may or may not be involved, but physiological changes like activation of sympathetic system happens. If the unconscious fear circuit is OK to keep us out of harm's way (predators) <strong>why do we also need to feel fearful</strong>? A related meta question is, if a zombie behaving like me, but having no qualia, can and will succeed similar to me, why have consciousness?</p>
  
  <p>I'll address the questions, but first let me solidify the claim that unconscious processes are sufficient for most adaptive regulations. Consider your example of heat/cold as thermo-regulation of body temperature...<strong>but do you really need to 'feel' heat/cold for that</strong>. Consider when you are sound asleep- you still unconsciously cover with blanket or throw away blanket depending on how sweaty/ cold you are- you dont need to consciously register that. <strong>So thermo-regulation, like other adaptive actions of affects, can happen in absence of accompanying felt feelings</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis mine)</p>

<p><strong>What evidence do we have for a separation between the processing of a stimulus and the experience of a stimulus?</strong>
  That is, what evidence is there to indicate that what we experience is NOT the body processing the stimulus?<br>
For example, what evidence is there that the experience of cold when jumping into a lake is different than the body processing the temperature difference (and processing related tasks such as thermo-regulation, etc)?</p>

<p>My assumption has been that the only difference between 'feeling' something or not 'feeling' something has been attention; that doesn't mean the 'feeling' isn't there, but that it is literally not being processed by the conscious/attentive part of the brain.    That is, instead of saying   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So thermo-regulation, like other adaptive actions of affects, can happen in absence of accompanying felt feelings</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it would be more correct to say:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So thermo-regulation, like other adaptive actions of affects, can happen in absence of <em>consciousness of or attention to the thermo-regulation process</em> </p>

"Attributing change in DV to IV manipulation: between-groups (control group) vs mixed-model (pre&post measure)","<p>One often sees researchers attributing a change in the dependent variable to their experimental manipulation, semingly without considering whether this change in DV occurs between or within groups.</p>

<p>For instance, in the classical Bargh et al. (1996) paper on behavioural priming, subjects in an experimental group were shown word primes recalling stereotypes of old age (e.g. ""forgetful""), while subjects in a controlg group were shown neutral words. Everyone's walking speed as they left the experiment was measured, and because the first group's was slower, it was concluded that priming people with words relating to a certain concept (in this case: old age) makes them unconsciously take on characteristics of that concept (in this case: walking more slowly).</p>

<p>The question that comes to my mind is, however: how do we know that the mean difference in walking speed is not just due to pre-existing (baseline) differences between the groups? How can we be sure it is due to the IV manipulation (different word primes)? </p>

<p>To me, believable evidence for this claim would be if they had measured everyone's speed pre&amp;post-experiment, and then found an interaction showing that, while controls' speed stayed the same pre-to-post, that of the old-age-primed group had decreased. Without such an interaction (involving the use of a mixed between-within model), is the authors' between-groups-only inference statistically correct?</p>

  intelligence. One critical but challenging problem in AI is to
  demonstrate the ability to consistently understand and correctly
  answer general questions about the world. </p>
  
  <p>The <a href=""http://aristo-demo.allenai.org/#/"" rel=""nofollow"">Aristo project</a> at AI2 is focused on building such a system. One
  way Aristo ""learns"" is by extracting facts from various sources and
  processing them into a structured knowledge base. When taking an exam,
  questions are parsed and processed along with any accompanying
  diagrams to determine a strategy for answering. Aristo then uses
  entailment, statistical analysis, and inference methods to select a
  final answer.</p>
  
  <p>While Aristo's abilities have improved significantly in the last two
  years, it still doesn't have perfect, reliable methods of gathering
  knowledge, understanding questions, or reasoning through answers.</p>
  
  <p>Using a dataset of multiple choice question and answers from a
  standardized 8th grade science exam, AI2 is challenging you to create
  a model that gets to the head of the class.</p>

"Why do we talk unconsciously while sleeping","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somniloquy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Somniloquy</a> is very fascinating. </p>

<p>It is unclear what are the causes, but most of the time it is not seen as a medical condition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Sleep talking usually occurs by itself and is most often harmless.
  However, in some cases, it might be a sign of a more serious sleep
  disorder or health condition.""</p>

<p>Here is a brief descriptive testimony of someone having this condition: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is what happened to me for about one year: almost every night, I talk unconsciously while sleeping (of course I don't know, but my room mate told me that). I dream almost every night and I consciously perceive that I'm dreaming, that I'm talking to someone, that what is happening in my dream.</p>
  
  <p>Why does this happen? Is it a kind of mental disorder? Is it because my brain is too active and I keep thinking too much about one thing, so that it keeps obsessing me, even in my dream?</p>

"Can a brain be modeled as a simplified interaction of different states and their triggers?","<p>I've long been interested in the concept of ""states of mind"", which influence the perception of the outside world and outlook on past, present and future. They can be thought of as ""colored lenses"" through which the world is perceived. Each state has a certain trigger. Some example states are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anxiety - world is a terrible place full of danger</li>
<li>Sexual arousal  - brain notices sexual stimuli more and reduces inhibitions</li>
<li>Creative inspiration - ideas fly and there's a drive to create</li>
</ul>

<p>Today I've read about an <a href=""http://www.thestandarddaily.com/scientists-claim-that-they-have-successfully-recreated-a-portion-of-a-rat-brain-in-a-supercomputer/6211/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">experiment to replicate a part of a rat brain in supercomputer</a>. The following quote jumped at me as rather significant:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The researchers wrote, that the slow synchronous waves of neuronal
  activity, which have been found in the brain during sleep, were
  ‘triggered’ during the simulations, <strong>suggesting that neural circuits
  may have the unique ability to able to switch into different ‘modes’
  that could explain critical behaviours.</strong></p>
  
  <p>“An analogy would be a computer processer that can reconfigure to
  focus on certain tasks. The experiments suggest the existence of a
  <strong>spectrum of states</strong>, so this raises new types of questions, such as
  ‘what if you’re stuck in the wrong state?” said Markram.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read that the project is criticized due to it's complexity, seems like they are working from the bottom up, which makes me ask:</p>

<p><strong>Are there projects out there that attempt to model the brain from the higher levels of abstraction (discrete states and their triggers) down to more detail?</strong></p>

<p>To use a computer analogy - instead of writing very low level binary code, I can take a high level programming library and work with that. Is there research in this direction?</p>

<p>This image is an example of a state machine - a system is modelled in terms of discrete states and their interactions. The author does not concern themselves with interaction of individual neurons, instead with higher level states:</p>

"For comprehension and critical thinking examinations, is recognition sufficient, or is recall more imperative for success?","<p>Recognition is the ability to retrieve information given a set of stimulus, be it a cue, a hint, a reference to a term then asking one to elaborate. Recall is the ability to produce content without such stimulus. Assume one is taking a critical thinking examination, where there is a discrete list of prerequisite content recommended for success on an examination. However, the examination is not a fill in the blank of this definition with 4 answer choices examination. The examination is of the format where one would read a passage. The passage's content is arbitrary and transcends the discrete list of prerequisite content. That is, it is related to the prerequisite content, but it is more complex and cannot be studied for. To achieve a high score, a test taker must apply relevant prerequisite knowledge to the passage's details and answer scenario questions. </p>

<p>Is the test taker at a disadvantage if the test taker is very fluent in the content, but only from a recognition perspective as opposed to a recall perspective? That is, the test taker cannot spontaneously lecture or write a chapter on the content, but given a cue, can retrieve information. </p>

<p>Here is an example. Pretend there is a neuroscience test. The requisite knowledge the professor assigns include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Know the physiology of action potentials</p></li>
<li><p>Know common neurotransmitters and roles</p></li>
<li><p>Know neuroanatomy</p></li>
<li><p>Know common psychological disorders such as schizophrenia, ADHD, and symptoms/treatments</p></li>
</ol>

<p>A student reads upon these chapters, understands the content well, but cannot simply draw up a chart and list 20 neurotransmitters, with their common effectors, ec. Nor can the student spontaneously reference literature on schizophrenia and genetics for 30 minutes, despite spending hours reading such literature.</p>

<p>Then the student walks into an examination, and the first passage is about a drug that the student has never heard (again, this is a critical thinking examination) of and its mechanism of action in dopamine receptors. The student is asked scenario questions about how this drug would affect schizophrenics. Given the cues ""dopamine"" and ""schizophrenia"", can a student realistically succeed on a test assuming normal reading comprehension if he can only remember pertinent information about ""dopamine"" and ""schizophrenia"" when triggered by a test taking atmosphere, a passage, reading those words, etc.? Or is innate recall outside of these cues more likely to end up in academic success on this test?  </p>

<p>Natural language understanding is neglected part of natural language processing in computer science. Exact definitions and tests of understanding are necessary for producing artificial general intelligence (AGI) - e.g. <a href=""https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-41649-6_13"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-41649-6_13</a> article argues that artificial general intelligence (e.g. software piece) should learn and self-modify itself but such development is possible only if AGI can estimate the quality/fitness of the new self-modification - whether this self-modification is better than existing version of AGI and whether this self-modification can be applied? Obviously - if we want to apply machine learning and AGI to understanding of the natural language then we should be able to test and measure the understanding.</p>

In addition, non-authority figures also have the power to punish, even if it's not legitimized, and as a result an abusive parent or child, or a bully or someone wielding a knife can punish you if you don't do what they say.  In addition, the effects of or threat of punishment itself can also last a long time, like many other persuasion/influence strategies.</p>

"Applications of project management techniques to managing recovery while in residential addiction treatment programs","<p>As some background, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scrum process</a> is a project management process used primarily in software engineering (it's what's sometimes called a type of <a href=""http://agilemethodology.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Agile methodology</a>). Its focus is on developing software iteratively. In general, a particular team will work in one to three week increments called <em>sprints</em>; at the beginning of the sprint, the team will select which outstanding tasks and features they are working on for the next sprint.</p>

<p>One major part of this is the daily stand-up meeting, which includes three questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
<li>What are you working on today?</li>
<li>Do you have any ""blockers""?</li>
</ol>

<p>These are limited to 15 minutes <em>at most</em> - if there are other, non-checkin-related issues, they're discussed later.</p>

<p>Often, there will be a physical board containing sticky notes with everyone's tasks. Each column contains a particular status type (not started, in development, in QA, complete). People will physically move the sticky note with their particular task across the board as it becomes closer to completion (e.g. halfway across the development column = halfway done with development) and changes status (e.g. when you're done with development, you physically move the sticky note to the ""In QA"" column).</p>

<p>I'm curious about the applications of this to a partial hospitalization program or residential treatment program. It seems like virtually all of them will have some kind of process group, but that they follow a different format than this.</p>

It seems like this could be particularly beneficial for complicated compulsive behaviors like eating disorders and compulsive hoarding.</p>

"What role do circular network structures play in neural networks?","<p>I'm developing small virtual neural networks and for the most part, the networks have remained feed-forward. When I create circular structures, it becomes a challenge to find a balance with the neural refactory period, stopping neurons from firing again for a period of time, giving them high action potential thresholds, then reducing that back down to fire again -it's tough to find a balance that stops infinite feedback loops but allows circular structures to play a role in processing. </p>

<p>I've done some reading on this and my vague idea so far is that circular structures perhaps allow the network to react to information based on its pattern, react to the information over time, so the C in an input series of A, B, C can be handled differently than the C in input series A, A, C. </p>

They credit this to <strong>hippocampal GR</strong> (<strong>glucocorticoid receptor protein</strong>) gene overexpression in the more nurtured rat kid (and underexpression of GR gene in uncared rat kid) as well as difference in expression in <strong>""hundreds of genes""</strong>. (The adobe flash app even offers a <em>""rat pup licking game""!</em>) </p>

<p><strong>Does this principle also work on human?</strong> There is a <strong>common popular belief</strong> that stress makes a person more resilient to stress. But at least in the rat example <em>at least partly that popular assumption did not apply</em>. The rat which lacked maternal adore at childhood, developed underexpressed hippocampal GR gene throughout the rest-of-the-life, and though they have specific advantage to specific situation, they could not quckly relief from stress. In contrast, more nurtured rat kid developed overexpression of hippocampal GR gene that helped them fast recover after stress. </p>

<p>My question is; this principle found in rats (which is also at a contrary to a certain popular belief), does also apply on humans? Such as if a human kid get less nurturing and more struggle or stess, will she or he develop less-resilience/ delayed recovery from stress at later life? as well if a human kid get proper maternal care and nurturing then she or he will develop more adaptibility and faster recovery from stress? If yes, is it due to similar set of genes?</p>

"How to measure/predict the difficulty of a conflict?","<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I want to conduct an experiment and I found that the difficulty of a conflict to resolve could play a factor in this experiment. 
I now need an easy way of measuring the potential difficulty of a conflict, so that I can control this factor.  </p>

<p><strong>Own Proposal</strong></p>

<p>I'm coming from StackOverflow and am used to present own proposals (since psychology is not primarily my field of expertise I wanted to have your opinion for my approach: 
I thought of a questionnaire that is supposed to measure various factors that could influence the difficulty of a conflict. 
The factors I thought of are: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Involvement</strong> (PI): The potential change and stress that a given conflict can have on the life of a conflict party. e.g. a colleague is telling you to bring out the trash while you don't feel like doing it. </li>
<li><strong>Influence of Emotions</strong> (IoE): How strong Emotions influence conflicts. </li>
<li><strong>Objective vs. Subjective</strong> (OvS): Are Arguments in the conflict based on evidence or are more testimonial kind. </li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong> (R): What is the probability and damage of an undesired outcome for a conflict party? </li>
<li><strong>Level of Society</strong> (LoS): 1-to-1 vs. 1-to-many vs. many-to-many, also is it a conflict between countries of just a few people. personal-family-inner friend circle-outer friend circle-foreign groups-countries-cultures ... just to give some example to what that could include.  </li>
<li><strong>potential violence</strong> (PV): Probability and potential dangerousness of on party using violent measures. </li>
<li><strong>explicitness</strong> of conflict result(s) (ECR): I think some conflicts have explicit results like ""Do Aliens exist?"" and some don't necessarily have a definite answer like ""What is an appropiate outfit for a woman? (which is answered differently in different cultures)"" </li>
<li><strong>conflict</strong> resolution skills of the conflict partys (CRS): This also might include negotiating and communication skills as well. </li>
<li><strong>medium</strong> (M): speech, written, social network, face-to-face, etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>I then thought of measuring those metrics on a scale of 1-7, weight them and add them add for some kind of conflict difficulty score:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RXRZ4.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RXRZ4.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Say Risk has a 10% influence on the conflict difficulty the weight, therefore, would be 0,1*(Scale of Risk). 
I also think this way the result might be 2 different scores depending on the partys point of view. </p>

<p>I also think that some of the metrics I proposed are not needed or cannot be measured using a questionnaire like the medium for example. 
But before I really go all the way to create a new questionnaire I wanted to know if I'm on the right track, if there is literature on this topic I missed, if I missed other important factors and so on. </p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have implemented a chat tool for my bachelors thesis, that displays emotions and handles profanity in messages differently. I know want to evaluate this software. The goal of this software is to improve communication in conflict situations and a new solution for hate speech in social networks. 
I also have a software engineer background and this is my first question in the psychology sector. </p>

"Purported exorcisms - can hypnosis cause a person to temporarily experience phenomena similar to those labelled as ""DID""?","<p>I've seen several videos/documentaries featuring (usually self-proclaimed) exorcists, both Catholic and Protestant, who perform ""exorcism"" ceremonies in which they ""cast out demons"".  </p>

<p>I'm personally a Christian, but I have some scepticism about the validity of these ceremonies, partly because I suspect that most of what's happening is that the pastor is inducing psychological phenomena of hysteria and euphoria in people through psychological conditioning techniques (links to more general scientific research in this area from informed readers would be welcome, btw).    </p>

<p>What I find harder to explain is that many of these people, during the exorcism, actually begin speaking and behaving as if the actual ""demon"" is communicating.  I have posted links to videos below where people start speaking to the pastor using complete sentences, laughing maniacally and taunting the pastor, all while supposedly the ""demon"" is doing the talking.  This seems like a really extreme psychological phenomenon to be caused through simple psychological manipulation.  I should explain that this happens after the people are subjected to significant psychological suggestion, like the pastor addressing the demon and telling them to ""come out"", etc.  </p>

<p>Is it possible that a person, in the right circumstances, could be induced to believe that they are a different entity, and to communicate as if they were that entity, in a fashion which seems similar to what I (a layman) imagine is the psychological phenomenon labelled as ""Dissociative Identity Disorder""?  </p>

<p>I should add that I, a layman, am highly sceptical of psychiatry and the validity of labels like DID, but that's probably an unrelated topic.  </p>

"Mind uploading & its constituents: Theoretically possible?","<p>Is it possible to remove the mind from the rest of the body and have it ""alive"" somehow as in its former known form? Mind uploading would be computerizing a mind to preserve data, memories and etc.</p>

<p>There are other constituents of this though that I will outline:</p>

<p>1.Mind uploading as in an interlink between the mind and some proxy (may or may not be computerized, but in general it might be expected) -- i.e., having the mind function in some connective/remote form that doesn't require a body but still enables the organ to work somehow -- like if you could linke neurons/axons/synapses to some feedback system that's not body-dependent;</p>

<p>2.Mind drive --  the ability to store NON-computerized components of the brain in some reliable method to preserve it biological function somehow (without its native body specifically at the least). Also, the idea of somehow or the same being being still technically of its former identity once this application has been made is questionable at best (when you take someone's brain and ""Frankenstein"" its ability to live and then relay it elsewhere somehow, can you argue that this is still of its natural-born identity?);</p>

<p>The two above differences take in to account the obvious notion that brain as a natural form is subject to decay and death as it is biological naturally (without factoring in anti-aging and other methods). The idea might stand to bring up the possibility of femtotechnology or etc. to recreate brain neural network copies and then attempting to figure what to make of the conscious bridge that forms one with mind.</p>

  <p>A personality disorder is a type of mental disorder in which you have a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, functioning and behaving.

<p>So I understand the personality disorders are more about having a rigid and unhealthy pattern of thinking, while mental illness in general is more about mood.

<p><strong>Schizophrenia or spiritual crisis? On ""raising the kundalini"" and its diagnostic classification</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two patients are described who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic,
  but had actually instead been going through spiritual crises, which in
  Eastern spiritual tradition are called raising the kundalini. Perhaps
  this experience is not a disease, but many--especially if not
  understood by oneself, the nearest relations and the medical
  profession--cause mental illness. In WHO ICD-10 the experience could
  be classified as F48.8, disordines neurotici specificati alii. The
  process falls outside the categories of both normal and psychotic.
  When allowed to progress to completion this process culminates in deep
  psychological balance, strength, and maturity.</p>

"Why do right-handed people put things in their left pocket, and vice versa?","<p>I'm not entirely sure if their is a duplicate of this question, or if this is the right SE site, topic, so sorry in advance if I am wrong.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, I have noticed that many people, including myself, put things in a pocket opposite of their main hand of usage (excluding ambidextrous people.) I am right handed, and I typically put my phone and other objects in my left pocket, and I take it out with my left hand and transfer it to my right hand. A relative of mine who is left-handed does the same thing, although with directions reversed.</p>

<p>Why is this so? What psychological reasons are their to do such an act?</p>

"Is self-actualization really a need?","<p>Abraham Maslow's original hierarchy of needs placed self-actualization at the very top of the list. As I understand it, self-actualization can be roughly defined as realizing one's full potential.</p>

<p>Yet the percentage of people who achieve self-actualization is theoretically less than 5% (probably closer to 1%). Maslow himself listed about a dozen people who, in his opinion, could be considered examples of self-actualization, including Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>At the same time, I haven't met many people who really pushed themselves to their full potential. Apathy and Xbox seems to be the norm nowadays.</p>

<p>So we can think of self-actualization as an awesome goal, but is it really a ""need""?</p>

<p>To put it another way, have any studies been done on the psychological damage inflicted on people who failed to self-actualize? People obviously get depressed when they fail to get a great job or blossom into a professional athlete. Could such ""failure-based depression"" qualify self-actualization as a need?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I'm not familiar with the psychological community's definition of ""need,"" so let's just say I'm referring to a need as opposed to a ""want."" We might think of a need as something that's necessary for a person's mental health.</p>

<p>Or, to put it another way, does self-actualization really merit being included with the other needs in Maslow's hierarchy, such as safety and social connections? Feelings of vulnerability and loneliness can drive people to suicide, but how many people who haven't self-actualized drown their sorrows in a bottle of beer?</p>

"What is a Good Working Memory Test Online (or overall if none)?","<p>By good, I mean three things:  </p>

<li>Accepted by professional doctors/psychologists/psychiatrists.  </li>
<li>Has supporting research.  </li>
<li>Has an established norm and can tell you where you are relative to the average.  </li>
</ol>

<p>These are the tests I found:</p>

<p><strong>TEST 1</strong>: <a href=""https://www.mindcrowd.org/consent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.mindcrowd.org/consent</a></p>

<p>This seems to be an actual medical test - it displays 12 pairs of words and then shows one word from the pair, the user is expected to type the second word. The test seems to be at least associated with some doctors (team: <a href=""https://www.mindcrowd.org/#team"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.mindcrowd.org/#team</a>) working on Alzheimer's research.</p>

<p><strong>TEST 2</strong>: <a href=""https://www.memorylosstest.com/free-working-memory-tests-online/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.memorylosstest.com/free-working-memory-tests-online/</a></p>

<p>Just some digit span test - shows you a series of numbers and has you remember them. It seems like this is an acceptable way to test WM given:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>thus, the digit span task is a common component of many IQ tests,
  including the widely used Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS).
  Performance on the digit span task is also closely linked to language
  learning abilities; improving verbal memory capacities may therefore
  aid mastery of a new language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href=""http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/browse/memory/test/digit-span"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/browse/memory/test/digit-span</a>)</p>

<p>but then there is this quote (tl:dr; Number spans can be gamed to achieve absurdly high results):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, memory span can be expanded dramatically - in one case to 80
  digits - by learning a sophisticated mnemonic system of recoding rules
  by which substrings of 5 to 10 digits are translated into one new
  chunk. In December 2015, Lance Tschirhart entered the Guinness Book of
  World Records for memorizing a sequence of 456 digits spoken aloud at
  the rate of one per second at the World Memory Championship in
  Chengdu, China.</p>

<p><strong>TEST 3</strong>: <a href=""http://opencoglab.org/memtest1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://opencoglab.org/memtest1/</a>
Same as the digit span, except with convoluted images. Imo, this test is flawed because the images are fairly complex and don't necessarily represent a single, familiar ""unit"". The flaw is in the fact that WM tests are supposed to measure how many ""units"" of data you can keep in mind.</p>

<p>Anyway, which of these tests are best, is there anything better? If there isn't, what's a good test?</p>

<p>My end goal is to get a decent approximation of my overall WM to see if training improves it.</p>

<p>PS, I did see this post <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/18126/in-the-digit-span-test-why-do-some-strategies-work-and-others-dont"">In the digit span test, why do some strategies work and others don&#39;t?</a>, which links to (<a href=""http://pebl.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://pebl.sourceforge.net/</a>), but I have no basis for evaluating the validity of those tests either.</p>

"Training adults on how to react to social cues.","<p>I was researching social cues and stumbled upon <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00197/full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, which concludes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>results suggest that implicit learning is context-dependent and can be influenced by the cue type, e.g., social and object cues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, that is not surprising at all, the findings that learning is context-dependent, meaning that relevant social cues improve it. However, what if the subject has to learn how to react to social cues? Say we are talking about individuals that for various reasons, (let's say, social isolation growing up or as one symptom of a disorder or other) do not know how to react to most social cues, or to more complex ones? How do you train them, given that, as adults, exposure in a cvasi-controlled environment (like school) is not possible?</p>

<p>I guess my question is: <strong>In adult learning, would it be possible to train people to understand or react to social cues, taking into account that you need to make the training context-dependent? *</strong></p>

I don't know, how MDD is defined, what is its criteria, what are its diagnostic methods. On the other hand, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> practitioners, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Burns"" rel=""nofollow"">David Burns</a>, define depression through the use of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Burns"" rel=""nofollow"">rating scales</a>.</p>

<p>For example, David Burns has a questionnaire, called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Burns#Burns_Depression_Checklist"" rel=""nofollow"">Burns Depression Checklist</a> (BDC). It asks you 25 questions about various thoughts and moods you experienced at least once during the week. Then it asks you to assign a number from 0 to 4 to each of them, meaning how strongly you experienced it, 0 meaning “not at all”, 4 meaning “a lot”. Then you add the numbers up, and if you get more than 10, you have a depression: mild depression (11-25), moderate depression (26-50), severe depression (51-75), extreme depression (76-100). The questions are very different, they ask if you feel sad, or discouraged, or worthless, or guilty, or lonely, or demotivated, or sleep to much, and so on. Therefore you can have different combinations of physical and emotional symptoms, and still have depression according to BDC. For example, i could put number 4 to questions about guilt, hopelessness, and self-esteem, yet put number 0 to questions about motivation, interest in work, and feeling tired; or I could do the other way around, and it would still mean i have a mild depression.</p>

<p>According to the study called <a href=""http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/faculty/detels/PH150/Kessler_Depression_JAMA2009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow""><em>The Epidemiology of Major Depressive Disorder</em></a>, 16.2% of US citizens experienced MDD in their lifetimes. If we assume Burns's definition of depression through result of BDC scale, then this study's data contradicts common sense and my anecdotal evidence. I gave BDC to various friends of mine, and all of them showed at least mild depression. From behavior and self-accounts of many people I meet every day I can safely assume that mild and moderate depression (in Burns's definition) are the statistical norm; the depressed people are the <em>majority</em> of population. I understand that anecdotal evidence means nothing.</p>

<p>My question is as follows. What exactly is major depressive disorder? How it is defined in a formal way? What are the criteria, which a person should met, to be diagnosed with MDD? What are the methods to diagnose it (for example, do psychiatrists use rating scales like BDC)? Finally, how MDD is different from the many alternative definitions of “depression”, including the colloquial ones?</p>

<p>I ask this because I can't reconcile my intuitive hunch that most people around me are depressed, some of them heavily, yet studies show that depression, while serious, isn't that widespread. If MDD is defined in a very different way, than Burns's depression, then it would mean that only a minority experiences MDD, so there's no contradiction.</p>

"Name of a cognitive test assessing whether a child can think independently","<p>I am looking for a names / examples of a tests that determine if the child is thinking on its own (I have tried searching on wikipedia topics about cognitive sciences/ psychology etc. with no luck). To be more specific, long time ago I saw a video that described two tests:</p>

<p>In the first, a teacher was given two cookies, and the kid just one. Teacher asked the child 
""Is it fair that I have two cookies and you just one"" and the kid replied as it was supposed to ""No"". 
Teacher then has split kid's cookie in half and asked again ""Is it fair now?"" and kid stated ""Yes, cause we both have two now"". </p>

<p>My memory fails at accurate description of second test, but I remember that it was supposed to determine if the kid is thinking 'What I know is what everybody knows'.</p>

<p>It's like if you put two kids in the same room with a large amount of 'sth', and asked one, let's call it 'Martha', to leave the room.
Then, you make the kid that stayed take for example two instances of 'sth' and afterwards ask him 'Do you think the kid that left the room knows that you took it?"" and kid kid replies ""Yes"" because it cannot differentiate 'Martha's' knowledge from it's own.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate any ideas where to seek.</p>

"Name for the need to reply “you can’t fire me, I quit”","<p>It’s a cliché in movies. The boss fires the employee, and they reply “you can’t fire me, because I quit”. Similarly, when in a romantic relationship, one person may decide to end it and the other answers the news with “well, I have been thinking about ending this for some time” (whether true or not).</p>

<p>Both of these replies should be unwarranted and effectively meaningless: the end result is the same. Yet, people often feel this need to “one-up”<sup>1</sup> one another. Does this need have a name? And do we have any formal findings (or ongoing research) as to why we have it?</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Not exactly “one-upping”, since you’re not outdoing the first person — more like preemptively doing what they’re doing, as if life works like a <a href=""http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Stack"" rel=""noreferrer"">MTG game</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_%28computing%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">the last thing any of you do is the first to happen</a>.</p>

"Variables in positive reinforcement in human beings","<p>I've been thinking about positive reinforcement occasionally, and I've always found myself wondering about various things that can influence it.</p>

<p>So, I'm looking for information (results of empirical studies) about the variables affecting positive reinforcement, in hopes of finding answers to my questions and questions that I haven't even thought of, such as:</p>

<ol>
<li>How does knowing what the positive stimulus is for affect the change? What happens if I did two things, and I don't know which one of them led to the positive stimulus? e.g. I solved a math problem and won some game, and then I received a prize, and I don't know for which one of these things</li>
</ol>

<p>What happens If (as far as I'm concerned) I did nothing, and then I receive a prize?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I receive a prize for something I did an hour earlier, for example, will it still change my behavior?</p></li>
<li><p>Does receiving a prize while I do a task has a stronger effect? weaker?</p></li>

"How to optimize bi-tasking?","<p>Based on an article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function#Advantages_of_brain_lateralization"" rel=""nofollow"">brain laterization</a>, it's said that a lateralized brain can do two tasks simultaneously. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lateralized chicks could pick food out of the pebbles with one eye and one half of the brain while using the other eye and other half of their brain to monitor the skies for predators. Not only could non-lateralized chicks not complete the two tasks simultaneously, but their performance of the single task deteriorated. This suggests that the evolutionary advantage of lateralization comes from the capacity to perform separate parallel tasks in each hemisphere of the brain.</p>

<p>While multitasking might still be too difficult, are there ideal ways of doing two different tasks at the same time? What kind of tasks are suitable for bitasking?</p>

"Why do we seem to have an internal drive to use different expressions(mostly when writing)?","<p>How come we have so many words/phrases that share the same meaning?</p>

<p>I suppose the most obvious answer to this would be that through communication between people with accent/language A and B, new words/phrases were added from A to B and vice versa.</p>

<p>I find however that when we are writing longer texts, we are ensuring that we are not using the same word/expression too often and—if we do—replace them with something else that has the same meaning. In other words: It seems to me like we have an internal drive to use different expressions.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there was any (maybe evolutionary) explanation for this, as it kind of adds a lot of overhead to communication: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Time</em>: unnecessary learning of new words whose meaning we're already capable of expressing with other words</li>
<li><em>Resources</em>: necessity of a slightly bigger neuronal structure to accommodate those words/expressions </li>
<li><em>Complexity</em>: more words need to be distinguished, which makes the understanding of the spoken word harder</li>
</ul>

<p>How does this compare to animals? Do we know whether they also have several ways of expressing the same thing?</p>

"Teaching Problem Solving : Mastering bit by bit Vs Try it all by yourself?","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I'm a teacher who <em>trains</em> hundreds of high school students in Math, Physics &amp; Chemistry to crack probably toughest competitive exam in India.</p>

<p>I deal with the students who are hardworking and scored at least 70%+ in their 10th Grade. They are definitely in a position to figure out the variables and required formula and solve it, if the problem is direct. For rest of the post when I say problem solving, I'm referring to the problems of Math &amp; Physics which are not as tough as 12th grade Olympiad problems but definitely a lot tougher than typical textbook level problems. <a href=""http://jeeadv.iitkgp.ac.in/oldqp.php"">You can see some of such problems here.</a> Each paper shown in the link, needs to be solved in 3 hours and more than 70% must be secured. </p>

<p><strong>Typical way of training: [Method1] Try it all by yourself</strong>
Students are taught (it is ensured students <em>understood</em> the) concept. Solve 3-4 variety mid-level example problems, to illustrate application of concept to the problem and reinforce their understanding. Move on to the next concept. Do the same with all the concepts and finish the chapter. Then, students are given about 50-60 unsolved problems, no two of same model. Students spend <em>lot of time</em> solving these problems, they discuss with teachers and they discuss among themselves. </p>

<p><strong>Problem with above method:</strong> The success percentage is very less. Its as low as 2-3%. I mean, only 2-3% of the students get through all the difficulties and finish those problems. Most of the other students find those problems too difficult to solve and are either losing motivation to solve such problems or think that they are not intelligent enough to solve the problems.</p>

<p><strong>Fixing the problem: [Method2] Master bit by bit</strong>
I've read few books like, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/047059196X"">Why Don't Students Like School</a>, <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/069111966X"">How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method</a> and analyzed myself (how do I solve the problems?) and understood that we try to recollect the patterns of problems. By practicing problems we are learning the patterns of problems and when solving an unsolved problem trying to figure out our put the patterns that we already learned. So, I've broken down larger problems into smaller problems. I've arranged these problems in the increasing level of difficulty. For the patterns to be remembered properly, I've increased no. of simple problems. I'm ensuring that students are mastering problems concept by concept, level by level.</p>

<p>Result is, now my students are not demotivated, they feel problem solving is simple and they are doing problems well. </p>

<p><strong>Problem with my method:</strong>
I realized that my students are entering a dangerous zone. They are not willing to solve difficult problems and they are unable to solve unknown model problems. Did I overtrain them? I consulted my college professors regarding this and they were furious with my method. They said, that I am spoon feeding the students. They said that I <em>must</em> follow the method 1.  That is what is going to help them in future in their higher studies and research.</p>

<hr>

<p>What exactly is happening? Why is method 2 failing? Why will method 1 work? Is it just about the psychological difference in feelings that method 1 guys feel more prepared for solving any kind of problem? Whats optimal way? Where can I learn more?</p>

"Are there cognitive benefits to two hand typing versus one finger?","<p>I've been reading an old popular psychology book by russian psychiatrist Vladimir Levi. One of the things that he has his depressed patients try is learn to juggle. He insists that such activity brings both halves of the brain together and that the brain ""likes to juggle"". His book was written in the 1980s, and there's little science presented in the book to back the claim.</p>

<p>Juggling involves coordinating both hands and is automatic, if I understand correctly. Touch typing involves coordinating 10 fingers together and is also automatic once learned.</p>

<p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, computer keyboards were the dominant way of inputting data into a computer. If one was <strong>to type anything one used both hands together for extended periods of time</strong> (most likely touch typing with both hands). But as of 2013, more and more people report using tablet PCs to surf the web and interact with friends online. Such typing most likely involves one finger pressing the letters on a virtual keyboard. It's a much slower process, as the keyboard is too small for both hands. </p>

In high school, you learn that electrons orbit around a nucleus, whereas in reality electrons are actually at every point of the orbit at the same time. How would you go about unlearning the initial fact learnt in high school? It seems that the earlier fact is retrieved subconsciously since it has become a habit.</p>

<p>In the case of this simple example, it seems to be easier to replace the earlier fact. However, this appears to be problematic when dealing with more advanced concepts such as unlearning a simplified version of how fMRI functions.</p>

<p>""You go into a dark room with a page of text and a flash light, and every ~30 seconds you turn on and off the flash light very quickly and try to recall as much as you can. And you do this for ~20 minutes. After ~30 days of practice you should have much better visual memory.""</p>

"Does playing video games increase attention and learning agility, therefore career performance","<p>Recently, there has been a lot of research into the positive effects of video games on cognition, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com.au/video-game-health-benefits-2014-9#kids-who-spend-moderate-amounts-of-time-playing-video-games-are-more-well-adjusted-10"" rel=""nofollow"">As business insider reports</a>.</p>

<p>I'm curious as to whether somebody should play video games purely to increase career performance based on the evidence given:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.menshealth.com/health/game-your-way-into-mensa"" rel=""nofollow"">A study</a> states that attention is increased by 14% when playing world of warcraft and <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/260270884_Video_game_play_attention_and_learning_How_to_shape_the_development_of_attention_and_influence_learning"" rel=""nofollow"">another</a> supports this hypothesis of attention and gaming. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/47/16961.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">Another study in particular</a> states that learning agility is increased after playing action based video games such as call of duty. This is possibly explained by video games improving the performance of perceptual templates. </p>

<p>Though studies in this area usually contradict each other. In that case, I ask how valid are these studies in predicting effects of video games on cognitive performance. </p>

<p>Many high end careers require workers with high concentration and learning agility abilities, especially a computer programmer at google. In this case do video games increase performance of individuals in a career? A study linking career performance and video game play would be valuable.</p>

  <p>video gamers were better than non-gamers in ability to fly and land aerial drones and were essentially as good as trained pilots on this skill (MKinley et al., 2011).

<p>While the evidence is there, it feels very uncomfortable to make the conscious decision to play video games, in order to boost career performance, rather than entertainment reasons. How valid are these studies, and is the decision to play video games purely to boost cognition, and career performance reasonable?</p>

<p>It's very frequent that the guy who is in charge <strong>pretends</strong> that he would be ""right"" (and the other would be wrong). This happens between parents and their children, in couples, in web forums, between teachers and scolar, in the HR, in the job, on social network groups, when speaking to police officers, judges and so on. The first one tries to explain to the others why he is right and the other is wrong.</p>

<p>Actually the idea itself of ""beliefs"", ""dicotomic"" helps to show why it's pretty hard to speak of being ""right"". 
It's enough to compare the formulation of any Evidence Based Paper to understand how subjective we are as human being. The law itself has often dicotomic formulation, the language used by lawyer is very approximative and far away from being objective. A math theorem is objective. </p>

<p>Isolation is a lot more common than we might realize, <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201306/together-still-lonely"" rel=""nofollow"">just because you are not physically alone does not mean that you are not isolated</a> many of us even fail to realize they are living in isolation (mostly because of the notion that isolation only comes in the physical form of being a shut-in). After isolation when the loneliness starts to kick in, Introverts turn to online communities (often gaming, facebook, or some forums) and extroverts have a tendency to turn to partying (MORE PEOPLE!) and often as a side-effect, alcohol and drugs, both confusing these activites with fulfilling social engagement; while they're really just turning into addicts of their own escape mechanisms which are only momentary reliefs from their feeling of loneliness, always feeling deep down inside like something is missing. The introverts that are isolated are usually physically isolated (shut-ins). While the extroverts that are isolated tend to be isolated mentally (closing themselves off; often without even realizing it) building superficial relationships that do not fulfill them.</p>

<p>We all have an instinct that tells us to interact with other people, an instinct that disregards whether that interaction is positive or negative (as we see for example in ""attention seekers"" that attract as much attention as they can without any regard for what kind of attention it is)</p>

"Is there research on effectiveness of teaching with high extraneous cognitive load?","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>While researching a particular author's mathematical exposition, I found out (directly from a primary source) that the author was probably intentionally using overly complex syntax. Purportedly, the idea was that 
 by producing a high <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load#Extraneous"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">extraneous cognitive load</a> the student would be subject to more ""mental exercise,"" deepening understanding and cementing concepts. This led me to the following line of inquiry.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>We all probably agree that cognitive load is the very nature of education, at least, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load#Intrinsic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">intrinsic cognitive load</a> is unavoidable. But does additional extrinsic cognitive load improve the learning outcomes for students? Doesn't it seem preferable to minimize extraneous cognitive load at all times, while ramping up the level of required intrinsic cognitive load?</p>

<p>However plausible the idea of ""more mental work means more mental muscles"" might be, I have to question its effectiveness. The success of students under these conditions might easily be explained by other traits such as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">grit</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there research that says high extraneous cognitive load (e.g. intentionally complex exposition) either improves or degrades learning outcomes (such as recall and retention) in some situations?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>I have two minor expository examples, but I hope they don't limit what you, the reader, may also have encountered like this elsewhere.</p>

<p>For example, something might be defined with a ""double negative"" pattern where there was already a (seemingly) simpler positive pattern: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A set $X$ is called <em>closed</em> if there is no limit point of $X$ which is not in $X$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Compare to: A set $X$ is called <em>closed</em> if every limit point of $X$ is in $X$.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if there exists a number $x$ which is not less than any element of $X$, then there is a least number which is not less than any element of $X$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Compare to: if there is a number $x$ which is greater or equal to every element of $X$, there is a least number which is greater or equal to every element of $X$.)</p>

<p>Another example is that some things are stated two or three layers deep: having a list of hypotheses, of which one bullet point is another list of hypotheses.  An example of that is a pattern of the form ""element of the set $X$ such that for all elements $y$ of the set $Y$, $y$ has the property that for every element of the set $Z$..."" (I still owe a better written example of this from what I was reading.) (I think something like that is usually simplified by modularizing definitions in a different way to bundle the layers separately before stacking.)</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>I was thinking of giving them two ""practice"" trials: one with a clearly audible signal (if they knew what the signal sounded like) and one that is noise alone. I would provide feedback on these trials in the case of an incorrect response. Is there any literature on if the signal or no signal trial should come first? In a run of 20 trials, is there an optimal number of catch (no signal) trials? Is there an optimal place in the track to put these catch trials?</p>

"How is ""socially gifted"" or ""social intelligence"" defined ""in a scientific way"" or ""semi-objectively""?","<p>Something that has puzzled me is the concept ""social intelligence"" or ""social giftedness"".</p>

<p>Partial illustration of problems:</p>

<ul>

<li>implies: e.g. both ""being good with people"" and ""being bad with people"" may be regarded as ""social intelligence"", just that their <em>goal</em> is different.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>both intelligence and giftedness are somewhat vague, because e.g. <em>valuation</em> of them is subjective and because people may not display these traits consistently (""a Ph.D. with 20 years of experience can still be wrong""). That which is intelligent for someone else might not be that for someone else. Unless one can devise some ""semi-objective"" measure (which is what I'm asking here).</p></li>
<li><p>Some people regard these concepts as ""being good with people"" or ""using right kind of communication techniques"". However, I find that these are not necessarily suitable for semi-scientific definition, because from these it's not a very long distance to <em>rhetorics</em>.</p></li>

<p>How is ""socially gifted"" or ""social intelligence"" defined ""in a scientific way"" or ""semi-objectively""?</p>

<p>Can there exist a ""right type"" of ""social intelligence""?

"Becoming an expert with accumulative hours of practice much less than the average expert?","<p>Anders Ericsson's work is famous for creating the idea of ""deliberate practice"" and its creation of experts, but Anders also talks about how long hours are inevitable in becoming an expert. Let's examine this on the standard of running. In 1960 a less than 5 minute mile was impossible, but now it's impressive but having a closer to 4 minute flat mile run is more impressive. We can maybe assume people didn't train as long as people do now to achieve that which would support Anders, but what if the variance in time spent training between 1960 runners and now is about the same, just that our training methodologies have allowed runners to easily surpass that speed. My question is what allows someone to become an expert in shorter time? What features of training methods IN ANY field (not just running) allows someone to acquire expertise in a field faster than other methodologies? Can we evaluate such methodologies?</p>

<p><em>“Well, if I showed you one object - one rock, say - you would not have to count it. You would just perceive its cardinality: you would know there was one object. The same thing happens with two objects. You just look at the pair of rocks and in a single glance, without any processing, you perceive that there are two of them present. You can do the same with three, four, or five items, if you are an average human. It is only when confronted with six or more items that you actually start counting them.”</em></p>

<p>Part of this occupation was blocking a bridge for car traffic, still allowing bicycles and pedestrians to pass.</p>

<p>At one point in time, the authorities decided to completely close one side of the bridge by using thick and high metal fences, no one could pass through any longer - and they were patrolling on the other side of the fence.</p>

<p>The event organizers decided to deploy ""peace-keepers"" on the other side of the bridge (the open one) so that people would be informed that it is really blocked - it was not really visible before almost traversing the bridge completely - and they were given a deviation-possibility and other help - friendly and non-violent!</p>

<p>What did I observe with individuals and couples (very biased of course):</p>

<p>Tourists (non-french) were very open and happy to be there, asked what all this is about and so on - no problem for using the deviation, some even participated in the event for some time.</p>

<p>Young, ""native"" people were partially very open, partially they did not want to listen (up to ignoring) to the help and had to learn it the hard way (when facing the fence).</p>

"Has sharing non peer reviewed sources decreased or increased beliefs in pseudoscience?","<p>I haven't found a detailed study of this, but here would be an example. If people shared a site that talked about the dangers of global warming, but wasn't peer reviewed, does this increase awareness, or does it actually give more credibility to global warming denial sites, since they are on equal footing, both being non peer reviewed? A global warming denialist argument is that a debate still exists, which has been good enough to cause skepticism and lack of action.</p>

<p>I know sites generally have incentives to get their articles or videos shared, so they would rather make their own summaries of scientific results, rather than just link to proper references. But pseudoscience sites can also reference peer reviewed sources, they just give their own interpretations of them. But why should anyone believe one site over another, since the standards for credibility are gone (which all of these sites perpetuate, pseudoscience or not)?</p>

<p>Or is it the case that non peer reviewed sites draw attention to issues in a way peer reviewed sources don't, and while there may be some collateral damage with lowering of standards, people are being swayed by pseudoscience sites either way?</p>

<p>Now, let's suppose we did our cross-sectional study and found that the cholesterol content of adults' diets decreased with age. We would then like to know why this is so. One possible answer is that people change their diets as they get older because they feel more vulnerable to heart disease. So we asked the oldest group, using the retrospective approach, if they feel more vulnerable and eat less high-cholesterol food today than they used to.
Sure enough, they said yes. But another reason for the current age differences in diet could be that the older adults never ate diets as high in cholesterol as those of the younger adults. So we asked the oldest group to describe the diets they ate 10 or 20 years ago. The diets they described contained <strong>less</strong> cholesterol than their current diets (which we already knew) and the current diets of the 35- and 45-year-olds in our study! This finding reflects the fact that the older subjects grew up at a different time, when food preferences or availability may have been different.</p>

"what causes an action potential to propagate exactly and why should it propagate?","<p>Hello I am taking a neurophysiology course and learned about the action potential and that it propagates in one direction from axon hillock down along the axon. 
I understand that action potential is simply the voltage difference caused by influx of Na+ ions causing the inside of the cell relatively more positive</p>

<p>My questions is why/how does action potential propagate? <strong>why should it propogate?</strong></p>

<p>If at one site where a sodium channel opens to depolarize, and k+ channel polarize the cell to membrane potential <strong>at that site</strong>, how does this affect the next neighboring ion channels down the axons to open and close? Why doesn't it just cause an action potential at one section of the membrane and stop? What exactly causes the neighboring ion channels to open continuously as well after the previous one open and closes? </p>

<p>Textbooks just says 'it propagates down the axon' but never mentions why it should and why should the previous ion channel configuration affect the next region of the membrane. I guess this might be a rather dumb question but I hope I did not confuse you, I realize my questions is a bit odd?</p>

I find in the book's references that his writing is based on papers older than the one I have linked, but the book is of an edition written more recently than the paper. He mentions that he has spent his entire life in the field of emotion and motivation, so are the ones in the paper i linked still debated?</p>

<p>What is the current view on which emotions to exist, as an industry standard and/or are the most accurate, and that I should model my view of human emotions to fit?</p>

"What could be the cause of behavioural or personality change?","<p>One of my close friends is having a behavioural or perosnality change. He used to be polite and civil but these days (since about 10 months) he is very aggresive and mean. He has been recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism and is on medication currently. I do not know if thyroid disorder is causing this or not. We used to discuss a lot of things. We loved to discuss a lot of things. We never had problems. We both were open minded. But nowadays, he ,especially in discussions, is very aggresive. Even if presented with facts or his own previous assertions he become very agitated. He tries to put the blame on others. What is more shocking is that he accepts the evidence and says the evidence supports him even though it contradicts him. This is not a one-time incident. It is happening everytime. We are so exhausted. There is no way for us to compromise either. He comes up with different line of arguments. Even if we decide not to argue on a particular stuff he accepts and immediately comes up with arguments. Literally, anything becomes an argument aggresively. If I make a remark like, ""there is too much traffic today"", then he immediately picks up and yells at me. He asks, what do you think is a city? don't you know there are traffic jams? Don't be the frog on well. Don't you learn anything ever in your life? Did you ever stepped out of your home? If I apologize. He would accept and again after few minutes or later the same day will send statistics on traffic jams in city and reignite the arguments. </p>

One might quickly become suspicious if the supposed delusions are only tied to a single acquaintance. But for people who are already slightly schizophrenic, it would be much easier to exaggerate their symptoms. Aside from cases of actual intentional gaslightings, schizophrenic people may tend to be paranoid and form beliefs that they are manipulated.</p>

"Correlationships between food choice and personality","<p>There are known attempts to correlate the personality of an individual with their choice of a color or a shape - something which I have asked about <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/19510/establishing-personality-from-shape-and-color-preferences"">here</a> and am using in an app that I am delveoping.  I am now starting to ask myself whether there are any formal studies that attempt to correlate common food choices with personality.  I have come across a few useful ideas by simply googling for ""food choice and personality"".  e.g. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.10.003"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Keller &amp; Siegrist (2015)</a>. and <a href=""https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/general-health/food-choices-and-eating-habits-says-your-personality.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Zayed (n.d.)</a></p>

<p>However, neither of those articles to my mind comes close to being a formal study of the subject.  In the context of my own app I am wondering whether I can augment its understanding of its user by adding - to an existing list of personality acquisition questions - a request to select from, say, images that show</p>

<ul>
<li>A burger</li>
<li>An apple</li>
<li>A chocolate bar</li>
<li>A chili pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that I am using many other personality assessment measures I would imagine that even without any known prior art on the subject I will in due course be able to glean something useful from an answer here.  However, I would be most grateful to anyone who might be able to point me to any formal, peer-reviewed studies on the subject.</p>

"What techniques can be used to differentiate between correlation and causation?","<p>Psychology is unique among other medical sciences in that it cannot ask test participants to like, prefer or support something. As such a vast body of psychological studies are purely observational and can find correlation but not causation.</p>

<p>For example if there is a link between self-awareness and empathy, how to test if being more empathetic increases self-awareness, being more self-aware increases empathy, or, let's say, level of some hormone control both and they are otherwise independent of each other?</p>

<h1>Problem</h1>

<p>Let's compare those two situations:</p>

<ol>
<li>A study found that people who eat a lot of sugar are fat. How researchers can test whether <strong>a)</strong> eating sugar makes people fat <strong>b)</strong> being fat makes people eat more sugar or <strong>c)</strong> both sugar consumption and body fat are influenced by the same external factor?</li>
<li>A study found that people who like yellow color are more likely to be psychopaths. How researchers can test whether <strong>a)</strong> liking yellow turns people into psychopaths <strong>b)</strong> being a psychopath makes people like yellow <strong>c)</strong> being a psychopath and liking yellow are both influenced by the same external factor?</li>
</ol>

<p>In first scenario the answer is easy - split test subjects into two groups, force one group to restrict sugar intake and monitor their weight, help second group lose weight and monitor their sugar intake.</p>

<p>In second - I cannot find the answer. Because psychology generally concerns itself with what people are as opposed to what they do, the standard approach in medicine described above cannot be utilized. Researchers can't force someone to like yellow, neither can they turn someone into a psychopath.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>When researchers find a statistical correlation between character traits or preferences, how do they test whether there is a causal relationship between those characteristic, if traits cannot be adjusted?</p>

"Timing accuracy in presentation of videos with different frame rates (with COGENT)","<p>For our fMRI study we want to present videos of 3 seconds duration. The videos have <strong>different frame rates:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>48 videos were recorded with 50 fps</p></li>
<li><p>16 videos were recorded with 25fps</p></li>
<li>64 videos were recorded with 30 fps</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I'm now faced with the problem that the videos are not presented for 3 seconds.</strong> The videos are either extended or shortened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>48 videos (50 fps): extended  (maximum extension between +6ms to
+10ms)</p></li>
<li><p>16 videos (25 fps): shortened (maximung shortening between -17ms and
-20ms)</p></li>
<li><p>64 videos (30 fps): shortened (maximung shortening between -17ms and
-20ms)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For this reason I assumed that the problem is caused by the different frame rates of the videos. But then I discovered that the extent of the extended or shortened presentation is changing from presentation to presentation and independent of the videos. So for example: Video1 is presented for 3006ms instead of 3000ms during the first presentation. During the next presentation Video1 is presented for 3008ms instead of 3000ms and so on.</p>

<p>Another problem is the presentation of a blank screen between each stimulus. It is set to range between 3000ms and 5000ms in varying steps of 250ms. Here I noticed an extended presentation ranging from +16ms up to 30 ms.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Any ideas what might cause this timing deviation?</li>
<li>Does this have to do with the hardware of the stimulus presentation
computer?</li>
</ul>

<p>The refresh rate of the stimulus presentation computer is set to 60Hz. The computer is connected to a projector for the fMRI measurements (but the timing deviations do also occur when I present the stimuli full screen on the stimulus presentation laptop).</p>

"What are science-based methods to memorize large sets of best practices?","<p>I am a writer. In every book about writing fiction there are some recommendations, which I need to remember during the process of writing. Examples of best practices may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>In every scene, it is necessary to describe where the characters are, what they look like (incl. how they are dressed), what time is it, plus information that competing media cannot replicate (smells -- books compete with movies and describing smells is one way to make a book more immersive than a movie).</li>
<li>Balance of description and action: Two paragraphs of description, then something must happen.</li>
<li>You cannot just tell what happens like a journalist. Instead, you need to paint a picture by using metaphors and comparisons.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are scientifically proven strategies to memorize long list of items (best practices in this case)?</p>

<p>I know I could do a giant checklist of text improvement processes and go through it while editing every chapter. I already tried that and it didn't work that well. There were over a hundred methods from different books, organized by writing stage (ideation, plotting, writing first draft, editing).</p>

<p>I'm using <a href=""https://apps.ankiweb.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anki</a> to increase my vocabulary (I'm not an English native speaker) and would like to have something similar for lists of best practices. However, Anki isn't really suitable for this purpose because it trains your ability to give correct answers to questions (not remember a set of best practices at a certain stage of writing).</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/1895/memorizing-sets-of-items"">another question</a> the use of flash cards was suggested. If I understand it correctly, this method requires me to create a flash card with following data:</p>

<p>Question: What things do you need to do at the beginning of chapter design phase?</p>

<p>Answer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define the event that the chapter is describing.</li>
<li>Write down the beat sheet.</li>
<li>Find on the Internet the images of places and objects that are featured in this chapter.</li>
<li>Write down the goals of the chapter.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is fine, if the list of items is relatively small. But what if there are 40 or 100 things that I can do at the beginning of a phase (chapter design in this case) and I want to remember them all without a checklist?</p>

<p>An answer to <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/1378/what-does-the-literature-suggest-about-the-optimal-strategy-for-quickly-memorizi"">this question</a> suggests attaching emotions to the things I want to memorize. I probably could invent some stories to memorize. But I still don't feel like this is the ""full solution"" (even if I invent stories that trigger my emotions for every of the 100 best practices, I am still not sure that I will remember them all).</p>

"Is the belief that a consultant knows more than the team a form of cognitive bias?","<p>I've noticed that many people assume that consultants know more than they themselves do and/or more than their team does.  That is, when a team is stuck on a problem, some people believe that a consultant can figure it out even without knowing that consultant. True, more heads might help, but I've also seen teams who believe everything a consultant says, especially at the beginning of the relationship yet scrutinize the people they work with.  Why?</p>

<p>I've read about the <strong>halo effect</strong> <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in Wikipedia</a>, which contains the statement, ""The halo effect is a type of immediate judgement discrepancy, or cognitive bias, where a person making an initial assessment of another person, place, or thing will assume ambiguous information based upon concrete information.""</p>

<p>This would suggest to me that any concrete information can bias someone when filling in the ambiguous information.  However, reading more about the halo effect, it seems mainly focused on how people <em>look</em>.</p>

<p><em>Misconception</em>, as he explains, is when we misunderstand a certain part of a problem because of how we are used to seeing it or because of how it is presented.</p>

Is there some resource which tracks the replication status of psychological research and collects the different effects which are reproducible (and which aren't)? </p>

<p>EDIT: I was able to find the following which is actually pretty close to what I was looking for. This is not a complete list but it is the kind of thing that I am after.</p>

"Research operationalizing so-called strategic thinking?","<p>Is there contemporary research in trait psychology, which attempts to operationalize the structures behind a strategic thinking style? I'm thinking of a style of problem solving as taught in officer training, and to a lesser extent, manifesting in strategically-oriented games like chess. </p>

<p>I realize that this sounds perhaps a little vague. However, in common usage it's not unusual to refer to a person's being a ""strategic thinker"" or a ""problem solver"". I wanted to know whether these traits have been studied or deconstructed in a more formal capacity, so as to define them in a manner consistent with trait psychology. </p>

<p><strong>Are there scientific definitions of strategic thinking with empirical support?</strong></p>

"Best way to capture effect of making people upset?","<p>I am an undergrad, I am planning to do some research to see how much I enjoy it before I apply for graduate programs.</p>

<p>I am researching the effects of a certain characteristic of a presenter making people upset, uncomfortable, aggravated or displeased during a short clip like a TV commercial.  My plan is to have subjects watch a short clip with a presenter and see if they are they aggravated, upset, uncomfortable with the presenter based on that one characteristic changing and compare this across demographics.  I do not have much experience with setting up and performing experiments.</p>

<p>How do I quantify how upset, uncomfortable, aggravated, or displeased the subject felt?</p>

"Why only 16 Jungian types? Combinatorially it should be 2 * 4! = 48","<p>The seeming elegance and symmetry of the table of functions prompted me to use a technical side of my brain to ask a ""what if"" question about the other possible Jungian functions.</p>

<p>I used combinatorics(math) to calculate all possibilities of arranging letters F,S,T,N as well as adding an alternating i/e ""flavor"". There are two options for the flavors (once we know the i/e ""flavor"" of the first function, the rest are determined because they alternate).</p>

<p>For illustration, I enumerated one quarter of all possibilities (only those starting with an F but you can keep going yourself if you like). The original 16 types are listed below that. As you can see, there are many gaps - only 4 of 12 used here and 16 of 48 used overall. So, exactly 1/3 utilization. The mathematical elegance is a tease, makes me think that this theory is based on something real, but is it? Could it be an elegant accident or an elaborate hoax instead? Why are some combinations not possible?</p>

"A type of long-term memory where I can remember full dialogues","<p>My female colleague cannot remember a discussion (dialogue) from a couple days ago or even yesterday, much less the full, exact sentences spoken. She jokes about having sclerosis. I can remember many dialogues from the last couple of years and even further, including the exact sentences – not all the dialogues from my life, but like 80% of those which were interesting, odd, or very funny, or made at least small impact in my life. Is this kind of long memory normal in people? Does it have a name?

"Importance of Neural Synchrony to Cognition","<p>Is there a consensus on whether computation using Neural Synchrony is reasonable or not? In ""How to Build a Brain"", Chris Eliasmisth cites Yuko Munakata and R. C. O'Reilly as saying that ""the available evidence does not establish that the observed synchrony of firing
is actually used for binding,instead of being an epiphenomenon"" to dismiss current architectures such as LISA and DORA which use synchrony. Yet, there still seems to be papers published on using <a href=""http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002561#abstract0"">neural synchrony for computation</a>. Additionally, <a href=""http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/molecules.html"">Thagard</a> still seems convinced of their importance saying that ""spiking neurons have psychologically important qualitative properties such as becoming synchronized with each other, and neural synchrony has been proposed as a crucial ingredient in inference, analogy, and consciousness"".</p>

<p>Are the authors of these new papers naive or is there convincing evidence for the meaningfulness of synchrony that Chris and I are missing here?</p>

"does getting top marks and ranks in school or college make one intelligent?","<p>Please do not discuses about IQ tests that have problems like: 2,4,8,16,... what is the next number? having the answer as 32, because one can relate any number of random numbers mathematically! Whenever I ask this question to someone they would just say: yes!  getting top marks and ranks in school or college does make one intelligent because they could just score a top rank in IQ tests!</p>

<p>This paradox about such IQ tests not being correct can obviously be reasoned, but are top rank holders in proper subjects at school or college more intelligent than the rest of the students?</p>

<p>I agree upon the fact that there can be diverse definitions for the word ""intelligent"". The definition I use for the term intelligent is: a person who has the ability to learn any kind of subject that involves reasoning and extend his abilities to be able to develop that subject**; time frame is not a problem in my definition. To be elegant, I believe that one who has the ability to learn and research on any subject is intelligent. I do not consider people who could do stuff any computer program can do, as the existence of an algorithm to solve that task makes that task less imaginative but could involve high calculation ability (a weight lifter is different from a martial artist) . Scientists haven't achieved human level intelligence in machines and that makes me set machines as my reference point for intelligence.     </p>

<p>please provide references enough to convince me and others on your answer.</p>

<p>*lets imagine relating a series 2,4,8,16,111; to do this we would first have to define a 5th degree polynomial with unknown coefficient values. equate: $f(1) = 2, f(2) = 4,...f(5) =111$. Its obviously possible to solve and get 4 values for each coefficients and the rest 2 coefficients end up being linearly related to each other (substitute any value other than zero for one and get the other). So hence you have a polynomial relating 2,4,8,16,111! </p>

<p>**when I say ""develop that subject"" I do not mean writing books and teaching, but I refer to the method of using one's creativity to enlighten themselves on the deepest regions of that subject.    </p>

<p>P.S. also please suggest the best possible ways to measure one's intelligence.   </p>

<h1>update:</h1>

<p>could you also please explain why we rely on tests that do not have defined answers to its questions <em>for measuring one's IQ</em>? Whenever I see a question that first gives a series like 2, 4, 6, 8. ? and ask for the missing number, I would be tempted to write 15356346546434 instead of 10 and form a polynomial relation that expresses the term in the series given its term number (like $f(n)$ would express the $n^{th}$ term). </p>

<p>I have also seen IQ question papers with questions that has a star drawn on with random numbers displayed within each blank loop we find within the star and a question mark in one of the blank loops which asks for the answer. Even they have arbitrary answers.     </p>

"How does the timing work out for dopamine to affect the development of long-term potentiation?","<p>I just recently learned (indirectly from <a href=""http://cnl.salk.edu/~terry/BGGN/reynolds.NN.02.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this source</a>) that long-term potentiation/depression only takes place when you have large/small amounts of dopamine present at the relevant synapse. However, my understanding is that early in the process of learning behavior, dopamine isn't released until after a reward is received. If I'm a monkey who has to look one way or the other to get some juice, by the time I drink the juice and get the resulting dopamine, the neurons I used to move my eye are presumably not firing any more, right? So then how does this work? Is it that:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's a slow bootstrapping process. Something like: first the
monkey has to learn that the taste of juice leads to the reward of
sugar. Then the monkey has to learn that the sight of juice
correlates to the taste, and extend the chain one step further,
etc., etc., such that by the time you actually have the monkey in
the lab there's a very small inferential step needed to plug into a
larger reward chain.</li>
<li>The neurons don't actually stop firing. There is some sort of
system in play that keeps the neurons firing afterwards, waiting for
fluctuations in dopamine level to tell it whether or not it should
increase or decrease long term potentiation.</li>
<li>Something I haven't thought of?</li>

"OCD Motivation and Dopamine Motivation, is there a connection?","<p>I understand that OCD is something that causes sufferers to perform irrational behavour consciously, I also understand that the motivation comes from performing the irrational behaviour/behaviours to release the anxiety experienced. </p>

<p>Although, what causes sufferers to pursue specific goals whether it be career choice, physical achievement, etc. ? According to my (hopefully trustworthy) sources the neurotransmitter ""dopamine"" plays a huge part in motivation, setting the bar high and making people do whatever it takes to reach that goal of ""happiness"" or ""achievement"". </p>

"Body Language: Why do we give each other the grumpy/frowning fake smile?","<p>I've recently become aware of this - I kinda knew I was always doing it, but just now it got me self conscious and thinking about it:</p>

<p>When crossing paths with a stranger, you are supposed to be friendly and smile at them, acknowledge them through a nod, and so on. </p>

<p>This is particularly the case in many service industries: </p>

<p>grocery stores - associates and customers acknowledging each other (not during checkout, but just walking around in the store)</p>

<p>fellow gym members as well as staff and members (again only walking around, not during particular business related interactions)</p>

<p>Another example might be you walk in a public bathroom and someone just comes out the door, you'll look each other briefly in the eyes, ""smile"", nod, acknowledge each other, and move on.</p>

<p>Now here's the thing I've become aware of, and mostly guys do this:</p>

<p><strong>We don't actually smile.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, we are kind of grumpy looking. Our mouth and eyebrows go into a frown, we press our lips together, and the only thing close to a smile that we do is to create a crease on the sides of our mouth.</p>

<p>Hard to explain... And hard to find actual pictures of this...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/weIfY.jpg"" alt=""3""></p>

<p>besides that he looks in the distance and he looks concerned, but imagine he looks at you and gives you a nod like that. pretty close!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yaDnf.png"" alt=""1""></p>

<p>he looks slightly more surprised, and worried, then what people usually look like, especially because the eyebrows are going up.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/fjNzS.jpg"" alt=""4""></p>

<p>he's got too much ""darnit!"" on his face, and his eyes are sad looking, but again, the general idea comes across.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qtf3I.jpg"" alt=""2""></p>

<p>he has an actual upward curved smile going on, but definietly the lips pressed together like that</p>

<p>So again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mostly guys do it</li>
<li>it is done for acknlowledgement/politeness when you cross paths</li>
<li>it usually goes with a nod and brief eye contact, whereas the nod goes down</li>
<li>the eyebrows might seem kind of like a frown, since you're noding down, while looking upwards in the persons eyes</li>
<li>your lips are pressed together</li>
<li>often the mouth will actually go into a reverse smile curve (meaning frown)</li>
<li>the mouth gets kinda pulled to the sides, like we're making a wide mouth, just like when smiling.</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all: Do you know what I'm talking about? Do you do it? Has it been done to you?</p>

<p>Does it have a proper name?</p>

<p>Why do we do it? Why don't we actually smile? We do we look rather grumpy when smiling like that? </p>

<p>I've noticed that we do a similar face in many different situations. Sometimes someone might tell you something that might make you smile or even laugh, but to them it's rather sincere, so you press your lips together, trying to make a frown, but you still can't help to smile a little.
There are many expressions that this kind of face can express (as you can see in the pictures), they all have a certain subtle difference to them, and definitely very different meanings, but I feel as if the mouth pressed together and kinda mixing a grin with a frown remains constant. The particular facial expression I am talking about is also accompanied by a nod, making it distinct.</p>

<p>Why do we do this so often?</p>

<p>Are we hiding something? Is this some sort of a default expression?</p>

<p>My question is: <em>could be functional to these subjects to read a book which tries to change their beliefs? At least could it be used to speed-up the therapy?</em></p>

<p>It could be described as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>The subject feels ashamed, weak or ""bad"" on some area. He develops the belief to be superior to others on another area (strong, very rational).</li>
<li>The subject feel a strong need to defend this superiority. Any attempt to change his belief is perceived as an aggression.</li>
<li>The strategy of defense include: use of cognitive distortion to confirm his belief, discrediting of the other idea, personal offence or provocation, getting annoyed and emotional, focusing on everything but his error / responsibility / distorted belief</li>
<li>The subject usually raise the level of the argument in an emotional way. He appears completely stubborn or use verbal strategy to obstacle the interlocutor. He appeals to any formal argumentative error.</li>
<li>The subject claim to be unique and use typical ""excuses"" connected to relativism like: ""why should I change?"". But actually he use relativism only when it comes to be useful to justify his own belief. Otherwise his beliefs appears very absolute and dichotomic.</li>

"Can the Philosophy thought game ""The experience machine"" be answered by Positive Psychology?","<p>In Philosophy, a thought game exists called ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">The experience machine</a>"" {1}. In summary, it's a machine you plug into that enables you to always experience positive events, and never negative ones.</p>

<p>One of the <a href=""http://reflectyourthoughts.tumblr.com/post/16160595846/too-much-of-a-good-thing-can-be-a-bad-thing-my"" rel=""nofollow"">common arguments</a> not to plug into this machine is that if you never experience lows, you can't appreciate heights, since they would become the norm. This line of reasoning is known as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill"" rel=""nofollow"">Hedonic treadmill</a>.</p>

<p>In Positive Psychology the concept of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_psychology#Changes_in_happiness_levels"" rel=""nofollow"">Baseline level of happiness</a> {2} exists. It has been shown {3} this baseline can be raised, or lowered, but the research I know of does not discuss the effect of removing negative experiences to increase the baseline. It focuses on other factors, like intrinsic motivation, self-esteem, and so on.</p>

<p>Knowing about baseline happiness, and the trend to fall/rise back to it; what would happen if you never had negative experiences? The argument against using the experience machine basically assumes the baseline would plummet if there are no negative experiences, or at least become quite low.</p>

<p>My line of thinking, and hypothesis is that there is no need for negative experiences in order to appreciate positive ones. Since, if you don't experience anything negative for a week, you can still experience joy that week, a month... a year... a life? If you are never unpleasantly hungry, you can still appreciate a good meal. </p>

<p>Now to the actual question(s):</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any research that shows the effect of ""lack of negative experiences"" on the baseline level of happiness?</li>
<li>Are you better able to enjoy nice experiences in the light of negative ones? </li>
<li>Is there research on the relation between the two?</li>
<li>Has this research ever been applied in Philosophy to try and answer the Experience machine puzzle?</li>

"Is the eye direction language dependent on the direction of writing?","<p>I've read from various sources about the <strong>eye direction language</strong>. What is of my special interest now, is:</p>

<li><strong>the past</strong> is on the <strong>left</strong>, looking left means looking into past</li>

"Does empathy extend to animals?","<p>I've read that humans are able to empathize with other humans, to feel as another person does, through mirror neurons. I'm guessing that they're able to empathize with primates too, as they share similar brains, have similar limbs, faces, etc. So, when someone watches a monkey or child drink juice, they can empathize some of the joy of drinking juice.</p>

<p>But what about a human empathizing with less humanoid animals? Can a person who has developed a personal bond with say, a horse, 'feel' the same way as the horse does? Can one understand the joy of a cat eating its favorite food?</p>

"What computerized EEG analysis algorithms are there?","<p>I got a commercial-grade EEG headband and am trying to look at the data it outputs. The headband quantifies raw EEG signal from a single forehead dry sensor into a range of EEG bands (alpha, beta, etc). The issue that I'm running into is that the values of the EEG bands jump rather significantly from one data point to the next (0.05 second reading intervals). Additionally, there are eye-related artifacts.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iey9z.png"" alt=""sample EEG reading""></p>

<p><strong>I would like to apply some sort of algorithm or statistical analysis to see how the EEG bands behave over some time interval</strong>.  I'm hoping to see if some EEG band statistically rises or is suppressed over 5-15min time period. Seeing instantaneous jumps in individual readings does not convey this information. </p>

<p>For example, I know that for Actigraphic studies, there are sleep scoring algorithms, like one by Cole that looks at the previous 4 minutes, the current minute and 2 minutes in the future to score a minute of actigraphy data: </p>

<pre><code> SleepScoreConstant*
(550*4minAgo + 378*3minAgo + 413*2minAgo + 699*1minAgo 
+1736*CurrentMinute  + 
287*1minAhead + 309*2minAhead)
</code></pre>

<p>Are there some similar algorithms for EEG band analysis?</p>

<p>Alternatively, it would help if you can suggest the realistic time window over which EEG bands may be statistically analyzed in awake subjects: is it 20 seconds? 5 minutes? 90 minutes? </p>

<p>I do a decent amount of tutoring, and this is one phenomenon I see popping up constantly, and I occasionally catch myself doing the same thing, though less often since I've become aware of it</p>

<p>What happens is a student learns a new concept/formula/algorithm in class and then does practice or assignment questions. They will then come up to me and ask me to check their work because the answer they are getting doesn't make sense, or doesn't line up with a known answer. Sometimes, they will even have spent hours double or triple checking their work on this new formula.</p>

<p>I will look over their work and confirm its correctness. I have learned to ask ""Can I see the work you did to get to this point?"" They then show me this work, and most of the time, there is a simple arithmetic error or oversight (and if its a misunderstanding of previous material, then its a whole other issue).</p>

<p>What has happened is that the assignment question involves multiple steps, the student makes a simple error in an early step, and assumes the error to be in the later steps involving the newly taught equations, and wastes hours looking for an error there.</p>

<p>My related questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this phenomenon have a name, and if so what is it?</li>

"What is the bias/thought process that results in distrust of ""formal"" knowledge in favor of ""folk"" knowledge?","<p>An interesting effect I've noticed is that certain groups of people seem to accept ""folk knowledge"" and value it over significantly better founded ""formal"" or scientific knowledge. In particular this is notable in many discussions of Psychology and vaccinations. Scientific evidence is clearly on one side, but an odd distrust seems to exist for some which makes the unproven or disproven ""folk"" knowledge more acceptable to them.</p>

<p>This effect seems sort of like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority"">Illusory Superiority</a>, but it seems to not quite be that; Illusory Superiority is the tendency of one person to overestimate <em>their own</em> abilities or knowledge.

<p><strong>Fantasy distractor definition:</strong> Usually one chooses distractors that a student could confuse with the correct answer, based on knowledge of common cognitive models of the field.

<p><strong>Potential concerns:</strong> How high is the risk that students remember the fantasy distractor? What is the best practice on  such fantasy items? </p>

<p><strong>Rationale for having fantasy items:</strong> The reason for asking is that it seems having a greater number of distractors can make the test more of a retrieval test than a recognition test. Getting plausible non-fantasy distractors (eg in chemistry can be tough). </p>

"How to measure dominance and submissiveness?","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Interpersonal dimensions of personality (Sullivan, 1953) have been described in a circular model, the interpersonal circumplex, since Leary (1957). The two dimensions that define this circumplex are warmheartedness(pleasantness) versus coldheartedness and dominance versus submissiveness. Two better known measures based on Leary's concept are Mehrabian's Trait Dominance-Submissiveness (Mehrabian &amp; Hines, 1978) and Trait Pleasure-Displeasure Scales (Mehrabian, 1978) (which combine with a Trait Arousability Scale, Mehrabian, 1977, into the PAD; Mehrabian, 1996b), and the Interpersonal Adjective Scale (IAS-R; Wiggins, Trapnell &amp; Philips, 1988).</p>

<p>If you analyse the dominance/submissiveness scales from these instruments, it becomes clear that dominance is here understood to be the <em>ability to assert oneself</em>, while submissiveness is the complementary <em>inability</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The 26 items of the Trait Dominance-Submissiveness Scale ... assessed the generalised feelings of control and influence over one's relationships and life circumstances (e.g. 'I control situations rather than let them control me' (+), 'I work best when someone has outlined a job for me' (-), or 'Domineering people don't intimidate me' (+)). (Mehrabian, 1996a)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The adjectives related to submissiveness in the IAS-R make this negative construct of submissiveness even more clear: timid, bashful, shy, forceless, are four of the eight self-descriptors from this scale.</p>

<p>Contrary to this perspective on submissiveness as incompetent and powerless, other conceptions are possible: some egalitarian individuals might not be unable to dominate others, but simply unwilling; some loving individuals might find fulfillment in selfless devotion; and with the ever expanding service economy, hopefully professional service providers enjoy serving their customers – it would be a dismal life for a majority of us, if we didn't.</p>

<p>Submissive pleasure is an important factor in certain forms of romantic relationships, from the wife choosing a traditional provider/facilitator-household in feminist times to the happy spanking BDSM couple.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Are there measures, scales or instruments that measure a positive, joyful concept of submissiveness, as it is conceived by BDSM?</p>

<p>If not, is there a measure of the ""service provider personality""?</p>

"Drawing Parallels Between Finance and Psychology: A Psychology Metaphor","<p>This question starts out with some finance theory to set the scene:</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Let's consider the stock price of Google (the value of holding a share in Google). The volatility in Google's stock price is the degree of variation in that price. An implied volatility can be derived from the market price of an option.</p>

<p>An option is an instrument which gives the buyer a right to buy or sell a particular stock in the future at a particular price, if they want to. Volatility is one of the inputs required to price (determine the correct value) of an option. It is the range in which a a stock price is expected to fluctuate.</p>

<p>Organisations are often considered as organisms. Organic metaphors are often used to describe how organisations work.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>If I was to use psychology to create a metaphor for volatility, what theory could I use?</p>

<p>If stock price is an individuals self worth or self esteem and an option price is their outlook on what their self worth might be at a point in the future. Finance theory would suggest that a correct view of future self worth would require something comparable to volatility.</p>

"What are some things that may explain feeling on ""auto-pilot"" the majority of the time in life?","<p>Assuming an individual is physically fit and does not experience abnormalities related to lack of circulation, obesity, or immune disease...what on a neurological level is the basis for feeling like life is on ""auto-pilot"" for most of the time.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A case study who is well known, is an intelligent individual. He is a male, Caucasian computer scientist under no duress such as financial problems, lack of romance or friendships, lack of nutrition, etc. This individual has the ability to learn things quickly, solve problems robustly, and can pick up spoken languages quickly. However, from experience, any small perturbations in his sleep cycle will cause him to be very, very agitated, very impulsive, have anxiety, and crash/melt down if sustained without sleep for long. By slight perturbation, I mean not an all nighter, but something many people around the world go through from time to time, like two back to back 5 hour nights. In detailed interviews, the person has admitted to feeling like life is on ""auto-pilot"" most of the time. They cannot explain their actions for every day tasks, and although self admittedly pious (but not overly extremist), wonders if their life is just a multivariable system, one in which everything around them from their coffee cop to their car are just ""elements"" in a set they call reality, with in their own words, ""have properties that detail information relative to to other elements"". This person communicates very, very well with others, to the point that they are seen as one of the most social people in mutual inner circles. This person is non violent and does not have any habits or crimes. This person has a high libido. In times of stress, or at random times, this person randomly will text a few close loved ones, ""Do you love me?"" or ""Are you mad?"".  </p>

"Is depression part of who a person is?","<p>I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, commonly known as depression.</p>

<p>Some days ago I had a discussion with my therapist about whether or not depression is part of the person I am. She says that indeed it is and that I should accept it as a part of my being. I should not fight it, but rather accept it. I should not see it as a ""demon"" trying to mess with my life, but rather as a part of me asking for attention, rising from the dark depths of my mind where I try to bury it. It is a helpess child, my own inner child, crying and asking for help for only apparently no reason, and I should not ""beat it up"" and yell at it to ""go back into its room"", but rather ask what's wrong and cuddle it. </p>

<p>I disagree, as I think that I <em>have</em> depression, but I <em>am not</em> my depression. I'm <em>suffering from</em> a depressive episode, but I <em>am not</em> a depressed person, as I am a completely different human being when I'm not going through an episode. I <em>have</em> an illness, I <em>am not</em> my illness. I might come to terms with the fact that I indeed have depression and that I have to deal with it, but this doesn't mean accepting it as a part of me. I fight it as I fight a flu or a cold. I accept the fact that I have come into contact with the virus, I can't be mad for that, I can't just willingly remove it from my body simply because I don't want it, but that illness is not a <em>part</em> of me, though it affects my everyday life and forces me to feel and act in ways I'd rather not.</p>

<p>You might ask to clarify what I mean with ""part of who a person is"", so let me try to explain further: is depression part of someone's personality, consciousness, temper, character? Or is it, as a disease, a negative and abnormal <em>influence</em> on someone's regular and healthy behavior?

"Which features of concept mapping are more helpful than outlining, or vice versa? and why?","<p>Please let us know any studies that compare features of concept mapping with outlining. Many studies have reported both outlining and concept mapping helpful for learning and assessment, but they looked at them as black-boxes. On one hand, although outlining has been around for longer, there are significantly more studies that indicate the effectiveness of concept mapping for learning and assessment. On the other hand, outlining is more widely used among students and researchers. Then, what are the features that differentiate them? Are there specific features that are helpful for some applications but not others?</p>

<p>Here is what we already know:
Miyatsu et al. [1] define the following procedure for outlining:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the entirety of the original passage.</li>
<li>Keep in mind how the author structures ideas.</li>
<li>Identify main ideas.</li>
<li>Structure main ideas in the outline.</li>
<li>Use outline as a cue to retrieve information.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps are very similar to the procedure advised by Novak and Cañas [2, 3] about designing a good concept map. Especially, steps three and four in the outlining procedure correspond to the progressive differentiation and integrative reconciliation processes defined in Ausubel's Assimilation theory [4], which are the foundation of the concept mapping.
Mayer [5] found outlines as ""advance organizers"" helpful to facilitate ""bridging,"" i.e., the thinking process one goes through to connect the new knowledge with what they already know [1]. This thinking process results in meaningful learning that is shown to be improved through concept mapping [2]. Lehman et al. [6] compared outlining with concept mapping, but found no significant differences between their uses, although results were leaning towards greater improvements with the mapping condition. Also, Bui and McDaniel [7] compared the use of skeletal outlines to illustrative diagrams in improving free recall and short-answer questions; while both conditions were significantly effective for free recall compared to a control, those using illustrative diagrams had performed significantly better than students using skeletal outlines, particularly for low-ability learners. Therefore, free recall may not depend on how students organize or visualize information, but it does effectively change improvements in short answer questions. Kiewra [8] compared using matrices against outlining on comparative information, with the former having visual properties that allow users to create relationships between different categories of information that the latter often overlooks. Hansell [9] suggested the use of ""post organizers"" or ""arrays,"" which use a combination of ""words, lines, and arrows,"" similar to that of concept maps. This was shown to have significantly improved the ability for students to outline as it focuses on ""identifying relevant ideas and fitting these into a meaningful pattern."" As a result, the visualization of information may have played a large role in enabling students to process information to a deeper level.</p>

"Confidence helps me, a lot. But why/how?","<p>I'm a competitive shooter (clay pigeon shooting). Performance in this sport is hugely dependent upon many different facets of a shooter's mental approach. I've realised different parts of my mental state at that time really influence my ability to get into that 'flow state' and effortlessly score high.</p>

<p>One of the biggest aspects I've started playing on lately (with significant results) is confidence. I've found telling myself to relax because this is an easy shot for me, and convincing myself I'm the best in the competition and the targets are easy is usually self-fulfilling.</p>

<p>What are the mechanics behind this being so effective?</p>

<p>I've read various articles and watched videos regarding 'hypofrontality' whereby the pre-frontal cortex being too active can cause you to overthink something that should be instinctive. I'm interested in how, specifically, this is the case.</p>

<p>How is our instinct more capable than our conscious and how (specfically) does that over-conscious type of approach influence instinct so much? Is it that we're only capable of taking one approach (either conscious or sub conscious) at a time and choosing the former means we're not maximising performance?</p>

"Common latent feature among all ""memory techniques""","<p>So I've been delving into ""memory techniques"" and people who compete in memory competitions(memorizing and reciting a poem in a small amount of time, memorizing a deck of cards, memorizing pi, etc). I've read books written by competitors as well as blogs in the community and have up with this list of techniques that are generally accepted as used in a competitive setting.</p>

<ul>
<li>Memory Palace: You allocate what you're trying to memorize into a visualization of a place you are familiar with</li>
<li>Pegging: You link one piece of information to another by getting an association even if the two subjects are not related(memorizing your grocery list by remembering your first item in the list is ""pickle"" and that rhymes with ""sickle"" which is used to cut grain so you deduce the 2nd item is ""rice"")</li>
<li>Projecting: A method used by some to memorize poems or story is to place themselves in it and see it firsthand in their mind</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a couple examples to prove a theory. My theory is all memory techniques are just spreading new knowledge across many neurons. In theory our brain works by when a neuron fires off, adjacent neurons fire off and we remember something. </p>

<p>So my theory is that all memory techniques just exploit this by embedding new knowledge into a breadth of neurons. Any thoughts or opinions on this? What makes a good ""memory strategy"" that is supported by what we know about the human brain?</p>

"Are our human brains programmed as materialistic as one can be?","<p>First of all, not all human beings are materialistic. I strongly believe that.</p>

<p>We tend to not be happy with what we have but what we want. We desire for more.</p>

<p>There is a saying that says that the other side of the lawn is greener.</p>

<p>We are inclined to compare ourselves with other human beings. Sometimes I have seen humans become so envious and jealous that they become their only barrier.</p>

<p>Why do we behave like so? We know that we can never be like them. Still, we want to have that kind of car, that kind of house and the list goes on.</p>

<p>Not only that. I have detected a feeling among humans titled <strong>A feeling of deprivation and replenishment</strong>.</p>

<p>Today we have an $80 Nokia Lumia 630 cellphone. Tomorrow we will see a commercial on an android phone. Little more expensive. Still, we want that. Then the market introduces the next-gen iPhone. We want that too. Then an iPad. Then iMac. Then iDesktop. Then dual-processor Xeon 21 cores the best desktop. Still, something will be missing tomorrow as soon we see the commercial of the next-generation TV with THX certified 8.5 channel Dolby Digital surround sound speakers and subwoofers. </p>

<p>Why does the human brain act this way? Is it right or appropriate to act this way? Is our human brain programmed for materialism and as soon as it perceives that object with its five senses and even though we don't need it we want it anyway? Why doesn't our sixth sense kick in and say hey enough already? </p>

<p>I have also seen in certain conditions and circumstances the sixth sense of homo sapiens automatically kicks in psychologically and it happens to support the lost or damaged senses. For example, when a visually impaired person is walking on the streets, right at that moment they can feel their sixth sense.</p>

<p>So the question are we materialistic by nature and why doesn't our brain have some sort of protection mechanism to protect us from that instinct? </p>

"Administrating a norm-referenced test to someone with bad command of the language","<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>We regularly administer tests in Greek that have (almost always) been developed in English and then translated by a corresponding Greek group and the norms re-calibrated.</p>

<p>We found that the Greek translations for a few of these questions can be anything from slightly misleading/vague to outright wrong, but we're still administering the tests unchanged, since this is what the norms have been calibrated on.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>We want to assess a child that has a better command of the English language (due to bilingual family environment) and is finding the Greek version difficult to understand*. However, the child does live in the mostly Greek-speaking area in which we operate, and we want to use the Greek-version norms to have a meaningful comparison to its peers also taking the test.</p>

<p>We would be inclined to administer the English (original) version of the specific test, so that the child can understand and answer more comfortably, and then score it against the Greek norms, which I realise is not ideal, but would be preferable to scoring against a reference group from a completely different context and background, and would also allow us to make a comparison to the child's peers.</p>

<p>However, due to the translation issues I mentioned earlier, this solution does not work (i.e., in some cases, the child would be answering, essentially, different questions than its peers would be in Greek).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What's the best way to approach this and <strong>why</strong>? Would it be better to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Administer the English version and score against the English norms? The results would not be directly comparable to the child's peers, and the reference group might not be very representative anyway.</li>
<li>Administer the Greek version, translated back into English to preserve the exact meaning of the Greek version, and score against the Greek norms? In this case, most questions would be identical to the original English version, but a few would be different in order to preserve the meaning of the mis-translated Greek questions. There's a question of how valid the norm would be due to the change in language.</li>
<li>Have the child take the proper Greek version with limited understanding? There's a question of whether the results would be accurate or a result of misunderstanding.</li>
<li>Accept that a meaningful comparison using this test is impossible in this case?</li>
</ol>

<p>N.B., I've listed the above as an indication of what we've been considering and our concerns, so any better alternatives are obviously welcome, but in any case, please explain your answer.</p>

<p>* To be clear, this is a behavioural assessment, not IQ or anything similar, so understanding of the questions is not really part of what's being assessed.</p>

"Did McClelland ever mentioned about two aditional needs in motivation?","<p>I've been getting classes on psychology of the motivation and my intructor mentioned about McClelland's theory of needs.</p>

<p>Although the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki entry on the subject</a> is somewhat clear about it. It doesn't mention about the necessity of determination neither the necessity of competence.</p>

<p>In my class my intructor attributed this to McClelland to which <em>him</em> defined those as:</p>

<p>Necessity of determination:</p>

<p>Tendency of to feel protagonist of your his or her own destiny.</p>

<p>Necessity of competence:</p>

<p>Tendency of a person to measure one's own performance with that of others.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where did my professor got those or if McClelland ever mentioned those in his theory.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone with experience in this field can offer some guidance on what's difference between them and how does exactly apply to a person's motivation?. Does it exist a hierarchy here as with Maslow's?.  </p>

"Is there any evidence in neuroscience that suggests visual thoughts (possibly others) or some aspects of the mind occupy higher dimensions?","<p>We think anything as real if we can perceive it through our senses. But I think generally speaking, anything <strong>is</strong> real if it occupies space (ie familiar 3D world/space)&amp; have a 2 way to &amp; fro interaction between it &amp; us. So the latter definition excludes things in the past &amp; future that <strong>were</strong> or <strong>will be</strong> real. So what about our thoughts or the mind? Mind is the arena where we have thoughts. The thoughts we have in our mind can be visual/tactile/auditory /olfactory/gustatory, etc. For instance, we can reproduce an image of a real world object in our mind. We know that the imagery is in our mind &amp; not in the real world, though there is an exact replica in the real world. These imageries can be static or dynamic according to we wish. I mean we can even run a movie in our mind in such a way that's virtually indistinguishable from reality. Just think about dreams. Sometimes after waking up, we think the events that occurred in our dreams really did occur. The complicated biological processes happening in our brain cells create what you call as thought. These biological processes can be thought of as an information or information changes. This information hence definitely occupy space. They occupy space in our brain cells. But where does the imagery or the virtual 3-D hologram itself that this information produces exist? For sure this imagery doesn't exist in our familiar 3 dimensions.If it did,it would be real as any other real object. But we know our mental imageries are 3-D.So why I believe these visual thoughts has to occupy some dimension or space? Because we experience it.Experience is mediated through interaction by some signal.Signal can travel through some medium only. By medium I mean space or higher dimensions; not a physical matter substance. So I think even though on how to produce an imagery in the mind is encoded as information in our brain cells, the information about the imagery itself has to geometrically occupy space &amp; time. That space maybe the higher dimensions. Thats why even though we don't feel these visual thoughts to be real, it appears as if they are real.In short I think they aren't real because of my definition I believe of  whats real  (anything real should occupy our familiar 3D space &amp; have 2 way to &amp; fro interaction). So in short this is what I want to know- is there any evidence in neuroscience that suggests visual thoughts (possibly auditory,tactile,etc) or some aspects of the mind occupy higher dimensions? </p>

"Is there a difference between physiological stimulations and psychological stimulations?","<p>From what I understand, <strong>physiological stimulation</strong> (or <em>stimulus</em> or <em>sensation</em>) ""refers to sensory excitation, the action of various agents or forms of energy (stimuli) on receptors that generate impulses that travel through nerves to the brain (afferents)"", while <strong>psychological stimulation</strong> (or <em>conceptualized stimulation</em>) involves cognitive process like perception, reasoning, emotion, experience. However, reading the Wikipedia page of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stimulation</a>, I feel like the two concepts are the same.</p>

"When and how did public nudity and sex become shameful and unacceptable?","<p>I am thinking about it from the evolutionary perspective. For nudity, I thought that maybe nude bodies may be associated with a higher probability of infection and diseases due to exposed parts. I also thought that maybe there's a social reason such that it's considered a better social status to be dressed; as an indicator of wealth and security. </p>

<p>But then when you think about it, it's not necessarily nudity that is frowned upon, it's the exposure of private parts. Considering that our reproductive organs are also used to dispose bodily waste, it makes sense to associate some sort of negative emotion with them. But then again, why would female breasts be considered indecent? </p>

<p>Also, when it comes to sex, clothed intercourse is still considered shameful. Sex is not only considered as a private activity, but also as a sin by lot many religions; it's also associated with morality. Gluttony, also being a function of our greed and bodily pleasure, doesn't receive the same amount of repulsion as does sex. Wouldn't it make more sense for the society to promote sex considering that it increases the probability of the continuation of our species?</p>

  <p>In an initial case series, one of us (EF) injected BT into the frown of ten depressed patients, eight of whom went into remission after one treatment (<a href=""http://www.botoxfordepression.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/BotoxDepressionPilotStudyMay2006.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Finzi and Wasserman, 2006</a>; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756121/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Finzi, 2013</a>). The study was limited by its small size, lack of controls, and lack of blinding. In three subsequent randomized, double blind and placebo controlled trials, we and other researchers have found response rates of 50—60% in major depression, with about one third of patients going into remission (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2012.01.027"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wollmer et al. 2012</a>; <a href=""http://pedroschestatsky.com.br/_files/view.php/download/material/92/54163c0e50f27.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Finzi and Rosenthal, 2014</a>; <a href=""https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.13m08845"" rel=""noreferrer"">Magid et al. 2014</a>, <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e267/0a6f79588df0b5339959e0976393d68856fe.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">2015b</a>).

<p>However, they then go on to say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How might injecting BT into the corrugator muscle influence the emotional brain? FMRI imaging has shown that subjects who received BT injections into their frown muscles had amygdala that were less responsive to negative stimuli (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhn104"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hennenlotter et al. 2009</a>). Recent work has confirmed that amygdala activity in response to angry faces was decreased when the frown muscles were paralyzed by BT injection. Furthermore, amygdala activity returned to its original inducible state after the effects of the BT injection had worn off, confirming that BT reversibly severed afferent feedback from the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugator_supercilii_muscle"" rel=""noreferrer"">corrugator muscle</a> to the amygdala (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1186/2045-5380-4-11"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kim et al. 2014</a>).</p>

<p><strong>With the decrease in amygdala activity in response to angry faces, am I correct in thinking that this could have a detrimental effect with regard to the flight/flight response in potentially dangerous situations?</strong></p>

"What forms of human thinking are present on animals and protohumans?","<p><strong>General idea</strong> </p>

<p>I'm trying to see what characteristics of human thinking  are present on animals and protohumans. In other words, how our thought depends on previous forms of intelligence  (because of evolution and particularly that of brain structure, I suppose).</p>

<p><strong>Background and problem</strong> </p>

<p>Some days ago someone said on the streets:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Measuring means comparing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it became clear to me that comparison is fundamental for the way we relate to the world, for the way we think and see he world. Why A is bigger\taller\better that B?</p>

<p>Another way we relate through the world is by analogy.  Analogy and for extension metaphor are on the beginnings of language; comparison between one thing or another seems also ancestral. So there are two ways of thinking that might be identified with animals thinking. </p>

<p><strong>The question</strong> </p>

<p>Are those ways of thinking present in earlier human beings or monkeys? </p>

<hr>

<p>I don't expect a complete answer but some help for me to start. Links\recommendations of videos, essays, papers orr short books are very welcome. (I don't believe in long texts, I apologise for this)</p>

"Do we know a priori any rules about the world?","<p><strong>1) Is there any set of rules that human beings or, more generally, other sentient living beings know a priori before any learning process?
In other words, do sentient living beings always were born knowing some causal relations about the world?</strong> </p>

<p>For instance, a newborn baby may not know that walking from a high place in direction of an edge may result on him falling due to gravity. Maybe he doesn't even know that he can move its arms and he only learns that after performing fortuitously an impulse that generates such action. Maybe he doesn't even know that he must breath in order to survive and he only learns that after feeling the discomfort and pain caused by the lack of oxygen. </p>

<p>As a disclaimer, I'm excluding here tautological logical syllogisms such as the principle of non contradiction and other axioms of logic. I'm also excluding here any synthetic a priori knowledge that can be derived from these (if you believe in synthetic a priori).</p>

<p><strong>2) In the positive case, how complex can these causal relations be (maybe a measure or an undeniably remarkable complex a priori knowledge)?</strong> </p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in a priori knowledge about normative judgements mainly related to social mores.</p>

"Rubik's Cube and building 3D visualization abilities","<p>I recently picked up a Rubik's Cube, intending to refine my ability to mentally work with three-dimensional representations.</p>

<p><a href=""https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1wc177zt"" rel=""noreferrer"">One review</a> seems to suggest that you can't ""normalize"" people this way (conditioning):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It should be noted that, as previously mentioned, there have been clinical
  treatments based on the notion of pairing a CS with masturbation to enhance
  responding to normative sexual stimuli, but with little long-term success (for
  review see Laws &amp; Marshall, 1991b).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that rather casts doubt of the conditioning theory of fetish development, but are there experiments arguing for it?</p>

<p>A bit more googling found <a href=""https://io9.gizmodo.com/pavlovs-pervs-1500110923"" rel=""noreferrer"">a popsci article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the 1970s, scientists wanted to know if they could condition a sexual reflex in men. First they got volunteers and hooked them up to a device that measured tumescence. Then they showed the men slides. The sequence of slides was always the same - naked women, and then boots. Naked women, and then boots.</p>
  
  <p>After some time, the scientists were pleased to see that the men responded to pictures of boots without ever seeing the naked women. Some of the men even showed response to sandals and high heels. They managed to instill fetishes in human beings. It would be interesting to see how deeply the fetishes ""took."" Was it specific to time and place, or did the scientists engineer a lifelong fetish in people?</p>

<p>In psychology there's an somewhat accepted phenomenon of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alexithymia</a>, the ""inability to identify and describe emotions in the self"".

"Ability of fixed-effects analyses to enable generalisation of results","<p>Is it correct to say that, when making inferrence on the results of an experiment, using a random-effects (RFX) rather than a fixed-effects (FFX) model merely makes the results <em>more generalisable</em>, as the quote below (from the fMRI study by <a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/29/8/2477.short"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leaver et al., 2009</a>) seems to suggest?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Random-effects models attempt to remove intersubject variability,
  thereby making the results obtained from a limited sample more
  generalizable to the entire population (Petersson et al., 1999). Thus,
  we used random-effects models in our analyses. In a single instance,
  we additionally considered results of a fixed-effects model, in which
  intersubject variability is not removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These authors later make the claim that those brain areas identified with the RFX analysis are more reliably/consistently involved.</p>

<p>I'd have thought that, with FFX, it is not the case that the results are simply ""less"" generalisable, but instead that they simply do NOT allow generalisation in quite the same way, since you are not accounting for the sampling noise added by the <em>random</em> selection of subjects to the sample. In other words, that there is a step jump rather than a gradual increase in reliability.</p>

<p>Furthemore, in my mind, this sounds like a fallacy somehow comparable to making inferrence on p-values that were not corrected for multiple comparisons: it's not that the corrected values are ""more reliable"" against false positives, it's simply that the uncorrected ones are UNreliable.</p>

<p>Does this analogy (or some other one) apply here, when using FFX (and not RFX) for sample-to-population inference?</p>

<p>Whilst this is a great answer to the initial question, it is difficult for me to pick apart from a neuropsychological basis.  Would there be significant improvements to ADHD symptoms with the “normalisation” of the ACC or would there still be significant problems?</p>

  <p>In psychology, passive-aggressive behavior is characterized by a
  habitual pattern of passive resistance to expected work requirements,
  opposition, stubbornness, and negativistic attitudes in response to
  requirements for normal performance levels expected of others. Most
  frequently it occurs in the workplace where resistance is exhibited by
  such indirect behaviors as procrastination, forgetfulness, and
  purposeful inefficiency, especially in reaction to demands by

In other words, people took longer to respond for the trials that were more difficult, i.e. the same that elicited more errors on average, rather than trading speed for accuracy or vice-versa, a participant behaviour seen as undesirable. The absence of a SATO is then strongly indicative of a participant having given their best during the task, i.e. correctly following the usual instructions to give fast but accurate responses. A certain level of skill is then said to characterise a particular SATO curve, and this parameter of the curve can change as people become better at the task.</p>

<p>However, rarely if ever have I seen papers that DO report a SATO, i.e. a <em>negative</em> correlation betewen RTs and error rates, or, in other words, participants that remained at a relatively constant level of skill but simply moved ""up and down"" their SATO curve. Clearly this is not a sign of ""good data"", but still, what is the correct analysis to perform in such situations, assuming that you can't just proceed to do analyses on RTs and error rates the way you normally do (in the absence of a SATO)?</p>

<p>Also, the above two paragraphs refer to the cases where a RT-errors correlation exists and is positive (1st para) or negative (2nd para). But what if there isn't a significant correlation at all?</p>

<p>A good paper discussing this phenomenon is Pachella's 1974 <strong>Unclassified US Air Force paper <a href=""http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/787880.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Interpretation of Reaction Time in Information Processing Research</a></strong>.

"Can drawing a duck define a person's hemispheric dominance?","<p>When I was on 7<sup>th</sup> grade, our math teacher asked every one of us to draw a duck. In the class of 34 students, a large portion of the students drew a left-facing duck.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dhdvc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dhdvc.png"" alt=""doodle of the duck""></a>  </p>

<p>The teacher said that it’s a simple test to figure out if a person is either right or left-brain dominant. So the people who drew a duck facing to left is a right-brainer, and <em>vice versa</em>. Apparently this Duck-test was quite popular in middle school.</p>

<p>Some even say, people who often draw a duck who faces left side is a left brain (instead of right). Although some says it's just muscle memory/ tendency. </p>

<p>My question is- is this mini test legit? 
Can you get a glimpse of someone's brain dominance by drawing a duck?</p>

"Standard Academic set of emotions, and cognitive functions","<p>As far as modern psychology is concerned, do we have a ""standard"" set of emotions agreed upon by academics?

<p>Also please pardon my novice understanding of psychology for this next question, but is there also a standard set of cognitive functions? 
For example, Carl Jung proposed the following: </p>

<p><strong>Extroversion</strong>: An attitude defining the self in accordance to the standard of the external world.</p>

<p><strong>Introversion</strong>: An attitude defining the outer world in accordance to the standard of the self.</p>

<p><strong>Intuition</strong>: Abstract perception of the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Sensing</strong>: Concrete perception of the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Thinking</strong>: Impersonal assessment.</p>

<p><strong>Feeling</strong>: Person-centered assessment.</p>

The aspect of having big brains is also very broad and does not cover in any detail about what it means by that, however if it means intelligence then this is a development from back when we needed to hunt for food as we started to create things and fleeing particular pray on sight became instinct. The section about being meat eaters does not conclude anything as many autistic people are vegans the same as neurotypicals so does not lead us anywhere. The section about woman being more submissive sexually is also not conclusive as most autistic people are asexual so there is no real dominance by both genders as most do not even partake in sexual activities. The graphs included are also questionable as they all seem to be in favor for aspies as they score higher on everything which i would say for things like the chances of having OCD they would be very much correct as the chances of having this when on the spectrum is 40 times more likely.

"What genetic polymorphisms are linked to aggression or violence?","<p>Anecdotally, there are reports of varenicline causing agression, but larger studies tended towards the finding of no effect over controls.</p>

<p>This got me into thinking about possible genetic polymorphisms that are implicated in aggression.

"What would be areas of ethical or safety concerns with a smartphone app interacting with people sleeping?","<p>The BBC News article <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44371572"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hi-tech dreamcatcher defeats sleep amnesia</a> mentions a recent talk by <a href=""http://www.adamjhh.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Adam Haar Horowitz</a> and then describes some limited tests of an apparatus called Dormio at the MIT media lab, that detects when an individual is in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hypnagogia</a> and then initiates interaction with a ""social robot"" rather than another person.</p>

<p>The interactions can include <em>""verbal"" prompting and suggestions by the robot!</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Dormio gadget is connected to a smartphone app or robot, which speaks word prompts to the subject as they slip into deeper sleep. These words can be used to influence their dreams or to knock them back into lighter sleep.</p>
  
  <p>""We have found that in the subjects we tested, those words reliably entered the hypnagogic dreams as dream content,"" said Mr Horowitz.</p>
  
  <p>""After this slight wake-up, we initiate a conversation about dream content with users via the Jibo social robot and record anything that is said, as hypnagogic amnesia is reported and we don't want people forgetting their useful ideas.""</p>
  
  <p>After this conversation, the system lets users drift back towards sleep, interrupting again when the biosignals suggest they are falling into deep sleep.</p>
  
  <p>""This is done repetitively to intercept dreams and extract dream reports,"" said Mr Horowitz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The BBC article notes some skepticism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antonio Zadra, a psychology professor at the University of Montreal, believes that dreams are designed to be forgotten.</p>
  
  <p>""We spend six years of our lives dreaming, of which we only remember a small sliver. If we were meant to be remembering more, that would be a colossal waste of time,"" he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as a bit of foreboding by Horowitz himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mr Horowitz admits there are ethical questions that need to be thought about before engaging with this enigmatic part of our daily routine.</p>
  
  <p>""How much of yourself do you want to access?"" he ponders.</p>
  
  <p>""How much power do you want to have there? How much do you want to be careful about messing with your own biosignals?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of letting your own potentially internet-connected smartphone interact with you <em>in your sleep</em> (during hypnagogia), while Siri, Cortana, Alexa, or even hackers may be running at the same time just seems slightly frightening to me. </p>

<p>While there may be various guidelines and even regulations that apply to scientific medical research, this is MIT's media lab, and the indirect results  could include someone selling a gizmo you buy on Amazon and connect to your phone and then go to sleep.</p>

<p>Basically, if a problem is presented in a dry, academic format, it's MUCH more difficult to solve than a problem presented in a real-world format.</p>

<p>The example from the book was something like this:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Problem presented in academic format</strong> - 10% of people are able to solve it:</p>

<p>You have 3 cards. One side of each card has letters, the other side has numbers. 2 cards are showing - one shows an A, the other shows a 3. How many cards do you have to turn over in order to figure out if all of the numbers are even?</p>

<p><strong>Problem presented in real-world format</strong> - 95% of people are able to solve it:</p>

<p>There are 3 people in a bar. One of them is drinking a coke. Another one is a senior citizen. How many people's ID's do you need to check, to see if they're of legal drinking age?</p>

But looking through <a href=""http://www.waikato.ac.nz/php/research.php?mode=show&amp;skin=fass&amp;author=tamatea"" rel=""noreferrer"">his publications list</a> I was rather disspointed there wasn't anything obvious since that talk. So, in my vague summary of the talk (I didn't take notes), he mentioned that psychopaths have some useful traits, including </p>

<ul>
<li>coolness under pressure</li>
<li>being good at spotting vulnerabilities in people or organizations</li>
<li>superficial charm that can oil the social machinery in many occasions</li>
</ul>

<p>and probably some I've missed. </p>

<p>I see there's a pretty similar talk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZO1jQUHXU"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Your Friendly Successful Psychopath""</a>, which makes reference to <a href=""http://wisdomofpsychopaths.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Wisdom of Psychopaths</a>, but I'm not familiar with the book... but a summary in The Guardian <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/07/wisdom-of-psychopaths-kevin-dutton-review"" rel=""noreferrer"">goes like</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dutton's book at any rate supports the idea that to thrive a society needs its share of psychopaths – about 10%. It not only shows the value of the emotionally detached mind in bomb disposal but also the uses of the psychopath's ability to intuit anxiety as demonstrated by, for example, customs officials. Along the way his analysis tends to reinforce the idea that the chemistry of megalomania which characterises the psychopathic criminal mind is a close cousin to the set of traits often best rewarded by capitalism. Dutton draws on a 2005 study that compared the profiles of business leaders with those of hospitalised criminals to reveal that a number of psychopathic attributes were arguably more common in the boardroom than the padded cell: notably superficial charm, egocentricity, independence and restricted focus. The key difference was that the MBAs and CEOs were encouraged to exhibit these qualities in social rather than antisocial contexts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the one more clearly identified research, the analogy with the CEOs sounds a bit doubtful to me in view of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqBPZR63vfA"" rel=""noreferrer"">research of Fred Kiel finding the opposite being true</a>, i.e. psychopathic-like CEO traits producing negative outcomes in business. So, yeah, I'm curious of the meta-analytical status of such claims, assuming there's enough research for review-like works.</p>

<p><strong>Is there some systematic research that finds there [or other potentially desirable traits] are really more common in psychopaths?</strong> Of course for some of the traits one needs to ask ""advantageous for who?"" or ""in what context?"", because they may be advantageous in the short run for the self, but might harmful for society/others, so there may be negative consequences for the self in the long run as a result. So I'm guessing a more sophisticated question would be if there's some kind of <strong>evolutionary stable strategy</strong> that favors a percentage of psychopathic traits...</p>

"Could brainwaves be the fenomena gives rise to consciousness","<p>I have speculated for a long time that brain waves could be the ""location"" of human consciousness or indeed the ""soul"". My argument for this is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>They vary with different states of consciousness, like dreaming.</li>
<li>They cover the brain as a whole and have provides coherence like the perception of time</li>
<li>I heard about an experiment with a man with severe secures that had his brain cut of in two with no neural connections. He didn't get a split personality and could perform functions that involved both halves of the brain. That told me that there couldn't be a completely neural explanation to consciousness. So which other mechanism do we know that could bridge that gap and provide a coherent self awareness combining the two brain halves: brain waves.</li>
<li>They may appear simple on the outside of the scull but on the inside they could display very rich characteristics.</li>
<li>Neural nets does not have brain waves and doesn't exhibit any signs of consciousness even though they have some kind of intelligence. </li>

"What psychological disorders have frequent and rapid anger outbursts?","<p>I'm interested in the mechanism behind a personality that can outburst anger rapidly and consistently for a long period. I've done some research and stumbled upon this issue described by <em>multiple different people</em>, typically about a female rejecting her partner, which makes me think it has some biological basis.</p>

<p>Within a certain time after a relationship starts, 6 months to 4 years an otherwise very desirable woman starts to have explosive anger outbursts over trivial issues and big issues alike. The words spoken and faults given during these temper outbursts does not matter, yet they follow a remarkably similar pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>very rapid onset (15 seconds or less from baseline to angry) and long duration (up to 3 hours to flare up again)</li>
<li>near total suppression of logical ability (will not see logic or reason)</li>
<li>total shut down of empathy (makes very hurtful comments, emotionally abusive)</li>
<li>significant drop in self awareness (can't see that acting like this is not appropriate and feels self justified)</li>
<li>perception changes (you ALWAYS do that, you NEVER do this)</li>
<li>does not want to be touched and actively rejects attempts at physical comforting</li>
<li>pushes the man out or continues the episode till the man can't take it any more and leaves</li>
<li>poor recollection of what happened during the episode later</li>
<li>likely to occur after 1 month of cohabitation, and can occur within days of having sex</li>
</ul>

<p>I've additionally gathered that men in these relationship assume more ""feminine"" role, while women are more ""masculine"". I've seen reports of a man bending over backwards to please such woman for years, yet this does not help.</p>

<p>Otherwise the couple say they still love each other and can function normally.</p>

<p>The almost universally given advice is: run, flee, end it. So it appears that behavior is aimed at and quite successful at forcing separation.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is this some kind of personality disorder? Is there a more scientific term I can use to look up this behavior? </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: since the question is closed</strong>, I will add answer here, as it took me a long time to find relevant info. </p>

<p>The mechanism described here is a clearly observable, biological, cyclical in nature, but it is only a tip of the iceberg of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_B_personality_disorders"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cluster B personality disordered</a> woman.  This pattern of violent outbursts and push/pull dynamics is consistent with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">borderline personality disorder</a> About 75% cases of BPD are female. I'm amazed at how many books are written on the subject by people who survived relationships with these women. (the male opposite is narcissistic personality disordered men, who deal just as much damage to women)</p>

<p>BPD/NPD has also been described as extremely low agreeableness and emotional stability on big 5 personality traits. During the courtship period, the undesirable traits are obfuscated from the potential partner (so woman who's more disagreeable than 95% of people may look like only 75% disagreeable). That's a major difference which is the cause of much unhappiness in such relationships. </p>

<p>BPD women are quite numerous are prone to emotionally violent anger outbursts, ""Projecting"" undesirable qualities onto the partner as a mechanism of self defense and avoiding any attempts to point out the pattern. Anecdotal evidence from countless sources suggests it is impossible to argue with a borderline disordered woman, or convince her to get help, as it results in the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Projection or blame shifting onto the partner</li>
<li>Threats of separation</li>
<li>Emotional abuse</li>
<li>""Circular arguments"" that solve nothing</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes these women experience moments of clarity, which only confuse the partner. These moments do not last long. Anecdotal evidence suggests BPD women are very resistant to therapy, and I've read accounts of up to 15 years of seeing psychiatrists/psychologists pass without any change.</p>

<p>It is common for the partner to somehow start accepting blame/fault for these violent outbursts, <a href=""http://www.sharischreiber.com/anycost.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">resulting in a lot of frustrated, depressed and beat up partners and husbands.</a></p>

<p>1) Is it possible to set up such a 10 part study on Mechanical Turk, where they will have to return every other day to take the next part?</p>

Increased promoter methylation would imply that the serotonin transporter gene is less expressed, so less serotonin is taken up by the presynaptic neuron, leading to increased serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. Surely the increased serotonin levels would lead to decreased amygdala response to threat? After all, selective serotonin reputable inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat anxiety disorders and depression by reducing uptake of serotonin and increasing serotonin levels as well.</p>

<p>It seems like these two are suggesting two contrasting effects for the same cause? Have I misunderstood something?</p>

"What is forward masking","<p>I am trying to understand what is visual masking (or more specificaly forward masking). I have read the explanation <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Visual_masking"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but still..</p>

<p>I understand that a background can interfere with a frontal visual stimulus. Anyone knows that. If I use whithe letters on white page I will see nothing. But, I assume the definition has more then that.. for example, in <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Visual_masking"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, in figure 1b, are they describing an experiment? If yes' then what is the experiment? I mean, what is the stimulus, what is the masking, what is the experiment question, and what is the result (I assume that there are known results to what the figure is describing...)</p>

"Possibility of increasing brain speed","<p>In science fiction stories, we often see the use of virtual reality, a 3d world that allows you to actually 'be' there. The writers often use a pod or helmet to signify the use of some sort of computer that reads and sends information to the brain. What many, if not all, of them have in common is that time is sped up. If it isn't double then it's triple or much more. Now, while this is science fiction and far removed from any real basis, I'm curious. Is it possible to speed up brain in such cases? I.e. Would we be able to make time move faster in a virtual space?</p>

<p>My gut, deduction, and the meagre amount of information I found online, says it's impossible. I know very little about the brain, but processing information at a much faster speed would force a much bigger strain on the organ, thus overtaxing it. Not to mention, if the brain could actually run faster, wouldn't it have it's own mechanisms for running faster, considering it would be quite the advantage when you want to survive as a cavemen against a lion that's in need of some breakfast.</p>

"Can we draw conclusions about content of thoughts from neural firing patterns?","<p>Can the neural firing patterns of animals be associated with specific kinds of thoughts? (ie Thoughts related to food, mating, or neighborly aggression?)</p>

<p>The author concludes, preemptively, that such an experiment would not demonstrate anything about the content of thought: ""We have no idea how neural firing relates to consciousness in humans, let alone animals.""</p>

<p>However, I am quite sure I have seen various papers published that use fMRI and neural patterns as evidence of particular states of mind. There are also social science experiments in which participants' brains are electrically stimulated, resulting in particular actions (grabbing of a pencil, for example), and then asked to explain the motivations for this action. These experiments would suggest that it is already assumed that specific brain patterns correlate to specific thoughts and actions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Get participants to complete a personality test honesty ($\bar{r} = .25$)</li>
<li>Get participants to complete do a job applicant role-play ($\bar{r} = .40$)</li>
<li>Get participants to complete a job applicant role-play and explicitly tell then to fake it ($\bar{r} = .60$)</li>

"How do ligands bind to and release from receptors?","<p>I'm wondering exactly how ligands bind to and release from receptors. Until recently I presumed ligands were attracted to receptors through electrostatic forces with no chemical interaction involved, and that catabolic enzymes (MAO, AChE) were simply present in the extracellular fluid. I hadn't given much thought as to how they disengage, but assumed ligands were brushed off by the extracellular fluid. </p>

<p>However, recently, I was reading about acetylcholinergic signaling and how it can be disrupted by, and I've come to realize is that everything I thought I knew about neurotransmission may be wrong. What I've read suggests this (article linked below):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>AChE is membrane-bound</p></li>
<li><p>AChE is part of the AChR, or just happens to be is close enough proximity that the AChE can catabolize the ligand while bound to the receptor</p></li>
<li><p>The AChR attracts ACh's positively-charged amine, which brings the acetyl group within range of AChE's reactive alcohol group. This alcohol group cleaves the acetyl group from ACh</p></li>
<li><p>It is not until the acetyl group is cleaved that the ligand disengages from the receptor</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is all of this correct?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the AChR and AChE distinct? If so, how can both simultaneously interact with a single molecule given their much larger size? If not, why are they ever spoken of as different?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this sort of catabolism-mediated disengagement the case with other neurotransmitters? </p></li>

  <p>""... what is a concept physiologically ...?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which then prompt Hebb to claim that <strong>cell assemblies</strong> were the physiological basis of a concept/thought.</p>

<p>Hence, my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any scientific evidence that support that the cell assembly is the basis of thought/a concept?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>HEBB'S CONTRIBUTION TO NEUROSCIENCE</strong></p>

<p>Some of his ideas have been confirmed; for example, in ""Biological Psychology"",Breedlove, Watson, Rosenzweig, teach that memory storage requires neuronal remodeling. This finding is grounded on Hebb's observation, which was confirmed by Kelso and Brown, 1986, that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Ensembles of neurons, or <strong>cell assemblies</strong>, linked via synchronized activity of these <strong>Hebbian synapses</strong>, could then act together to store memory traces.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above observation is related to the maxim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""cells that fire together wire together.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hebb's hypothesis about how synaptic connections grow stronger or weaker in response to experience gave rise to the idea of Hebbian synapses. </p>

<p>A Hebbian synapse is a synapse whose strength depends on its effectiveness in driving the postsynaptic cell; for example, cells during visual deprivation do not fire together; consequently, they do not drive the postsynaptic cells. In turn, the synapses get weaker, i.e., less sensitive.
In contrast, if cells are stimulated by the visual field, cells fire together, driving postsynaptic cells. This in turn strengths synapses. </p>

"Are millenials more risk-averse than prior generations were (at the same age)?","<p>The Congressional Institute (a US Republican think tank) has <a href=""https://www.conginst.org/?report=congressional-institute-report"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a 2015 report</a> stating that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Millennials were highly protected in childhood by a fortress of youth safety initiatives, which they took as evidence that they were truly valuable. This protection has translated into risk aversion in their young-adult lives: Millennials are avoiding the stock market and real estate, turning away from entrepreneurship, and are trying to plan for the long term.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is mostly an indirect inference, which may well confuse cause and effect. The recession may have caused some of the observed effect via lack of money. But it's also possible that a combination of developmental and later environmental condition have truly affected the psychological inclination toward risk taking of the generation graduating in the midst of the recession. After all, people do suffer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">negativity bias</a>.</p>

<p>I did find something else (and from a less political source) that might support the inference as well, namely two surveys found that millennials are apparently <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170713-why-the-millennial-stereotype-is-wrong"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">less likely to switch jobs</a> than Gen-Xers. (Generally, <a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2977217"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more risk-averse persons switch jobs less often</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>British think tank the Resolution Foundation reported in February that only one in 25 UK millennials was switching jobs each year during their mid-twenties. Members of the preceding generation, known as Generation X, were found to be twice as likely to keep switching employers at the same age – a good thing for them, financially speaking. Job-hopping tends to come with a pay rise of about 15% with each move, as well as the opportunity for workers to learn new skills and determine which kind employers are a good fit for them. Meanwhile, pay rises for those who stay with one company for the long term have dwindled to almost nothing, according to the Resolution Foundation report.</p>
  
  <p>In April, the Pew Research Center, a non-partisan “fact tank” based in Washington, DC, published similar findings, drawn from US Department of Labor data. The report found that American workers aged 18 to 35 were just as likely to stick with their employers as their older counterparts in Generation X were when they were young adults. And among those with college degrees, millennials were found to have longer track records with their employers than Generation X workers did when they were the same age.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But millennials may have done that because fewer jobs were available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The economic evidence is pretty clear,” says Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation and one of the authors of the report on UK millennials’ decreasing job mobility. “Young people have always changed jobs more than older people, but it’s definitely the case that the rate of mobility has fallen – for young people particularly quickly, although it’s fallen for everyone.” [...]</p>
  
  <p>Neither report gives concrete answers about why job mobility has decreased among young people. Richard Fry, a senior researcher at Pew, wrote in his summary of the data on Pew’s Fact Tank blog, that it may be “due to a dearth of opportunities to get a better job with a different employer.” Gardiner, meanwhile, points out that young people may be less willing to take risks having come of age during the financial crisis. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my question is whether are any systematic studies that more directly (e.g. via questionnaires or lab-based experiments) try to assess whether millenials have higher risk aversion than previous generations had at a corresponding age.</p>

<hr>

<p>There's also an interesting side question here, which does however have an answer. Namely whether (self-reported) risk-aversion is time-varying (and how much). <a href=""https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00965549v2/document"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One study</a> says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the question could be asked as to whether the financial
  and macro shocks a person faces over his lifetime modify his risk aversion. Our empirical
  analysis provides evidence that risk aversion is composed of a time-variant
  part and shows that the variation cannot be ascribed to measurement error or noise
  given that it is related to income shocks. Taking into account the fact that there
  are time-variant factors in risk aversion, we investigate how often it is preferable to
  collect the risk aversion measure in long panel surveys. Our result suggests that the
  best predictor of current behavior is the average of risk aversion, where risk aversion
  is collected every two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that it has been more than that since the start of the last recession, I guess the average risk aversion of millennials could be well estimated.</p>

"How do children learn the grammatical rules of counting?","<p>Up to the number twelve it is simply a case of learning a sequence.</p>

<p>""one, two, three, ...,twelve""</p>

<p>From 13..19, it's adding the word ""teen"" after a number but sometimes with certain changes e.g. ""thirteen"" instead of ""threeteen"" and ""fifteen"" instead of ""fiveteen"". (He even may make this mistake of ""nineteen, tenteen, eleventeen..."" at first).</p>

<p>Then we must learn that ""after nineteen comes twenty"". Next 21-29 is just the word ""twenty"" followed by a single digit.</p>

<p>Then we must learn ""after twenty-nine comes thirty"".</p>

<p>Next(?) we are taught to count in tens ""ten, twenty,..."" (the next being like the teens by with ""-ty"" instead of ""-teen"".) And we learn that ""after ninety comes a hundred.""</p>

<p>Now this tricky part (in my opinion) the child learns (or is told?) that ""after twenty-nine comes thirty"", ""after thirty-nine comes forty"". From this clever child deduces that ""after forty-nine comes fifty"".
Maybe the child gets stuck on ""ninety-nine"".</p>

<p>But then the child is able (in principle) to count to a hundred and perhaps even further once it realises that the next numbers you just say ""a hundred and"" and start from the beginning until you get to 199.</p>

<p>Is there much research done into this? What I'm particularly interested in is which bits are taught, which bits are learned through imitation and which bits are deduced. I am trying to write a program that can imitate this learning. </p>

"Is there any evidence for the cell assembly?","<p><strong>What is a cell assembly?</strong></p>

<p>In <em>Principles of Neural Science</em> Eric Kandel, and colleagues wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After this strengthening has occurred, a group of three neurons that are strongly coupled by excitatory synapses form a cell assembly (Figure E–5C). Neuroscientists generally use this term rather imprecisely. One must look to mathematical models of networks for more precise definitions, which generally have some- thing to do with the presence of strong mutual excita- tory interactions within a group of neurons. The word “assembly” emphasizes that the group did not initially exist but was constructed through the strengthening of the synapses of the neurons in the group, which in turn was caused by the simultaneous activation of the neurons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In [1] the cell assembly is defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A large group of cells that tend to be active at the same time because they have been activated simultaneously or in close succession in the past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sebastian Seung in [2] defines the cell assembly like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the neurons are excitatory and are mutually connected by synapses into a structure known as a <em>cell assembly</em>.</p>

"Does practicing Ravens Progressive Matrices tests inflate your IQ score?","<p>I'm 16 years old and a year ago I got obsessed about IQ. I took a Raven IQ test and scored 115. Then during the autumn and winter of last year I took some more IQ tests using RPM and scored 126 on almost all of them. I took the Raven IQ test again in January of this year. I scored 126 on it. I wasn't convinced. So I researched the most accurate online IQ test and found the Norwegian Mensa Practice test took it and scored 128. A couple months after that I took the Mensa Denmark practice test formerly known as iqtest.dk. I scored IQ 121 on it.</p>

<p>Is it because I took so many Raven IQ tests my score is so high? Does that mean that my IQ isn't in the 120's? Where would you put my Non-Verbal/Spatial IQ?

  <p>Sociosexual orientation, or sociosexuality, is the individual difference in the willingness to engage in sexual activity outside of a committed relationship. Individuals with a more restricted sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who have a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness.</p>

<li>Is the effect of partner intelligence on  marriage satisfaction more about similarity to one's own intelligence or is it the case that the relationship between partner intelligence and marriage satisfaction is linear and positive regardless of one's own intelligence?</li>
<li>Does any observed effect of partner intelligence on marriage satisfaction vary based on whether you are comparing husbands to wives or wives to husbands?</li>

Such estimates can then link into power analysis and sample size calculations.</p>

"Facet versus scale prediction of Big 5 personality","<p><strong>NEO facets and scales:</strong> The NEO model of personality has 5 scales (i.e., extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, openness, and conscientiousness). For each scale there are 6 facets (e.g., neuroticism has anxiety, hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, and vulnerability to stress). See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory#Personality_dimensions"">here for a list of the 30 facets and how they relate to the 5 scales</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Incremental prediction:</strong> I am interested in the degree to which the 30 facets predict important real-world outcomes over and above the big 5 scales. Examples of important outcomes might include financial success, life satisfaction, health outcomes, longevity, job performance, career success, marital satisfaction, criminality, and so on. While each of these outcomes would be interesting in itself, I'm particularly interested in any general claims that can be put forward regarding the incremental predictive validity that is obtained from using facets rather than scales.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical baseline:</strong> I take a few points as self-evident. There is a difference between in sample prediction and true population prediction. The true population regression equation can not be worse for the facets than the scales. The facet level prediction could mirror the scale prediction merely through an appropriate set of regression coefficients (i.e., some form where facets are in some sense equal within a scale, adding up to the scale effect).</p>

<p>I also take it as self-evident that the population prediction would be at least a little bit better with facets. It seems implausible that the pattern of regression coefficients required to replicate the scale prediction would necessarily be exactly match the best population prediction model. However, there is still the question of what the size of the increase is, and how big the increase in prediction is relative to the prediction achieved by the scales.</p>

<p><strong>Methodological challenges:</strong> There are also several issues around estimating the size of the incremental prediction of facets relative to scales. Adding an additional predictor increases sample variance explained even when the predictor has know incremental prediction in the population. Thus, procedures that compare sample r-squared of scales versus facets prediction models would be biased. Models that use a data driven variable selection procedure like step-wise regression to select an optimal subset of predictors would also be biased. The size of this bias would be greatest in smaller samples. </p>

<p>Thus, I'm particularly interested in studies that have accounted for these methodological challenges. For example, a good study might have (a) a large sample of 1000+ participants in order to generate robust results, and (b) a statistically valid procedure for estimating population r-squared for facet and scale predictor models (one possibility would be to estimate the model in half the sample and evaluate in the other half, although many other cross-validation procedures are possible).</p>

<p>Thus, <strong>my questions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the incremental prediction of the 30 facets over and above the big 5 scales on important psychological outcomes?</li>
<li>In particular, how and to what extent have studies dealt with the methodological issues related to performing this comparison?</li>
<li>In totality, is the incremental prediction at the facet level sufficient to justify the added complexity to thinking and theorising?</li>

I am a regular user of Google Calendar, and I use its drag-and-stretch time-interval interface. In doing so, I constantly <em>seem</em> to be making judgments such as ""Event A has properties [a1,...,aN], ####.... it will probably last about two hours"".
My question, then, is: what is happening during the ""####"" stage of this process?</p>

<p><em>*</em>*EDIT: To avoid confusion, I would like to make clear that I am interested in cases where an agent is facing an ""instance"" of a ""type"" of event (if you imagine that the agent has a set of ""memory traces"" related to instances of the event, then I am referring to a case in which there is a reasonably high amount of variance/uncertainty in duration across previous instances), that agent has certain knowledge/evidence, and the agent must make a guess and/or a decision based upon a guess.
I've used the calendar planning example as an illustration. However, I am asking this question more broadly, as it relates to time scales ranging from very small to very large.</p>

"How can psychometry measure the very high IQ's in adults?","<p>From Wikipedia's page on <strong>Mental age</strong>, we learn that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Originally, the differences between mental age and chronological age were used to compute the intelligence quotient, or IQ. This was computed using the ratio method, with the following formula: mental age/chronological age * 100 = IQ. No matter what the child's chronological age, if the mental age is the same as the chronological age, then the IQ will equal 100.[4]
  An IQ of 100 thus indicates a child of average intellectual development. For a gifted child, the mental age is above the chronological age, and the IQ is higher than 140; for a mentally retarded child, the mental age is below the chronological age, and the IQ is below 70.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this way, precocious children can get exceptionally high scores (e.g. scores above 160, s.d. 15), even if they answer correctly only a fraction of the total number of questions, provided the test is sufficiently hard in comparison with their actual chronological age. However, I am not aware of any tests for adults that discriminate accurately above the threshold of IQ $\sim$ 160 - their accuracy is even less than 4 s.d., taking into account a ceiling effect. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How can psychometry assess an IQ of 170 or 180 in adults when the rarity of such scores is 1 in several millions?</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>Can the IQ scores of exceptionally and profoundly gifted children be extrapolated into adulthood?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it true that that a profoundly gifted child with an IQ of 170 would score better than 99.9998% of the general population?</strong></p></li>
<li><strong>It seems that two different definitions of IQs are used here: is there a correlation between them?</strong></li>

"Deception and nose touching - does it work for things that are about to be said in prepared speeches?","<p>I'm not sure if nose touching is a scientifically-validated signature of deception or internal conflict. For the purposes of this question I would assume that it's fairly common knowledge in psychology that people touch nose or cover the mouth when saying something part of them does not believe to be true.</p>

<p>If nose touching is encountered in a regular,spontaneous conversation, then it may be deduced that the statement that the person just made is untrue (or the person does not really believe it). For example: ""I can easily make money on the stock market"". If such statement is followed by a nose touch, I can assume that the person is at least partially unsure about the content of the statement. </p>

<p>Now, when I'm watching prepared talks, like on Ted.com, the following question arises: If a person has prepared a speech in advance,rehearsed it and is now delivering a prepared speech, does nose touching have any ""predictive component"" for deception? In other words, <strong>if a person touches a nose during a prepared speech, is it a sign of deception/internal uncertainty that just happened or one that is about to happen?</strong></p>

<p>I know that there are fMRI studies that found some actions can be predicted x milliseconds in advance, and I'm interested if nose touching is one of things that can predict something that is about to happen, not indicate something that just happened. </p>

"What is it called to think without language? Are there studies around it?","<p>I think there are two types of thinking:
with and without language.</p>

<p>For my entire life, in my opinion, I have always thought without language. Some people say it's impossible and that we think with language without knowing it. But the fact is that I can distinguish them pretty well.</p>

<p>Reading the answers on <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/5462/is-it-possible-to-think-without-language"">https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/5462/is-it-possible-to-think-without-language</a> I see that the answers focus on other ""senses thinking"". By this I mean, the answers focus on other forms of communication that we have, turned into thinking, such as, thinking based on images, sounds, etc. But in my opinion those are just ""tools for thinking"", they are just something like super rapid accesses on memory to rationalize things and not the real source of ""thinking"".</p>

<p>So here I am, stuck on ""What is this thinking process? How does it happen? It just looks like magic.""</p>

<p>If you ask me to describe it, I would say it is a weird mix of--well, I can't even explain it. I just have some perception of the mix of things received from memory like something operating on memory really, really fast.</p>

<p>I am very slow and bad at thinking with language which results in big difficulties in explaining anything. 
I feel language is like putting what we have in so many dimensions into a single one like taking a colorful picture with a sense of depth and turning it into a flat black and white image.</p>

<p>Does anyone know any studies done on this? What is this weird form of thinking? It's hard in terms of communications, but it's awesome to feel things intensely.</p>

<p>Please remember I am really talking about this ""weird thinking"" and not confusing it with feelings.</p>

"What functions does the brain perform to recognize a familiar object unconsciously?","<p>Let's say a person's brain experiences how a vehicle/object looks for the very 1st time. It would require lot of attention/focus/processing to analyse the object, extract features and train its neural networks. After many such experiences (don't know the statistics, does anyone have any clue?), when it sees/experiences the same vehicle/object, it won't need much self/conscious intervention to be able to understand the presence of it. Remember, when driving a car, how many times do we need to actually focus on vehicles/objects? Presumably 0 except for some personal interests (reading number plates, unusual activities) or trigger events that might excite us to do so (turn indicators, possible threats, unusual activities, etc.). </p>

<p>There's also a caveat associated with this behaviour: the brain just knows/believes the vehicle/object exists there with some minimal set of attributes, but it can't read/interpret minute details (like texts/numbers, precise boundaries etc). To do this it requires visual focus as well as the brain's attention, I think.    </p>

<p>What brain functions are involved in this activity? What are those features that help the brain perform such tasks without requiring much intervention/processing? Is there any technical term for this behaviour? </p>

"What books should I study to have a decent understanding of psychology?","<p><strong>Background:</strong><br>

I have read quite a bit on psychology, mostly on PsychCentral and PsychologyToday, but the knowledge I have is in bits and pieces. I want to have a well-organised knowledge of psychology like a student who is pursuing a career in psychology. The knowledge that I have right now feels like 'Googled knowledge' to me.

"How does subjective experience arise from matter?","<p>Forgive me for lacking rigor, but if what I know is correct, it is established that consciousness and other higher functions characteristic of humans are a consequence of our cortex, specifically neocortex. However, what has always puzzled me is the neurobiological basis that gives rise to the phenomenon that we associate our bodies with ourselves – i.e., why does my brain think of my physical body as ""me"" and make me care for it? In other words, why is me me at this particular point in time and not some other body living e.g. centuries ago? Why do I not associate ""me"" with multiple bodies living at the same time, or have identity at all? </p>

<p>A naive, materialist answer would perhaps be that given our nervous system etc., ""me"" is only a sort of an illusion created by the brain which acts as a kind of ""least thinkable unit"" that has no neural connections to other physical bodies. Still, <strong>what is the process that ""picks"" precisely my brain and my body to become ""me""</strong> – why have I not sensed reality from the viewpoint of e.g. Albert Einstein or Brad Pitt?</p>

<p>I wonder if any empirical answers to such questions can be given, or at least if these questions have been reformulated to a set of more well-defined questions in the light of modern neuroscience.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
A better way to form this question would be: if two bodies come to exist at the same time, and consciousness is an emergent, materialistic phenomenon of the body, why do I experience the emergence of consciousness in one specific body (i.e. the one I call my own) and not in another?</p>

"How do humans learn to combine tasks?","<p>I've been reading about <a href=""https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2014/papers/221/paper221.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">hierarchical learning</a> (a variant of reinforcement learning from what I understand) and how it is shown to allow learning of a higher-level task (the main example is assembly). I made the mistake of assuming that since the paper shows how a set of sequential actions are learned more quickly when the individual tasks are learned beforehand, that the same could be accomplished with a set of tasks to be combined.</p>

<p>For example, imagine learning to play hockey. First, you have to learn how to skate effectively. Secondly, you learn how to handle the puck with a stick. Thirdly, you have to learn to be aware of the other players and their movement. Finally, you combine all of these and sometimes have to spend time refining the lower end skills to become an effective hockey player.</p>

"Origin of group-level statistics in psychology and cognitive neuroscience","<p>In experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience today, with the exception of a few specific subdisciplines, the consensus seems to be that an experimental study has to be performed on a group of subjects which are considered as a sample from an underlying population. Statistics is then applied in such a way as to allow an inference on <em>properties of the distribution in that population</em> of a certain psychological function or feature, most often the population mean.</p>

<p>My question is: When was this consensus established, with which reasoning, and on whose initiative?</p>

<p>In my experience, current textbooks on statistics in psychology discuss the statistical procedures in great detail, but contain only a few cursory remarks on the <em>psychological</em> (not statistical) motivation of these procedures. They do not discuss why a cognitive scientist should be interested in a population-average reaction time, a population-average event-related potential etc. – instead of e.g. effects that are present in every single individual in the population, or a specific sub-population. Or maybe I'm just looking at the wrong books?</p>

I am using a non-validated translated questionnaire in my survey. The purpose of it is not to validate the measure in a different language and its construct validity, I only translated it for the purpose of my study. Still, I am obligated to test the construct validity of the questionnaire and the problem is the following:</p>

<p>When I run the <strong>principle axis extraction with oblique rotation</strong>, I initially get 2 factors-two of the items load very poorly on the 1st factor (zero corrleations), and some have small values of 0.3, but also correlate with the second one. Majority loads on the first factor and the MAP test also gives me a reason to extract only one factor. If I run the principle axis extraction <strong>without any rotation</strong>-it only suggests me to remove one item, based on the correlations with the factor, not two.</p>

<p>My question is-can I decide to extract a ""fixed number of factors"" and extract only one after concluding that MAP test gives me a better solution? The second question is-if I do so, am I allowed to only remove that 1 item that it offers me to remove after extracting 1 factors and ignore the almost zero loadings in the initial EFA with oblique rotation of the second item? The other problem with removing too many items is that it messes my variance too much. It is in my interest to keep as many items as possible, but only the mentioned one I think I must remove (the second one I am not sure whether I must).</p>

"Is there a model for designing a tracklist to get the most engaged reaction from a crowd at a rock concert?","<p>At a recent rock concert, I noticed that the ""headliner"" is almost always preceded by several bands whose job it is to ""warm up the crowd,"" and that during those ""opener acts,"" the crowd does indeed transition from a sort of ""cold"" to ""warm"" state, i.e. will dance more, jump around more, etc. </p>

<p>During an act, the band seems to (in my experience) open with one or two energetic songs, follow up with a slower song, then play more energetic songs, in a series. This doesn't exactly follow the model of act to act transitions - wherein the ""hottest act"" is saved for last. Instead, it's more of a ""wave."" In short, there seems to be a contradiction in the planning of a concert between how the whole concert is planned, and how a single band's tracklist is planned. </p>

"Questions on Interpreting Factor Analysis Results and Scores","<p>I am trying to learn factor analysis and I thought it would be a good idea to try and very poorly ""mimic"" the computation for IQ scores with a dataset of dummy values as a way to ""learn by example"". </p>

<p>To start off, this is what I intend to do, and I don't know if this methodology is correct or not: I have the loadings for that factor determined. Now that I have the loadings, I want to generate a score for each of the samples. That will leave me with a population of scores that I can then standardize around a mean of 100. From there I would plot a normal distribution. Whenever I get a new sample, I can then generate a score for it and see where it falls on the distribution.</p>

<p>To get my results, I am using Python's Sklearn library, specifically the <code>FactorAnalysis</code> class. I noticed that the <code>FactorAnalysis</code> class has a <code>score_samples()</code> method. The output score for each sample is the log-likelihood of the sample.</p>

<p>Here are some of the questions I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is my approach in generating a distribution based on the samples' factor scores flawed? How do they do it in practice?</p></li>

"Which mental illnesses are probably natural?","<p>Which states of mind that are classified as mental illnesses might be a natural and useful part of our brains?</p>

<p>For example, some evolutionary biologists have suggested that some types of depression are a natural consequence of losing a fight for dominance. i.e. In order for the loser to fit into the social pecking order he must have feelings of low self worth. </p>

<p>Are there other types of ""mental illnesses"" that might be natural and useful? (By ""natural"" I simply mean evolutionary selected for.) And that if this illness was cured for all human beings it would in fact damage the social fabric of society?</p>

<p>Another example. A phobia of spiders. Most people would agree that this is not a mental illness but a common trait of most humans. A phobia of trees is probably not.</p>

"How does a female measure her own attractiveness?","<p>In theory, a female who is above average should reject most advances because they can afford to wait until they are approached by a male of high value. Whereas a female of low attractiveness can not afford to reject most advances.</p>

<p>What would make sense is that in the fist few years of adult life a female should simply reject all advances. A process of simply collecting statistical data on her own attractiveness. </p>

  <p>This psychological effect is often used in the cinema, where an actor will be shown apparently looking at himself or herself in the mirror. What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but the position of the actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed in the mirror for the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but I don't think my understanding is sufficient.</p>

<p>So correct me if I'm wrong but, the idea is that, contrary to our quick assumptions, Venus isn't actually admiring herself in the mirror but she's actually looking at the viewer (me)? Am I right?</p>

<p>I'm just wondering why all the other websites are talking about mirror angles, like how she actually would not be able to see her face (really?) and there's one saying that Venus' face is actually between me (the viewer) and the mirror, uhhh what? So does that mean she's actually painting herself? </p>

"Can tapering reduce the risk of sedative kindling and brain damage?","<p>So we know that repeated withdrawal from GABAeric substances like alcohol and benzodiazepines will cause kindling and worsen future withdrawal symptoms. Also, it appears that withdrawal from alcohol is responsible for most of the brain damage, since binge drinkers have more brain damage than alcoholics. </p>

<p>Wouldn't it be possible then, to take a long acting benzodiazepine or slowly sip alcohol throughout the next day to taper off and therefore mitigate the risk from this?

<p>The abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Social loaﬁng was investigated by testing a multilevel model among 23
  intact work groups comprised of 168 employees representing two
  organizations. Results demonstrated that as hypothesized at the
  individual level, increases in task interdependence and decreases in
  task visibility and distributive justice were associated with greater
  occurrence of social loaﬁng. At the group level, increased group size
  and decreased cohesiveness were related to increased levels of social
  loaﬁng. Of particular interest was the ﬁnding that group member
  perceptions of perceived coworker loaﬁng was associated with reduced
  social loaﬁng, opposite of our predictions. We suggested that this
  unexpected ﬁnding may provide evidence of a social compensation
  effect.</p>

"What causes an individual to not be able to hold all the details of a large project in memory?","<p><strong>Background:</strong> First of all, I'm not in any kind related to cognitive science, I'm a programmer. I'm not even sure that it's the right place for asking my question, but I'll try anyway. So, first of all, I'll describe the initial problem that motivated me to ask this question. There are some concrete examples.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I join the programmers team that have rather big (but not huge) project. I'm trying to figure out how it works, how each part of the system cooperates with each other. I want to see how it works as a whole, so that I could say that I understand what's going on: what goes first, what goes next, without going into pretty much detail. I want to have this image in mind and to discuss the project with no need to diving into code, or to schemes describing the project, or any additional info. The thing that does not let me do this -- I fail to remember the system components, their execution precedence that may vary, and their interactions between each other.</p></li>
<li><p>I got explanations of some project use case. Everything seems to be clear, but there comes a time when I realize that I can not hold all this in my head, can not keep all precedence of actions, the interactions between them. The whole thing becomes blurry.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I tend to see these cases having the same reason. As this reason results in my wish for better results achievement, I call it a problem. It may or may not be a ""problem"" from medical or any other point of view, but this is a problem for me anyway. So, when I talk about solving this problem, I talk about improving my results in area described above.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>What is this problem called where a person can not hold all the details of a large project in memory?</li>
<li>Is this a failure of memory?</li>
<li>Is the problem due to lack of intelligence? </li>
<li>Would any of the following reduce the problem: chess, poker, solving math problems, nootropics?</li>

"Human vision detection of faint blinking or moving point of light, guidelines for sensitivity versus frequency","<p>This question is in the neurology/neuroscience rather than the psychology aspect of this site.</p>

<p>I'd like to check the limits of visibility of a (presumably green) LED at large (kilometer) distance, and I'm assuming that modulation of intensity (blinking) or position (""wiggling"") would make the same brightness noticeable at larger distances than a steady, stationary point of light.</p>

<p>My options are to vary the frequency and duty cycle of the pulses, and to alternately flash two different LEDs separated by a large enough distance that the point would appear to ""wiggle"" or move slightly either left/right, or up/down.</p>

<p>Neurologists and human visual processing researchers have studied the limits of visual detection of stimuli for quite a long time, and so the body of work is quite large and therefore beyond my scope of understanding.</p>

<p>Might there be a <em>best frequency</em> or range of frequencies for blinking or ""wiggling"" that the human vision system might be most sensitive to? I'm just guessing that it might be somewhere near the range of 1 Hz to 10 Hz, but I'm just guessing without any scientific basis.</p>

<p>As far as separation for the ""wiggle"" what might a <em>best separation</em> or range of separations that might be most noticeable? </p>

<p>An answer that points me to the underlying physiological phenomenon that I should read further about would be just as acceptable as numbers with supporting links. Because I'm not so familliar with the neurology of vision, I can't judge beforehand which way to cast the question.</p>

"The brain physically changes with regular coffee consumption, but at what rate does it return to normal?","<h1>Question</h1>

<p>We know adenosine receptors A1 &amp; A2 subtypes physically increase in the basal ganglia with prolonged caffeine exposure over the period of about 1-2 weeks, <strong>but at what rate do they return to normal</strong> (downregulate)? <em>Id est</em>, what is the extinction rate of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation"" rel=""noreferrer"">upregulated</a> adenosine receptors?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>If you take coffee daily, you no longer get a boost from it after about a week, but rather, you're just staving off the harsh withdrawal symptoms, not to mention over time it will physically change your brain <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3392208?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""noreferrer"">to have more adenosine receptors</a> i.e., ""sleepiness receptors"". (Ramkumar V et al, J Clin Invest 82:242-247)</p>

<p>""A <a href=""https://lifehacker.com/5585217/what-caffeine-actually-does-to-your-brain"" rel=""noreferrer"">1995 study suggests</a> that humans become tolerant to their daily dose of caffeine—whether a single soda or a serious espresso habit—somewhere between a week and 12 days. And that tolerance is pretty strong. One test of regular caffeine pill use had some participants getting an astronomical 900 milligrams  (9 cups of coffee) per day, others placebos—found that the two groups were nearly identical in mood, energy, and alertness after 18 days. The folks taking the equivalent of nine stiff coffee pours every day weren't really feeling it anymore. They would feel it, though, when they stopped.</p>

<p>""You start to feel caffeine withdrawal anywhere from 12 to 24 hours after your last use. That's a big part of why that first cup or can in the morning is so important—it's staving off the early effects of withdrawal.""</p>

<p>Caffeine, the natural pesticide of bright red coffee berries, creates an emergency response in your body to fight it off (pooping, peeing, and adrenaline). It inherently doesn't give you energy or focus, but the adrenal side effect does. Studies show that people who have coffee 7 days in a row no longer receive any energy or focus benefits. At that point their brain has been sufficiently altered with new adenosine receptors that they are just at their baseline behavior. They found this was true with any caffeine amount, from 1 to 10 cups of coffee. The exception is after 10 cups is it just starts frying your brain. </p>

<p>""You might think all of this probably takes a while, but <a href=""https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/02/22/coffee/"" rel=""noreferrer"">it takes about seven</a> days to become addicted to caffeine.

"What's the term for people who deny others' achievements?","<p>I know a bunch of people that are always in deep denial (at least trying to appear so) of other people achievements. It can be another country or another group or another religion.</p>

<p>For example, when you tell them, ""Did you hear about Mike? He just bought a Lamborghini,"" they have several type of answers ready for this situation, like: ""Who cares? Lamborghini was never good, you need to go to gas station every 15 minutes,"" or like, ""But don't you know how terrible his wife is?"" or, ""He might have stolen someone's money,"" etc.</p>

<p>They know they are wrong, but they say these types of things to ease their deep internal pain. You would call them some sort of jealous people, but it's not only jealousy. Sometimes when you tell them things like, ""Did you see the recent car Germany just built? It just runs on salt water!"" They come back with sentences like, ""Whatever, I would die rather than living for a second in Germany."" Everyone would be like, ""WHAT?"" But yes, they say these sort of things.</p>

<p>So what do you call these people? What's their problem? Do you have any advice to offer these people?</p>

Could Cognition models that say 'mind' states are actually 'brain states' and that we are therefore neuro-chemical mechanisms ; could these models miss important factors like how 'behavioral algorithms' of the 'mind-brain' are organised and how they interact and how the mind-brain 'makes new 'behavioral algorithms'. What I call Behavioral Algorithms could be called 'mental programs' or 'mental software'. So are there models of Cognition that do not focus on Physicalism ( the philosophy that everything that exist has a physical basis and nothing else like  emergent qualities or something 'intangible')?</p>

"Analysis according to Jung's Psychological Types","<p>Recently I read Jung's Psychological Types out of self-questioning. I would like to analyze myself in such a fashion more ""professionally"", however I do not profess to be able to do that myself, having no prior education and training in psychology. I have already done the MBTI test, but after reading Jung's book, I realize that the test is not exhaustive.</p>

<p>My question is - which types of therapists or specialists normally perform these analyses? Do some psychologists base their analysis on Jung's theory? Is it possible to ask ""just"" for a personality analysis based on Jung's Psychological Types? Or is this theory just an auxiliary method, and does not play as an approach per se?</p>

"Which statistical tests to use when analyzing NASA TLX?","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA-TLX"" rel=""nofollow"">NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)</a> is a subjective, multidimensional assessment tool that rates perceived workload.

<p>Which statistical tests can be used to compare these test results? I am particularly concerned with whether or not the task load index could be considered an interval variable, and thus whether, for example, a simple student <em>t</em>-test could be used. In particular, is the NASA-TLX scalar invariant? Can a difference between two means (e.g., 50 and 60) be interpreted as equal to a difference between two other means (e.g., 10 and 20)?</p>

"What defines the easiest time to get out of bed in the morning for humans?","<p>I'm interested in sleep research, and sometimes in conversations with people the following idea gets discussed: ""A person becomes aware at a certain time in the morning and feel great(while still in bed). But the wake up time is later, so that person keeps sleeping and the feeling is gone. It's much harder to get out of bed"". The general pattern is that there's a perceived good time to get out of bed, but people oversleep it.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the second part of this statement is caused by sleep inertia, where a person slips into deeper sleep(slow wave sleep SWS) stages. But what about the perceived ""perfect wake up time""?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What sleep stage or sequence of sleep stages</strong>, if any is associated with this feeling of energy in the morning(NREM1,2?)?</li>
<li><strong>is this feeling associated with light exposure</strong> (ex: 20 minutes after light exposure)</li>
<li><strong>does it happen every day</strong>, for all people?</li>
<li>Is there some "" deep sleep hormone"" (probably not melatonin) that gets released in deeper sleep stages and produces sleep inertia?</li>
</ul>

"Are there ""6 degrees of separation"" for ideas?","<p>Sites like linkedin.com are built on the idea that you can be related to any person in the world though around 6 people. One person knows another one, that one another one, and in the end you are connected through intermediate connections.</p>

<p>I'm interested if something similar exists for ideas - <strong>does human mind naturally connect and infer from different ideas to find a relationship between ideas?</strong> I'm thinking about this in the context of Freudian dream interpretation. In his book on the analysis of dreams, Freud repeatedly lists examples where he uses analysis and logic to find meaning in dream imagery and experiences.</p>

<p>This makes me curious if what Freud has discovered is some function of memory or thinking that establishes connections between unrelated ideas through intermediate ones.</p>

<p>For example, there is no connection between cats and space flight. But ones mind may try to connect them through a cartoon episode which involved super intelligent cats from the outer space invading earth in spaceships. Now there is a connection between cats and space flight.</p>

<p>What <strong>I'm trying to ask is if it is natural for the mind to bridge gaps between unrelated ideas through intermediate ones, especially if/when a person is actively looking for a connection?</strong> if there are 6 jumps between two unrelated ideas/concepts, then there are 6 degrees of separation.</p>

<h3>Update (Description of the Method of Adjustment)</h3>

<p>The Method of Adjustment, also called Method of Average Error (Guilford, 1954), is used to psychophysically measure a subject's <em>accuracy</em> and <em>precision</em> in matching (subjectively equalizing) stimulus magnitudes.</p>

<p>Typically, subjects are asked to adjust the magnitude of a variable <em>comparison stimulus</em> (Co) until it subjectively equals the magnitude of a fixed <em>standard stimulus</em> (St). This is repeated several times$-$per St as well as for different St's. As a result, one obtains for each St a distribution of Co's. Descriptive statistics of these distributions, such as the mean and the standard deviation, are used to compute the <em>point of subjective equality</em> (PSE) and the <em>difference limen</em> (DL).</p>

<p>A measure of accuracy is the <em>constant error</em> (CE), i.e. the difference between the PSE and the St. A meaure of (relative) precision is the <em>Weber fraction</em> (W), i.e. the ratio of the DL and the St.</p>

"Islam and participation in acts of political violence","<p>This is currently a hot political topic, but what does the science say?</p>

<p>I was thinking that a good experiment would take groups of people, and match them for alternate explanations: Age, gender, socio-economic status, level of education, nationality, occupation, cultural factors, political affiliation, immigration status, etc.  (These are factors that many experiments control for when dividing subjects into groups, so is not unusual to do.)  Then look for correlations, and see if particular religious affiliations (or non-believers), are more strongly correlated with participation in acts of political violence than are other factors.</p>

<p>I have not found such a study yet.  There is a fair amount of research regarding attitudes towards violence, with mixed results (<a href=""http://www.thelocal.de/20100606/27673"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>, <a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/07/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_attitudes_towards_terrorism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>, <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/22058/have-multiple-intelligence-services-estimated-that-15-25-of-the-muslim-populati"">example</a>), but these are generally not controlled for very many factors, and do not address any actual violence rates.  There is also some research on actual violence rates (<a href=""http://www.globalresearch.ca/is-islam-violent-i-would-say-absolutely-not-berkeley-political-scientist/5450475"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>, <a href=""http://cps.sagepub.com/content/43/11/1327"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>), but again, few variables are controlled for, and the focus is on countries rather than people.</p>

"Does spanking a child teach them that it's ok for another person to touch them against their will?","<p>The debate over whether spanking is an appropriate punishment largely revolves around proponents saying that it creates a more ""disciplined"" person and opponents saying that it traumatizes the child or makes them grow up violent.</p>

<p>One thing that, as far as I know, has been overlooked is the issue of how it affects a person's sense of personal physical sovereignty. Can a child really compartmentalize spanking such that they can believe ""It is acceptable for my parent to spank me as long as a child, but nobody else, and not when I am an adult.""? It doesn't seem likely to me. It seems that, if a child is conditioned to believe that spanking is a normal and acceptable thing, it isn't a stretch to believe that other entities, such as the government, have potential suzerainty over the individual.</p>

<p>Given that any rational person should want their children to believe that nobody but nobody has the right to touch them against their will, for any reason, would it not make sense that spanking is detrimental to an individual's psyche?</p>

"Can a positive change result in positive stress?","<p>I have been researching the differences between stress and anxiety to understand them for my own curiosity. My basic understanding is that stress is a variation from routine or something that upsets your normal balance while anxiety is worry about something when there is no stressor.</p>

<p>My question, then, is this: if stress is caused by change to normal routine, would a good change with only positive effects still be considered stress? For example, going on vacation. The travel could certainly be stressful (or perhaps just anxious), but once a person arrives, lets assume they have a very good, relaxing stay. Could this be considered a stress since it is a change from the normal routine, despite having no negative effects?</p>

<p>I admit that most likely the answer lies in a misunderstanding I have about the definition of stress, but I am curious...</p>

Second one, how far can a signal travel (possibly going through several synapses) horizontally in the neocortex?</p>

"Thinking about something vs. doing something","<p>In computer programming, when a program analyzes itself, we call it ""reflection"" or ""introspection"".
Example:
A program has several features. When the program runs, it can analyze itself to determine what features it supports and present it in the user interface. The user could choose one of the features and instruct the program to run it.</p>

<p>Now, the question:
Is there an equivalent mechanism in the brain? I.e. how can the brain think/reflect about a behavior/capability without executing the behavior/capability? Is there a special ""module"" in the brain that is responsible for reflection and one responsible for execution? If yes, how does the brain decide which module to use in the specific context (thinking vs. acting)?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Schwartz and colleagues (2002) have proposed that people fall into two
  groups: those who seek to maximize their decision by finding the very
  best option out of choices presented (maximizers), and those who have
  an idea in mind of what would be an ""acceptable"" option and settle for
  the first choice that surpasses their expectations (satisficers).
  Maximizers are always on the look out for ""the best,"" are less
  satisfied with their choices, more likely to ""socially compare"" their
  options to others, and more likely to experience regret (Ma &amp; Roese,
  2014). Another recent publication proposed that when individuals
  experience ""choice closure,"" and stop re-evaluating the non-selected
  alternative options, satisfaction with choice can increase (Gu, Botti,

"Why are disorders discrete?","<p>Disorders are usually discrete. For example, if you are given a test for, say, ADHD, they are usually only two results ""you have ADHD"" or ""you don't have ADHD"". Autism is treated as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum"" rel=""noreferrer"">spectrum</a>, but this spectrum is by no means continuous, also being in discrete parts.</p>

<p>Why is this? Why can't you get a result of ""76% ADHD""? Intelligence, for example, is measured continuously, as is personality (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometrics"" rel=""noreferrer"">psychometrics</a>). Of course, tests can't be continuous, having a finite number of questions, but neither are rulers, which measure the continuous quantity of length, or IQ tests, which measure the continuous quantity of IQ.</p>

<p>So, why are disorders measured discretely? For example, if one person has 38% of a disorder, they may benefit from different treatment than someone with 87% of a disorder in a predictable way.</p>

 However as an Autistic person I find myself wondering if any of the participants in that study had any form of Autism.</p>

<p>It seems to me that if the synaptic pathways in the brain of a fetus can become so malformed that they result in things like, Learning Difficulties and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified with traits of Aspergers Syndrome, then how would the brain of an autistic person interpret a Binaural Beat in comparison to a Neurotypical person ?</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Copy Drawing</strong>: Given a randomly chosen handwritten digit, Spaun should produce the same digit written in the same style as the handwriting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digit recognition</strong>: Given a randomly chosen handwritten digit, Spaun should produce the same digit written in its default writing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>N-arm bandit task</strong>: Spaun should perform a three-armed bandit task, in which it must determine which of three possible choices generates the greatest stochastically generated reward. Reward contingencies can change from trial to trial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>List memory</strong>: Given a list of any length, Spaun should reproduce it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Counting</strong>: Counting. Given a starting value and a count value, Spaun should write the final value (that is, the sum of the two values)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Question answering</strong>:  Given a list of numbers, Spaun should answer either one of two possible questions:</p>

<p>i. What is in a given position in the list?</p>

<p>ii. Given a kind of number, at what position is this number in the list?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rapid variable creation</strong> Given example syntactic input/output patterns (e.g., 0 0 7 4 → 7 4; 0 0 2 4 → 2 4; etc.), Spaun should complete a novel pattern given only the input (e.g., 0 0 1 4 → ?)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fluid Induction</strong> Spaun should perform a syntactic or semantic reasoning task that is isomorphic to the induction problems from the Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) test for fluid intelligence</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In ""Spaun 2.0: Extending the World’s Largest Functional Brain Model"" by Xuan Choo, it is written:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The final Spaun 2.0 model consists of approximately 6.6 million
  neurons, can perform 12 cognitive tasks, and has been demonstrated to
  reproduce behavioural and neurological data observed in natural
  cognitive agents.</p>

<p>What novel cognitive tasks does Spaun 2.0 add? Reading the thesis, I've only been able to identify:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Adaptive arm control</strong>: Given a force field applied to Spaun's arm, Spaun should adapt to the force and continue to be able to draw in spite of the changing environment dynamics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stimulus matching task</strong>: Given an example image from ImageNet, match other images of the same categories.</p></li>

  <p>However, there is more to the Indian head wobble than just a cultural quirk passed through the generations. In renowned cultural scientist Geert Hofstede’s exhaustive research on cultural norms across different countries, <a href=""https://www.hofstede-insights.com/country-comparison/india/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">India scored 77 on the dimension of Power Distance</a> – the extent to which people expect and accept power inequalities within their own society – compared to a world average of 56.5.

"Why does SCID call itself ""Structured"" when by many accounts it's semi-structured?","<p>The ""S"" in SCID officially stands for ""Structured"" as in Structured Clinical Interview for DSM. But as far as I can tell for the last three editions (5, IV and III), non-official sources (research papers etc.) often refer to it as a 
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-structured_interview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">semi-structured interview</a>. e.g. <a href=""https://www.appi.org/products/structured-clinical-interview-for-dsm-5-scid-5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[0]</a>, <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deborah_Glasofer/publication/302432474_Structured_Clinical_Interview_for_DSM-IV_SCID/links/58fa1fca4585152edeceb1d0/Structured-Clinical-Interview-for-DSM-IV-SCID.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[1]</a>, <a href=""https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research/research-areas/services-policy-and-law/structured-clinical-interview-dsm-disorders-scid-0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[2]</a> / <a href=""https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/research/research-areas/services-policy-and-law/structured-clinical-interview-dsm-disorders-scid-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[3]</a>, or <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1637252"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[4]</a> etc. The first link [0] is actually APA's own publishing blurb for SCID-5. The last one [4] is Spitzer et al. (1992) paper on SCID for DSM-III... which has over 4,000 citations in Google Scholar.</p>

<p>So why is there this discrepancy between the name (as fully spelled out) and content of the SCID?</p>

<hr>

<p>I find it even more baffling after reading the introductory section of Spitzer et al., which emphasizes that SCID was designed from the get-go as semi-structured in opposition to previous [completely] structured interviews that were being advanced by others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The major contribution of DSM-III was its inclusion of
  specified diagnostic criteria for virtually all of the mental
  disorders. This made possible, at about the same time as
  the publication of DSM-III, the development of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). The DIS was designed for use by lay
  interviewers with 1 week of intensive training. Although
  originally developed for use in the Epidemiologie Catchment Area Study in which the cost of employing clinically
  trained interviewers would have been prohibitive, it has
  been used by investigators in a large number of nonepidemiologic
  studies.
  In the presidential address at the 1983 annual meeting of
  the American Psychopathological Association, titled ""Are
  Clinicians Still Necessary?"" one of us (R.L.S.) discussed the
  potential limitations of the DIS in clinical research. Without questioning the advances embodied in the DIS, it was
  argued that the most valid diagnostic assessment still required the skills of a clinician with experience in evaluating a range of psychopathology.</p>
  
  <p>Unlike a lay interviewer
  administering a completely structured interview, such as
  the DIS, an experienced clinician can tailor an interview by
  phrasing questions to fit the subject's understanding, asking additional questions that clarify differential diagnosis,
  challenging inconsistencies in the subject's account, and
  judging whether the subject's description of an experience
  conforms to the intent of a diagnostic criterion. This is
  particularly true in the diagnostic evaluation of subjects
  with psychotic symptoms who have little insight and
  present with a complicated story from which the interviewer must discern the symptom profile. For these
  reasons, two of us (R.L.S. and J.B.W.W.) started work on a
  clinical assessment procedure that would not only be
  linked to DSM-III but would incorporate several features
  not present in previous clinical diagnostic instruments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So was the naming of the SCID a case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""embrace and extend""</a> the concept of ""structured"" interview? I couldn't find the answer in Spitzer et al...</p>

"Does male preference for feminine women faces vary with bisexual orientantion and/or (BDSM) submisiveness?","<p>I found some papers on the variance of male preference for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness#Facial_features"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""feminine"" women faces</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2008.07.012"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Men report stronger attraction to femininity in women's faces when their testosterone levels are high""</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbv077"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Men’s Preferences for Female Facial Femininity Decline With Age""</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The latter is not terribly surprising given that testosterone level declines with age.</p>

<p>In case one wonders, the latter paper also gives a brief description how the facial ""femininity"" is operationalized in terms of</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>facial features such as higher cheekbones, a rounder forehead, smaller chin and nose, and rounder eyes (Farkas, 1987). The aggregate differences between women and men in this combination of facial features are often referred to as “facial femininity” (Little et al., 2011)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably the most interesting paper (that I found) in this line of research <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33545.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has these elaborate findings</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>preference for feminine faces was not only influenced by sibling age and sex, but also [...] fatherhood modulated this preference. Men with sisters had a weaker preference for femininity than men with brothers, highlighting a possible effect of a negative imprinting-like mechanism. What is more, fatherhood increased strongly the preference for facial femininity. Finally, for fathers with younger sisters only, the more the age difference increased between them, the more femininity preference increased. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also there's a <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/40/14388"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Western-culture association with the preference</a>.</p>

<p>After glancing at those papers, I have some ""obvious"" questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is this preference also affected by bisexual orientation, i.e. do bisexual men report a less strong preference for ""feminine"" women faces?</li>
<li>is this preference also affected by dominance/submission-preference in a BDSM-type relationship?</li>
</ul>

<p>(Yeah, asking two questions in one is somewhat frowned upon, but these seem related enough and a review paper might answer them both.)</p>

"Any academic research/term for (some) men's preference for muscular female bodies?","<p>While I was searching for articles on the correlates of attraction to female ""feminine"" faces I ran into some non-academic discussions on the attraction that some men apparently have for muscular women, e.g. <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-am-I-attracted-to-girls-who-are-very-muscular"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on quora</a> or on <a href=""https://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=4316883&amp;pagenumber=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bodybuilding.com forms</a>, where some of the folk opinion (fairly predictably) was that such men are ""closet homo"" etc. </p>

<p>I'm at a loss how to search for any academic works on this topic, i.e. what's some terminology used; is there any academic research on this phenomenon at all?</p>

<p>As a related matter, there is some academic research on the nature of visual preferences of bisexual males, e.g. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22875715"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">using swimsuit images</a>, but only typical male/female images were used in that paper, not anything more ""in-between"", e.g. in terms of muscularity (or facial features). It's also quite easy to find reseach on the culturally-expected phenomenon <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sex-muscles1/women-drawn-to-men-with-muscles-idUSEIC04599320070710"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""women drawn to men with muscles""</a> or <a href=""https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20000810/attraction-to-muscular-men"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">articles trying to limit/disprove that</a>.

<p>In a case Wikipedia having surprisingly little google juice, on the 5th page of google results; I discovered its article on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_worship"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""muscle worship""</a>, which does contain some Latin-ish (how else) academic terms: sthenolagnia (=""sexual arousal from displaying strength or muscles"") and cratolagnia (""arousal from strength""). But these terms can simply refer to the ""worship"" participants fitting culturally-expected roles; I did find there that it's supposedly very prevalent among gay men, but there's no citation to back that up, and in any case it isn't what I was looking for. A similarly uncited statement is that </p>

<blockquote>

"How is the brain cooled?","<p>I remember[ed] reading <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219"" rel=""noreferrer"">a story</a> on a brain-inspired integrated mechanism for energy-delivery and cooling in (experimental) new computer chips:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match.</p>
  
  <p>Its new ""redox flow"" system pumps an electrolyte ""blood"" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. [...]</p>
  
  <p>""The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today.</p>
  
  <p>""That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But as with other biology-inspired stuff, neural networks in particular, what ultimately becomes useful in computer science/engineering may not be that closely related to the way biology actually works.</p>

<p>So what I want to ask here is: are there some detailed mass-and-heat flow analyses for how the brain (of humans or even of other mammals) is actually cooled? How is most of the heat exhausted from the brain? Is it really thorough blood, and then globally through the whole body? Or is mostly a more local process at head level?</p>

<hr>

<p>I managed to find something about the <a href=""https://bioheat.umbc.edu/files/2015/07/Chapter2_2007.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">importance of blood for cooling</a>, but only at whole-body level:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second influence of the blood flow is that it can enhance heat
  dissipation from the inside of the body to the environment to maintain a normal body temperature.
  Theoretical study has shown that if the heat produced in the central areas of the body at rest
  condition could escape only by tissue conduction, the body temperature would not reach a steady
  state until it was about 80°C. A lethal temperature would be reached in only 3 hours. During exercise,
  our body temperature would have typically risen 12°C in 1 hour if no heat were lost by
  blood flow. Maintaining a core temperature of 37°C during thermal stress or exercise in the body
  is achieved by increasing the cardiac output by central and local thermoregulation, redistributing
  heat via the blood flow from the muscle tissue to the skin, and speeding the heat loss to the environment
  by evaporation of sweat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So from that I suspect blood is surely important for cooling the brain as well, but still some questions remain, e.g. where does most of the heat from the brain get dumped by the blood? In more layman's terms: is the rest of the body necessary as a radiator for the brain, or is the skull enough for that purpose?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00186829"" rel=""noreferrer"">a paper</a> cited by AliceD on biology.SE, I also found some anatomical considerations from about two decades ago... which seem to not be very conclusive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Selective brain cooling (SBC) is understood as a natural
  mechanism that enables mammals to maintain their brain
  temperature below the temperature of the rest of the
  body during states of hyperthermia (Baker 1979). [...]</p>
  
  <p>The question whether SBC also operates in humans, who
  lack cranial retia mirabilia, has led to an interesting controversy.
  For some authors (Brengelmann 1987) the copious
  and constant arterial blood flow to the brain appears
  sufficient to cool the brain under all conditions. Others
  (Cabanac 1993) concede that this concept may be correct
  for the conditions at normothermia, but they propose that
  an additional brain-directed cooling mechanism becomes
  effective during hyperthermia. These authors draw attention
  to vascular arrangements in humans, which permit
  effects comparable to SBC in ""rete species"". Cabanac
  (1993) points to several sites of intimate thermal contact
  between the arterial and the cooler venous blood, e.g.,
  the internal carotid in the carotid canal, where the artery
  is tightly surrounded by the venous plexus caroticus and
  thereafter immersed in the cavernous sinus, and the vertebral
  arteries surrounded by a plexus of veins where
  they course through the transverse foramina (see our Fig.
  14). Furthermore, Cabanac refers to the high cooling capacity
  of the skin of the head (particularly rich in sweat
  glands), whence venous blood, cooled by sweat evaporation,
  flows via emissary veins towards the brain in hyperthermic
  situations (Caputa et al. 1978; Cabanac and
  Brinnel 1985; Deklunder et al. 1991; Hiroshita et al.
  1991). An additional loss of heat occurs in the upper airways
  (Cabanac 1993), including the paranasal sinuses. A
  direct conductive skin-brain heat exchange has also been
  considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2004.08.079"" rel=""noreferrer"">decade-later paper by Caputa</a> still noted that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The existence of effective SBC in humans has not been
  proven directly because brain temperature has never
  been recorded in healthy subjects exposed to hyperthermic
  conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Healthy volunteers who received LSD, ketamine or psilocybin, a compound found in magic mushrooms, were found to have more random brain activity than normal while under the influence, according to a study into the effects of the drugs.</p>
  
  <p>Researchers at the University of Sussex and Imperial College, London, measured the activity of neurons in people’s brains as the drugs took hold. Similar measurements have shown that when people are asleep or under anaesthetic, their neurons tend to fire in a more predictable way than when they are awake.</p>
  
  <p>“What we find is that under each of these psychedelic compounds, this specific measure of global conscious level goes up, so it moves in the other direction. The neural activity becomes more unpredictable,” said Anil Seth, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex. “Until now, we’ve only ever seen decreases compared to the baseline of the normal waking state.”</p>
  
  <p>The research, published in the journal Scientific Reports, appears 74 years to the day after the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman went on the world’s first LSD trip. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the Guardian article just gets into a long expose of Hoffman's experience. But it does seem to identify one of the authors a bit later on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robin Carhart-Harris, a researcher at Imperial College who took part in the study, said the sudden increase in randomness in brain activity appeared to reflect a deeper and richer conscious state.</p>
  
  <p>“People tend to associate phrases like ‘a higher state of consciousness’ with hippy speak and mystical nonsense. This is potentially the beginning of the demystification, showing its physiological and biological underpinnings,” he said. “Maybe this is a neural signature of the mind opening.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>N.B. a quick search found <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZIaTaNR3gk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a TEDx talk by Carhart-Harris</a> on the topic, but it seems older than this study.

<p>So I have some questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can anyone locate this Scientific Reports study?</li>
<li>Has there been any more skeptical commentary on it? Or is there (silent) agreement that it really proves psychedelics induce a heightened state of consciousness?</li>

"What are the personality correlates of moral outrage?","<p>It seems surprisingly hard to pin down what moral outrage actually involves. It's easier to say <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ejsp.434"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">what it isn't</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, moral outrage—anger at the
  violation of a moral standard—should be distinguished from personal anger at being harmed and
  empathic anger at seeing another for whom one cares harmed. Across a preliminary experiment and a
  main experiment, both designed to manipulate the appraisal conditions for these three forms of anger,
  we found evidence of personal anger and empathic anger, but little evidence of moral outrage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is basically: <strong>what is known about personality correlates of moral outrage?</strong> Below are some musings of my own:</p>

<p>I'm guessing some level of extroversion might be needed to <em>express</em> it, but it might even depend on how that outrage is expressed, e.g. online or in a rally or face-to-face etc.</p>

<p>It's even less clear to me what would correlate (personality wise) with just <em>feeling</em> such an outrage (keeping in mind the non-trivial distinctions from the quote). Possibly the close-mindedness from Big Five (opposite of openness) plays a role, but it's unclear to me if it's universally relevant. E.g. outrage at bigotry could have the exact opposite personality correlates to outrage at unconventional behavior. Maybe the humility/honesty in the HEXACO model has some correlation as well, e.g. with outrage at theft of aggrandisement.</p>

<p>And apparently I'm not the only one to think <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/03/moral-outrage-public-anger-reasons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">something like that</a>:</p>

  <p>outrage is driven by differing conceptions of what is just. For example, a recent Super Bowl ad featuring a Latino mother and young daughter making the long journey from Mexico to the United States – only to be confronted by a border wall – elicited very different responses of outrage. That’s because those who see the exclusion of immigrants as unjust and those who see maintaining a strict border as justified share a common desire to promote what they see as moral.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, maybe I'm wrong to assume there are any universal correlates in the current personality models. If that's the case, are there more specific personality facets proposed for correlating with ""moral outrage""? Something like a strong sense of having a ""moral compass""?</p>

<p>From the previous link:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our work highlights a third motive that is based on people’s desire to view themselves as morally upright people. Threats to one’s moral self-image have been shown to elicit unpleasant feelings of guilt that can motivate efforts to restore a positive view of oneself. This is commonly expressed by issuing an apology or making amends.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So maybe feeling moral outrage is actually related to Neuroticism? That seems a bit simplistic to me.</p>

"Is there a formal name for the compulsive and recurrent urges to pick one's nose in order to remove perceived imperfections?","<p>Under which formal category does the following condition fall?: the condition of experiencing frequent and compulsive urges to pick one's nose searching for any possible perceived imperfections (be they wet snot, dry snot and even scabs) in order to remove them or ""smooth them out"" by means of scratching, in a sort of endless pursuit for a sensation of perfect smoothness within one's nose (endless because the sensation of perfect smoothness is never quite achieved and usually the scratching itself leads to bleeding and scabs which paradoxically become the fuel for future nose picking sessions, in an endless cycle). Likewise, are there any formal treatments to cure this particular condition? How effective are these treatments? Are there any studies on this? References are very welcomed.</p>

"Psychology of disrespect and being proud of law breaking. How does it work and how to combat it?","<p>I'm gonna talk about Russia. :) I'm not interested in foreign policy, relations, for this question... maybe just a tiny bit. </p>

<p>A little preamble. <br>
After the collapse of the Soviet Union (hereinafter S.U.), the people got lost, they didn't know who they were, what they wanted to do and who was going to tell them what to do. S.U. did a really good cleansing (of people's minds)... they were destroying all the traditions and knowledge that people lived by before S.U.: how to organize themselves, how to protect your property and even how to manage your household (if you're living in your own house). Private property, businesses, gold and anything valuable were seized. From the Party's point of view it was better if you live in an apartment rather than your own house. So, after the collapse, it was, loosely translated in English, the wild and evil ’90s. Basically the time of socio-political chaos. All the bad in people surfaced and no one to stop them because bribery was a second nature and it got instilled in the culture and the government.</p>

<p>Now to the point of the question. <br>
Nowadays, when people break laws, even those that just a manifestations of common sense and you point that out, they tend to just show ""muscles"" and try to scare you away. Examples: driving in places when it's prohibited, littering, bribing the law enforcement, causing disturbances (e.g. playing loud music). Driving dangerously is a particularly big problem. </p>

<p>The reasoning often goes something like this: that's ok, no one's there, and it's really stupid not to take the ""opportunity"" (for saving little time, money, effort), I will do no harm... And even if you don't take this ""opportunity"", in some circles there can be social pressure to act like this. Romanticizing and glorifying a criminal life-style is somewhat prevalent... unfortunately teens often don't grow out of it. The civil court is a huge hassle (unless you're some sort of a government worker), police officers often ignore ""small"" violations and you left with the aggressor alone, imagine a big guy with no morals or a sociopath. </p>

<p><strong>Why people don't see that they live such an a-typical, perhaps anti-social or criminal, life?</strong> And is there a way to go about to make those people aware of how they behave?</p>

<p>Any terms in psychology that describe this, any books to read or forums to visit... I'll appreciate any advice. </p>

"Is there a psychological term for enduring hardship to achieve a promised state?","<p>I'm new to CogSci and to Psychology in general, so forgive me if this question has been answered before...</p>

<p>I see a pattern in many sociological environments that goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Someone promises a better (possibly imaginary) state of living to someone else</li>
<li>But this better state will only be achieved if the someone else endures a hardship period or similar</li>
<li>A lot of ""Someone elses"" go through the hardship, and many of them endure a lot of time and justify what they are doing, even though nothing has really changed.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I am most interested in is this aspect of point 3: that, even if there isn't a real difference, people will think there is, just because they endured the hardship.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>a) A promise that some phone/shoe/whatever is much better than the alternative, but it is overpriced. People who bought it (endured the hardship) will find a justification for it at any cost (even if there isn't one).</p>

<p>b) A promise to achieve a peaceful state of mind through daily meditation for a long period of time. People who are committed to meditating will find any small improvement in life as if it was related to that.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a psychological term for this ""phenomenon""/behavior? Has it been studied (I'm sure it might have been)?</strong></p>

"Can the V * I * E theory of motivation explain the motivation of Nelson Mandela?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The V * I * E theory of motivation (Galbraith &amp; Cummings, 1967; Vroom, 1964) posits that if either the value of a goal, its instrumentality or the expectancy to reach it is zero, then an individual will not be motivated to reach that goal (please correct me if I'm wrong). </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nelson Mandela</a> spent 27 years in jail because he was an anti-apartheid revolutionary. Apparently, he never gave up his mission. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Can the VIE theory of motivation, or newer developments of it, explain thoroughly why some people don't give up their goals even if they to live under adverse conditions for a very long period of time?</p>

<p><em>More details</em>: One might argue that such a person didn't lose the goal but just didn't try to realize it as long as it wasn't possible. In other words: the value was kept upright but the expectancy was zero. On the other hand, if V, I or E is zero, then the motivation - the drive - is zero as well. It is unclear what kept upright the value in this case. What drives a person in such a situation to keep fighting and can that be explained by the VIE theory of motivation?</p>

<p>Having reviewed the literature, I'm under the impression that they often occur in stress related situations or serotonin dysregulation (MDMA seems to trigger brain zaps), but I also read isolated people claiming they could voluntarily trigger brain zaps by ""tensing up"" and voluntary eye movements.

Also a few marginal reports of brain zaps by heavy opiate, LSD, DXM and ketamin users, but who do not seem specific about details.</p>

<p>Ambivalence is a state of having simultaneous, conflicting feelings toward a person or thing.<a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/4402/why-do-people-say-they-hate-drama"">1</a> Stated another way, ambivalence is the experience of having thoughts and/or emotions of both positive and negative valence toward someone or something. The term also refers to situations where ""mixed feelings"" of a more general sort are experienced, or where a person experiences uncertainty or indecisiveness concerning something. The expressions ""cold feet"" and ""sitting on the fence"" are often used to describe the feeling of ambivalence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambivalence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ambivalence</a> is experienced as psychologically unpleasant when the positive and negative aspects of a subject are both present in a person's mind at the same time. This state can lead to avoidance or procrastination, or to deliberate attempts to resolve the ambivalence. When the situation does not require a decision to be made, people experience less discomfort even when feeling ambivalent.</p>
  
  <p>It is normal to have ambivalence from time to time about how we feel about another individual, whether we can trust the authenticity of a person. As human beings are multidimensional creatures. Trials and triumphs both bring out different aspects that are part of the one person. A person's mood, can change the way that person relates to others. Combined with the modulation of the observer's own internal processes, there can be a varying perception between two people. </p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br>
Pseudo-random, 'swaying', motion appears to help induce a flow state, in that it 'captures' the movements of an activity and entrains them to an underlying rhythm of activity.  Time between activity-related movements is reduced, and error-recovery time is also reduced.  (again, this is from first-hand observation, not published results).</p>

<p><em>The following is the relevant explanatory section of the 2nd question's answer:</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Seen from this perspective, cyclical movements are the norm for almost any animal,    whereas short-duration, ""single-use"" movements like typing or playing the piano are rather unusual. It could be the case that if the motor cortex (or even the basic movements encoded in the spinal cord) is inherently tuned to modeling cyclic movements, then adding some continuous motion could help the motor cortex capture the intended typing or playing movements as part of the larger, continuous movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last question I have is if the frequency of the periodic movements, which in general follow a 'figure-8' track, could be related to the frequency of other cycles in the body?  For example, could the frequency of motion reflect the active frequency of the brain, e.g. EEG waves?  Or could it reflect a different neural/physiological cycle or state?</p>

<p>Naturally this is a tricky question: on one hand, the activity itself serves to entrain the neural system to a certain periodicity.  On the other hand, if the rhythmic movement activity is allowed to 'float' in frequency organically, does its characteristics reflect anything about the initial state of the neural system?</p>

<p><strong>Final question(s):<br>
Does the frequency of movement give clues to other periodic cycles, such as EEG waves?<br>
Does said movement give any other insight into the brain/body state?</strong>  </p>

"What is the primary mechanism behind nationalism, sports-team-ism, product-ism etc.?","<p>I'm interested in doing research on the subject of nationalism, but I believe that what I'm looking for is more generic than that. I observe that nationalism looks similar to the way that people feel about their sports team or their favorite product or their religion or their race. People proselytize for these things, and people sometimes kill over them (e.g. -- soccer riots). I note also that this kind of devotion can also produce strong negative feelings towards the other teams, countries, etc.</p>

<p>In each case, a person exhibiting this behavior with respect to a country, sports team, or product has at least one of the following characteristics (maybe others?).</p>

<ol>
<li>Person <strong>identifies</strong> personally with X.</li>
<li>Person feels a sense of <strong>belonging</strong> with others who also identify with X.</li>
<li>Person is inclined to <strong>convince others</strong> that they should also follow/admire/believe X.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there an underlying mechanism behind these symptoms or term that describes this behavior? What is the body of study that examines these types of behaviors (causes, definitions, and effects)? If there isn't a particular term for this as a generic subject of study, are there at least some studies that examine the common features of these behaviors?</p>

<p>What I have researched so far: <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/3988"">This question</a> helped a little bit in thinking about this issue, but I'm not sure it answers my question. Also, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maslow%27s_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maslow's hierarchy of needs</a> points to ""respect by others"" and ""belonging"" as posibilities, but I don't know much beyond that or where to look.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update</p>

<p>I'm stuck. I'm just not sure that ingroups and outgroups really characterize the <strong>fundamental mechanism behind why people hold some beliefs with evangelistic or violent fervor</strong>. That feature of human nature is not dependent on the existence of a group. If I try to convert someone to my way of thinking, I am not doing so because of a group to which I belong. Certainly group behaviors that @PEEJWEEJ mentioned can feed such sentiments, but like I mentioned to @Ana, I'm not convinced that the group itself is the cause. Perhaps I could be persuaded otherwise, but I think there's something else going on here.</p>

"Can asking a leading question in a poll change the opinion of the respondent?","<p>Poll* questions if phrased in a way to suggest a fact to the reader, may force the person to think of explanations to support the view expressed in the question. This belief may then last on its own because of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance#Persistence_of_discredited_beliefs"">belief perseverance</a>.</p>

<p>For example, if a poll ask questions of the form :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do you think 90% of people behave in {situation}?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or, political questions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which party do you believe is trusted by over 70% of the voters? Options:{Plausible Party A} {Small unknown party B}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or from the opposition party,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which party do people relate to when thinking of corruption? Options: {Ruling Party} {Small unknown party}</p>

<p>Or, another of the commercial flavour,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which company comes to the mind of 70% of the people when they think of clean water? Options : {Big company A} {Small unknown company B}</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By choosing options wisely, the poll creator can force certain ideas into the minds of individuals under the banner of ""popular opinion"" without them even realising it. By trying to rationalise why or how the most likely option is correct, individuals giving the poll will essentially think up of or create evidence. This will then further reinforce and plant the suggested idea with varying degrees of permanence.</p>

<p>So, does the concept of belief permanence thus imply (as explained above) that polls can be used to plant incorrect ideas/information in people? </p>

<p>Also, can polls thereby be an effective marketing technique for companies and/or political parties when trying to shape public opinion?</p>

<p><sub> By poll, I mean any form of interaction which involves Q&amp;A with or without the provision of correct feedback at the end. I do not mean only elections or opinion polls.</sub> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The unconscious] can do many processes at the same time. You can either focus on one
  thing  or another, you can't focus on two or three things at the same time. Because
  consciousness is very limited in what it can do; unconsciousness is much broader. And
  although we know very little about the true nature of creativity, one emerging theme that
  comes out of this is that, if you're trying to solve a mathematical problem... if
  you're trying to solve any intellectual problem... you keep on focusing at it, you may
  get stuck. Taking a break, taking a shower, going for a walk, playing golf, you come
  back refreshed. And often doing the other activity, <em>boom</em>, the idea will come to you.</p>

"Beyond a certain level, is reading comprehension affected more by psychological intuition than by verbal intelligence?","<p>Certainly, you have reading comprehension passages on the SAT, GRE, and LSAT. <strong>But beyond that point, is it really possible to measure reading comprehension through multiple-choice tests?</strong> There are multiple motivations for why an author may make argument X, and multiple interpretations of his exact argument, which may be affected by the immediate circumstances that made him write that argument at that particular point in time (and while we may know a bit about the society that he lived in, chances are that we'll probably never know who he intended the book to be written for - hell - some people probably intended to write a book to impress some potential lover [and hell, maybe some passages in the book are motivated to attract the sympathy of that lover] even though they pretended to write it for the greater good of society). </p>

<p>I mean, all you have to do is to look at courtrooms. There, people pretty much argue about what people (in a case with precedent) actually meant, and there's usually no concrete (and correct) answer. And people who study the life of a particular philosopher may have multiple interpretations of why philosopher X wrote passage Y, and what X really meant in writing passage Y. </p>

<p>Plus, it's oftentimes very interesting to read the writing of someone you know REALLY well because you know their life so well that you can dream up hypotheses of what prompted them to write passage X at time Y (and you also know his social network so you could imagine what audience he had in mind, and what audience he might have secretly hoped to impress without mentioning it). And perhaps because of this, reading comprehension is not a skill with a single scale, since people are better at understanding some people than they are at understanding others.</p>

<p>I mean, I guess the ultimate test of reading comprehension would be to test someone on one of Immanuel Kant's books, or on some recent postmodernist book (made artificially difficult to read/parse), and then ask him ""well, what is Kant trying to get at""? But is that really a valid test? Or maybe one where you have to dissect the entire structure of a book where X is pretending to be Y pretending to be Y pretending to be X (of course, such books are rarely written, but theoretically possible). </p>

<p><strong>Alternatively, wouldn't someone with exceptional reading comprehension be better at reading crappy writing?</strong> (because they're probably more able to process multiple thought-streams at once - which includes possible fragmentary/jumbled ideas?) A common assumption in reading comprehension tests is that the writing is ""perfect"", but this is frequently not the case, and people (especially older people) can get attention lapses when writing</p>

"Are there any connectionist models that integrate reinforcement and  fully supervised learning?","<p>I've been working on modeling some phenomena involving real-time control in an environment with inherent rewards (specifically, playing a 'pong'-like game), and it's increasingly looking like reinforcement learning by itself won't cut it computationally (I'm currently using a <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/group/pdplab/pdphandbook/handbookch10.html#x26-1290009"" rel=""nofollow"">temporal difference back propagation neural network</a>).</p>

<p>One possible supplemental learning mechanism is to also have the model predict the environment's future state, from which it can learn from in a supervised manner using standard feed forward back propagation.</p>

In training this net, I simply change the weights via reinforcement learning first and then change them again to account for the state prediction error via back prop.</p>

  <p>What is the character of the NCC? Most popular has been the belief
  that consciousness arises as an emergent property of a very large
  collection of interacting neurons (for instance, Libet 1993). In this
  view, it would be foolish to locate consciousness at the level of
  individual neurons. An alternative hypothesis is that there are
  special sets of ``consciousness"" neurons distributed throughout cortex
  and associated systems. <strong>Such neurons represent the ultimate neuronal
  correlate of consciousness, in the sense that the relevant activity of
  an appropriate subset of them is both necessary and sufficient to give
  rise to an appropriate conscious experience or percept (Crick and Koch
  1998).</strong> Generating the appropriate activity in these neurons, for
  instance by suitable electrical stimulation during open skull surgery,
  would give rise to the specific percept.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For decades, a different game, chess, has held the exalted position of
  “the drosophila of cognitive science”—the model organism that
  scientists could poke and prod to learn what makes experts better than
  the rest of us. StarCraft 2, however, might be emerging as the rhesus
  macaque: its added complexity may confound researchers initially, but
  the answers could ultimately be more telling.   “I can’t think of a
  cognitive process that’s not involved in StarCraft,” says Mark Blair,
  a cognitive scientist at Simon Fraser University. “It’s working
  memory. It’s decision making. It involves very precise motor skills.
  Everything is important and everything needs to work together.”</p>
  
  <p>Blair, the Simon Fraser University scientist running the SkillCraft
  project, asked gamers at all ability levels to submit their replay
  files. He and his colleagues collected more than 4500 files, of which
  at least 3500 turned out to usable. “What we’ve got is a satellite
  view of expertise that no one was able to get before,” he says. “We
  have hundreds of players at the basic levels, then hundreds more at
  level slightly better, and so on, in 8 different categories of
  players.” By comparing the techniques and attributes of low-level
  players with other gamers up the chain of ability, they can start to
  discern how skills develop—and perhaps, over the long run, identify
  the most efficient training regimen.</p>
  
  <p>Both Blair and Lewis see parallels between the game and emergency
  management systems. In a high-stress crisis situation, the people in
  charge of coordinating a response may find themselves facing competing
  demands. Alarms might be alerting them to a fire burning in one part
  of town, a riot breaking out a few streets over, and the contamination
  of drinking water elsewhere. The mental task of keeping cool and
  distributing attention among equally urgent activities might closely
  resemble the core challenge of Starcraft 2. “For emergencies, you
  don’t get to train eight hours a day. You get two emergencies in your
  life but you better be good because lives are at stake,” Blair says.
  “Training in something like Starcraft could be really useful.”</p>

"What transient factors affect performance on IQ tests?","<p>While performance on intelligence tests aim to measure an underlying relatively stable trait, there are presumably a range of transient factors that could temporarily lower or possibly even raise scores on such tests.</p>

"What structures in the brain are called upon to strengthen coupling between bilateral movements?","<p>It is very difficult for the normally-coordinated person to be able to pat his/her head and rub his/her stomach at the same time (or pick a similar activity).  It seems to be possible to maintain the separate hand motions over the short term, but keeping the movements separate is almost impossible to keep up.  One ends up either rubbing the head while rubbing the stomach or patting the head while patting the stomach before long.  Effectively, there seems to be a ""locking"" between the motor cortices across the hemispheres during bilateral movements of the arms.</p>

<p>Given all of this complex coordination that is possible between the two arms/hands, what are the structures within the brain that are called upon to strengthen the coupling between the two arms during bilateral movements?

"Why is it so difficult to use a ""true mirror"" as a mirror","<p>This Youtube video shows what a ""true mirror"" is: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSxCZCy5Wsk"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSxCZCy5Wsk</a></p>

<p>In short, when you look into a true mirror you look at yourself (among other things) as you really are, instead of as a mirror image. That is what looking at real time video recording feels like.</p>

<p>But as anyone ever tried shaving or doing their makeup using a live video can tell, a true mirror makes you clumsy, to say the least. From my own experience, I find myself constantly confuse both left-right and front-back in such a case, which is interesting because a true image is just a mirror image that reverses left-right and front-back. So it seems to me some part of my brain in some sense recognizes my true image as a mirror image, and summons whatever pertinent mirror image circuits to automatically take on from there. Any other thoughts on how to explain this difficulty?</p>

<p>Think about this: suppose a person grows up never seeing a mirror reflection, will he be able to use a mirror for the first time? will he not be better off with a ""true mirror"" than with a mirror? If he grows up using true mirrors, will he be as clumsy with mirrors as we are with true mirrors? We feel natural and at ease dealing with mirror images. Is this just the result of practice and experience? I'm curious if a true mirror will become as natural as a mirror if one uses it for long enough.    </p>

"How to integrate word prediction keyboard into P300-based BCI (brain computer interface) system?","<p>See this question in <a href=""https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/71990/how-to-integrate-word-prediction-keyboard-into-p300-based-bci-brain-computer-in"">User Experience</a>.
Farwell and Donchin (1988) described a P300 based BCI selecting letters by detecting P300 responding to the flashing letters. According to this system, only one target can be detected each time, thus only one flashing group. If we use word prediction keyboard in this system, once a letter is selected, the predicted words will appear on the screen. If next letter and the predicted words flash at the same time, the system is not able to tell which to select. What's the best way to integrate word prediction keyboard into this system? two ideas below:</p>

<ol>
<li>to have the keyboard disappeared after a letter is selected, only leave predicted words appear on the screen. If nothing is selected in a limited time, remove the words and the keyboard comes back, subject continues to spell.</li>
<li>same idea as above, instead of removing  the keyboard, just to stop the keyboard from flashing when the predicted words are flashing after a letter is selected. </li>
</ol>

<p>However, both might slow down the spelling process if subjects only need words with 3 or fewer letters. Any other ideas?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vuPhC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Fig. 1. An example from the Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory at East Tennessee State University 
[To spell the word ""DOG"", as rows and columns flash successively, the user has to count how many times the letter 'D' (the target) flashes. This results in a P300 response being generated each time the row or column containing the target flashes. The twelve-flash series is repeated a predetermined number of times. The responses for each row and column are averaged, and a classifier is applied to determine how closely each averaged response resembles the P300. The intersection of the row and column with the highest classification values is selected. In this case, the row and column containing the target letter 'D' would be selected, and a ""D"" would be presented as feedback to the user on the line below the presented word ""DOG"" at the top of the matrix.]</p>

<p>For some context, I'm asking this because coming from a computational perspective this doesn't really make sense.

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Confirmation bias</a>: ""the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.""

<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Peak-end rule</a>: ""a psychological heuristic in which people judge experiences largely based on how they were at their peak (i.e., their most intense point) and at their end."" This suggests optimizing for a good <em>last</em> impression.</li>

Is pleasure just some sort of indicator of your neurotransmitters? Just as you might feel hot/cold, you might feel pleasure/pain.

Or could it be that we naturally have a strong tendency to have almost obsessive thoughts of the future, and being rational about it? Meaning, we might not even get any sort of pleasure from being pragmatic - it's just something that we do, because we get repetitive thoughts of ""that's reasonable"" ?</p>

She has been profoundly deaf from the age of 12, but learned to differentiate pitch tactilely. She had absolute pitch, which obviously helped. She plays bare feet in order ""to hear"". </p>

<p>She can also help accoustical engineers, as she can sense the air pressure.</p>

<p>In her <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU3V6zNER4g"">TED talk</a>, she describes that she hears music like everybody. There seem to be no doubts that she has the same perception of music than any other great musician when the sound information, in the form of vibration, can be treated by her musical brain.</p>

<p>This seems to show that musical information can be accurately transmitted through tactile vibration.
My question : is it conceivable to transmit all sound information in the tactile modality ?  Are tactile detectors sufficiently sensitive to let through all/most of the sound information ?  </p>

<p>I guess language is very particular and it would be impossible to differentiate words directly from sound vibrations, but maybe the sound signal could be modified in a way to make speech sounds more distinguishable.</p>

<p>If possible, I guess it could have great applications, helping deaf people, and maybe enabling communication in noisy environment.</p>

"What is so ""potential"" about action potentials?","<p>When an action potential is propagating through a neuron, it seems to me that the time for ""potential of action"" is over, and that we are now just in a state of ""action"". Why don't we just call action potentials ""action""? Where is the potential for action when the neuron itself is undergoing action? In fact, when a neuron is at rest, it is said to have a ""resting potential"". To me this seems more like a ""resting state"" and an ""action state"". So what is so potential about ""action potentials""?</p>
"
"Explanatory gaps in the formation and propagation of action potentials","<p>To my understanding, the steps of an action potential are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The neuron is at rest--there is a negative charge (K ions) inside the cell, and a positive charge (Na ions) outside the cell. Pumps work hard, pumping in K and pumping out Na to maintain this polarization.</p></li>
<li><p>Excitatory NTs bind with the dendrites. As soon as it's over a certain threshold it triggers an action potential.</p></li>
<li><p>The inside of the cell depolarizes, and the depolarized ""chunk"" propagates through the axon.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now here's my confusion:</p>

<p>A. How do neurotransmitters manage to depolarize the inside of the cell? Do they force the cell to give up pumping out Na ions? Do the neurotransmitters themselves contain positively charged ions that the ion pumps are not sensitive to?</p>

<p>B. When the cell depolarizes, the electrical impulse travels down the axon. When this happens, Na+ and K+ ions rapidly pass through the membrane as the signal fires. (Like this picture) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential#mediaviewer/File:Action_Potential.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential#mediaviewer/File:Action_Potential.gif</a></p>

<p>Why are ions being pumped in and out of the axon in such a way to propagate an action potential? Why isn't it just a positively charged signal running through the axon, without regard to the outside environment? (please let me know if this is unclear!)</p>

<p>The above study from 1984 at Stanford found that oral administration of baclofen somewhat improved sleep in patients with PLM-associated arousals. The results seem fairly positive, with the finding essentially that although baclofen increased the <em>number</em> of PLMs, it decreased their amplitude, and decreased the length of the arousals associated with PLMs. </p>

<p>My question then is why does there seem to be no follow-up research on the treatment of PLMD (i.e. arousals caused by PLMs) with baclofen? I understand that RLS (Restless Leg Syndrome) is accompanied by PLMS in about 80% of RLS cases, and since dopaminergics and anti-convulsants are generally more effective treatment for RLS than are muscle relaxants (like baclofen) the research on RLS and baclofen is not extensive. But in cases of PLM-associated arousals unaccompanied by sensations of restlessness (RLS), why is there no further research on the seemingly promising treatment of baclofen?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although much has been written about the moral basis of authoritarianism,
  empirical research on the relationship between moral judgment level and
  authoritarian and ethnocentric attitudes has been sparse. In this study, I hypothesized
  that higher levels of moral judgment are related to anti-authoritarian and antiethnocentric
  attitudes, whereas lower moral levels predict the presence of authoritarian
  and ethnocentric opinions. Dutch university students (n = 126) and high school
  students (n = 88) completed the Sociomoral Reflection Objective Measure (SROM)
  and scales for authoritarianism and ethnocentrism. Results in the two samples converge:
  Moral judgment level indeed appears to be related to authoritarianism in the
  expected direction and—to a lesser extent—to ethnocentrism äs well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have these findings (either for authoritarianism or ethnocentrism) been confirmed in other studies?</p>

<p>(The ethnocentrism scale used by van Ijzendoorn seems pretty obscure; it was only published in Dutch. He used a Dutch version of Adorno's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-scale_(personality_test)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F scale</a> for authoritarianism.)</p>

"Where can I find recent research on the role of context effect in perception of similarity?","<p>BACKGROUND. I’m writing a paper on the role of similarity in the theories of concept empiricism developed by the British Empiricists Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, and how the idea of context effect from modern cognitive psychology could be used to better understand these theories. The basic idea I’d like to develop in my paper is that similarity is contextual, relative to a frame of reference, and this can explain how a general abstract idea (on Locke’s theory of abstraction) or a set of similar ideas held together in the mind that are called up by awareness of an exemplar (on Berkeley and Hume’s theory of general ideas) can be formed from particular instances none of which are identical: while not identical, they are similar to each other in a certain context, relative to a certain frame of reference, and thus can be classified together by the mind (e.g. scarlet and crimson are not identical but are similar to each other, in context, relative to aquamarine; or mammals are all different from each other but similar to each other relative to birds; or birds and mammals are different but relative to plants are similar. Etc.)</p>

"Are there researched approaches to learning a subject more quickly?","<p>TLDR at bottom.</p>

<p>So from my knowledge(correct me if I'm wrong) there is no evidence to suggest that we can improve general intelligence. But what about improving skills/intuition in specialized fields like programming or mathematics? </p>

<p>I went through this course on coursera called Learning how to learn by Barbara Oakley(engineering professor) who suggests the following to quickly learn new subjects: </p>

<ol>
<li>Pomodoro technique 25 minutes study 5 min break</li>
<li>Eliminate Distractions</li>
<li>Do not neglect memory training. Recalling what you have studied is a great way to learn.</li>
<li>Practice and consistency. </li>
<li>Cramming is bad - it takes time to 'build neural chunks' as she says. I wasn't sure if this was based off of actual science or just conceptual. </li>
</ol>

<p>I do not like method 1 at all from my experience. Often times when I am going through technical textbooks and I have a timer randomly go off on me at 25 minutes in the session, I find myself jumping from my seat and my productivity wanes. However, timers at around 45 minutes(where my brain seems to slow down) does not have this kind of effect.</p>

<p>But in Cal Newports Deep Work book, he suggests:</p>

<ol>
<li>Absolutely no distractions. Even delete social media from your life. Isolation can be a very ideal way of achieving deep levels of focus </li>
<li>Be consistent.</li>
<li>Do not tap in to willpower</li>
<li>Use 'rituals' to turn the deep work mode on. </li>
</ol>

<p>From my experience, point 1 has severely reduced my ADHD symptoms and as a result my productivity has greatly improved. But even then, I still wonder to myself how much validity there are to these two professors approaches? Neither are neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, or psychology professors. I want to know if there is some kind of research, evidence(strong or weak), that there are more effective approaches to learning a specific field at a much faster pace. I have also read summaries of 'Peak' by Anders Erikson who is an apparent authority in this topic but I still haven't found anything eye opening. </p>

Somewhere I read that even if this is a lot, this must be an absolute requirement otherwise by the theory of evolution, such high energy requirement brains would already have been eliminated.</p>

<p>My question is we know evolution is never stationary, so what is the recent trend (last 4000-5000 years) in the usage of brain energy? To me only 2 cases are possible (in an evolutionary stable sense):</p>

<ul>
<li>We are evolving to require less brain power for the same functionality, but the size of functionality remains same (i.e. we are able to think the same thing with same power requirement).</li>
<li>We are evolving to require more brain power for the same functionality, but the size of functionalities increase(i.e. we are now able to think the bigger things but the power requirement increases).</li>

<p>I just saw this picture puzzle, and found it easily by doing a row-by-row scan, but it seems harder to find it just by looking around. I was thinking that the puzzle was intentionally designed to draw attention away from the correct location, by the following features:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every snowman is different and its nose points in an apparently arbitrary direction, so as to prevent any uniformity that would give the panda away.</li>
<li>A sizeable fraction of the snowmen have extra things like scarves, hats, bow-ties and and even candy sticks, most of which are also brightly coloured. These distract the viewer as they automatically spend more time looking at these oddities, especially those with patterns. (Saccades tend to concentrate about them.)</li>
<li>The panda ears are almost the same size as the buttons on the chest of each snowman, and the snowmen themselves are positioned such that many of them have their buttons appearing just above the snowmen in front of them at about where the ears should be.</li>
</ol>

<p>So I was wondering what are the psychological processes that facilitate such visual misdirection. Is it just the saccade mechanism? My second question is whether there are more convincing examples. For other kinds of visual illusions there are plenty of unambiguous examples, but this one does not feel like an illusion as the task is just to find something.</p>

"Can someone who is never speaking of himself and present himself as very altruistic be egocentric / narcissistic?","<p>I've tried to make some searches on egocentrism and its opposite (Allocentrism).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Egocentrism</strong> is the inability to differentiate between self and other.
  More specifically, it is the inability to untangle subjective schemas
  from objective reality; an inability to understand or assume any
  perspective other than their own.</p>
  
  <p>Although <strong>egocentrism</strong> and <strong>narcissism</strong> appear similar, they are not the
  same. A person who is egocentric believes they are the center of
  attention, like a narcissist, but does not receive gratification by
  one's own admiration. An <strong>egotist</strong> is a person whose ego is greatly
  influenced by the approval of others while a narcissist is not.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Allocentrism</strong> is a collectivistic personality attribute whereby people
  center their attention and actions on other people rather than
  themselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But since the <strong>prosocial</strong> actions are often motivated by ego needs (see Polatch effect for the extreme) can we say that among extreme idealistic people (i.e. militants in extreme organizations) we can find <strong>Narcissists</strong> as well? </p>

<p>A narcissist has absence of self-compassion, he thinks to be perfect. Is there a correlation between some form of Narcissism and altruism?</p>

<p>I get a terrible mixed feeling, one one side itching to solve the problem, on the other side this damned blockage that prevents from going all in.</p>

<p>This made me ask myself ? How is it that I got good with calculus ? And now I realize...what I've been doing all along was looking for solutions of my problems online before trying to even attempt solving a problem and . I haven't told anyone about this because I feel so, so awfully ashamed by it.. But now I'm desperate for help.</p>

<p>By some mysterious process, this made me one of the best mathematics students in my university (CS undergrad). Even though I've absorbed and emulated others' way of thinking I manage to see simple and elegant solutions to a larger number of problems than my peers who've worked so much harder.</p>

<p>At this point, I feel like this irrational fear or mental obstruction suffocates me and stands in my way of truly becoming as good as I hope to become. </p>

<p>This all boils down to :</p>

"Does the brain generate identical words in different languages similarly?","<p>Saying (or even just thinking) a word or phrase results from activity in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_processing_in_the_brain"" rel=""nofollow"">multiple regions</a> of your brain. Of course, we can measure/'map' this activity to some degree; From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EEG measures the brain's electrical activity directly, while other methods record changes in blood flow (e.g., SPECT, fMRI) or metabolic activity (e.g., PET, NIRS), which are indirect markers of brain electrical activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is, just how <em>precise</em> is this mapping? Is it precise enough to answer the following question? (and if so, has anyone examined it)?</p>

<p><strong>I'm curious if the same word or thought in different languages is produced by the same pattern of brain activity</strong>?</p>

<ul>
<li>For example: does ""hello"" for a native English speaker generate the same signal response as a Spanish speaker saying ""hola""? </li>
</ul>

<p>More generally, I guess the question I'm asking is: <strong>are the signals/activity generated by the brain to create language driven more by the phonetics/orthographics/structure of a word or the meaning/connotation of that word/concept?</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>Can we quantify that person x speaking the greeting ""hello"" is more/less similar to a Spanish speaker saying ""hola"" than, say, both speakers saying ""a"" (in English <em>a</em> is an article; in Spanish <em>a</em> is equivalent to the English ""to"")?  </li>
</ul>

<p>Two notes / caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I would assume that the same word in different languages would generate different signals in the <em>same</em> individual (i.e., one who comprehends the meaning of the word in both languages). Though perhaps this isn't true (which could also be very interesting).</p></li>
<li><p>Of course perhaps sex, gender, age, or even just general variation between individuals (or even variation <em>within</em> an individual) might produce slightly different activity signals for the same task/word.  </p></li>

"Does caffeine improve performance for habituated consumers?","<p>I've seen a fair few studies over the while that suggest caffeine increases arousal in the short term and that for some tasks, this will also increase performance (<a href=""http://www.foodinsight.org/Resources/Detail.aspx?topic=Fact_Sheet_Caffeine_and_Performance"">there's a few citations here</a>).</p>

<p>However, as with most drugs, habituation leads to withdrawal effects and adjustment, so that in some senses once a person gets used to caffeine, having a regular dose of caffeine may just bring a person to something like a normal level of functioning.</p>

<p>Thus, in a general sense,

"What type of learning mechanism produces a consistent typo?","<p>There is a typographical error that I make and do so every time I try to type a certain word. Whenever I try to type <em>remember</em>, I type <em>remeber</em>. I do this every time. This is different to a regular typo because most typos happen at random, whereas this mistake is guaranteed to occur. It's not a spelling mistake, because I know how to spell remember, I just don't press all the required keys.</p>

<p>Could it be related to touch-typing? I don't make the typo when I peck out the keys.</p>

<p>I wonder whether it is related to muscle memory, because there are many words with the pattern 'e_e', such as <em>here</em>, <em>there</em>, <em>gene</em>, <em>theme</em>, <em>scene</em>, etc. So where I reach the second <em>e</em> my motor system is primed <em>not</em> to push the key that came before, i.e. <em>m</em>.</p>

"Motivation vs Goal Oriented Behavior","<p>What's the difference between these two terms when used in the context of cognitive psychology?

However, its hard for me to grasp when this is <em>not</em> the case insofar as theories of motivation are concerned.</p>

<p>So are these terms effectively synonyms with 'Goal Oriented Behavior' simply being the more modern verbiage? Or is 'Goal Oriented Behavior' a special subset of Motivation?

"Is procrastination greater when skill is low and rewards offer low status boost and does this lead to efficient  task allocation in groups?","<p>I am very interested in procrastination, because it is such a clear sign of lack of motivation. I have a hypothesis about why we procrastinate, which I would like to get tested by you.</p>

<p>The assumption for this hypothesis is that we are more likely to procrastinate on tasks, which we are not good at, or which does not yield a sufficiently large boost in status.</p>

<p>If this assumption is correct, then I believe that a group of people, where all members are able to do all tasks, would become more efficient if those group members who were less efficient at solving a task would procrastinate and never get it done, so it could get solved by someone who is better at it. Similarly, it would be good if the whole group procrastinate on tasks, which do not yield a sufficiently large boost in status, because this way the group can allocate more status to tasks that are more important and this way avoid having the members do tasks, which they just felt like doing.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are individuals more likely to procrastinate on tasks that they are not good at?</li>
<li>Are individuals more likely to procrastinate on tasks when the rewards in terms of status boost for successfully completing the task are low?</li>

"Is being less emotional a bad thing for motivation?","<p>We know that emotions increase motivation. The stronger feelings, the more motivated we get to do something about it. We know that humans differ a lot in how emotional we are.
In theory that should imply that less emotional people have less motivation in general.
Are there any research studies on how much emotions affect our motivation, or how much motivation differs from different people? Or possibly research studies on personality types that are more/less eager to get things done than the average?</p>

<p><strong>For those who need sources to believe that emotions and motivation are linked:</strong></p>

<p>From the study ""EMOTION AND MOTIVATION IN LEARNING: CURRENT RESEARCH, FUTURE DIRECTIONS, AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) Without emotion and motivation there would be no learning. <strong>Emotional
  states are integral parts of the adaptive process of learning, which
  includes attaching value to objects and events</strong> (both outside and
  inside oneself), based on a set of needs. (...)</p>
  
  <p>In short, <strong>emotion and motivation relate to internal states that are 
  relevant in the management of goals</strong>. For example, motivation has been
  defined as modulating and coordinating influence on the direction,
  vigor, and composition of behavior (Shizgal, 2003). In line with this
  reasoning, <strong>emotion is seen as an evaluating response of an event as
  relevant to a goal; it is positive when the goal is advanced, negative
  when the goal is impeded</strong> (Oatley, 2003). Thus, it has been argued that
  the key function of emotions in a learning perspective is to decouple
  the individual from the necessity to respond unconditionally (Scherer,
  2001). As will be discussed below, emotions also embody a crucial part
  of the learning process by influencing the associations that are
  formed between stimuli, their combinations and behavioral responses. (...)</p>
  
  <p>Studies also show that the <strong>emotional intensity, measured as arousal, of a stimuli or a situation increases the allocated attention</strong> (e.g. Armory et al., 2002). (...)</p>
  
  <p>Evaluative conditioning (EC) illustrates an active research paradigm within this tradition.
  <strong>EC combines emotional evaluations and higher order cognitive constructs.</strong> (...)

</blockquote>

<p>From the study ""The impact of emotion on perception, attention, memory, and decision-making"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) neuropsychological studies have shown that <strong>patients with emotional dysfunctions due to brain lesions can be highly impaired in everyday decision-making</strong> and social interactions.
  <strong>Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated how brain regions previously thought to be purely “emotional” (e.g., amygdala) or “cognitive” (e.g., frontal cortex) closely interact to make complex behaviour possible</strong>.
  <strong>Psychology experiments have illustrated how emotion can change our perception, attention, and memory by focusing them on important aspects of the environment.</strong> This research has revealed to what extent emotion and cognition are related, or even inseparable. (...)</p>
  
  <p><strong>We define emotion as an event-focused process consisting of (a) specific elicitation mechanisms based on the relevance of a stimulus that (b) shape an emotional response instantaneously across several organismic subsystems, including motivational changes</strong> (changes in action tendency, such as approach versus withdrawal), physiological changes (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance), changes in motor expression (in face, voice, and body), and changes in subjective feeling [3, 4]. E<strong>motions are elicited as the individual continuously evaluates objects, events and situations with respect to their relevance for his/her needs, goals, values, and general well-being</strong> (appraisal). The detection of a relevant event elicits an adaptive <strong>emotional response that mobilises resources that allow the individual to cope with the situation</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>When faced with a choice, we evaluate the options, weigh the possible consequences and their probabilities, and choose an option, and are confronted with the consequences. <strong>Expected emotions may influence our evaluation of behavioural options</strong> (for example, I may expect to be very happy once I buy the new luxury car, or I may have a gut feeling that it’s better to avoid a certain car dealer) and thus inform the choice at hand. Once a decision has been taken, t<strong>he immediate consequences will also elicit emotions such as joy, relief, regret or disappointment, which may inform future choices or lead us to modify our current choice</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>However, <strong>recent research has shown that emotion is central to the decision-making process</strong>, both as an input and an output [43]. Decisions and their consequences result in emotions (such as joy, relief, regret, or disappointment), and <strong>many of our choices are guided by the experience of these emotions or the anticipation of the emotions that may be elicited</strong> [interestingly, however, we are not very good at predicting which emotions we will feel in the future, see 44].</p>
  
  <p><strong>According to the somatic marker hypothesis [48], our choices and decisions are informed by bodily reactions that are triggered by emotion</strong>. These so-called somatic markers are body states that have been elicited by rewards or punishments in the past and been associated with certain situations or choices. When a person is deliberating several behavioural options, the physiological reactions associated to previous choices are re-enacted or anticipated in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and may inform the current decision, e.g., by helping us reject less advantageous options.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Conclusions</strong>
  Our review of recent research from the Affective Sciences shows that the duality of reason versus emotion that has been propagated for a long time is not reflected in the architecture of the brain and the functioning of the mind. <strong>Emotion and cognition are closely intertwined, complex human behaviour emerges from dynamic interactions between multiple processes and brain networks. Emotion determines how we perceive our world, how we remember it, and which decisions we take.</strong> Like any other complex system, emotion may go awry, as illustrated for example by exaggerated attentional bias to threat in anxiety [23] or preferential memory for negative events in depression [56]. However, when functioning normally, emotion should be considered as useful guide, far from being irrational, that helps us navigate our complex environment.

"How to derive the generalization bounds for the classical perceptron model?","<p><em>I thank all the commenters for the valuable feedback. I'm trying to improve this question (which I had long ago -- omg I'm getting old).</em></p>

<p>Is there a way to simply derive the generalization bounds for the classical perceptron model? More specifically, how to derive the maximum number of patterns that a N-large perceptron can store? And in the case of an NxN network of neurons, how to derive the number of patterns (or memories) and their basins of attractions? Are there simple methods, other than the ones invoking replica theory, as it's done in Gardner's works?</p>

<p>I'm basically referring to the great work of Elizabeth Gardner in this matter. I find that her work is often overlooked in the field of neuroscience, arguably because it is too difficult to understand its mathematical derivation.

<p>I couldn't find anywhere a simple explanation of her derivation and the implications of her results, in a terminology that also undergrads could also understand.

<p>What really strikes me about his story is the following: he seems to have an extraordinary memory and storytelling ability. Couple this with good looks, height, and a face that looks older than he is and you can see how he would have the tools to be con artist. But those are also skills that can be used for many many many other disciplines and could have been put to good uses. He could have been a salesman or any number of things. </p>

<p>Some criminals seem really messed up psychologically. He doesn't come across as that. He seems to have an intact psyche that isn't riddled with some abused past. But he is missing some basic emotions like guilt. For instance, he decided to work in a hospital without even considering the safety of patients around him and, according to Wikipedia nearly killed an infant. Another instance is that he took control of a plane when he didn't know how to fly one, obviously putting all the passengers and his own life at risk.  That seems insane! Only until he actually gets in a situation where lives are at stake did he really realize what could happen. Thus, he also seems to have no imagination for the consequences of his actions. He would tell strings of lies basically continuously and never think twice about it, never considering the consequences for businesses of the money they lost.</p>

"Are all dendrites targeted by an axon, or are there a lot of ""empty"" dendrites?","<p>As far as I understand, one neuron can have up to 200 000 dendrites (e.g. purkinje cells).

<p>I assume that each dendrite has one input terminal and each axon branch has one output terminal. I also assume that only dendrites can have input terminals and that only axons' branches can have output terminals.

"How does the neocortex distinguish between perception and imagination?","<p>From my understanding, the neocortex performs both perception and imagination/planning within the same hierarchical structure. During perception, an area of the neocortex receives current input from sensors and decides on motor actions to execute. During imagination, an area replays previous inputs, or operates on potential future inputs for planning. Actions don't actually get executed during planning.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it seems like both perception and planning are in part executed by the same neural structures. It seems intuitive that the same abstraction mechanism needs to be reused to arrive at the same high-level representations. On the other hand, it seems like the brain still needs to distinguish between them, for example to not executed imagined actions.</p>

<p>The two processes certainly affect each other. Perceiving a difficult situation can cause planning, perception can cause an association to imagine another situation, or imagination sets filters on what we perceive. Are there any explanations if and how the neocortex implements both perception and imagination/planning within the same structures?</p>

<ul>
<li>Are perception and imagination states that the neocortex areas switch between, or can they be carried out simultaneously? Can multiple areas be involved in planning at the same time? </li>

"Is serotonin conclusively linked to depression?","<p>Some highlights from the article ""<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110816122449/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/01/28/the-depressing-news-about-antidepressants.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Depressing News about Anti-Depressants</a>"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ever since a seminal study in 1998, whose findings were reinforced by landmark research in The Journal of the American Medical Association last month, that evidence has come with a big asterisk. Yes, the drugs are effective, in that they lift depression in most patients. But that benefit is hardly more than what patients get when they, unknowingly and as part of a study, take a dummy pill—a placebo. As more and more scientists who study depression and the drugs that treat it are concluding, that suggests that <strong>antidepressants are basically expensive Tic Tacs.</strong></p>
  
  <p>One team of researchers wondered if antidepressants were ""a triumph of marketing over science."" Even defenders of antidepressants agreed that the drugs have ""relatively small"" effects. ""Many have long been unimpressed by the magnitude of the differences observed between treatments and controls,"" psychology researcher Steven Hollon of Vanderbilt University and colleagues wrote—""what some of our colleagues refer to as 'the dirty little secret.' ""In Britain, the agency that assesses which treatments are effective enough for the government to pay for stopped recommending antidepressants as a first-line treatment, especially for mild or moderate depression.</p>
  
  <p>But if experts know that antidepressants are hardly better than placebos, few patients or doctors do. Some doctors have changed their prescribing habits, says Kirsch, but more ""reacted with anger and incredulity."" </p>
  
  <p>Doctors see with their own eyes, and feel with their hearts, that the drugs lift the black cloud from many of their depressed patients. But since doctors are not exactly in the habit of prescribing dummy pills, they have no experience comparing how their patients do on them, and therefore never see that a placebo would be almost as effective as a $4 pill. ""When they prescribe a treatment and it works,"" says Kirsch, ""their natural tendency is to attribute the cure to the treatment."" Hence the widespread ""antidepressants work"" refrain that persists to this day.</p>
  
  <p>Right about here, people scowl and ask how anti-depressants—especially those that raise the brain's levels of serotonin—can possibly have no direct chemical effect on the brain. Surely raising serotonin levels should right the synapses' ""chemical imbalance"" and lift depression. Unfortunately, the serotonin-deficit theory of depression is built on a foundation of tissue paper. How that came to be is a story in itself, but the basics are that in the 1950s scientists discovered, serendipitously, that a drug called iproniazid seemed to help some people with depression. Iproniazid increases brain levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Ergo, low levels of those neurotransmitters must cause depression. More than 50 years on, the presumed effectiveness of antidepressants that act this way remains the chief support for the chemical-imbalance theory of depression. Absent that effectiveness, the theory hasn't a leg to stand on. Direct evidence doesn't exist. Lowering people's serotonin levels does not change their mood. And a new drug, tianeptine, which is sold in France and some other countries (but not the U.S.), turns out to be as effective as Prozac-like antidepressants that keep the synapses well supplied with serotonin. The mechanism of the new drug? It lowers brain levels of serotonin. <strong>""If depression can be equally affected by drugs that increase serotonin and by drugs that decrease it,"" says Kirsch, ""it's hard to imagine how the benefits can be due to their chemical activity.""</strong></p>

"Are the incidents of autism spectrum disorder on the rise, or is there an increase due to better definition of diagnostic criteria?","<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Statistics offered by the CDC</a> indicate that the prevalance of autism spectrum disorder in the U.S. went from 1-in-150 children in 2002, up to 1-in-88 by 2008:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AuX7n.jpg"" alt=""CDC Statistics on Identified Prevalance of Autism Spectrum Disorders""></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr065.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">A new report released in 2013</a> shows that this number has risen to 1-in-50.</p>

<p>The most recent study concludes that it is likely that the changes in prevalence are due to an improved awareness/survey techniques:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While it is not
  possible to definitively determine the
  underlying reason for this trend, several
  previous studies that also examined
  changes over time in ASD prevalence
  estimates within selected birth cohorts
  suggest that increasing recognition of
  children with ASD has had an important
  impact. Evidence from
  epidemiologic, genetic, and neuroscience
  research points to the prenatal period as
  the key exposure window for ASD risk
  factors. If the causes of ASD are
  related to factors that exist prior to or
  occur just after birth, it is unlikely that
  changes in ASD prevalence within the
  cohorts of children aged 6–13 in
  2011–2012 reflect ‘‘true’’ increases in
  susceptibility to the condition at these
  ages. Rather, changes in prevalence of
  parent-reported ASD within these birth
  cohorts (children born in 1998–2005)
  likely reflect either changes in the
  recognition of ASD by health
  professionals or survey-based
  measurement changes over time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there also seems to be a significant support for the idea that <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/16/health/autism-facts"" rel=""noreferrer"">ASD is rising to epidemic proportions</a>, and that anything from changes in how many older couples are having children to various environmental factors may be increasing the rate of ASD incidents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These rising rates inspired Bob Wright, co-founder of Autism Speaks, to say, ""We have an epidemic on our hands.... It is imperative that the U.S. government steps up its commitment to helping people living with autism today."" Last November, the first congressional hearing on autism in 10 years was held to determine what the federal response should be. (It didn't exactly make front-page news: It aired on CSPAN-3.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Now we know there's a host of genetic and environmental factors that are likely involved,"" says Dr. Susan Hyman, professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism.</p>
  
  <p>One possible contributor to autism's rise is that people are having babies later. The chance for gene glitches increases as parents -- especially dads -- age, explains Irva Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist at the MIND Institute at the University of California, Davis.</p>
  
  <p>But delayed childbearing explains only a very small fraction of the rise in autism rates. Environmental factors may turn many autism genes ""on"" or ""off,"" says Hyman.</p>
  
  <p>""The best studies we have now point to things that babies are exposed to in the womb, when the brain is forming,"" says Hertz-Picciotto. Living in areas with high levels of air pollution (such as near a freeway), having low levels of folic acid, being overweight or diabetic, and having a high fever during pregnancy all seem to up a woman's risk of having a child with autism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What studies or evidence support an actual increase in the rate of children with ASD?  Presumably there are stronger connections to environmental factors than the infamous Wakefield study, given the comments by Dr. Hyman?</p>

<p>Are there studies that show a strong correlation with increased rates with changes in the  diagnostic criteria, which would support the hypothesis that a significant portion of the increased prevalence is due to improvements in identifying individuals on the spectrum?</p>

<li>You don't have direct control over your brain, and it's a black box to you</li>
<li>Your only duty is to provide content for you brain</li>
<li>Every action you do during learning process should be consciously accurate</li>
<li>You should practice more and more (PMP)</li>
<li>You should not care about becoming fluent, as it's not under your direct control</li>
<li>After a while, you brain reaches fluency</li>
<li>The more you provide accuracy for your conscious mind, and the more you practice, the more fluency you'll get from it</li>
</ol>

<p>I Googled this formula and to my surprise I found almost nothing related. So, I have this question:</p>

<p>Is this a subject of cognitive sciences? And if so, is it valid? Do we have a theory regarding these arguments for developing motor-skills?</p>

"Is abstract knowledge incompatible with literal memorization?","<p>Let me describe 2 interesting cases :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Solomon Shereshevsky (Luria, 1968) had an almost perfect literal memory. He remembers strings of hundreds of digits for years after only having read them once. I would like to explain this by his awesome synesthesia: everything is encoded in so many ways that everything is considered as new, and so a new memory trace is formed to remember it (we know that ""first time"" experiences are well remembered (Robinson, 1993), as are distinctive features  (Hunt &amp; Worthen, 2006)). Shereshevsky's gift was compensated by big difficulties recognizing (visages, which he considered extremely changing) and had basically no understanding of abstraction: metaphor, figurative language.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLpCfHH1OVU"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kim Peek, the ""real Rainman""</a>, had a rote knowledge of 6000 books, yet was unable to extract abstract information from this knowledge (his memory was like a computer's, basically). He was also unable to understand metaphors.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, it seems to me that abstraction is incompatible with literal memory: we have to forget some concrete features to get the abstract essence. Is there any scientific literature about an incompatibility between abstraction and rote memorization?</p>

"How to design ballot papers with a large number of candidates in a preferential system?","<p><strong>Background:</strong> In the 2013 Australian Federal election, several parties were elected to the senate seemingly because of usability issues related to the ballot paper (see <a href=""http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/sport-and-motoring-enthusiasts-to-join-senate-in-new-hung-parliament-20130908-2tdqm.html"">here for discussion</a>). For example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The] Australian Sports Party has no policies other than advocating lots
  of sport, and won just 0.22 per cent of the vote. But with preferences
  from other small parties, they are likely to get a Senate quota ahead of
  the second Labor candidate, who had 12.33 per cent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the Australian federal electoral system, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate"">Senate is the upper house</a>. Each state has an equal number of senators. Election to the senate requires that you achieve a certain percentage of votes in a given state. It is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate#Voting_system"">preferential block voting system</a>. Thus, you can achieve the required votes after preferences have been allocated.</p>

<p>On the current ballot, you can either vote above the line or below the line. Above the line involves ticking a single box and accepting the allocation of preferences of that particular party. Ticking below the line requires that you number every candidate from one to the number of candidates (which could be over 100). Thus, the according to wikipedia about 98% of people vote above the line.</p>

<p>A strange situation arose in the 2013 election where several micro-parties appear to have won senate seats due to a flaw in the combination of the preferential and the above the line system. This seems to have been brought on by a range of factors including a general across the board increase in the vote for micro-parties and collaboration in micro-parties in allocating preferences to each other.  Traditionally, when the likely senator was one of only a few parties, the allocation of preferences was fairly clear. However, many voters if explicitly asked about their preferences, may have put one of the major parties above some of the more obscure parties that seem to have been elected based on preferences.</p>

<p>Thus, there is a problem:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are too many candidates to make it easy for people to indicate their preferences for all candidates.</li>
<li>The preferences implied by putting a 1 in a box ""above the line"" (i.e., accepting the preferences of a given party) may often not be consistent with what a voter would intend their preferences to be were they asked to think about it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is a good way to design ballot papers with a large number of candidates in a preferential system so that it is easy to use and conveys the important aspects of people's preferences?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What psychological theory or empirical research justifies such a ballot paper?</strong></li>

"Are Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development supported by empirical evidence?","<p>I've just come across a (very basic) description of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg&#39;s_stages_of_moral_development"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kohlberg's stages of moral development</a>, and I found the section on the Pre-conventional level of moral reasoning rather suprising.</p>

<p>In particular, stage one, obedience and punishment orientation:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development, and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with preconventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong, but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.</p>
  
  <p>In <strong>Stage one</strong> (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. ""The last time I did that I got spanked so I will not do it again."" The worse the punishment for the act is, the more ""bad"" the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is ""egocentric"", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.There is ""deference to superior power or prestige""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What surprised me is the example of moral perception in relation to degree of punishment.</p>

<p>While there does seem to be <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/a/1903/420"">support for the idea</a> (please feel free to chime in on that question with more authoritative answers!) that spanking <em>can</em> be an effective means of eliminating undesireable behavior, <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/1940/3451"">there is a significant amount of evidence</a> citing the general levels of negative impact corporal punishment can have.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, lower levels of punishment seem to have no correlation with Kohlberg's Stage One model.  My son does not seem to equate punishment as indication that an action is 'morally wrong'.  He does understand that if he repeats the behavior, he will likely have to repeat the punishment, but given the experimentations with defiance and self-assertion common to three year olds, he does tend to repeat the behavior at least a few times, in an attempt to push boundaries and see what he can get away with.</p>

<p>Additionally, the one time my son has been exposed to corporal punishment (another child's grandmother decided to spank her son in daycare, right in front of my son, much to my anger and frustration), my son showed no indication that he felt that the boy had done anything wrong, but rather was obsessively concerned as to whether he was okay, and why she would do that to him.</p>

<p>This seems counter to the idea that the punishment instills the idea that the actions which precipitate the punishments are ""morally wrong"", as Kohlberg seems to be asserting.</p>

<p>Am I misunderstanding Kohlberg's Stage One?  Is his theory generally considered reputable?  Most importantly, is there observational data upon which his theory is based, which supports the conclusions he draws?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There have been a few claims of photographic memory, but only one person was ever reported to have passed tests supporting that claim: a woman named Elizabeth, who later married Charles Stromeyer, the man who had performed the studies within which Elizabeth demonstrated these purported skills.  </p>

<p>I have not yet read the paper. But my first thought would be that a lot would depend on how you define contenders. I also imagine that the criterion of interest is research achievement, and that number of papers is an imperfect index of this.</p>

"Can the brain work better in stressful conditions?","<p>I was watching <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VAZtyQm6p0&amp;list=PL8642F108C0C3DB53"" rel=""nofollow"">a documentary about the brain the other day, BBC's Human Body - Brain Power</a>.

"Conscious versus Visual Representation Update","<p>In their paper ""<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26529489?dopt=Abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">A cortical network that marks the moment when conscious representations are updated</a>"" Stottinger et al claim that there is a network in the anterior insula, medial and inferior frontal regions and inferior parietal cortex that updates conscious representation. However, they did this by studying changing images. Is there any reason to believe that this system is not just for updating visual representations, as opposed to general conscious representation? (note: I only have access to the abstract, so I'm unsure whether this is addressed in the paper)</p>

<p>Full abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to survive in a complex, noisy and constantly changing environment we need to categorize the world (e.g., Is this food edible or poisonous?) and we need to update our interpretations when things change. How does our brain update when object categories change from one to the next? We investigated the neural correlates associated with this updating process. We used event-related fMRI while people viewed a sequence of images that morphed from one object (e.g., a plane) to another (e.g., a shark). All participants were naïve as to the identity of the second object. The point at which participants 'saw' the second object was unpredictable and uncontaminated by any dramatic or salient change to the images themselves. The moment when subjective perceptual representations changed activated a circumscribed network including the anterior insula, medial and inferior frontal regions and inferior parietal cortex. In a setting where neither the timing nor nature of the visual transition was predictable, this restricted cortical network signals the time of updating a perceptual representation. The anterior insula and mid-frontal regions (including the ACC) were activated not only at the actual time when change was reported, but also immediately before, suggesting that these areas are also involved in processing alternative options after a mismatch has been detected.</p>

<p>I am using paired comparison methods to estimate estimate respondents’ sensitivity to distinctions in words used to characterize the construct of agreeableness. (e.g, Undemanding = .34 versus Peaceful = .72). The contrast between the words' factor loadings is the signal to be detected.  The stronger loading was alternated between being on the first and second word. I did find that the contrast predicted probability of correct detection (r = .20*). </p>

<h1>Experiment background</h1>

<p>The stimulus is paired comparison words with each word having a different factor loading (from prior research) based on it's measurement of agreeableness. So each word taps the construct more or less deeply than the other.
The contrast between the words in terms of their factor loading is the signal.
A set of 122 such paired comparison tasks was developed and the task before the respondent is to select the more agreeable word.</p>

<p>The respondents are students recruited for the research having varying degrees of sensitivity. Each word in the pair only has a factor loading as the estimate of signal and the contrast should be the salient feature in the task.</p>

"Psychological theories about the end of a romantic relationship","<p>There's no doubt: many couples break and many marriages break, what happens in these cases?</p>

<p>In the loving encounter brain areas aimed at judgment and critical analysis, are clouded by an increase of dopamine: the neurotransmitter that activates our most irrational and euphoric drives.
The biology tells us that this pleasant situation lasts a few months (activation of oxytocin receptors) because of the decrease of dopamine in the intersynaptic space.</p>

<p><strong>Which other theories could explain the decline in desire/closeness?</strong> </p>

"How can you tell the difference between ""natural"" homosexuality and ""trauma related"" homosexuality","<p>When stumbling across the question: <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/17540/is-homosexuality-a-mental-disorder"">Is homosexuality a mental disorder?</a> I realized that it is very close to a personal question that My wife and I (mostly me to be fair) about the source of homosexuality in sexually abused children and young adults. </p>

<p>First, as I know this is a sensitive subject please understand that my goal is understanding and not offence. I am simply trying to understand a situation that may or may not arise, in our lives. </p>

<p>Let me explain, and hope that this will make this question clearer. My wife and I are currently in the process of becoming Foster parents. One of the things we need to do, is to be honest about where our ""personal lines"" are. For an extreme example you don't want the leader of the KKK to be tasked with raising African American children. However a lot of our interactions are focused on finding much more mild cases of ""Oh I didn't realize that would be a problem for us, I never thought about it that way.""</p>

<p>In recent classes the topics of homosexuality and sexual identity have come up. And while I have no problem with homosexuality as a choice or a pre-disposition. I wonder about homosexuality as a result of trauma. </p>

<p>For example, A teen that decides that he is homosexual, under normal circumstances is fine by me. If it is an active decision and preference then it doesn't matter, it's his choice. If it's a passive trait (for example genetic) then again it doesn't matter. It's like being left handed. It just is, move along. This is summarized for brevity, obviously. But that is a good summary of how we (both my wife and I) feel. </p>

<p>But one of our responsibilities as a Foster parent could include caring for sexually abused children and teens. The question is how can we, or should we try to differentiate between homosexuality as a response to trauma or naturally occurring homosexuality?</p>

"What do we know about schizophrenia and mathematics?","<p>Schizophrenia is usually associated with intellectual problems.

<blockquote>
  <p>Russell et al (1997) recently proposed that intellectual decline in
  schizophrenia was a nothing more than a ‘myth’. They followed up
  patients who had received an intelligence test as a child, who then
  developed schizophrenia, and had their intelligence re-tested some 19
  years later. There were no differences between the child and adult
  IQs. However, others have criticised this study on the grounds that
  the sample was unrepresentative in that the individuals had presented
  to child psychiatry units and were far more intellectually impaired
  than subjects in other studies of children who subsequently developed
  schizophrenia.</p>

<p>From my research prior to this question, it seems that there is a loss of ability, but likely not chronic decline over the course of the illness, one before or during the transition to psychosis.

"Have there been any recent replications of the Hofling hospital experiment?","<p>In the original <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofling_hospital_experiment"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hofling hospital experiment</a> (1966):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A person would telephone a nurse, saying that he was a doctor and
  giving a fictitious name, asking the nurse to administer 20 mg of a
  fictitious drug named ""Astroten"" to a patient, and that he/she would
  provide the required signature for the medication later. A bottle
  labelled ""Astroten"" had been placed in the drug cabinet, but there was
  no drug of that name on the approved list. The label clearly stated
  that 10 mg was the maximum daily dose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several reasons why the nurse should refuse the request:</p>

<ol>
<li>They don't know the doctor</li>
<li>They don't know the drug</li>
<li>The requested dose is greater than the labelled maximum dose</li>
<li>Paperwork was not provided</li>
</ol>

<p>Nonetheless, 21 of 22 nurses complied.  One of the (many) disturbing aspects of the experiment, is that even with so many reasons to refuse, the nurses tended to obey.  The implication is that with fewer reasons to refuse, they would be even more likely to obey.</p>

<p>This turned out not to be quite true, as per a <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2955382?sid=21105876242913&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=2"" rel=""noreferrer"">partial replication by Rank and Jacobson</a> (1977), in which they eliminated one of the reasons: They used a drug known to the nurses (Valium) instead of a fictitious drug, and somewhat counterintuitively got much lower compliance rates.</p>

<p>So if you wanted to have a particular hospital patient ""eliminated"", it seems to me that Hofling provides a simple plan: Make a phone call from a payphone somewhere to the nurse's station at the hospital, pretending to be a doctor, and ask them to administer a lethal dose of some poison - the only caveat is that as Rank and Jacobson showed, you don't want to refer to a drug they are familiar with, so ideally a lethal toxin placed in the drug cabinet ahead of time (or equivalently, a mislabelled toxin).</p>

<p>Rank and Jacobson suggest that perhaps reduction in obedience may be partially due to cultural changes: Changes in the relationship between doctors and nurses, the self-esteem of nurses, changes in the legal landscape and fear of lawsuits, etc.  <strong>Have there been any recent replications of the experiment that suggest how easy / hard it is today to have a patient anonymously murdered by a nurse?</strong></p>

"Are there ""awareness"" related mirror neurons or processes in the brain that get activated by awareness?","<p>I'm reading the ""The Power of Now"" book by Ekhart Tolle, in which he describes a spiritual practice by which attention/awareness is focused on the currently experienced mental state. For example, anger, frustration or jealousy are observed without letting them take over. Tolle describes the outcome of this practice as something along the lines of ""these emotions are transmuted into awareness"". <strong>I'm interested if there's any evidence in cognitive science to support his claim.</strong> </p>

<p>The description reminds me of mirror neurons - observing an emotion in others ""infects"" the observer with the same emotion. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"" rel=""nofollow"">There's a small number of deeply connected mirror neurons that permeate the human brain</a></p>

  can not only help simulate other people's behavior but can be turned

It happens very often when the child communicates with grown ups. I am guessing it can be an attempt to draw attention or be liked more but I'm not a psychologist so I thought I'd ask. What are some of the causes of this type of behavior in children, and what are some of the cures for it? Is there a difference between causes in girls and boys?

"Studies modelling learning curves of an overall task and subtasks","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Lee and Anderson (2001) published an article in which they argued  that learning a complex skill can be understood in terms of learning various component skills. They did this by performing a hierarchical task analysis on the Kanfer-Ackerman Air Traffic Control Task.
They then re-analysed a dataset where participants performed the task over repeated trials. By examining key logs, they were able to extract out the speed with which overall goals were achieved (e.g., landing planes) as well as subtasks (e.g., moving planes through the hold patterns, etc.). They then analysed the relationship between practice and performance (i.e., the learning curve) for both the overall task and the subtasks. Specifically, they fit three parameter power functions.</p>

<p>I'm currently doing some research exploring similarities and differences between overall and subtask learning curves, and I'm keen to identify other papers that have modelled subtask and overall task performance. However, the learning and performance literature is pretty broad and crosses multiple disciplines, and thus, somewhat challenging to search. I've also tried the <a href=""http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?cites=11799180207397881632&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">cited by link for the article on Google Scholar</a>.</p>

<h3>Question:</h3>

<ul>
<li>What, if any, other studies have been published that have modelled the relationship between both practice and subtask performance, and practice and overall task performance?</li>
</ul>

<p>My preference is for studies where the dependent variable is task/subtask completion time, but any dependent variable representing performance would be interesting.</p>

"What are different ways to determine centroids of fMRI activation, their drawbacks and perks?","<p>I'm reading an older article on bilingualism (Kim, Relkin, Lee, &amp; Hirsch, 1997) for a seminar. They were interested in the spatial separation of two languages in early and late bilinguals.  They determined activated regions and their overlap in two conditions and across two groups.</p>

<p>To determine these areas, they first excluded all voxels where BOLD response difference to baseline was not above their empirically derived false positive rate (p&lt;0.0005) and then used all these voxels as if they had the same activation to determine the ""centre-of-mass"".</p>

<p>They then calculated the distance between the centroids in the two conditions to measure spatial separation and counted the overlapping voxels.</p>

<p>I have some issues with this method:</p>

<ul>
<li>it seems as if they're throwing away a lot of information by discarding all voxels where activity was not above chance level and maybe more importantly by treating all significantly activated voxels as the same even though there may be significant differences in their activation level </li>
<li>minor: it's volumetric, not mass, so it should be centre of volume, right? It may be a misunderstanding of the workings of fMRI on my part.</li>
</ul>

<p>They also demonstrated that the derived distance held up well over two orders of magnitude in significance level, but still they didn't differentiate between highly and not-so-highly-but-still-significantly activated voxels. Is this still state-of-the-art?</p>

<h3>My questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>What are different ways to calculate centroids without discarding so much information but still backing up the conclusion inferentially (some sort of spatial confidence area?)?  </li>
<li><p>What are their drawbacks (my lecturer says they all have some, so you can just as well use the above-mentioned multistage method, but this seems like the easy way out)?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a well-tested method to test spatial separation of activity for two conditions? I'm not asking about demonstrating functional separation, but once you don't treat voxels as on-and-off anymore, calculating degree of overlap becomes less trivial.</p></li>

"How do animals recognize other animals of their own species?","<p>My motivation for this question is dog-based, but I suppose it would apply equally well to humans. <strong>How do animals recognize their own kind, particularly where there is large variation in appearance?</strong></p>

<p>The background is that I am reading <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20020168"">""Discrimination of human and dog faces and inversion responses in domestic dogs (<em>Canis familiaris</em>)""</a> by Racca et al.

These authors show that when dogs are presented upright objects, human faces, and dog faces, they spend more time gazing on novel objects and human faces than they do on familiar ones. However, they spend significantly more time gazing on familiar dog faces than they do on novel ones.</p>

<p>This got me thinking how a dog ""knows"" another face belongs to a dog. Acedotally (which I realize is worth approximately nil in science), my dog reacts very differently to seeing another dog in an adjacent car compared to a person. Given that there is so much phenotypic variation in dogs, how does it know that other animal is a dog, and not a cat or very large rodent? I could understand a lion recognizing another lion, because all lions look more or less the same. </p>

"Neural networks with biologically plausible accounts of neurogenesis","<p>One of the reasons artificial neural net algorithms like cascade correlation (<a href=""http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/fahlman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pdf</a>) have been generating interest is because they start with a minimal topology (just input and output unit) and recruit new hidden units as learning progresses.

General non-connectionist frameworks with empirical justification are also of interest, even if they don't have a solid reductionist account.</p>

<p>I have asked an <a href=""https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/1385/33"">alternate version of this question on Linguistics.SE</a> that focuses on language acquisition instead of general learning, but considers both children and adults.</p>

"How does goal-tracking and sign-tracking behaviour vary across species?","<p>In Pavlonian (classical) conditioning,  conditioned responses of an animal may vary. Some animals focus on the unconditioned stimulus (ie. food/location of food) while others may focus on the conditioned stimulus (ie. lever or button). These behaviors have been termed 'goal-tracking' and 'sign-tracking' respectively, as defined by Flagel et al. (2007).</p>

<ul>
<li>What are some known examples of this variation between different species?</li>
<li>How does the variation within a species differ across species? Do some species exhibit more or less variation than other species?</li>

"Why do I type ""it's"" when I know it should be ""its""","<p>I <em>know</em> the difference between ""its"" and ""it's"". When I read it, even in my own writing, I can see incorrect usages almost instantly. However, when I type, I often type ""it's"" when I should write ""its."" The opposite problem is rare (""its"" when it should be ""it's""). I don't even notice that I've written it incorrectly unless I proof-read my writing.</p>

<p>So, why do I do this?</p>

<p>But neither really seem to address this case. The first accepted answer refers to speech errors and centers around sounds and phonemes. Since there isn't anything phonetically different between ""it's"" and ""its"" I can't see how I have stumbled into this problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When mentally planning the next word in a sentence, we must choose the
  appropriate lemma. By selecting the units in a neural network that
  correspond to a certain lemma, it spreads activation to the
  corresponding morphemes, which in turn spreads activation to its
  corresponding phonemes. When the activation of a phoneme unit exceeds
  a certain threshold, it is selected for utterance (e.g., spreads
  activation to the motor units that allow us to speak).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second answer refers specifically to mechanical typing errors arising from looking at text (which I am not doing) and striking the wrong key. These errors don't seem to cover my situation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Salthouse mentions the taxonomy of typing errors proposed by Wells    (1916) of ""substitutions, intrusions, ommissions, and  transpositions"", and also cites empirical estimates of prevalence of<br>
  different types of errors.</li>
  <li>""Many substitution errors involve adjacent keys.""</li>
  <li>""Most transposition errors are cross-hand rather than within-hand""</li>

  <p>The findings show that gender affects accuracy rather than speed of body language reading. This effect, however, is modulated by emotional content of actions: males surpass in recognition accuracy of happy actions, whereas females tend to excel in recognition of hostile angry knocking. Advantage of women in recognition accuracy of neutral actions suggests that females are better tuned to the lack of emotional content in body actions. The study provides novel insights into understanding of gender effects in body language reading, and helps to shed light on gender vulnerability to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental impairments in visual social cognition.</p>

But, the error is the distance of hand to target. </p>

"Waking around the same time without an alarm","<p><em>Anecdotal background</em></p>

I used to work in an industry, over 15 years ago, where earlier morning starts were part of the job (started work at 6am then), but none quite as drastic since then.  I do not take naps, either.</p>

<p>This happens irrespective of the conditions (temperature, etc).</p>

"Does correcting responses after feedback lead to better learning?","<p>In a typical supervised learning experiment, one might present visual stimuli, e.g. faces, one after another and ask participants to classify each one into one of two categories, e.g. A and B. Usually participants are not required to DO anything after getting feedback - they just wait, and eventually the next trial appears. Does learning improve if, when the response is incorrect, participants are required to change their response to the correct one before proceeding?</p>

<p>To provide some context - unlike the ""typical"" experiment described above, I am using educationally relevant materials - mathematics story problems. They are still binary forced choice, but responses are given using radio buttons instead of the usual ""press P or Q"", so to correct an incorrect response, participants would have to go change the radio button response.</p>

<p>More specifically, since details were requested, all of the problems are story problems involving the concept of ""sampling with replacement"". Before doing the problems, participants read an instructional passage explaining the general formula for sampling with replacement problems. This passage explains that each problem involves two numbers, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, where <em>a</em> indicates the number of sampling events and <em>b</em> indicates the size of the sampled set. The problems ask for the number of different possible outcomes, which is given by the formula a^b. Thus, to solve the problems, it is only necessary to figure out which number is the number of sampling events and which the size of the sampled set. Here is a sample problem:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can think of at least two reasons why they MIGHT learn better from doing this. First, it might improve motivation - they know it's a pain in the neck when they answer wrong, so they're more motivated to answer right. Second, it might have a cognitive benefit, in that they would encode the correct and incorrect answers more strongly because they have to actually respond in some way.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there could be a negative effect in that it interrupts the flow of the trials. Doing a large number of trials quickly, pop pop pop, could increase learners' fluency, and such benefits could be decreased by the proposed requirement.</p>

<p>On the third hand, it might be even more beneficial to use an even more extreme version of the proposed requirement, e.g. present several questions at once and only tell them that SOME are wrong, not WHICH ones, so they have to think about it even more. Of course this could encourage them to figure out ways to play the system and could be even worse with respect to the possible negative effect I mentioned.</p>

<p>Anyone have any evidence or speculations about this?</p>

"Can't we teach other intelligent animals ""complex"" languages?","<p>I assume I'm not the first person to think about this, but I find this idea very useful, and if it works it would really be a major breakthrough (IMO, more important than getting to space).</p>

<p>Animals already have their own ""kind-of-language"", but it is based more on feelings, moods, and whatever the sounds/body-language naturally inspire, and not on abstract thought.
Given that there are primates capable of using sign language, I am left to believe that the barriers preventing animals from learning to speak are not simply their smaller brains, but their inability to pronounce the letters of most human languages and the lack of incentive or a good teacher (human parents are the equivalent language-teacher for the human-baby)</p>

<p>The scenario I though of would be the following (I used chimps as an example, but you can replace it with other animals if you wish):
A group of world-class language-scientists develop a language with words and letters that can be easily pronounced by chimps. The language could even be constructed to be a very ""beginner"" language, to ease the learning process, as long as it keeps its properties of being able to express various thoughts and ideas.
    A few people then spend a some years to learn and practice this language until they can speak it more or less fluently, and adopt a baby chimp (or more) to raise, like a human baby.</p>

<p>There are, of course, a lot of details left to discuss. The ""parent"" should probably form a close bond with the chimp, so that it trusts them and pays attention to them. Luck is also a factor, as maybe only some current chimps would be able to pass this experiment.</p>

<p><strong>In summary, my question is:</strong> Are there currently any species likely to be able to learn a language specifically made for them? And if yes, is there nobody researching this? I want to talk with my cat!</p>

<p>I am interested in your thoughts about this, and in any useful information you might have regarding this subject.</p>

<p>In both cases these terms seem to be used for physical symptoms which rather than being attributed to physical conditions, are based on mental factors, ie., psychogenic.</p>

<p>Also, three of these definitions are framed in terms of ""thought to be caused by psychological factors"", ""appear to be of psychic origin"" and ""appear to be psychogenic."" Given that these three terms imply cause is not known with certainty they are idiopathic, right?</p>

  <p>idiopathic<br> adj.<br> Of, relating to, or designating a disease
  having no known cause.<br> <a href=""https://www.thefreedictionary.com/idiopathic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American Heritage Dictionary</a></p>

<p>From looking at these two meanings of psychosomatic disorder and somatoform disorder, am I mistaken in perceiving them the same way, or at least confusingly almost the same thing? One says ""relating to disorders ... thought to be caused or aggravated by psychological factors"" and the other says ""denoting physical symptoms ... (that) appear to be of psychic origin.""</p>

<p>Could someone clarify what the differences are in light of the definitions, which seem quite the same to me?</p>

"Why does ""name it to tame it"" work from an evolutionary psychology perspective?","<p>There seems to exist a phenomenon where being aware of one's feelings gives us power over them. I have seen this in everyday life, but the strongest piece of evidence I've seen is from a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcDLzppD4Jc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">talk by UCLA Psychology professor Dan Siegel</a> who talks about his research putting people in brain scanners and getting them to name their emotions, and he says:</p>

  <p>If you can get her left brain to name the emotion, her left brain will
  squirt soothing neurotransmitters into her lower brain</p>

"Finding largest level of imperceptible noise in an image","<p>Suppose that we want to find the ""largest level"" of a random noise that can safely be added to an image such that the resultant noisy image cannot be distinguishable from the original noise-free image. For this purpose, we design the following subjective experiment:</p>

<p>Let I be the reference (noise-free) image. We first add a high level of noise to I to get a noisy image J. We then display I and J side by side, and ask a user to reduce the level of the noise in J gradually using a slider until he/she cannot distinguish between the reference image and the noisy image. The resultant level is then considered as the largest level of imperceptible noise for I.</p>

<p>But do you think that this experiment is technically sound? Also, can we use an adaptive procedure like QUEST to find the desired threshold/noise level? What do you think?</p>

"How to explain utility function from personality, beliefs and ongoing emotions?","<p>Economists widely use utility function (and more broader approach called hedonistic regression) but are there explanations or derivations of utility function from the perspective of cognitive sciences or psychology which can take into account personality, beliefs and experience (memory) and ongoing emotions (affects)? Clearly one should start with the Maslov pyramid that determines goals and needs and then one can proceed to explain why different people value differently one and the same goods or services? Are there such research trends, some keywords, terms, notable researchers in this area?</p>

<p>I have read only about incorporation of altruism in the utility function of neoclassical economics, about hypberbolic discount function and so on. But I have not managed to find more practical explanation of utility function.</p>

<p><strong><em>This question has the following context</strong>: I am trying to model the economic behavior or BDI agent - agent with Beliefs/Desires/Intentions. BDI is the most popular approach for modelling cognitive agents. Recent research (e.g. <a href=""http://people.idsia.ch/~steunebrink/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.idsia.ch/~steunebrink/</a>) has endowed BDI agents with formalization of emotions (KARO logic framework) and there is scarce but ongoing work to endow BDI agents with personality (e.g IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing and Five Factor Model from personality psychology). So, BDI agents have cognition, personality and affects and they can be used as models of human economic behavior. But there is missing link from economics and cognitive sciences - how humans act as economic agents? What are the models? What goals they can have, how behavior (decision to make purchase) can be infered from agent's goals, beliefs, personality and emotions? How human perception of utility (of particular attributes of particular products, particular designs, particular type of entertainment, etc.) is connected with his personality, experience, beliefs, affects? Utility function seems to be promising proxy in this research - psychology can explain utility function and economics can apply this function to particular transactions.</em></p>

<p><em>Is there some research along this lines?</em></p>

<p><em>This should be promising area of research. Because common approach to economic analysis and prediction is connected with Data Science and statistical methods (conjoint analysis and hedonic regression). What I am trying to do is to find logic, semantic, cognitive methods of explanation and prediction of customer behavior. Similar trend - from statistical to semantic methods can be found in other fields of Science as well - e.g. in natural language processing, in search engine engineering and so on.</em></p>

"how can the development of sexual preferences be influenced?","<p>I am wondering about the development of sexual fetishes, not necessarily in its meaning of having a sexual affection for inanimate objects, but in its broader meaning of any type of sexual abnormality.
As far as I know, such preferences develop through conditioning; i.e. in a state of arousal something not related to sex is perceived and assosiated with one's feelings. For example, one might experience a leather outfit while being aroused and develop a fetish for them.</p>

<p>This is quite a harmless example, but many fetishes may actually be harmful and an individual may want to prevent its development. For the sake of argument, a castration fetish could be considered extremely dangerous, leading to potential self harm at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Would a person who experiences arousal from such a fetish be able to prevent it from emerging? As an example, one could avoid masturbation while thinking of the unwanted fetish. This on the other hand would lead to repression of these unfulfilled desires and could possibly backfire.</p>

<p>Can the development of sexual preferences be actually stopped and/or influenced, and if so, what would be the best way to do so?</p>

"Does neuroplasticity cancel the notion of ""aptitudes"" as a natural gift?","<p>Considering the definition of neuroplasticity as the capability of our brain to rewire itself by forming new neural connections throughout the life, it seems to me that our brain is like a programmable computer and all we have to do is to input new codes and debug/delete/re-program what we have internalized from our parents and the environment.</p>

<p>Having that in mind, this notion that people are being born by some special gifts called ""aptitudes"" loses its credibility. According to what aptitude pros say: ""Aptitudes are natural talents born differently in every individual and they are special abilities for doing, or learning to do, certain kinds of things which is unique in every person.""</p>

"How to interpret strong, significant correlations between dimensions on a measure?","<p>I have been provided datasets from two questionnaires, with the aim of exploring any relationships between the factors measured by one, and factors measured by the other. One questionnaire looks at personality (big 5 type stuff), while the other looks at self-assessed capability (self-efficacy). Note, however, that I am performing exploratory research - I'm looking for correlations, rather than suggesting causation.</p>

<p>The questionnaires each feature approximately 60 questions, which fit within a number of dimensions. I didn't construct the questionnaires, so, as part of the analysis I looked at the correlation coefficients of scores between dimensions within each questionnaire, before looking at the correlations of dimensions between questionnaires (I hope I'm making sense!).</p>

<p>What I've found is that almost all the dimensions within the questionnaire measuring self-efficacy correlate with each other, to a strong degree (more than ±0.5) significant at the 0.01 level.</p>

<p>My experience in questionnaire design and analysis is limited, however, this result seems instinctively bad. Having done some reading around the issue, I have come across ""multicollinearity"", however, as I am not performing regression (because I'm not looking for causation), I don't think this is the appropriate term. Similarly, I have come across the term ""factor loading"", but, again, I'm not doing factor analysis here, so I don't think this is applicable.</p>

<p>My, albeit naive, understanding is that either the factors are all measuring the same (or a very similar) thing (an issue with construct validity, maybe?), or the factors are all different, but strongly and significantly related (in which case, is this an issue?)</p>

<p>My overall question is this: Am I correct in this understanding / is there a way (or multiple ways) to explain what's going on here? And, for bonus points, does this issue (if it even is an issue) have a technical term?</p>

<p>As always, many thanks in advance!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So your first natural response is to cry, or as you like to think of it, to produce noises from your vocal throat. This is an inbuilt response. As you grow up you notice every time you emit this noise you are given food, attention, and your basic needs are accounted for. This is a learned response.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>produce noises from your vocal throat. </p>

<ol>
<li>Why do humans know crying? </li>
<li>If it is not crying and you call it <em>noises from vocal throat</em> then why do babies produce those noises instead of noises such as laughter noises? Clearly they know that the crying type noise will get us to provide them comfort but the laughing type will not. </li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps when they are in the womb they can feel when the mother cries, it causes discomfort; so maybe they learn it that way through association. But that begs the question: Why don't they learn laughing in the womb as well? </p>

<p>As shown in the video, neuron firing rate increased when the edge of a bar of light touched the crosses present on the top left. It is not just the orientation and location of light bar, but it seems that the light bar's edge is defining the firing rate, and thus determines the receptive field. So, the oriented receptive field of the cell seems to be defined w.r.t to the stimulus edges, rather than the bright and dark regions stimulating the on-center and off-surround parts of the receptive field. It seems that the simple cell was getting triggered when the edge of the light bar touched the three lines made by cross marks and triangles in that particular orientation. So, the cell under consideration was responding to edges at three separate locations.</p>

I'm sure that there are more scientific journals of cognitive psychology than these two, and I guess, that there are also more advanced statistical tools than comparing groups. For example, in social psychology, structural equations modelling and mediation analysis are in fashion.</p>

<p>When asking this question, I had <strong>working memory</strong> in mind. 
Common methods to measure working memory empirically are, among others: dual task paradigms, n-back tasks and composites of simple memory measures. The main statistical tools that are applied to these measures seem to be mainly ANOVAs, t-tests, and other variations on traditional linear modeling, but what are the alternatives?</p>

"Are there any studies (fMRI scans, etc) showing why some people (supposedly) are more open to hypnotism?","<p>In <a href=""http://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> published in Harper's magazine back in 1996, journalist David Foster Wallace described his experience with hypnotist Nigel Ellery (see the last section of the article, titled ""THE HEADLINE ENTERTAINMENT""). Mr Ellery was providing part of the entertainment on the cruise ship that David was on.</p>

<p>As to hypnotism, David writes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First off, we learn that not everyone is susceptible to serious hypnosis: Nigel Ellery puts the Celebrity Show Lounge's whole 300-plus crowd through some simple in-your-seat tests to determine who is suggestibly ""gifted"" enough to ""participate"" in the ""fun"" to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the footnote to that paragraph just quoted, David writes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I, who know from hard experience that I am hypnotizable, think about sports statistics and deliberately flunk a couple of the tests to avoid getting up there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question I wanted to ask is, are there any studies looking into why some people would be more susceptible to hypnotism?</p>

<p>What I am particularly interested in is whether this has something to do with a habitual activation or inactivation of parts of the brain, or perhaps the levels of some neuromodulators?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sex differences in central tendency, variability, and numbers of high
  scores on mental tests have been extensively studied. Research has not
  always seemed to yield consistent results, partly because most studies
  have not used representative samples of national populations. An
  analysis of mental test scores from six studies that used national
  probability samples provided evidence that although average sex
  differences have been generally small and stable over time, the test
  scores of males consistently have larger variance. Except in tests of
  reading comprehension, perceptual speed, and associative memory, males
  typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring
  individuals.</p>

"Do introverts engage in too much self-control or do they lack impulsivity?","<p>Regardless of whether people are extraverts or introverts, if they are asked to act in an extraverted way, this improves their mood (for example <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-18181-001/"">Zelenski and others 2012)</a>. My question is concerns the reasons for why introverts don't engage in extraverted behavior. According to dual process models of behavior (for example <a href=""http://public.psych.iastate.edu/caa/classes/Readings/Strack%202004.pdf"">Strack, Deutsch, 2014</a>), human behavior is a combination of impulses and more reflective behavior (for example self-control). It strikes me that extraverted behavior is often quite impulsive (e.g. posting a funny picture of oneself on facebook).

<p>You see, Buddhism has a concept of <em>anatman</em> or no-self that attempts to explain the conditioned-self as a cause-and-effect phenomena arising through the interaction of the five aggregates (sensations, mental-formations, thoughts, feelings, etc.) and doesn't have a permanent or essential existence of its own. However, I would like to know what does the science or <em>psychology</em> has to say about this?</p>

<p>Does something called <code>I</code> exists as a soul/essence separate from the physical body? <strong>More importantly</strong>, does <code>volition</code>, or more commonly called <code>will-power</code> exists or it is just an illusion?</p>

<h2>A practical Experiment:</h2>

<p>Suppose <code>I</code> (as soul/mind/any-other-hypothetical) <em>decide</em> to lift my arm right now, and the very next instant my arm lifted in the air. I would like to know <em>what</em> exactly triggered the decision to lift? If it were <code>I</code> (soul/mind/etc..) that made the decision, then why would  electrodes attached to my brain show that the impulse to move the hand came before I was aware of it? The electrodes reading seem to imply that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Either the arm has a mind of its own apart from the primary mind (sort of a separate CPU core in a multi-core processor) that took the decision (seems less likely to me). OR</li>
<li>Some external force (in nature) triggered the decision (seems more likely to me).</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to know what is Psychology's take on this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The conventional explanation to this in terms of the <code>subconscious</code> being the causal factor seems incomplete at best. As mentioned in a comment on @ArnonWeinberg's answer, all it means is that we don't know. Subconscious seems like a hypothetical chaos that we ascribe all phenomena that we are unable to explain scientifically. In the above experiment for instance, what caused the subconscious mind to make that decision at that exact moment?</p>

"How does raw IQ change over the lifespan at the group-level?","<p>In the classic review of intelligence research (<em><a href=""http://www.psych.uiuc.edu/~broberts/Neisser%20et%20al,%201996,%20intelligence.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns</a></em>), Neisser et al (1996) write the following</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Stability</strong>. Intelligence test scores are fairly stable during
  development. When Jones and Bayley (1941) tested a sample of children
  annually throughout childhood and adolescence, for example, scores
  obtained at age 18 were correlated r = .77 with scores that had been
  obtained at age 6 and r = .89 with scores from age 12. When scores
  were averaged across several successive tests to remove short-term
  fluctuations, the correlations were even higher. The mean for ages 17
  and 18 was correlated r = .86 with the mean for ages 5, 6, and 7, and
  r = .96 with the mean for ages 11, 12, and 13. (For comparable
  findings in a more recent study, see Moffitt, Caspi, Harkness, &amp;
  Silva, 1993.) Nevertheless, IQ scores do change over time. In the same
  study (Jones &amp; Bayley, 1941), the average change between age 12 and
  age 17 was 7.1 IQ points; some individuals changed as much as 18
  points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typically, IQ scores are standardised for age and thus remove age related differences.</p>

<p>My question is</p>

<p><strong>What is the  relationship between age and raw intelligence test score at the group-level from around age 5 and into adultyhood?</strong></p>

<p>From what I've read, I understand that at the group-level intelligence increases monotonically with age during childhood and that it levels-off at some point (perhaps around 18?). Also, below a certain age (e.g., in infancy), completely different tests are required to measured intelligence. I also understand that individuals may experience various trajectories (e.g., some might plateau earlier, etc.), but I'm interested in the group-level. Thus, an ideal answer would probably provide a sense of the functional form of the increase in intelligence over childhood and adolescence. </p>

<p>My first thought for an answer was to look at the test manual for a standardised child intelligence test, such as the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Intelligence_Scale_for_Children"" rel=""nofollow"">WISC</a>, but I don't currently have easy access to that.</p>

"Is it possible to improve reading speed and visual comprehension by doing exercises?","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I'm trying to capture detailed information from the images in my visual memory, mainly text.  My daily life requires reading many documents on varying topics. I want to increase my reading speed and comprehension so that I can see text blocks as a whole; that is I see them not as meaningful text, but an image to be processed later. Perhaps then I would be able to iterate over the images in memory faster than I can with my eyes. </p>

<p>However, when I need to remember the details of a topic, I can visually remember the location of the text in the document, but I can't recall details such as whole sentences.</p>

<p>I'm trying to improve my visual memory by this simple exercise: </p>

<ul>
<li>chose a random image from flickr </li>
<li>have a look at it for a few seconds </li>
<li>eyes closed, try to rebuild the image from memory </li>
</ul>

<p>but normally I can not remember many of the details from the image, even if it's not very detailed.</p>

<p>When I try this exercise with text blocks, I mostly end up ""reading the block"". It's hard to treat a text block as an image without reading it. So I normally fail at visualizing it in my memory.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to improve reading speed, reading comprehension, and visual comprehension through visualisation exercises like those above?</li>
<li>If not with the above exercises, are there other exercises that can improve such skills?</li>

"Reference signal when measuring EEG","<p>When performing EEG, a number of electrodes are placed on the scalp to measure the electric potential difference between those locations and a reference. In the unipolar configuration, the reference is often the signal on another electrode (and is common to all measurement electrodes) or an average of the all measurement electrodes. In the bipolar configuration, the reference is specific to each measurement electrode (and is often another electrode located nearby). For examples, see <a href=""https://youtu.be/86zIa3pGM50"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5479869/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

"Emotional energy exchange between bodies?","<p>I'm not sure on which platform to ask this question:</p>

<p>Is it possible to exchange emotional energy between two bodies via acts of goodwill? Two examples of acts of goodwill are: Help someone with their groceries, and buy someone a thoughtful gift. Is it possible that in these examples, both bodies gain emotional energy, which both bodies can store and then have the ability to dispatch subsequently to other bodies?</p>

<p>Science has proven that doing an act of goodwill for someone else benefits both parties.</p>

<p>So what if the human network stopped doing acts of goodwill? Would the network suffer in some way? For example, I do know that babies die if they are not held. What if all bodies in the network lost the ability to do acts of goodwill to another? </p>

<p>Would all the babies die? </p>

<p>If so, that would be very dangerous to society, because we would all go extinct. So shouldn't we be looking into this?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to the late great David Hawkins, MD, Ph.D., we have proof that emotions have measurable energy and can either foster or negate actual cell life. Dr. Hawkins’s groundbreaking work, as explained in his book Power vs. Force, shows how a person’s log level--the measurable energy level in their magnetic field--increases as that person experiences more positive emotions. Hawkins’s most interesting finding was that cells actually died when the log level was below 200, where the emotions of scorn, hate, anxiety, shame, regret, despair, blame, and humiliation reside. So it’s key to regulate and manage our emotional state, not just for our overall well-being (and that of those around us) but also for our physical health.</p>

"What are the dangers of using mindfulness-based techniques for individuals suffering from Schizophrenia?","<p>I am unable to find much research on the application of mindfulnesss for those suffering from Schizophrenia. A recent study by Chien and Lee (2013) focuses on the application of a psychoeducation program for Chinese patients with Schizophrenia. However, I do not have the pleasure of reading this but findings indicate that it can improve psychosocial functioning (<a href=""http://www.cme.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=1653271"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cme.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=1653271</a>).</p>

<p>Though the study show promising results for alleviating symptoms in Schizophrenic patients, I feel - <em>prima facie</em> - that there might be a risk in exacerbating symptoms by educating Schizophrenic patients to adopt a non-judgmental awareness towards positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusional thinking. I am a supporter of mindfulness-based interventions except I can't seem to find much literature on its limitations and risks for Schizophrenia.</p>

<p>As the neurological and biological evidence around Schizophrenia is far from conclusive, I am narrowing this down to only psychological and ethical risks/dangers that could potentially arise from mindfulness practice and Schizophrenic individuals. For clarity around the theory underpinning Schizophrenia, I would refer to the <em>Theory of Mind</em> as the overarching philosophical foundation for understanding Schizophrenia and interactions with mindfulness practice. A definition is given by Pedersen et al (2012):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Theory of mind (ToM), the ability to think about mental states such as
  thoughts and beliefs in oneself and others, is a complex cognitive
  function that requires the integration of information from multiple
  sources. Substantial evidence has accumulated that patients with
  schizophrenia have impaired ToM functions (Sprong et al., 2007; Bora
  et al., 2009) that result in social-interactive deﬁcits.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a cognitive perspective, what dangers does mindfulness pose to a Schizophrenic individual's ability to discern their self-concept and their relations with the world? </p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>This is purely for illustrative purposes.</p>

<p><em>X suffers from Schizophrenia and visual hallucinations. X does engage in mindfulness practice regularly. His/her mindfulness practice involves paying non-judgmental attention in the present moment. Initially, X paid too much attention to the occasional visual hallucinations through his mindfulness exercises. This triggered a higher amount of distress and anxiety for X and caused him/her to believe in the 'reality' of the hallucination. It could be said that there may be a potential danger that existed in the initial stages of X's introduction to mindfulness practice.</em></p>

<li>What are the dangers of using mindfulness-based techniques for
individuals suffering from Schizophrenia?</li>

You revel in this discovery and look forward to being able to enjoy this person's desirable qualities. More to the point, you expect that your appreciation of someone will help generate an appreciation of you by that person, with your other qualities doing the rest.

<p>Workplace behaviours and personality traits, e.g. passive-aggressive behaviours, can be highly influenced by family conflicts and childhood experiences. Blanch and Aluja (2009) distinguish between work interfering with family (WIF) and family interfering with work (FIW):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Work–family conﬂict (WFC) has become an important dimension in the
  study of individual differences at work. This concept has been deﬁned
  as a form of inter-role conﬂict in which the role pressures from work
  and family are mutually incompatible, identifying at least three types
  of WFC: time, strain and behaviour based conﬂict (Greenhaus &amp; Beutell,
  1985). Two main directions are generally considered in WFC research:
  work interfering with family (WIF), and family interfering with work
  (FIW) (Frone, Russell, &amp; Cooper, 1992).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Conflicts in the family environment may contribute to passive-aggressive behaviours in the workplace. Rejection at home can influence personality traits of the individual (Rohner, 1980):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rejected child is especially likely to become hostile, aggressive,
  or passive-aggressive if  rejection takes the form of parental
  hostility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Organisations cannot function optimally if its employees exhibit passive-aggressive behaviours that are a result of past or current family conflicts. These behaviours can have an impact on culture as well (Forbes, 2013). Passive-aggressive behaviours are becoming common in the workplace and I'm interested to know what are the antecedents of passive-aggressive behaviours in the workplace that arise from family conflicts and past childhood experiences.</p>

"What is the psychological basis of ""survivor's guilt""?","<p><strong>Context</strong></p>

<p>I have just been watching a documentary about survivors of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of March 2011.  Specifically the interviews with ordinary residents of the towns affected.</p>

<p>One thing came through time and again was the notion that was best stated by a friend of mine*- a volunteer firefighter on duty in one of the affected towns on the day of the tsunami:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what gives me the right to survive, when so many others died?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, this doesn't just occur in Japan, it seems to happen a lot, where people seem to feel guilty to have survived and feel a sense of responsibility for those who perished.  What is the psychological basis behind this?</p>

<p>Are there any studies that have addressed this?</p>

<p><strong>Side notes</strong></p>

<p>I lived in Japan for 4 years and have many friends from the affected area, this friend of mine was and is still inconsolable that he, in his own mind, could not save more people.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I assume that the number of repetitions of the stimulus should give better results, but I am not sure why.

So, are repetitions wanted in this kind of experiment?</p></li>
<li><p>There are time points in which I didn't expect P300 but the brain activity was not 0. I understand that there is always a background activity in the brain, but maybe there is more to it? And if so, are there certain frequencies that are expected in the EEG?</p></li>
<li><p>When I analyze the data using an average response, should I assume anything on the P300 response?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the recommended sample Rate I should use? I guess there should be an advantage for high sample rates to increase resolution, but I am not sure about that. Am I right, or maybe a lower sample rate has advantages that I am not aware of?</p></li>

"Can the desire to change a romantic partner ever be satisfied?","<p>Based on the typical relationship advise: ""Don't try to change your partner"" and such, I would say that many people want to see their romantic partners behaving just a little bit differently. It is a common thinking pattern. </p>

<p>For example, a person may be wanting for the strong and independent partner to be more caring and compassionate. Or wanting for a partner to spend more time listening, or being more punctual, etc. </p>

<p>These thoughts can be summarized as ""Our relationship would be perfect if only he/she did XYZ"". In other words, people expects to experience relationship bliss when their partner complies with their wishes. </p>

<p>It seems to me that the XYZ is always a moving target, and can never actually be fulfilled, a sort of mirage, just out of reach. This makes me think these thoughts could be caused by some neurochemical process.</p>

<p><strong>Is expectation of relationship bliss, conditional on XYZ is just a side effect of some neurochemical process?</strong> Is it an expression of seeking novelty in a relationship (""<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=6Og8CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=novelty%20same%20but%20different&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zhaWiIeMA7&amp;sig=DUHm69llnBYhhqY3AFgGBqHgHPI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0tJn5w_rLAhWIdh4KHf6GCCcQ6AEIPjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=novelty%20same%20but%20different&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">same, but different</a>"")?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify what I mean by Neurochemical:
 If a person ingests 8 shots of hard liquor, there's a new chemical -alcohol introduced into blood circulation. In a short time alcohol will affect cognition regardless of any protests from the person's higher order cognition. A person cannot will themselves to not feel the effects of the chemical and act normal.</p>

<p>The ingested chemical affects the brain (neurochemical?). Until the chemical is cleared from the circulation or neutralized, the person will continue experiencing cognitive effects of the chemical compound. </p>

<p>By <strong>neurochemical process</strong> I meant an indigenous process by which brain can release a brain affecting chemical/hormone that will act according to the model above. Adrenaline in fight/flight response is an example of such chemical. Maybe Oxytocin is another example. I know of words like psychoactive, psychedelic, neuromodulator and less scientific terms like ""mind altering"", but none of these seemed to fit. </p>

"The line between fantasy and reality","<p>It is already well known that imagining certain things can have a physiological effect on us. For example, imagining an intense situation can cause the heart rate to go up, while imagining a quiet, safe place might have the opposite effect (or maybe that one is simply a result of distracting oneself from whatever may cause unrest).</p>

<p>Another example would be imagining yourself doing something you don't want to do. From what I understand, this reduces the stress of anticipating work.</p>

<p>I wonder, though, what exactly separates this from actually doing what you imagine? what are the differences in the physiological effects? How different is the activation of the brain?

"Does the human visual system implement (adaptive) histogram equalization?","<p>The human visual system is very good at 'cancelling out' shadows and other lightning effects, and focusing on the contrast in images. A famous example of this is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Adelson's checker shadow illusion</a>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LUmGqm.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/LUmGqm.png"" alt=""Adelson&#39;s checker shadow illusion""></a></p>

<p>In the above image, cell A and B are the same exact colour, yet we see cell B as significantly lighter than cell B.</p>

<p>In this case, if I wanted to get a machine to make an observation similar to the human perception, I would use a technique like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization"" rel=""noreferrer"">adaptive histogram equalization</a> to enhance the contrasts and eliminate the shadows and lighting effects.</p>

<p>In computational terms, histogram equalization works by taking the cumulative distribution of the histogram of pixel intensities and stretching it to be a line. This transformation makes the histogram uniform, and thus maximizes the entropy and amount of information conveyed by each bit -- giving an information theoretic justification for why one would want detectors that use this sort of transform. Adaptive histogram equalization works the same way but instead of transforming the global histogram, first divides the image into a large number of tiles and then normalizes each tile. This tends to amplify the signal, while 'cancelling out' the local background due to effects like shadows or lighting gradients.</p>

<p>Laughlin (1981) showed that the large monopolar cells in the insect compound eye -- specifically in <em>Calliphora stygia</em> -- implement histogram equalization through their neural coding to cancel out the ambient contrast of typical natural scenes. <strong>Has something similar been shown in vertebrate visual systems?</strong> In particular, in the human -- or similar -- visual system? </p>

<p>Further, Laughlin (1981) could not look at adaptation of the eye to a specific scene, and was comparing to a static typical environment, has this research been extended to look at dynamic changes in the coding pattern in response to specific scenes?</p>

<p>Firstly, in my work, I have met some adults with severe debilitating mental special needs. The ones that peaked my re-assessment on this subject, were ones who as young children, were only considered slightly ""slow"" but physically did not look different than their peers. Then around a certain age (one at 7 for example), went through a terrible reaction like massive seizures or food poisoning, making them <strong><em>loose all mental facilities,</em></strong> permanently. Now, at a much older age, their facial features are completely altered to what we associate <strong><em>some</em></strong> severely mentally debilitated people with. I prefer not to describe if possible, the point is the actual bone structure and other features seem to have shaped very differently now. However, they were not born that way and the only thing that changed was mind and brain function.</p>

<p>Secondly, there seems to be a staggering number of people online and especially on YouTube, bewildered and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=desired%20face%20subliminal&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">claiming that subliminal programing videos</a> have allowed them to change their facial features.

"Name or theory for a particular phenomenon pertaining to ideological possession","<p>Is there a name or a theory for when someone alters a truth to strengthen their point(delusion)? </p>

<p>For instance, remember when President Trump carried out his plan to deport ""illegal"" immigrants and the lefties painted a different picture by their ""Day without immigrant"" story to portray the administrators as cold mean bullies, as opposed to saying ""Day without ILLEGAL immigrants""? </p>

<p>It is a phenomenon where individuals will consciously alter something, not intentionally to lie malevolently, but strengthen their (obviously) weak point(something to do with ideological possession).</p>

"Ambiguity in self-evaluating Likert-scale questions","<p>I am concerned that when <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale?oldformat=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">Likert-scale</a> type questions are used in self-evaluation questions, the results are ambiguous and would like to know if it's possible to address this ambiguity.</p>

<h1>Interpersonal Reactivity Index</h1>

<p>Although I have seen this in multiple questionnaires, in this question, I would like to focus on it's use in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_Reactivity_Index?oldformat=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">Interpersonal Reactivity Index</a> (IRI), which is used to measure empathy. The index is a set of questions that must be answered according to a 5-point Likert-scale ranging from ""Does Not Describe Me Well"" to ""Describes Very Well"".</p>

<h1>Ambiguity Concerns</h1>

<p>Consider this question from the IRI:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>I daydream and fantasize, with some regularity, about things that might happen to me.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, my concern is the temporal descriptor ""with some regularity"". How is someone filling this survey supposed to determine what the population mean of ""regular"" means? Is it once a week? Once a month?</p>

<p>I have similar concerns about the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol start=""2"">
  <li>I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me. </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>What is ""often""? What depth/duration do the ""tender, concerned feelings"" require to qualify for this question?</p>

<h1>How to Address Ambiguity</h1>

<p>How is this ambiguity of language, in regards to personal assessment, addressed in these types of surveys? It seems like a better designed survey would first try to establish the person's view of the general population in terms of range of feelings it's trying to describe, as well as the duration and frequency. Consequently, the person's assessment of the general population could be taken into account for their own personal assessment.</p>

<p>Have concerns similar to this been addressed before in other contexts?</p>

"Is the order of stimulus pairings in second order conditioning relevant?","<p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning#Second-order_and_higher-order_conditioning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">second order conditioning</a> next to a CS1 + US also a CS2 + CS1 association is learned so that also CS2 will cause a CR. Is the order in which the stimuli associations are learned (CS1 + US and CS2 + CS1) relevant for the strength of the CS2 -> CR association?</p>

<p><em>To make an example</em>: A student gets a bad grade in an exam (CS1) and due to a extremely negative response of his / her parents (screaming, punishment = US) the student develops a fear response to exams in general (single trial fear conditioning; the response ""exam -> fear"" was learned). Does the student already responds with fear to any stimuli (CS2) which signals a upcoming exam although this association was learned earlier before the fear conditioning? Is it necessary that the association CS2 + CS1 is learned after the CS1 + US association or doesn't it matter?</p>

<p><em>Explanation of the abbrevations:</em> In classical conditioning a association between an unconditioned stimuli (US) and a conditioned stimuli (CS) is learned so that the person also responds with the response to the conditioned stimuli which he / she has previously shown to the unconditioned stimulus. The classical example is Pavlov's experiment with a dog. A bell was ringing (CS) whenever food was presented to the dog (US). After a while the dog salivates (CR) whenever the bell rings (without presenting the food). Thus the response ""bell -> salivation"" was learned.</p>

<p>In second order conditioning next to an association of an unconditioned stimulus (US) and a first conditioned stimulus (CS1) also an association of a second conditioned stimulus (CS2) with the first conditioned stimulus (CS1) is learned. Thus the person / the animal also responses with a conditioned response (CR) similar or equal to the unconditioned response (UR) to the second stimulus even though that the association CS2+US was directly presented before.</p>
"
"Understanding fear as a response in classical conditioning","<p>I have difficulties to understand fear as a response to a stimuli. In my view fear occurs as a anticipation of a possible threat in the (nearby) future. Fear prepares the organism so that it can react faster to the threat (eg. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fight or flight response</a>). Thus, the order of the stimulus (threat) and the response (fear) is changed (""fear -> threat"" instead of ""threat -> fear""). So I would describe this connection as ""preparation -> stimulus"" instead of ""stimulus -> response"".</p>

<p>I would argue that stimuli which cause fear (eg. loud noise) are predictors of a threat. Thus for the reaction ""loud noise -> fear"" we have a second order conditioning since the association ""loud noise -> threat"" was created before.</p>

<p>In a similar way I would describe other fear conditioning processes. When for example a student develops a test anxiety, after multiple exams a student often experience (extremely) negative responds which he / she experience as a threat. Thus he / she learns the connection ""exam -> threat"" and responds with fear at upcoming exams in order to prepare herself / himself for the anticipated threat.</p>

<p><em>My Questions:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Is this a valid description of fear conditioning?</li>
<li>Is it in general possible that in classical conditioning the order ""stimulus -> response"" is changed to ""preparation behavior -> stimulus""?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>added:</p>

<p>Thank everyone who encourage me. You let me have more brave to build a human brain mind model(not brain structure). </p>

<p>Let me introduce myself.
I have some CS and EE background and now research on robotics area. I love cognitive science so much so I want to figure out how to let robot really have the mind like human to achieve goal more clever. Thank the hint of @Jeromy Anglim, I give a video youtube example:<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVAlt0FYmiI"" rel=""nofollow"">James and Rosie Preparing Popcorn and Sandwiches</a></p>

<p>That video shows two robot cooperate together to make a sandwich with cognitive architecture(CRAM or Cogito) based on ROS(<a href=""http://ros.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Robot OS</a>,<a href=""http://www.ros.org/wiki/APIs"" rel=""nofollow"">ROS map</a>,<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qziUJcUDfBc"" rel=""nofollow"">ROS Navigation Video</a>) system. After reading their papers I found that they just using database or downloading web page instructions or using very well structured pages which are for human (ex.<a href=""http://research.cyc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">CYC</a>,<a href=""http://openmind.hri-us.com/login.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">OpenMind Indoor Common Sense database</a>,Semantic web,ORO,SUMO,Wikipedia,<a href=""http://images.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">google images</a>,<a href=""http://www.germandeli.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">germandeli</a>).</p>

<p>Also I found that many free resources,any article on WWW should be most important database. The most important thing is how to build a system that can read natural language and have a model (maybe based on CRAM cognitive architecture) to understand it,because CRAM has a very good knowledge processor(KNOWROB,M. Tenorth and M. Beetz, “KnowRob — Knowledge Processing for Autonomous Personal Robots,” in IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent RObots and Systems., 2009.). If perhaps, I want to collect all linux opencourse libraries to make it more fast and robust. I also begin to take <a href=""http://see.stanford.edu/see/lecturelist.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1"" rel=""nofollow"">online machine learning course</a> on stanford. </p>

<p>My goal is to build a human mind model can learn,have some innovation,and find intelligent solutions to dedicate itself to human society.But my first step is to find a way that robot can try to understand all kinds of data on the WWW (any data that it can't understand just warn the first 10,and ignore others), and structure them as an intelligent interaction system which can answer knowledge or skill questions which can be search on google. The most important of that system is try to use all information on the web clever with robust libraries( I don't want to reinvent wheels).</p>

<p>I know it is a long term project, but I loving and willing to achieve in my whole life. 
Because this is an integration project and any success in that will make a big change in the world just as ROS in robotics also an integration project and very active on most top robotics research centers and in the beginning on industry now. I know My own energy is not enough for this purpose, but I can gather all the power of opensource and volunteers in the world to do it together~^^ (Now is the day which techs are really enough for this project like computer speed,WWW,advanced research papers,opensourse libraries,free opencourseware lessons,..., what a lack is a group of excellent people volunteer to make it become true to help anyone who use this project.)</p>

"How are newly created neurons recruited into existing networks?","<p>As far as I understand, the basics of neurogenesis (abstracted down to the level that makes sense to a computer scientist) is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Neural <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progenitor_cell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">progenitor cells</a> differentiate into new neurons that have zero (or very few) synaptic connections, but are sensitive to the local chemistry.</li>
<li><em>(Optional)</em> Sometimes (such as in adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb) these immature neurons-to-be are produced far away from where they are needed and follow standard pathways to migrate to the correct brain region</li>
<li>The immature neuron extends dendrites towards upstream neurons and starts to develop an axon</li>
<li>The immature neuron extends axon towards downstream neurons, and</li>
<li>The neuron matures and becomes indistinguishable from the network it joined.</li>
</ol>

<p>I've eliminated many of the biological details, since I want to just capture the details (<a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Adult_neurogenesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more info</a>). The part that seems to be not well described, and <strong>my question, is</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do neurons select where to make their initial dendrite and axon connections?</li>
<li>How/when does a given network notify the progenitor cells that they should differentiate?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Partial results</h3>

<p>Cecchi et al. (2001) proposed a model where the new neurons produce initial connections randomly, and then the only the ones that contribute to the function of the network end up firing frequently and surviving, and the rest die. This inspired by the observation of high death rate among immature neurons. However, there is not biological evidence to support that the initial connections are in fact random, and I hope that there has been more evidence gathered since the early work in 2001.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>This question is motivated by <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/214/29"">the search for computational models with a biologically reasonable account of neurogenesis</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I am looking for some sort of abstract local explanation to my questions at-least at the rule-of-thumb level. For examples, if I was asking about plasticity of established connections (and not neurogenesis in particular), then Hebb's ""neurons that fire together wire together"" would be a sufficient answer, although <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike-timing-dependent_plasticity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">STDP</a> would be a better one. However, I do not need all the biological details, just the high level rule if one is known.</p></li>

"Defining shyness towards strangers in confrontational situations","<p>First of all, I would like to stress that I am <strong>not</strong> a cogsci person and I have almost no background in those areas of science.</p>

<p>The question is whether there exists a definition of a phenomenon I recently encoutered: A person is shy, but <strong>only</strong> in confrontational situations - has no <strong>social phobia</strong> regarding making friends and so on. Furthermore, this ""shyness"" is only demonstrated towards strangers, i.e. the person in question has no problem confronting somebody they know. Lastly, the problem occurs only in person, not over the Internet or telephone. </p>

<p>All in all, the question is - is this phenomenon described somewhere? And most importantly - does it have a name? Maybe it has already been defined and studied by someone.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Meaning of confrontational</h3>

<p>By 'confrontational' I mean 'having different opinions' or 'having to sort out a disagreement'. To provide an example illustrating the problem:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>After being ripped off at a restaurant (food bad, late, cold, etc), the person prefers to let the whole thing go and pay rather than argue with the waiter (thus avoiding an in-person confrontation). But,</p></li>
<li><p>If the person were ordering a pizza over a phone and it did not arrive for an hour, they would have no problem calling the restaurant and discussing the problem.</p></li>

I'm interested to understand more about how the interactions between the dreamer <em>within the dream state</em> and these characters inside the dream work.</p>

<p>Do the characters in one's dream actually have their own <em>thoughts</em>? That is, does the mind ""sandbox"" each character, keeping track of what each dream character is thinking?

Are their words and actions simply based upon a sense of empathy, or does the mind somehow maintain separate ""conscious states"" for each dream character?

"Why do some people seem to disregard the choice of doing nothing (The Zero Choice)?","<p>In many areas of life we have a choice between multiple options: if we are hungry and we want to go out to eat, we have a number of places to choose from (McDonalds, etc).  However, we also still have the 'Zero Choice' (my terminology) of not eating out at all and getting food some other way.</p>

<p>In my personal life, I've noticed (perhaps falsly) that a fair number of people, once they've made a general choice (in the example: eating out), they disregard the 'Zero Choice' (not eating out) and become fixated on the sub-choices (where to eat out).</p>

<p>Is there a noticable difference in mental activity between people who don't consider the 'Zero Choice' and people who do?</p>

<hr>

<p>Original Question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my life I've noticed that people rarely see the 'nothing' choice. 
  Rather than choosing <code>this</code> or <code>that</code>, there is also the choice of
  <code>neither</code> and <code>both</code>.  People I've interacted with often weigh their
  <code>both</code>, <code>this</code>, and <code>that</code> options fairly well, but many completely
  miss the <code>neither/nothing</code> option.</p>
  
  <p>More specifically, I've seen this in a couple girlfriends I've had and
  a couple guy friends also.  When trying to decide what to do, they'll
  settle on a type of activity (active/passive -> general category ->
  couple options) and then choose between a couple options.  However,
  rarely in these options do they include the idea of something
  completely different.  Meanwhile, this is something I do without
  thinking; other options are always present to me, and I have no
  difficulty in seeing, weighing, or choosing the <code>neither</code> option.</p>
  
  <p>These are poor examples and for that I apologize; but is this a
  recognized phenomenon? What neural differences are there between
  people who process the <code>nothing</code> option and people who don't?</p>
  
  <p>Has this even been researched at all?  Cursory Googling (the most
  available to me right now) has revealed nothing; I could be searching
  for the wrong thing though...</p>

<p>My first question is quite straightforward: <strong>Is this statement valid?</strong></p>

<p>I don't understand why you should come to the conclusion that your brain should 'flip' the image. Wouldn't your brain be able to cope just fine without flipping it? If anything I would suspect the brain to <em>not</em> flip the image, if there is no reason to do so.</p>

<p>In order for this statement to be valid, I would expect a scientific theory/experiment from which can be concluded that the brain does process the vision in such a way that, after it being processed all subsequent processing occurs on the 'inverted' image. That seems to me to be the most logical interpretation of 'to flip'.</p>

<p>2) If so, does cognitive-neuroscience address this difference?</p>

<p>(Certainly, there are physical properties of our world that enforce the distinction between up and down (gravity) but not between left and right although people do generally have a right-hand motor bias.)</p>

"How does Parkinson's disease result in tremors?","<p>From what I understand, Parkinson's disease is caused by the death of dopamine producing cells in the substantia nigra, however I don't understand how that causses the symptoms of Parkinson's. I am particularly interested in the tremor aspect of the disease, although it would be great if someone could also explain how the other psychiatric problems arise (dementia, emotional problems and sleep issues).</p>

<p>The reason for this question is that I am trying to understand how deep brain stimulation (DBS) is able to stop the tremours in Parkinson's, or at least reduce their severity, and whether DBS could also help in the other symptoms of Parkinson's.</p>

<p><strong>What causes the tremors in Parkinson's disease?</strong> <strong>Why do Parkinson's patients develop dementia, emotional problems and sleep issues?</strong></p>

"Study showing how different ages of children learn about balancing objects","<p>I'm trying to track down a source for an idea I saw in a documentary a while ago (sorry, no idea where!) It demonstrated how children learn differently at different ages, through showing them balancing an unevenly weighted bar (in other words, a bar that looks the same along its length, but is in fact heavier at one end).</p>

<p>Loosely, the programme suggested that: young children (toddlers?) can get such a bar to balance intuitively, through ""trial-and-error""; slightly older children (5?) try to balance the bar half way, and so say ""it won't balance""; older children again, understand that the bar is not evenly weighted and so once <em>again</em> realise that experimentation is needed to find the balancing point.</p>

"Does the type of informational representation of a question in a research survey affect answers?","<p>Does the type of data format used to represent questions in empirical research affect the depth and quality of that research? For example, most questionnaires use written text as a data format. Would results differ if the same questions, under the same rules, were asked in person for example? I have memories of some platform presenting survey questions in a game-like interface, e.g. instead of asking you in text if you would rather purchase a cup of coffee over a cup of tea with five dollars, it displayed dollar banknotes as images and you had to move them with the mouse cursor towards either the image of a cup of tea or the image of a cup of coffee.</p>

"Can addiction develop to the absence of a normally present negative stimulus?","<p>I am wondering, can someone become addicted to the absence or the removal of a negative stimulus? Normally, addiction is associated with pleasure-inducing drugs, like opiates and amphetamines as notorious examples. These compounds induce massive release of dopamine in the limbic system, ultimately leading to addiction. <a href=""https://www.asam.org/resources/definition-of-addiction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Addiction is a collection of behaviors</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Addiction is characterized by <strong>inability to consistently abstain</strong>,
  <strong>impairment in behavioral control</strong>, <strong>craving</strong>, <strong>diminished recognition of
  significant problems with one’s behaviors and interpersonal
  relationships</strong>, and a <strong>dysfunctional emotional response</strong>. Like other
  chronic diseases, addiction often involves cycles of relapse and
  remission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is known that training can be assisted by positive reinforcement (well done! here's a candy), or by negative reinforcement (wrong! here's an electroshock). Can addiction be caused by either? In other words, suppose someone is constantly aware of something unpleasant (pain, itching, unwanted perceptions such as tinnitus (ringing in the ears), negative emotions or thoughts) <strong>can the removal/lessening of such a stimulus lead to an addiction of the means to remove it?</strong> </p>

<p>For the sake of the question I think it is sufficient to focus the question on one (<em>e.g.</em>, <em>craving</em>), or several of the symptoms, as existing studies, if any, may have focused on only one or few of the symptoms of addiction.</p>

<p>In short: <strong>are there studies on the addiction to the absence / removal of a negative stimulus</strong>?    </p>

<p>So I’m having difficulty establishing connection between the Psychopy running testing machine and the machine with the actual netstation installed. I numbered the summary questions at bottom!</p>

<p>I have the basic following code below, but I’m assuming I am inputting a wrong IPv4 address or port number for the net station.</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function
from psychopy import locale_setup, sound, gui, visual, core, data, event, logging,     clock
from psychopy.constants import (NOT_STARTED, STARTED, PLAYING, PAUSED,

from numpy import (sin, cos, tan, log, log10, pi, average,

ns = egi.Netstation() 
ns.connect('ipv4 address of the testingmachine ', 'port number of netstation machine') # change/ check by Network Utility?
</code></pre>

<p>And I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/cfv_egi.py"", line 281, in ns.BeginSession() 

File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/egi/simple.py"", line 799, in       BeginSession self._socket.write( message ) 

File ""/Users/abc/Documents/PsychoPy/cfv/egi/socket_wrapper.py"", line 58, in write self._connection.write( data )

When I change the port to another one with a server, it gives me the below:

<p>So summarizing my question,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it correct that I am supposed to input the IPv4 address of the NetStation machine?</p></li>
<li><p>How do I figure out what port number I need to input? Do I use the port numbers listed from using “Network Utility” app in the mac?</p></li>
<li><p>When running the psychopy code that makes me connect to the machine, what needs to be setup in the Netstation computer? ie. do I need to have netstation software running?</p></li>

<blockquote>
  <p>The third development was the advent and maturation of the functional
  neuroimaging technologies mentioned in the Introduction, which enable
  us to observe directly, without opening up the skull , the activity of
  the working human brain. Two principal classes of such methods are
  currently available, although others are under development.12 The
  first provides measures of the electric and magnetic fields directly
  generated by neuroelectric activity in populations of suitably located
  and oriented cortical neurons (electroencephalography [EEG]; magnetoencephalography [MEG]).
  The second provides measures of hemodynamic or metabolic consequences
  of neural activity such as local changes of blood flow, glucose
  consumption, or blood oxygenation (especially positron emission
  tomography [PET]; and functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]).
  All these technologies are complex and expensive, and <strong>they tend within
  and between classes to have complementary strengths and weaknesses</strong>
  (see, e.g., Nunez &amp; Silberstein, 2000; Toga &amp; Mazziotta, 1996; Wikswo,
  Gevins, &amp; Williamson, 1993). Together, they undoubtedly constitute a
  major methodological advance for cognitive neuroscience. Indeed,
  scarcely an issue now goes by of any cognitive neuroscience journal
  that does not contain one or more papers featuring images outfitted
  with colored spots identifying regions of ""significant"" brain
  ""activation"" produced by some stimulus or task.13</p>

  <p>According to Paul Churchland, Mary might be considered to be like a feral child. Feral children have suffered extreme isolation during childhood. Technically when Mary leaves the room, she would not have the ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain has to learn and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the visual cortex. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of brain development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But can't I really see new color if I never experienced some mixture of wavelengths prior? I thought that the person who saw only 90% of spectrum for the whole life still would gain new experience when seeing something from remaining 10%.</p>

<p>I know cone cells are responsible for color perception. They are located on retina of eyes. Most people have three of them, but there can be more or less. Signals from them travel to parvocellular cells and to koniocellular cells. It's not clear how color is processed there, as far as I am aware. Then signals travel to visual cortex from there. And V1 is said to be the most influential part of visual cortex. But I am not sure how V4 is responsible for color perception.</p>

<p>Is there scientific support for his claim? Or instead, is there scientific support for the opposite?</p>

"Nature vs. Nurture","<p>In the following I have 4 questions which I think are too interleaved to separate into 4 different posts. I hope it's not a duplicate, but I didn't find here similar posts.</p>

<p>My understanding (as a layman, based on few non-professional books and some googling) is that the current ""state of the art"" regrading the age-old question in the title, is essentially as following: </p>

<p>For pretty much any reliable measurement researchers could come up with (in relation to cognitive capabilities, personality traits, interests, confidence, success, etc), 100% of the variance could be attributed to heredity and nonshared-environment (typically in approximately 50-50 split between the two), and effectively 0% of the variance is attributed to shared-environment.</p>

<p>My impression is that the research is vast, the data is ample, and the conclusions are overwhelmingly consistent and accepted.</p>

<p>My first intermediate question: is the above description correct? </p>

<p>Now, that trichotomy, as I understand it, goes like this: by ""heredity"" people refer to anything identical twins that grow separately share (so mainly genetic and epigenetic factors), by ""nonshared-environment"" people refer to anything identical twins that grow together do not share (specific social interactions, different life experience, etc), and by ""shared environment"" people refer to the things non-sibling that grow together share (same parents and family, same home, same neighborhood, same school, same lifestyle etc).</p>

<p>My second intermediate question: is this description correct?</p>

<p>If so, it basically means that a pair of identical twins that grew up together, is indistinguishable from a pair of identical twins that grew up separately, and that a pair of any two random people is indistinguishable from any two non-sibling that grew up in the same home with the same parents.</p>

<p>In shorts, sharing home does not make people more similar, with respect to most reliably measurable properties.</p>

<p>My third intermediate question: are there any notable exceptions? Known traits whose variance is meaningfully explained by the shared-environment?</p>

<p>My forth and last question: Is the socioeconomic status of the family is part of the shared-environment? It seems as it should be (if my description above is not too-wrong), but then it implies that it has no effect on anything other than the future socioeconomic status of the children. Is this really case?</p>

<p>Do things like the neighborhood and schools quality have no intrinsic effect (e.g. on intelligence, inclination to violence, occupational aptitude, religiousness, etc)?</p>
"
"What is the basis of the belief that modern psychology demonstrates that words themselves can be hurtful and verbal aggression should be wed out?","<p>I'm sorry for the length of this question, but to ask it I'll need to refer to two concepts.</p>

<p>Firstly, we see the escalating trend to weed out any and all examples of even very minor negativity or aggression in words. Those are deemed unacceptable, addressees of such messages may be called 'victims', and telling people to 'grow a thicker skin' is explicitly declared a non-solution to the problem. Examples of this are many: StackExchange's new Code of Conduct, strict rules of communication Riot Games is trying to enforce in League of Legends, punishing people for jokes, firing employees for not being nice enough to their colleagues, etc etc.</p>

<p>It is claimed that such policies are backed up by modern psychology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One major mistake in this reasoning is ""unlike with sticks and stones, with words the addressees have the choice: to accept the message or to drop it"". They do not, the message will be received and the emotional reaction will happen, emotions are not subject to conscious control. One can choose to ""get over it"", but the same can be said of sticks and stones, so the real issue is the damage assessment. One reason for the new consensus is the undermining of folk misconceptions that heavily weigh physical damage over emotional one (as in the saying) by modern psychology.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humans are social creatures. If a grief stricken person can be consoled by words and interactions. Why would you not expect the opposite to be equally effective that is turning a happy person depressed and mentelly unwell? To say that people should just ""ignore it"" is to assign all blame to the victim but that's not fair and ignores everything we know about human behaviour.</p>

<p>Here I have to jump for a short while to the second concept... Monika and Marcin Gajda, in their book ""Rozwój. Jak współpracować z łaską"" (which is a Polish book on self-development that claims to be based on psychology and is written from an extensive Christian angle) introduces the concept of ""emotional sovereignty"". It distinguishes five levels of this sovereignty:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Submission.</strong> For example, if a bum insults me, I'll have the rest of my day screwed because I'll think how useless I must be that even a bum holds me in contempt.</li>
<li><strong>Entering a symmetrical conflict.</strong> Here I'll insult back the bum or even start physically fighting him to defend my good name.</li>
<li><strong>Ignoring aggressively.</strong> Here, feeling superior to the bum, I'll walk away, maybe mumbling something silently to myself.</li>
<li><strong>Assertiveness.</strong> As described by modern psychology.</li>
<li><strong>Merciful love.</strong> Told you the book is written with an extensive Christian angle. Here, with no contempt, feelings of superiority, aggression, urges of vengeance, or anything of this sort on my side, I'll look at the bum with compassion, seeing how miserable he must be to behave that way.</li>
</ol>

<p>The book claims that people can - and should - work themselves from the lower levels to the higher levels, for their own good. Staying on the lower levels is harmful, also from the psychological point of view, for the people who stay there. Also the book claims that a person may be on different levels in relation to different people: for example, a person may be on the 5th level with regard to this exemplary 'bum', but on the lowest level with regard to one's own mother. (Important: This self-development is not supposed to include trying to control one's own emotions).</p>

<p>And here is where the two concepts meet, at least in my mind. If such 'abusive' words and messages are treated as 'big deal', if growing a thicker skin is not to be advised, if, having received such messages, the correct action to take is deemed to be to report the offender to whoever is in charge of the community, if, as psychologists want, not attempting to stop receiving these messages is not respecting oneself enough… Then such beliefs and policies seem to me to hurt, rather than protecting, 'victims' of verbal abuse, because effectively they teach them to stay at the lower levels of emotional sovereignty. If, instead of attempting to cleanse the word of all verbal 'negativity', the emphasis was on empowering the addressees of such messages to be 'sovereign' over them, then the old adage that '<em>sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me</em>' would become true. On the other hand, the current emphasis of fighting the 'abusive' messages themselves seems to me to give the abusers the power to actually hurt the receivers of the verbal abuse: and that's a lot of power to place in improper hands.</p>

<p>I understand that my reasoning may be very well wrong, as the general consensus seems to be in the opposite. Then do both models not contradict themselves, regardless of whatever would seem to me to be the case? Or is Gajdowie's model of emotional sovereignty wrong?</p>

<p>EDIT: Just to clarify: The precise point that is hard to reconcile for me is this one: It is impossible for the receiver of the 'abusive' messages to avoid being damaged by such messages (the quoted comments) vs it is possible (Gajdowie)</p>

"Is mapping sound frequencies to the vertical axis universal?","<p>Shrill notes are said to be ""high"", and rumbles are said to be ""low"".  Humans seem to metaphorically map frequency to the vertical axis, and in the cultures that I know of, high frequency is considered ""up"".</p>

"Why do many people not use tabbed navigation (e.g. in an internet browser)?","<p>I have noticed that many people do not use tabs even though tabs have been around in browsers for some time. I have been noticing that people either do not differentiate tabs as specific navigational elements (e.g. a web page with tabs) or do not use them even when they know what purpose they serve. A lot of people have not even heard the word ""tab"".</p>

<p>These are only my personal impressions so I am curious to learn if you  have noticed otherwise. Also I know a free add-on for MS Office which gives you a tabbed window. As far as I know it is not a massive success.</p>

<p><strong>Why do some/ most people find it hard to use tabbed navigation (e.g. in an internet browser)?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Here is an informal study (blog published, 21 participants, all Firefox users, all students or friends of the author) that shows that most (of the recruited participants) do use tabs, but about half of the participants use them only rarely (""4 tabs for every 100 navigation actions""): <a href=""http://dubroy.com/blog/how-many-tabs-do-people-use-now-with-real-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dubroy.com/blog/how-many-tabs-do-people-use-now-with-real-data/</a></p>

<p>Since the sample in this study is not very representative (Firefox users have made a concious choice regarding browser usage and are therefore more aware of browser functionality; 21 is an extremely low number for analysing common behavior) we might safely assume that other user types (those using pre-installed browsers; those not friends to a computer nerd) will use tabs even less.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>update:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>a speculation just occurred to me: what if people, generally, find navigation much easier on a vertical (e.g. book contents/ web site left menu/ Win Explorer folder tree/ etc) or if not finding it easier, at least expect it there, while navigation ver a horizontal is either more difficult for some reason or unhabitual?</li>

"Can animals develop mental disorders that are unique or similar to our own?","<p>I just had a discussion with someone about mental illnesses in people (specifically talking about Capgraw delusion, alien hand syndrome, and walking corpse syndrome) and how some people's lives can be ruined by mental disorders. </p>

<p>Then I had a thought: Do animals also get mental disorders? I don't think I've ever heard anybody suggest it before...we all just assume animals are just animals and do animal stuff. Some people might say, ""Oh, that cat is crazy."" but maybe it's actually suffering from a mental disorder?</p>

<p>I mean, we all know animals can suffer dramatic trauma and be psychologically scarred by it...but humans can seemingly develop mental disorders without previous physical trauma and we also develop very odd mental disorders (like Capgraw delusion). </p>

"Is there a limit on the rate at which incoming information can be comprehended?","<p>I recently started a course on ""Speed Reading"", which aim is to read faster whilst holding the level of comprehension constant (so not to its detriment, but not aimed at improving comprehension either).</p>

<p>Now, for the case of reading, I imagine we can define a <strong>rate at which information is been given to the brain</strong>. So, the faster you read (holding comprehension constant), the higher such rate is. Clearly, the aim of such training programs like ""speed reading"" is to move that rate up. </p>

<p><strong>Is there an upper limit to such rate, perhaps because of biological reasons?</strong> Does it depends on the person?

<p>The book argues that we evolved to direct ourselves towards things that would promote our survival, and each of these hormones has a role to play in either strengthening certain behaviors, or encouraging us to move on from certain behaviors - one of the ways this is done is ""Dopamine/Serotonin disappointment"" (I don't recall if it was also relevant for oxytocin), which lessens the reward - and seems to have evolved because it encouraged us to move on and try to do even better.</p>

<p>But the book makes no mention of passion*, or how it fits in into all these discoveries.</p>

<p>Specifically, I wonder, <strong>how is passion possible in light of these ""disappointments""?</strong> I'd imagine passion involves a significant feeling of reward. Is there another hormone involved, one that's less... disappointing?</p>

<p>And <strong>how does passion develop into what it is?</strong> I am a big believer in the claim (which also appears in the book) that we evolved to seek ways to survive, and that what makes us happy (or sad, or stressed) is perceived by us as helpful (or detrimental) to our survival. <strong>How does one connect something to the need for survival in such a way that gives him so much energy and continuously rewards him for doing it?</strong></p>

<p>And, being practical as always,
How can I get me some of them passion?

"What are the best known causes and treatments for apathy?","<p>Has any extensive research been done into what the most common causes of apathy are and are there any treatments with a highly reported success rate? If so, what are these?</p>

<p>For clarification of what apathy is, it is <strong>a state of desensitization</strong>, where subjects seem to strongly lack any observable moods, and have severely dampened feelings and/or emotions. One well known side effect is that apathetic people often struggle to motivate themselves to perform tasks.</p>

<p>(From wikipedia)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apathy is a lack of feeling, emotion, interest, and concern. Apathy is a state of indifference, or the suppression of emotions such as concern, excitement, motivation, and/or passion. An apathetic individual has an absence of interest in or concern about emotional, social, spiritual, philosophical, and/or physical life and the world.</p>

"Do we know what is happening inside the brain when a person is hit in the head?","<p><em>For the purposes of this question, I will use the example of a legally sanctioned athletic contest (i.e., a boxing match), rather than criminal activity or accidents, but the question certainly applies to any brain trauma that has similar effects.</em></p>

<p>Anyone who watches boxing and other fighting sports knows that when a fighter is hit hard in the head or face, a few things are very likely to happen (links lead to videos showing examples of the effect in question):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The legs either go <a href=""https://youtu.be/VKCM5hVhHKU?t=4m11s"" rel=""nofollow"">stiff</a>, go <a href=""https://youtu.be/trArNgBNxhE?t=2m54s"" rel=""nofollow"">limp</a>, or begin to <a href=""https://youtu.be/_6AmqhTkRNA?t=17s"" rel=""nofollow"">wobble</a>;  sometimes, they seem to <a href=""https://youtu.be/RmljZRox8OU?t=51m30s"" rel=""nofollow"">move in unpredictable, involuntary ways</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The eyes glaze over and <a href=""https://youtu.be/CiCy1uxSI-o?t=20m7s"" rel=""nofollow"">seem to lose focus</a></p></li>
<li><p>The fighter will stumble and fall, sometimes after a <a href=""https://youtu.be/5hzvG0w_Rzc?t=6s"" rel=""nofollow"">slight delay</a></p></li>
<li><p>Mobility and coordination are <a href=""https://youtu.be/sccD0Uvz6Rg?t=10m49s"" rel=""nofollow"">profoundly reduced</a></p></li>
<li><p>The fighter appears to <a href=""https://youtu.be/2o7A3rMN6Co?t=5s"" rel=""nofollow"">lose spatial awareness and orientation, sometimes even seeming to be confused as to where he/she is</a></p></li>
<li><p>In some cases, the fighter will immediately lose consciousness, but I am more interested in the alternative - that is, a serious blow to the brain that results in the above effects, but doesn't render the victim totally unconscious.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, when the face or head suffers a strong, sudden impact from the front, back, or sides (or, in cases like an uppercut punch, from below, and to the bottom of the chin), momentum causes the brain to strike one or more surfaces inside the skull, so there is some mechanical/physical injury going on - in short, the person who was hit has a concussion.  I know that this can cause significant, long-term damage to the brain and nervous system, but I am interested in the short-term, immediate effects.</p>

<p>Is this physical/mechanical injury the sole reason we see the symptoms I've described above?  Are there separate processes taking place (e.g., abnormal electrical/chemical activity causing the symptoms described above)?  Or does the physical/mechanical injury cause other types of abnormal activity in the brain/nervous system?</p>

<h3>In short, do we know what is happening inside the brain after a hard blow, causing such pronounced effects, described above, in the rest of the body?</h3>

"What are the neural substrates of retrieval induced forgetting?","<h2>Retrieval-induced effects</h2>

<p>It is well known that practicing retrieval of remembered items increases the probability of correctly recalling that item in future tests: the <em>testing effect</em>. <strong>Retrieval-induced forgetting</strong> (RIFo) and <strong>retrieval-induced facilitation</strong> (RIFa) are less known, but related phenomena with, in my view, large theoretical and practical implications for cognitive memory research and educational theory. </p>

<p>In RIFo, learned items associated with a remembered item subjected to retrieval practice appear to suffer from increased forgetting in future tests (Anderson, Bjork and Bjork, 1994). Some papers report that the inverse also appears to occur: in RIFa, the probability of recalling associated remembered items also increases (Chan, 2009). RIFo appears to be a reasonably robust phenomenon with many replications, while RIFa is not as well established an effect.</p>

<h2>The cognitive neuroscience of RIF</h2>

<p>Where the classical view might have attributed the effect to relative strengthening of associations and decay, modern theories revolve around variations on an automatic inhibition process associated with recall attempts (Anderson, Bjork and Bjork, 2000). This might suggest that the PFC and frontal cortex more generally should be doing most of the legwork here, but is that empirically the case? </p>

<p><strong>What are the known neural substrates of RIFo (and RIFa) effects?</strong></p>

"What is the relation between measures, constructs and concepts?","<p>It is uncontroversial to say that the cognitive sciences do not exclusively deal with directly observable phenomena, but nonetheless aim to study the physical causes of behavior and cognition scientifically. ""<strong>Grasping</strong>"", for instance, is directly observable, but cognitive science also studies ""<strong>intelligence</strong>,"" which is not directly observable, at least not for all conceptualizations of intelligence. </p>

<p>When cognitive science studies such an unobserved quantity, the difference between the <strong>general concept</strong>, the <strong>unobserved construct</strong>, and the <strong>direct measure</strong> is sometimes rendered implicit. More colloquially: go far enough down the methodological rabbit hole for an unobserved construct, and you will likely eventually find a <em>patient zero paper</em> that defines a broad folk concept, then makes a spherical-cow or just-so statement that a construct maps on to the concept.</p>

<h2>Example: Working memory</h2>

<p>For an illustration of a just-so definition, take Baddeley and Hitch's definition of <strong>working memory</strong> in their seminal 1974 work as a replacement for the classical short-term/long-term memory model:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>a system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of information</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The relationship rendered implicit here is [""memory"" -> STM/LTM -> WM/LTM].)</p>

<p>To be fair to Baddeley &amp; Hitch, and so as not to single them out, Baddeley has later defended this problem with their model on productivity and guide to discovery grounds (Baddeley, 2007). I find this quite reasonable, and I do not mean to impugn their excellent research or the model's productivity in any way, only to use the example as an illustration for the question. </p>

<h2>Problem of implicit relations</h2>

<p>Implicit relations are antithetical to the practice of science because they engender <strong>unstated assumptions</strong> and hidden theoretical incompatibilities. It is also antithetical to science communication and scientific literacy, because important words like ""intelligence"" and ""memory"" become effectively polyvalent, with subtly different meanings that are not apparent without considerable study. The relationship between IQ and intelligence is the prototypical example.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p><strong>What is the relation between measures, constructs and concepts as actually used in the cognitive sciences?</strong> (Contrast intelligence or memory with grasping or walking, if concrete examples are helpful.)</p>

"How can items from a general self-esteem/efficacy measure be changed to measure context specific self-esteem/efficacy?","<p>I am very interested in a survey employing a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">Likert</a> type scale in my research. I have come across the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenberg_self-esteem_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale</a>. I would like to use this scale to get a sense of how subjects feel about their self-esteem during their trial in my research. </p>

<p>The questions will stay consistent with Rosenberg’s test model keeping five of the items positively worded and keeping five negatively worded using the four-point scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. </p>

<ul>
<li>Can the scale questions be ""changed""/presented without losing validity in the self-esteem measurement?  </li>
<li>If not, then how do I let participants answer questions in the context of
my experiment and what I am trying to improve? For example, I would like to know how they feel about learning a new language (e.g., Japanese) using a traditional method. Then I present a new method and ask again how they feel about learning the same new language? I would like to capture feedback from participants that would let me know if they feel better/more confident about learning a new language by utilizing a new method/approach?</li>
</ul>

<p>The Rosenberg questions are extremely general (I believe this is the beauty of it) which means it can yield stronger more general results. However, from my limited knowledge, I believe a generally confident person would answer those questions positively most of the time which means filling-out this scale before and after an experiment wouldn't conclude drastic result/change. However, if those questions were directed towards an issue that the subjects in the experiment all find difficult, then I believe their subjective answer to the questions would show considerable change if a *new method promises to improve their perceived intuition over a traditional method?   </p>

<p>The following are the questions from Rosenberg’s self-esteem scale:</p>

<ol>
<li>I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.</li>
<li>I feel that I have a number of good qualities. </li>
<li>All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.</li>
<li>I am able to do things as well as most other people.</li>
<li>I feel I do not have much to be proud of. </li>
<li>I take a positive attitude toward myself. </li>
<li>On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.</li>
<li>I wish I could have more respect for myself.</li>
<li>I certainly feel useless at times.</li>
<li>At times I think I am no good at all.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>If a Rosenberg scale shouldn't be used in this case, then what would be an appropriate scale?</em></p>

<p>I was originally looking at <a href=""http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~health/engscal.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)</a>. However, I would still ask the same qustions of GSE that I have of Rosenberg's Scale. How can I ""retro-fit"" GSE to make it in the context of say learning a language &amp; self-efficacy? </p>

<p>The following are the questions from the GSE scale:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can always manage to solve difficult problems if I try hard enough.</li>
<li>If someone opposes me, I can find the means and ways to get what I want.</li>
<li>It is easy for me to stick to my aims and accomplish my goals.</li>
<li>I am confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events.</li>
<li>Thanks to my resourcefulness, I know how to handle unforeseen situations.</li>
<li>I can solve most problems if I invest the necessary effort.</li>
<li>I can remain calm when facing difficulties because I can rely on my coping abilities.</li>
<li>When I am confronted with a problem, I can usually find several solutions.</li>

"Do hints improve memorization when using spaced repetition?","<p>For example, I'm learning geography using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spaced repetition</a> method. I have some program which asks me questions like, <em>""In which country Melbourne is located?""</em>, and I have to recall the country (assuming I've studied the material and at least once seen Melbourne on the map). This program also gives me two possible hints when I can't recall the answer:</p>

<ul>
<li>If I choose ""<strong>obvious hint</strong>"" it says ""kangaroo"", which for me is a straight giveaway for ""Australia"".</li>
<li>If I choose ""<strong>vague hint</strong>"" it says ""hell"". After thinking a while, I may come up with this: <em>""There's the Devil in Hell. There's an animal called Tasmanian Devil, which lives on the island Tasmania, which is near the Australia.""</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The idea in both cases is to not show the answer right away when I can't recall it, but rather force me (more or less) to try recalling it once again, but now with some additional information.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Do obvious hints help memorization at all?</strong> As you saw, the hint ""Australia"" is as good as just showing me the answer, but maybe it helps building association in my memory which helps recalling the answer later.</li>
<li><strong>Do vague hints help more?</strong> I assume yes, since they trigger some associations in my memory, but I have no proofs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, the ""obviousness"" of a hint is very subjective, but the idea behind it should be clear: ""obvious"" hints are just one or two associations away from answers, while ""vague"" ones form longer association chains.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: There is a <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/6167/7869"">related question</a> with an <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/a/6168/7869"">answer</a> which mentions elaborative rehearsal and depth of processing, but I'm not sure if those processes are involved here, since hints are mostly related to an answer (""Kangaroos live in Australia""), not a question (""kangaroos"" and ""Melbourne"" are not associated in my memories, neither do ""hell"" and ""Melbourne"").</p>

The two week planned study into the psychology of prison life ended only after 6 days due to emotional trauma being experienced by the participants.

To win a medal in the Olympic Games you probably need to have an outstanding predisposition for that specific sport BUT unless you have a very negative predisposition for something (such a limping and trying to be a marathon runner) you can by hard work become a ""good amateur"", probably ending up in the top 10 %, and maybe even top 1 % or so, ""just"" by a lot of work. (However, top 1 % won't give you any medal on most regional or national championship so you are still a loooong way from the olympics).</p>

<p>It is obvious what you need to do to achieve that: play a lot of tennis (if tennis is the sport you want to be a good amateur in) combined with some more generic weight and fitness training.</p>

<p>Can you achieve similar results (top 1-10 %) with regards to your cognitive abilities with hard work? Why? Why not? How?</p>

"Questions regarding schizophrenic prodromal progression","<p>I have been researching schizophrenia(sz) for a long while now, especially concerning the prodromal and ultra high risk(UHR) phases. Diagnostic criteria, symptom progression, remission rates, etc. But I haven't been able to find research of prodromal ""symptom wave"" patterns. In developed sz, psychosis and other symptoms exhibit a wave formation, waxing and waning. Is such a wave pattern present in some form as the disorder develops? If so, how long can a wave of 'downtime' versus more severe symptoms last?</p>

<p>I also am having trouble getting a full understanding of the diagnostic criteria for prodromal and UHR, though UHR doesn't seem to be well-defined anyway. The symptom lists vary slightly per paper, but in only one have I seen any mention of sensory processing issues developing in prodrome, and PTSD-like hypervigilance seems to not be mentioned much. Are these symptoms not as common in prodrome? There are other symptoms(eye contact avoidance, social ability degradation, dissociation etc.) that I have the same question about but I don't want to get too long.</p>

<p>I have other questions, but <strong>mainly I am looking for any sz specialist or someone experienced with sz willing to help me iron out these details with their experience</strong>. I'd like to message them if possible. This matter is of personal concern to me. I haven't added any sources or detail because this question is more opening up the possibility for a correspondence, and it would take a long time to explain everything. It would be strictly objective and not related to therapy of any sort. I hope this question is not inappropriate for this forum.</p>

"How can be explained from an evolutionary perspective the fact that some successful people do not want to have children?","<p>According to David Funder, Douglas Kenrick proposed a revised version of Maslow's hierarchy from an evolutionary perspective (1).

"Is eye movement important with eyes-closed EMDR therapy?","<p>Original EMDR therapy involved a subject with open eyes tracking a target that moves side to side.</p>

<p>It is now common for EMDR to use devices like electronic ""tappers"" to alternately stimulate the left and right sides of the subject's body, leaving the subject free to close his eyes and engage in visualizations related to the trauma being treated.</p>

<p>In general, during wakeful visualizations with my eyes closed I often move my eyes in a manner similar to REM sleep.  I have tried a few sessions of EMDR and found it to be uncannily effective.  During closed-eye EMDR I sometimes find myself engaging in REM based on my visualizations, and other times find my eyes moving side to side in synchrony with the ""tappers.""</p>

<p>My question: Are there any studies or theories that suggest eye movement in closed-eye EMDR is relevant to the efficacy of the therapy?  E.g., does it matter whether the closed eyes move side to side if there is some other bilateral stimulation?</p>

  <p>Tobii’s consumer eye trackers are primarily intended for personal

  <p>Tobii distinguishes applications in two categories: Interaction Use and Analytical Use. Depending on the intended use of your application, you may need to apply for a specific license.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Beyond real-time interaction, knowing where we focus our attention
  brings value to a range of applications within behavioral research,
  usability testing, streaming of gaze data and even health assessments.
  These applications would involve transferring, storing and
  analyzing/aggregating the eye tracking data which is defined by Tobii

<p>What they are much less clear on is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do they introduce this separate licensing model? Surely, it has to do with pricing and the availability of Tobii pro eye trackers, but this still sounds like a very odd, hard to enforce, business model.</li>
<li>How do they intend to enforce this? Can they sell a product and simply ask of buyers not to use it for a certain purpose?</li>
<li>How difficult is it to obtain a license? Does anyone have experience with this?</li>

"Why can't we learn what we don't like?","<p>The school system as we know it, is &amp; has been shaping students to fit the system which they live in and throughout this process, the students are forced to learn(mostly memorize) subjects which they do not have any interest in whatsoever and because of this they can't score high in school. It is as if our brains are trying to avoid information, which is out of interest, as much as possible. But when there's something in interest it is damn easy to collect and comprehend that information.</p>

"Why do people bid on online auctions sooner than a few seconds before it ends?","<p>This is something that has always puzzled me about human behavior on online auction platforms. I am talking about a specific platform where you can sell almost any item you want with a starting bid and a fixed time until the auction ends. People then can place a bid at any time, thus increasing the current price. The current price is always last bid + 0.5 currency. When the auction ends the highest bidder gets the item for the current price, with a percentage going to the platform. E.g. if the starting bid is 1 currency and someone bids 50 currency, the price is at 1.5 currency, until someone else places another bid, e.g. 20 currency, which would push the price to 20.50 currency, with the first bidder still being in the lead.</p>

<p>And that's exactly the crux. No one except the highest bidder knows what the highest bid is. People tend to place a bid, see it's not high enough and then increase their own bid in small currency steps, often going beyond what they originally were willing to pay. Also anyone who bids early risks that someone else tries to bid more than them, while when they bid late that chance is reduced, especially because there isn't any time for anyone to bid again.</p>

<p>For the platform this is good. For sellers this is good. For buyers, not so much. It's super irrational. They just drive the price up by bidding.</p>

<p>If buyers would just wait till a few seconds before the auction ends, and then place exactly the highest amount they are willing to pay, the item would sell for less, and they wouldn't be drawn into a bidding war that escalates the amount they are willing to pay. Even if it slightly decreases their chance of getting the item, unless it's a super rare thing there are so many items from different sellers, it would still be rational to behave this way until they succeed on one of the items. If unsuccessful too often, they could then conciously decide to increase the amount they are willing to pay - to adjust to the market price, not escalate in a bidding war.</p>

<p>Of course the platform wouldn't profit as much then, but I doubt buyers behave this way out of charity for them. So the question is: <strong>Why are people behaving this way?</strong> Are they really not aware of this? Do they not care? Is bidding to them just <em>fun</em>? Is this in some way related to gambling?</p>

<p>(I have asked this same question a few years ago on a Q&amp;A in my native language, and the unanimous answer was: <em>""Bidding is how that platform works, you obviously don't understand it,""</em> which leads me to believe that the answer is <em>people really are not aware,</em> but I don't get <em>why not</em>.)</p>

<p>I have been selling items on a particular platform for over a decade and absolutely profited from this irrational behavior, but at the same time I am so confused by my fellow humans.</p>

<p>I usually go down into the weeds and try to explain in detail what would limit exposure and why. Sort of the ""teach a person to fish"" kind of approach. I consider this the most honest way.

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Just to be clear: There is no real substantial danger to the person. The topic is commonly regarded as not entirely clear and sufficiently scary even to the non-diagnosed hypochondriac, but scientifically and morally it is completely ok to say, don't use it too much and don't worry about it.</p>

"Implementing new procedures / guidelines in companies","<p>I'm teaching evidence-based practice and implementation science to midwifery students, i.e. how to evaluate research findings e.g. regarding new therapies and diagnostics and how to plan the implementation of new procedures into clinical practice. The question of how new procedures/guidelines can be implemented most successfully into an organization is obviously pretty complex and depends e.g. on the willingness of the co-workers to change their behaviour, but also on the organizational culture, leaders etc. Several models exist how implementations should be planned or evaluated (<a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2014.11.012"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Williams et al., 2015</a>), but I feel like the field is not very advanced in terms of theory building and the possibility to predict the success of implementation.</p>

Or: that borderline is demanding and manipulative and hateful because she wants to be and it serves her.  So that is the first question.</p>

"Psychology Research, Questionnaire Help Needed","<p>I am Computer Science student and studying Psychology as an elective. Now I was required to conduct a research on any topic. I chose: Negative Effects of Permissive Parenting Style on Youth of Pakistan. I am having difficulty in making Questionnaire (since I have very little experience about it). I want your expertise to know which approach is better. I have following two approaches of making questionnaire.</p>

<p>First Approach:</p>

<p>Topic: Negative Effects of Permissive Parenting Style on Youth of Pakistan</p>

<p>1-Do you think that permissive parenting style has negative effects on Pakistani youth?</p>

<p>2-Would you like to adopt permissive parenting style if you happen to become a parent?</p>

<p>3-Do you think that permissive parenting is one of the reasons that Pakistani youth lacks self-discipline?</p>

<p>4-Do you think that the element of not listening to anyone, in Pakistani youth is because of their brought up by permissive parents?</p>

<p>5-Do you think that students of universities in Pakistan do not perform well in academics because they are not afraid of their parents' reaction on getting failed?</p>

<p>6-Do you think that parents should be friendly enough, so that their children do not hesitate to share any problem?</p>

<p>7-Do you think that in Pakistan, permissive parenting should be encouraged?</p>

<p>8-Do you think that blurred line between parents and children leads to domestic conflicts?</p>

<p>9-Do you think that children become creative in a restriction free environment?</p>

<p>10-Do you think that permissive parenting makes relationship with children conflict-free?</p>

<p>11-Do you think that youth of Pakistan do not abide by rules because they are not enforced by any rule under the permissive environment?</p>

<p>12-Do you think that, in Pakistan, drugs is more often among the youngesters having permissive parents?</p>

<p>13-Do you think that the parents being soft spoken, builds strong emotional understanding in children?</p>

<p>14-Do you think that under permissive environment, children will lack decision-making skills?</p>

<p>15-Do you think that friendly environment in home teaches children social skills?</p>

<p>Second Approach: What do you think about the following statements?</p>

<p>⦁ Your parent really expect you to follow family rules.</p>

<p>⦁ Your parent try to know where you go at night.</p>

<p>⦁ Your parent know exactly where you are most afternoons after school.</p>

<p>⦁ When your parent tell you to do something, they expect you to do it immediately without any question.</p>

<p>⦁ Your parent get very upset if you try to disagree with them.</p>

<p>⦁ It is a bad idea to question authority.</p>

<p>⦁ A person must have clear long term goals.</p>

<p>⦁ You would rather do something beside studying during extra time.</p>

<p>⦁ If you like something, you want to have it no matter what.</p>

<p>⦁ You have a healthy diet.</p>

<p>In the first approach, direct questions with binary options are given.</p>

<p>In the second approach, first 5 questions are used to depict whether the subject is permissive or not. Next five questions are used to know what are the effects on permissive parenting.</p>

<p>Also, the patterns that I am thinking of would completely bypass our language processing centers and be immediately received by our visual cortex (or something like that).  After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.</p>

"Solving T-shaped maze (probability learning): differences between rats and humans","<p>From Jonah Lehrer's book ""How We Decide"", he mentions the experiments with rats and Yale undergraduates.</p>

<p>I found the paper that (presumably) matches the experiment of rats.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brunswik, E. (1939). Probability as a determiner of rat behavior. Journal of Experimental 
  Psychology, 25, 175–197. [Reprinted in Hammond, K. R., &amp; Stewart, T. R., 2001]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the results seem to be somewhat different from what he described.</p>

<p>Could anyone tell me where I can find the paper about Yale graduates performing the maze task?</p>

<p>Here's the excerpt from the book,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Look, for example, at this elegant little experiment:
  A rat was put in a T-shaped maze with a few morsels of food
  placed on either the far right or the far left side of the enclosure.
  The placement of the food was random, but the dice were rigged:
  over the long run, the food was placed on the left side 60 percent
  of the time. How did the rat respond? It quickly realized that the
  left side was more rewarding. As a result, it always went to the
  left of the maze, which resulted in a 60 percent success rate. The
  rat didn't strive for perfection. It didn't search for a unified theory
  of the T-shaped maze. It just accepted the inherent uncertainty
  of the reward and learned to settle for the option that usually
  gave the best outcome.
  The experiment was repeated with Yale undergraduates. Unlike
  the rat, the students, with their elaborate networks of dopamine
  neurons, stubbornly searched for the elusive pattern that
  determined the placement of the reward. They made predictions
  and then tried to learn from their prediction errors. The problem
  was that there was nothing to predict; the apparent randomness
  was real. Because the students refused to settle for a 60 percent
  success rate, they ended up with a 52 percent success rate. Although
  most of the students were convinced that they were making
  progress toward identifying the underlying algorithm, they
  were, in actuality, outsmarted by a rat.""</p>

"Which physical properties of a stimulus can a human attend to?","<p>I am not only curious about speech, but for concreteness in illustrating my question, I consider the case of speech perception. Assume a listener is presented with an acoustic waveform. The wave causes deviations from the atmospheric pressure at the listener's eardrum. Thus, the acoustic pressure as a function of time “comes for free”, so to speak. Mechanically so.</p>

<p>From sound pressure we can derive amplitude, and by the fourier transform, amplitude as a function of time is transformed to the frequency domain. That is, amplitude as a function of time becomes amplitude as a function of frequency. We use this transformation because it reveals properties of the wave which are perceptually relevant, e.g. formant frequencies.  Presumably, listeners can attend to properties of the waveform describable under this transformation.</p>

<p>But what about mathematical models of the acoustic wave which are not simply transformations on the wave, but which derive some richer structure from amplitude fluctuations over time. For instance, what about a model which constructs a higher dimensional representation of the wave from the one-dimensional pressure fluctuations? (Imagine that instead of amplitude being a point moving back and forth along the real number line, the wave is represented as a point moving around in, say, 3-dimensional space). Say that such a model revealed a perceptually relevant property P of the waveform. Would the listener be able to “hear” P directly, or would would she need to engage in some information processing task to recover P from pressure fluctuations over time?*</p>

<p>*I realize that human listeners don't actually manipulate equations in their heads. I use the mathematics just to describe the underlying neural computation.</p>

<p>While I believe that the cast and crew of “Alien” did an excellent job in portraying the emotions of the humans during their encounter with an unmentionably vicious and seemingly unstoppable predator in the horrific solitude of space, I keep asking myself:</p>

<p><strong>What are the limits to the fear a human mind can deal with before descending into insanity or causing the individual to enter a stupor? Would a real human being in the shoes of Ellen Ripley be able to survive and preserve her sanity?</strong></p>

<p><li><i>How long and how far can adrenaline keep the body and mind alert before fatigue compels a human to rest and sleep regardless of the imminence of existential danger? </i></li>
<li><i>Can a bizarrely strange and tremendously terrifying situation effectively neutralize the survival instinct, e.g. by overwhelming the capacity of the mind to process new information and resulting in the individual being awe-struck and incapable of either fighting or fleeing? </i></li>
<li><i>Could a certain type of psychopath – because of lack of fear and empathy as well as being out of touch with reality – be significantly better suited to surviving the encounter with such a monster? </i></li>
<li><i>Could a (nearly) complete lack of imagination (as a non-deviant character trait) mitigate the adverse effects of fear a person would experience in such a situation? Conversely, would a highly impressionable person succumb and collapse more easily? </i></li>
<li><i>Is there a correlation between a sudden and surprising threat and the will for struggle, on the one hand, and a repetitive, “banal” mortal danger from the point of view of helpless people and inertness and lack of resistance, on the other? To clarify: Am I more likely to be able to muster my strength and fight back an enemy, however terrible, that just attacked for the first time, than somebody or something that I have seen methodically, mercilessly and effortlessly destroy all around me? </i></li></p>

"Spontaneous emotional bonding in traumatic events","<p>First off, I know next to nothing about cognitive sciences, but I experienced something today that got me curious. So please forgive me for maybe not being able to express my questions adequately.</p>

<p>Today I was driving around with a friend of mine quite late when we passed someone in the bike lane who turned out to be a guy and a girl (probably around my age. I'm 24.) who had crashed while riding a bike down a hill, with her sitting on the handle bar. (Her shoe was completely entangled in the spokes of the front wheel.)
The guy was lying unconsciously on the ground, just beside the bike, bleeding heavily from the head, gasping for air, while she was standing next to him with blood all over her face in some state of shock.
My friend called 911 and ran off to find a street sign for them to locate us.</p>

<p>(I am trying to shorten this story a bit, but I am still quite shaken by the experience, so I am having a hard time extracting the parts that are relevant to my questions.)</p>

<p>Some other people came by in a car and got out to help, while the guy - totally unresponsive - managed to stand up. They got him to sit down against a fence, still unable to communicate. At some point we realized that they did not speak Danish (we're in Denmark). While the other passersby tried to care for the guy, I got the girl's shoe out of the wheel, because I noticed she was walking around with no shoes and it's quite cold. When I tried to give them to her, she just hugged me. She just hugged me really tight, with her face against my chest, shaking and hyperventilating. </p>

<p>When the police and an ambulance arrived, we were still standing about 5 meters from the guy, still hugging, while everyone else was helping the guy. At this point, she spoke a full sentence for the first time, asking ""Is he okay?"". I told her ""I think so."" and I think at this point she realized what had happened, because it made her cry audibly for the first time during the episode. I imagine she could be blaming herself for the accident. If her foot hadn't gotten in the wheel, they wouldn't have crashed. I asked her if she wanted to go to the ambulance, she said yes and I walked her to it.</p>

<p>Fast forward half an hour. We drove off after talking to the police, and while sitting in the car still shaking, I noticed a strange feeling accompanying the shock of the experience. I felt, and still am feeling (it's about 3 hours ago now) some kind of strange bond with these people.
I have never been involved in an accident like that before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I am left with - first of all - a feeling of wanting to meet them again. Not only to see if the guy is all right, but actually, genuinely wanting to get to know them. Second of all, something about the girl hugging me like that, really affected me. It's almost as if I'm experiencing something kind of similar to the feeling of being about to fall in love with someone. Some kind of unexplainable connection. I am quite aware that what I am experiencing only <em>resembles</em> the felling of being in love, and how irrational this is, hence my wondering.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Firstly: her behavior during the incident. What cognitive processes
could cause her to seek this kind of comfort in a stranger, while her
friend is sitting 5 meters from her, bleeding heavily from the head.
It seems like a peculiar reaction to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly: what cognitive processes could cause me to feel this
strange one-sided bond with them? Especially the girl. Why would
someone feel like they're  falling in love with a person they don't
know, and have only ever spoken a couple of words to, after such an
incident?</p>

<p>What effect does that kind of traumatic event have on the forming of
emotional bonds between people, during the event?</p></li>

"Do many people have an ""Accompanying Voice"" - an equal they converse with?","<p>A hypnosis professional told me this is true, so I am asking: is it a fact of psychology that many people have a voice that they talk with ""in their head"" which talks back to them and helps solve problems? I find that this voice often has a perspective I never had and presents ideas I had not thought of. But it does not just tell me what to do. When I really get in a fix, it backs off and lets me solve the problem ""by myself"". I am about 50 and it has been there as far back as I can recall.</p>

<p><strong>Is it common to have an ""Accompanying Voice"" and conversations where both voices appear to have equal standing and independence?</strong> Is there research which shows this is something other than a hallucination? (After all, an internal monologue is not a hallucination. Why not have two voices in your mind?) The prevailing idea is that voices are hallucinations, but it seems that they could just be parts of the self. This is a cornerstone of Transpersonal Psychology, which uses a dialog method to help people improve self-awareness and solve inner issues.</p>

<p><strong>Addition:</strong> Here is some info from <a href=""http://www.intervoiceonline.org/2298/voices/positive-voices/hearing-voices-amongst-normal-people.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a site about this topic</a>, although it does not address my question directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of prevailing attitudes psychiatry and within society as a
  whole, it is important to point out, that there are many people who
  hear voices who can cope with their voices and regard them as a
  positive part of their lives. Neither is it the case that voices have
  always been regarded as a negative experience, throughout history and
  even today there are people who hear voices who find their voices
  inspirational and comforting.</p>
  
  <p>These are facts, that on the face of it are hard to square with the
  negative way that the experience is regarded by psychiatry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>More Addition:</strong> Here is a bit about <a href=""http://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/voice-dialogue"" rel=""nofollow"">the Voice Dialog technique used in Transpersonal Psychology</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Voice Dialogue Technique<br>
  The Voice Dialogue technique allows a client
  to gain a deeper sense of inner wisdom and gives them the opportunity
  to identify and examine the voices within. Being armed with this
  powerful knowledge provides a greater resource from which the client
  can draw upon when faced with difficult circumstances. The Voice
  Dialogue guides a client into realizing that there are parts of their
  inner being that propel them, but they are separate from those parts.
  They begin to understand that they are made up of many parts and each
  serves a function and has an energy force that sustains it. With this
  awareness, a client is able to create a balance among all of his
  corresponding and correlating parts and can determine which ones to
  silence and which ones to accentuate.</p>
  
  <p>The ""Aware Ego"" in Voice Dialogue<br>
  In Voice Dialogue, this heightened
  sense of awareness is referred to as the ""aware ego."" An aware ego is
  not a trait that one possesses, rather it is a process by which we
  begin to know all of the layers of our consciousness on an intimate
  level. Because there is an negative for every positive, the aware ego
  assumes that you can experience both the beneficial part of your
  consciousness and its opposite. With enough insight into your own
  identity, you can choose freely which one will serve you better, and
  can adjust, alter, and align the parts within to meet your goals for
  healing.</p>

<p>To me, this is about using a process which gets underneath assumptions, especially unconscious ones. The biggest assumption is that we are one singular thing that is consistent and understandable. Not So. But we can become master of ourselves.</p>

"Do we have a sub- or super-unconscious?","<p>Being conscious (awake) and unconscious (asleep) are two mutually exclusive states.</p>

<p>Going the other direction (waking up) is not usually so pleasant. Why not?</p>

<p>Conscious and subconscience are two coexisting areas:</p>

<pre><code>Conscious

Subconscious

Unconscious

<p>When we cross over from consciousness to unconsciousness, do we ever go straight into the dream state, or is a dreamless unconsciousness always achieved first (we have to get to the dream state from the unconscious state)?</p>

<p>BTW, I realize that dreaming is referred to as a state, but it is not mutually exclusive to unconsciousness (you are dreaming <em>while</em> you are unconscious/sleeping, not dreaming <em>instead</em> of sleeping).</p>

"Standardizing sales data with dollar market data within USA","<p>In the study of performance...</p>

<p>One approach to standardizing sales data across different regions of the country may be to adjust for the relative wealth/purchasing power of the clientele in a given region. For example selling 50k USD merch in Lubbock, TX is more impressive performance than selling 50k USD merch in Beverly Hills, CA. Although it is possible to use the cases in your sample to build your region-standardized variables, these sample-based estimates can be incredibly biased and in fact could penalize truly high-performing regions.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a resource? data table? method? that could provide estimates of how dollars equate across major regions of the country... Maybe by zipcode?
Maybe this is related to cost of living or median income of region? any ideas?</p>

"Studies on games where optimal play involves losing for counterfactual gain","<p>Apologies for not knowing the nomenclature; I'll try to describe what I mean.</p>

<p>The optimal strategies for some imperfect information games involve purposefully doing badly in some cases, so that bluffs are more effective in other cases. You purposefully lose more in some lower margin subtrees, to create confusion in some higher margin subtrees and win more there.</p>

<p>I don't know if poker has this counterfactual property or not. We're talking about something a bit more twisted than just bluffing or hussling. I wrote <a href=""http://strilanc.com/game-theory/2014/06/17/Counterintuitive-Counterfactual-Strategies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">a blog post</a> describing an example game with this counterfactual property, if that helps.</p>

<p>Personally, I find this counterfactual property counter-intuitive. Intuitively I would have guessed that you should always try to do your best in every case. This intuition gets stronger (and wronger) when I think of it in terms of things that matter a lot (imagine trying to explain to someone that you're purposefully losing a war so that you could counterfactually win it more often in alternate histories! They'd arrest you on the spot!).</p>

<p>Has this particular possible disconnect between intuition and optimal play been investigated? Have there been studies checking if humans have difficulty following optimal strategies that involve losing for counterfactual gain?</p>

"Brain Theory and Paradigm","<p>In <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4199269/"" rel=""nofollow"">this short piece</a>, physicist Dmitri Krioukov makes the case that we must expect complex systems (such as brains) to <strong>reduce to simple physical systems</strong>. Furthermore, he cautions that the pure collection of increasingly-large quantities of data on the anatomy and physiology of brains can not be productive in itself; success can only proceed through forward inference from the <strong>appropriate theoretical models</strong>. In fact, data-collection is only useful at this point insofar as it prompts the formulation of correct theory and the abandonment of the current paradigm, which he compares to the <strong>Ptolemaic model of the universe</strong> prior to Copernican thinking. </p>

<p>My question then, is this: Assuming scientific brain theory must ultimately be continuous with philosophy of mind, is <strong>eliminativism</strong> of ""mental"" states and content sufficient and/or necessary in order to instate the paradigm that will create the basis for ""reverse-engineering"" the brain? If not, why not? If so, then what must be eliminated and how would you go about it? What, if anything, must replace the old concepts in order to (begin to) give a thorough account of human behavior and biology?</p>

"Is it fair to categorize the neurons in the output layer of artificial neural networks as grandmother cells?","<p>I'm interested in how memory is distributed in the brain. That inevitably leads one to think about grandmother cells.</p>

<p>Under my interpretation, a neuron (or a small ensemble) would classify as a grandmother cell, if it activates, without fail, whenever a specific stimulus is presented to a subject, over an extended period of time.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, there is no evidence for the existence of such neurons, except some experiments that show the activation of specific neurons for a short period of time between trial sessions. The last part is important, because to my understanding grandmother cells are explicitly about long term memory.</p>

<p>If I look at most artificial neural networks however, the cells in the output layer usually exactly fit this definition. You can easily train a network to recognize pictures of your grandmother and consistently find the exact same cells active during evaluation whenever such a picture is presented. That's important for a computer of course, because it needs to have a consistent way of telling something is learned.</p>

<p>This would be an important difference to the brain though, because one could argue that any system, involving grandmother cells and that has only a limited number of cells, eventually suffers from overfitting or at least very limited generality.</p>

<p>Is this assessment fair? Is my definition wrong, somehow? Did I miss some evidence?</p>

  <p>Ein verdrängter Vorstellungs- oder Gedankeninhalt kann also zum Bewusstsein durchdringen, unter der Bedingung, dass er sich verneinen lässt. Die Verneinung ist eine Art, das Verdrängte zur Kenntnis zu nehmen, eigentlich schon eine Aufhebung der Verdrängung, aber freilich keine Annahme des Verdrängten. [...]. Mit Hilfe der Verneinung wird nur die eine Folge des Verdrängungsvorganges rückgängig gemacht, dass dessen Vorstellungsinhalt nicht zum Bewusstsein gelangt. Es resultiert daraus eine Art von intellektueller Annahme des Verdrängten bei Fortbestand des Wesentlichen an der Verdrängung.</p>
  
  <p>A supressed element of thoughts or imaginations can surface in the conscious mind under the condition it can be negated. Negation is away of acknowledging the supressed, actually a repeal of the supression, but of course not an acceptance [...] By way of negation only one consequence of the supression is undone, that the content of the supressed does not become conscious. The result is a kind of intellectual acceptance of the supressed, while the supression mostly persists.</p>

<p>(<a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verneinung_(Psychoanalyse)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">German text wikipedia</a>, translation mine)</p>

"Visual field testing: Choose between Yes/No, 2AFC, and 2IFC task?","<p>As a newbie to psychophysics experiment, I have a small project to do visual field testing on healthy, adult, naive subjects. The experiment stimulus is a small sine grating (0.3 degree, 6 cycles/degree) embedded in one of 25 possible locations in a noise background picture (18 degree). The orientation of the grating, and the contrast of background noise is fixed, and I need to measure the sensitivity (d') at 25 locations given a series of (probably 3) grating contrasts, and a series of stimulus exposure time (50,100,200,300,400 ms). </p>

<p>In a single trial, subject knows where the grating will be located, and maintains fixation at the center of noise background. Then the stimulus will be briefly presented (once in Yes/No and 2AFC, twice in 2IFC) for one of the stimulus exposure time, and subject need to judge whether the grating is present (Yes/No), or is located in which stimulus (2IFC and 2AFC). For a each unique combination of grating location, grating contrast and stimulus exposure time, I plan to do 16-20 repetitions to measure d'. So there are LOTS of trials.</p>

<p>I think this should be a mature experiment, but I am stuck on choosing between the following 3 experiment paradigms. The major problem is the time required to complete the experiment. I have run pilot experiments on all of them.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>1-interval yes/no task. This task runs fast, but suffers from changing response bias. Is the response bias going to negatively affect d'? In signal detection theory, d' is insensitive to bias only when the variance of response to signal and signal+noise is equal. However, I don't know whether there is firm experimental evidence to support this.</p></li>
<li><p>2AFC task. This task comes from a suggestion in textbook. Instead of presenting one cue of target location on each trial, I can present two cues that is symmetric around fixation point, and subject need to judge which cue location has the grating. The task assumes that human visibility map is central symmetric, and effectively cut the number of locations to half, so it runs even faster than the Yes/No task. However, it is rarely used in literature about visual field testing, what might be the potential drawback?</p></li>
<li><p>2IFC task. I see many literatures doing this, but it is the slowest one (more than double of the time for Yes/No). What's worse, because the stimulus is brief presented, and the interval between them is short (400 ms), sometimes subjects report that they ""see the stimulus but forget which interval has it"". So in some of our pilot data, the sensitivity at fovea is lower than in near-peripheral, because subjects had made an error. How do psychophysical researchers overcome the problem of subject error, and the problem of long, boring experiment?</p></li>

"Is the perception of drawings an acquired skill?","<p>Most descriptions of visual perception explain how our brains interpret incoming visual stimuli (via feature detection, monocular depth cues, etc.).

"How to answer questions that don't seem to be possible to be answered on a Strongly disagree - Strongly agree scale and what's their point?","<p>I'm continuously being perplexed by psychological tests that display a lot of questions that don't seem to be able to be answered in a simplistic ways, but nevertheless simplistic answers are demanded.</p>

<p>I was subjected to such tests a few times in my life already. Each time the questions were a major challenge for me... until, out of necessity, I was stopping caring about the accuracy of the answers. Instead, I was giving rough estimations, feeling these estimations are almost meaningless.</p>

<p>As an example, I was once subjected to a test whether I was aggressive, submissive, assertive, or manipulative. The test contained questions like ""do I think cunning is an effective way to get what one wants""? Do I think so? Yes, I think it is an effective way insofar people were able to trick me a few times in my life. Do I do this? I try not to and I don't even think I'm any good at it. Nonetheless, such questions clearly contribute to showing that I'm manipulative.</p>

<p>For an other example, let's take the <a href=""https://qst.darkfactor.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dark Factor test</a>. We have here questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most people deserve respect.</li>
</ul>

<p>My problem with this questions is that, as far as I'm aware, there are many definitions of ""respect"". How am I supposed to answer this question without knowing what definition of respect we're talking about?</p>

<ul>
<li>The innate respect that, according to many moral theories, is an indefeasible privilege of every human being?</li>
<li>The respect that is defined as a person's trustworthiness or ability to perform their duty? </li>
<li>The respect that stems from fearing other person?</li>
</ul>

<p>All 3 definitions entail radically different answers on my part, including an ""I don't know, I'm not strong enough in philosophy to be able to answer this"" in the first case.</p>

<p>Or another question. ""It is sometimes worth a little suffering on my part to help others in need."" Is it? I believe yes. Can I? Sadly, rarely. Which of these two answers should I give?</p>

<p>Another category are questions like these two: ""It’s wise to keep track of information that you can use against people later."" and ""I feel sorry if things I do upset people."" Here, however, my problems with these questions border critiquing the test itself, so I wonder if I'm not falling to the trap of arrogance. Namely, I have a feeling (maybe very wrong) that this test here treats what is not necessarily immoral as if it was. Is it wise to keep track of information that can be used against people later? In most circumstances likely no. But there are situations when this course of action is both necessary and perfectly ethical, I suppose: to protect oneself from these people anticipated unwarranted attacks. Do I feel sorry if I do things that upset other people? This depends on circumstances even more. If I win a sport match I'm likely to upset my opponents: does my attempts to win a fair game make my personality have dark traits? Escaping one's mother's overprotectiveness is likely to make her even more upset: but as far as I can tell, the psychologists' theories were that it is most healthy and necessary to do this. Nonetheless, I have a feeling that a positive answer to such a question would make one's personality darker in the results.</p>

<p>Could someone explain to me what's the point of such questions and how to answer them?</p>

"how does our brain knows the simialrities between anything?","<p>If I see your face today then I will recognize you if I see you tomorrow.
There must be something similar will happen in my brain for both incident, since the inputs to my body/brain is similar(at least some). So, that means the brain is clustering things/Inputs and I don't force the brain to cluster your face view, this happens automatically. Or may be the brain can calculate how much similar these two views of your face. anyway,may be I am completely wrong.  But the question is then how it does? and It applies for any type of sensor input to our brain.</p>

<p>edit: yeah, it should be more specific. I am talking about neocortex.when some similar incident happens then similar regions in neocortex will active, but how does the brain calculates the similarities? it's like the brain can calculate the similarities between two groups of networks.

"The role of high-performance in neuropsychology","<p>As far as I understand, neuropsychology gains most of its insights from the reconciliation of lesions of the brain and <strong>cognitive impairments</strong>. Normal functioning (both of the brain and the mind) plays a less important role in neuropsychology.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Which role does <strong>cognitive high-performance</strong> play in
  neuropsychology? Are there attempts to map cognitive high-performance processes to neurophysiological structures and processes? Some examples would be great.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Examples of cognitive high-performance:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eidetic_memory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">eidetic memory</a> (e.g. <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wiltshire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stephen Wiltshire</a>)</li>
<li>memorization of pi (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Haraguchi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Akira Haraguchi</a>)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_calculator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mental calculators</a> (e.g. <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gert_Mittring"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gert Mittring</a>)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">speedcubing</a> (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Etter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lucas Etter</a>)</li>
<li>advanced mathematics</li>
<li>advanced chess playing</li>
</ul>

<p>The mere fact that for such high-performers there are possibly enlarged (and internally more strongly and probably more specifically connected) areas of the brain (and connections between them) is not what I am looking for. Especially for the more mathematical and intricate cases there must be more than that.</p>

<p>The main difference between <em>neuropsycholgy by impairment</em> and <em>neuropsychology by high-performance</em> seems to be that in the former case you can more easily perform statistical studies (but also single-case studies), in the latter case you can only perform single-case studies.</p>

"To what extent is it true that both too much stress and too much relaxation lead to mental shortcuts?","<p>Sometimes rational thought seems to be bypassed in the brain for more automatic behaviour (shortcuts, instinct, intuition, heuristics):</p>

Relaxing yourself can help in reversing the process and becoming more rational again. She calls it the 'stop-and-think' response.</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow?ac=1&amp;from_search=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Thinking Fast and Slow</a> by Daniel Kahneman he writes that when someone feels confident that there are no threats facing him their system 2 (rational system) becomes lazy, <em>'cognitive ease'</em> and starts to depend on heuristics too much.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, apparently mental shortcuts happen both in situations of high stress <em>(fight or flight)</em> and in situations of confidence and relaxation <em>(cognitive ease)</em>.</p>

<p>Question: To what extent is it indeed <strong>factually</strong> true that both too much relaxation and too much stress can cause mental shortcuts? Please elaborate...</p>

"Does the Perception that Stress Affects Health Matter? The Association with Health and Mortality","<p>I recently came across the following paper:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3374921/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Keller, A., Litzelman, K., Wisk, L. E., Maddox, T., Cheng, E. R., Creswell, P. D., &amp; Witt, W. P. (2012). Does the perception that stress affects health matter? The association with health and mortality. Health Psychology, 31(5), 677.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This study tracked about thirty thousand adults in the US for 8 years
  and they started by asking people ""How much stress have you
  experienced in the last year?"" They also asked, ""Do you believe that
  stress is harmful to your health?"" And then they used public death
  records to figure out who died. They found that people who experienced
  ""a lot of"" stress over the past year had a 43% increased risk of
  dying, but that was only true for the people who also believed that
  stress is harmful to their health. People who experienced a lot of
  stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die.
  In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study,
  including people who had relatively little stress. The researchers
  estimated that over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,00
  Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief that
  stress is bad for them, which is over 20,000 deaths a year. If that
  estimate is correct, that would make believing stress is bad for you,

<p>[From: <a href=""https://youtu.be/RcGyVTAoXEU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Psychologist Kelly McGonigal's TED Talk: How to make stress your friend, Sep, 2013]</a></p>

<p>Now, my questions is: ""Is this study confounded?""
I think the way they have measured ""How much stress have you experienced in the last year?"" highly depends on the reference point defined individually for the subject. I may see an event as very stressful, and someone else may see the same event as not stressful at all. [For more information about refernce point, please look at: <a href=""http://citec.repec.org/d/ecm/emetrp/v_47_y_1979_i_2_p_263-91.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kahneman, D., &amp; Tversky, A. (1979). Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica: Journal of the econometric society, 263-291.]</a>
On the other hand, they have asked: ""Do you believe that stress is harmful to your health?"" Again answering this question is very subjective depending on the same reference point.</p>

<p>Counter example: imagine subjects A has experienced so much disaster in their life that they have seen very negative health effects of stress. On the other hand, subject B has not experienced that much stress in their life. To both subjects, last year was highly stressful. Obviously, highly stressful for subject A means a complete disaster, and for subject B means a little worse than other years. When you ask them ""Do you believe that stress is harmful to your health?"", obviously, subject A responds yes because they have experienced very negative health effects, but subject B who has not experienced that much stress in their life would probably say no. Now, subject A will probably die earlier than subject B. Could you argue that dying earlier is because of believing stress is bad for you?</p>

<p>I believe this study is loosely measuring a correlation, and they cannot conclude a causal effect in this way. Please let me know if I am missing any point or I do not understand what they have done.</p>

"What are the different theories about how the brain processes speech?","<p>When we heard speech the brain needs to go through a series of steps to go from the received sounds to a mainly conceptual meaning that follows from the words involved.

How does the brain solves this problem?</p>

<p>I was told there are many theories, but I don't have any names, except what some people call ""the oscillatory theory of speech perception"" of which I could not find much literature.

<p>So, do such studies exist (or are underway)? Or is there something fundamental to this subject that keeps it only in the realm of armchair discussion?</p>

"How does the brain act on the information gained via eye saccades?","<p>I've often heard that the process of saccading can be described as a statistical sampling technique.

<p>But this conceit seems to be made purely on a loose analogy to much more well defined problems than vision (e.g. anything soluble via <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"">Monte Carlo Method</a>), and in the perception literature I haven't found any proposed mechanisms by which this integration of sampled information could occur.</p>

"Do we understand the non-subjective mechanisms behind pleasure and pain?","<p>If we are to view pleasure and pain as being essentially synonymous with the more mechanistic concept of reward and punishment (i.e. as a part of learning and motivation system) then do we understand how this actually occurs at a neurobiological level?  At least in ""lower"" animals, pain seems to simply cause an aversion response. Pain motivates the animal to stop whatever it was doing (possibly stopping the pain), and to avoid in the future repeating similar responses to those that preceded (and therefore were possibly causal toward) the incident that caused pain.</p>

<p>This sort of thing is not that hard to replicate in computational models, so it is clearly nothing magical.  Obviously, the subjective ""experience"" of pleasure and pain gets more into philosophy of mind and that's not what I am asking about.

"Do the neural substrates behind motivation to retain/dispose of property govern whether certain people view their friends and partners as possessions?","<p>I'm trying to understand why people have sometimes have the ability to sever ties with valuable connections, e.g., people that have up until that time meant a lot to them.

<p>Hoarders, on the other hand, can place a lot of value on objects that are generally considered to be refuse.   </p>

<p>Looking into hoarding and it's associated disorders, I found some very recent information in Wang et al (2012) regarding some of the neural substrates of acquisitive behavior (which forms some of the physiological basis of hoarding).  These researchers found activation in the orbitalfrontal cortex (OFC), a common substrate of obsessive compulsive disorder, associated with acquisitiveness, and activation in the nucleus accumbens (a motor nucleus within the basal ganglia often associated with addictive behaviors) when possessive participants valued a popular ""hot"" item. There was also activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is associated with monetary valuation of a stimulus, during ""disposal"" of items that they had acquired during the experiment.</p>

<p>Firstly, <strong>is the treatment of people like property an earmark of any notable (Axis II or otherwise) DSM disorder?</strong> </p>

<p>Secondly, <strong>in the case where we assume those that do treat others as property to be acquired and disposed of accordingly, do these same anatomical regions in the OFC govern this behavior?</strong></p>

<p>My question now is - <strong>is there an established opinion which of the two is the preferred method?</strong> </p>

<p>The thing is that skin conductance is relatively straightforward. An electrode or two suffices - too easy. Pupillometry, on the other hand, requires either cumbersome glasses or a head-mounted device, or, alternatively, a table-top device necessitating the subject to focus on a restricted field of view (otherwise the camera looses the pupil).</p>

<p>Given we are considering measuring children, an electrode would intuitively be better, as it can be secured firmly to a finger, it allows for easy instructions - 'don't touch it', and it is relatively robust to artifacts, given that puil recordings suffer from eye blinks. </p>

<p><strong>Should we consider practical considerations only and choose skin conductance, or are there compelling reasons to use an eye tracker instead</strong> **? </p>

"Do we perceive contrast colour patterns easily because of adaptation?","<p>I can understand that colours are just manipulation of our brain to light rays of different wavelength and energy. We perceive patterns better at higher contrast. Do we perceive patterns better at high contrast because of adaptive processes in our brain, <em>i.e.</em>, do we habituate to the colours?</p>

<p>For example, consider a black board; we find texts written by white chalk easier to see than if it was written by blue chalk. Is white chalk on black board a form of adaptation of our brain, or it is always preferred by the brain in comparison to blue? In terms of wave mechanics, the white chalk may cause greater disturbance in the light waves travelling from the black board to our eyes.

"Is it possible to bridge implicit and explicit memory?","<p>It is self evident, from the various studies of Skinner and Pavlov, that a traumatic - or one of a similar nature - experience possesses the tendency to reside within certain schemas through the processes of classical conditioning; exmpli gratia, one may experience unpleasant stings from a wasp ,and thusly bestow fear ( based on that of the pain derived from stings) upon all creatures with similar characteristics through generalisation. And, hence these conditions based upon the creatures may last for prolonged durations, depending upon the frequency and ""intensity"" of the exposure. </p>

<p>However, my question is: could there possibly be a way to bridge implicit memory with declarative in such a process similar to conditioning? So that, as one, for instance, endeavours to memorise a speech, a certain experience associated , despite the fact that the speech may have never encountered the memoriser, could massively boost one's ability to do so. </p>

"Could a painful stimulus be effectively used as a learning aid?","<p>In rats, the application of a painful stimulus has shown an increase in overall arousal and the ability to learn certain behaviours (The study is neatly summed up in this video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-DgV2vixSo"">Motivation and Reward in Learning</a>). The experiment with electric shocks is shown on the second half.</p>

<p>It is common sense that human beings would naturally avoid painful consequences, but the deliberate application of a noxious stimulus may also elicit a unconscious response, or conditioning, to avoid those behaviours, which would mean a faster learning rate.</p>

<p>Learning could also be improved because pain is an intrinsically meaningful response, while perceived failure is somewhat weaker and less imediate as a motivating agent.</p>

<p>Could small electric shocks, applied by another individual, or a computer program (maybe even self-administered), have any use in learning? At what specific tasks would this technique be more effective?</p>

"The mind as a state of matter or physical system?","<p><strong>What examples of attempts to formalize a <em>principled</em> physical basis for consciousness and/or a general theory of the mind exist?</strong></p>

<p>I read a fascinating ArXiV preprint last year called <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1219"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consciousness as a State of Matter</a>. In this paper, physicist Max Tegmark proposed a formalization of consciousness in terms of a distinctive state of matter he termed <strong>perceptronium</strong>. Tegmark concludes that we may identify conscious systems by use of six principles, which he bases on Tononi's <strong>integrated information framework</strong> (Tononi, 2008), which I provide primarily for illustration:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Information:</strong> A conscious system has substantial information storage capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamics:</strong> A conscious system has substantial information processing capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Independence:</strong> A conscious system has substantial independence from the rest of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Integration:</strong> A conscious system cannot consist of nearly independent parts.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> A conscious system has substantial dynamics and independence.</li>
<li><strong>Utility:</strong> An evolved conscious system records mainly information that is useful for it.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Formalizing consciousness and the mind?</h1>

<p>Tegmark's theory is prototypical of a number of recent jabs at a viable, <strong>general theory of the mind</strong> defined as what we might call <em>the physical system which causes behavior</em> that I am very excited about. I am also familiar with the somewhat related <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B008SM38VU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How Can the Human Mind Occur in the Physical Universe?</a> (Anderson, 2007) as well as the general field of <a href=""http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ecological psychology</a> and radical embodied cognitive psychology, e.g. Chemero (2009). Because the content theory behind all of these are so qualitatively different, I would say the common denominator is more methodological and scope-related than strictly empirical, however.</p>

<p>Specifically, these jabs appear to represent <strong>a move away from the near-universal dependence on linear models and non-overlapping research scopes</strong>, and towards more unifying theories of mind, cognition and behavior. I have some limited awareness of strictly methodological articles such as <a href=""http://www.comp-si.org/workshop-14-files/Butner_Psych%20Methods%202014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this recent Psych Methods article</a> which proposes topology as a general tool for the purpose (Butner et al., 2014). </p>

<p>I find that these theories and methodologies, while often flawed in obvious ways (though not necessarily more-so than any others are), raise difficult questions that traditional theories and methodologies do not seem to allow for (Butner et al., 2014 discusses this in some detail). I would be very interested to know more about both general theories and methodologies similar to what I have referenced here, which I hope is sufficient to clarify this complex question. </p>

<p>Formal generalizations allow us to see our fields' otherwise isolated findings in a wider perspective, and allow us to identify the forest we may otherwise miss for the trees. For example, an extremely interesting question raised by Tegmark's formalization is the following quote from the <a href=""https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/why-physicists-are-saying-consciousness-is-a-state-of-matter-like-a-solid-a-liquid-or-a-gas-5e7ed624986d"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Medium article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tegmark points out that any information stored in a special network known as a Hopfield neural net [a type of neural network which Tegmark deems to satisfy his principles] automatically has this error-correcting facility. <strong>However, he calculates that a Hopfield net about the size of the human brain with 10^11 neurons, can only store 37 bits of integrated information</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is a difficult problem for Tononi's content theory to solve in other ways than by claiming Tegmark is somehow not fairly representing the theory, and this line of reasoning potentially has serious implications for all information-based theories. It is often asserted that the brain has incredible computational power ... but we rarely formalize our understanding of what this means. What if we have it all wrong, and it's simply physically and/or mathematically impossible for such a computational system to exist?</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p><strong>What examples of attempts to formalize a <em>principled</em> physical basis for consciousness and/or a general theory of the mind exist?</strong></p>

<p>(Please don't feel discouraged from giving answers based on anything I have referenced. I would not say the information I have provided for anything besides Tegmark's theory constitutes a remotely sufficient answer, so they are fair game.)</p>

<p>A student that did not pay much attention at class, may vaguely recognise the second name, so he checks the middle box and moves on. </p>

<p>Part three: Does it make a difference if the quiz is on paper, and thus gives no direct feedback, or online, and can indicate the correct answer?</p>

"What is the proper definition of psychopathy?","<p>I've seen all those checklists of psychopathy traits, read many articles and watched several tutorials - they mention like dozens of characteristics, but never make it clear about the actual meaning of the word.</p>

<p>Is psychopathy the lack of emotion? Is it the lack of empathy? What's the most accurate definition of the term?</p>

<p>Also, a lot of things that I've seen are unclear and contradictory:</p>

<ol>
<li>A lot of explanations mention ""disregard to social norms"" as an intrinsic trait - but it clearly contradicts the trait of ""self-interest"", because by committing crimes or disregarding norms they harm themselves just as much as they harm people around. That's exactly what some psychopaths respond to allegations that they are dangerous and may commit a crime: ""there's absolutely no reason or benefit of committing crime, so why would I do it?""</li>
<li>A lot of explanations mention ""superficial charm"", while it's unclear how do you even measure that objectively and what does it have to do with mental disorders? Is the evaluating therapist just supposed to tick ""yes"" next to ""superficial charm"" if they personally were charmed by a psychopath, or what? And what does it even have to do with mental health: it's not like ""charm"" is an aura directly projected by brain.</li>
<li>It's very unclear about impulsiveness, aggressiveness and impulsivity: some mention them as intrinsic traits of psychopathy, while others claim that they have nothing to do with it. It's also unclear how do they fit together with lack of emotional response or self interest, because they have nothing to do with each other or even contradict each other.</li>
<li>Things like ""manipulation"", ""lack of realistic goals"" or ""disregard to safety"" seem like things that 90% of the population would qualify for, at least at some point. What exactly is so special about ""psychopathic"" disregard for safety that makes it stand out from the disregard rutinely demostrated by every chemistry freshman? Is it like they are incapable of understanding the very concept of safety, or what? Are they not only remorseless and aggressive, but also intellectually retarded? Does there exist a negative thing that psychopaths aren't?</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, to the question of what psychopathy means, everyone says entirely different things, most of which either don't make sense or are self-contradictory. It seems like a blanket term for everything that's considered ""evil"" by society, but doesn't seem like a real mental disorder. Is it even one disorder, or a collective name for several unrelated disorders?</p>

<p>The only thing that I am clear about is that psychopathy is innate (in comparison to sociopathy, which is trauma-induced).</p>

<p>P.S. I have scientific background, but I am not a psychologist - so it's possible that everything in psychology is as ""vague"", and I just don't understand how does this area of science works (although, for example, bipolar disorder was clear enough to me).</p>

"When someone consumes finasteride, what happens neurophysiologically and what mental functions / faculties are altered?","<p>Finasteride is a medication used to treat androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness) and enlarged prostates. Reported side effects include male breast enlargement, lowered sex drive, and headaches (among others). Additionally, there have been many anecdotal reports of ""brain fog"" and some reports of individuals unable to recall short-term memories.  </p>

<p>Finasteride blocks the conversion from testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by inhibiting 5α-Reductase type II and III. However, it can also have an effect on neurosteroids. From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Neurosteroids like 3α-androstanediol (derived from DHT) and
  allopregnanolone (derived from progesterone) activate the GABA_A
  receptor in the brain; because finasteride prevents the formation of
  neurosteroids, it functions as a neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor and
  may contribute to a reduction of GABA_A activity. Reduction of GABA_A
  receptor activation by these neurosteroids has been implicated in
  depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally to these secondary effects resulting from lowered DHT, finasteride itself also crosses the blood–brain barrier. </p>

<p><strong>Beyond the reduction in GABA_A receptor activation, what effects does finasteride have on the brain (secondary via 5α-Reductase inhibition and lowered DHT, or directly, via crossing the blood-brain barrier) and what kind of functions are altered by it?

<p>On the one hand there is the following example: there was a vintage advert against pollution whereby a lot of people were shown littering as an example of negative behaviour. This was shown to be contra-effective, because showing certain negative behaviour to be commonly practiced actually made it look more acceptable and resulted in more people engaging in it.</p>

<p>On the other hand there is the copycat effect whereby people would be encouraged to engage in certain behaviour because it is widely discussed (for example, sensational news about murder and suicide, or a novel or series/film about similar topics, resulting in people who had such tendencies imitating the said behaviours). It has been suggested that the way these topics are viewed could prevent people from engaging it the said behaviour (for example, emphasizing the grief of the victims’ relatives).</p>

<p>So does the way certain popular (widely practiced or widely discussed) negative behaviour is viewed actually effect whether or not it will be imitated by those who are prone to that behaviour (the first case suggests that it doesn't, the second case suggests that it does)?

"If the optic nerve transmits to both hemispheres, how do split-brain experiments work?","<p>From what I understand, the optic nerve of each eye transmits information to both hemispheres of the brain. This is unlike other sensory and motor information, where (for example) the right hand is controlled by the left and vice versa.</p>

<p>Most sources I read skip over this information or don't explain it clearly, but I found it stated this way in <a href=""https://open.lib.umn.edu/intropsyc/chapter/4-2-seeing/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Introduction to Psychology ebook</a> and <a href=""http://sites.psu.edu/clarep/2017/04/20/a-dominant-preference-eye-or-hand/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this blog post</a> (quotes pasted below; scroll for it).</p>

<p>However, I also read about split-brain experiments (such as those by Sperry and Gazzaniga) performed on patients who had undergone corpus calloscotomy, where the link between the two hemispheres of their brain was broken. Many of these experiments are vision-based, showing different visual stimuli to each eye and observing reactions in the corresponding hemisphere. But <strong>this assumes that the right eye transmits information only to the left, and vice versa</strong>, which, according to the other two sources, does not seem to be the case.</p>

<p>Taking it further, <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/split-brains"" rel=""noreferrer"">this Psychology Today article</a> mentions studies on hemispheric transfer, which showed that subjects could read text more efficiently when fed directly to the right-eye (∵ contralateral control), rather than going to the left eye and then having to be transferred to the left hemisphere for processing—again implying that vision follows the contralateral principle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although the principle of contralateral control might lead you to expect
  that the left eye would send information to the right brain hemisphere
  and vice versa, nature is smarter than that. In fact, the left and
  right eyes each send information to both the left and the right
  hemisphere, and the visual cortex processes each of the cues
  separately and in parallel. This is an adaptational advantage to an
  organism that loses sight in one eye, because even if only one eye is
  functional, both hemispheres will still receive input from it.</p>

<p><strong>The <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/split-brains"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Psychology Today</em> article</a>:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A team of researchers from UC Santa Barbara, led by Gazzaniga,
  recently tested information transfer using MEG. Language is processed
  in areas of the temporal lobe on the left side of the head. When you
  read with your left eye, the information first ends up in the right
  hemisphere and must be transferred to the left hemisphere via the
  corpus callosum to be processed. To test the efficiency of the
  hemispheric transfer the researchers showed a randomized list of words
  and nonsense words to the left or right eye of a number of research
  participants. They then measured how effectively the subjects would be
  able to distinguish words from nonsense words. The study showed that
  subjects were significantly more efficient in determining the nature
  of the string of letters when the information was fed directly to the
  left hemisphere via the right eye. Apparently the brain has
  difficulties processing information that has had to travel long
  distances.</p>

<h1>My question</h1>

<p>Assuming my first information is accurate, here's one explanation I can think of: each eye <em>usually</em> sends information only to the opposite eye, but the optic nerve fibres travel to both hemispheres <em>in case</em> one eye stops functioning, in which case the remaining eye begins transmitting to both hemispheres. That seems a bit of a stretch, though.</p>

<p><strong>So, here's my question:</strong> How do vision-based split-brain experiments account for the fact that the optic nerve reaches both hemispheres? Are there other properties of transmission that I'm not aware of (such as my hypothesis above)? Or is the assertion that the optic nerve transmits to both hemispheres simply false?</p>

"Social Media and General Addiction","<p>I have a question made of four aspects on addiction and dopamine neurobiology. </p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> I'm currently wondering whether the addictive potential of social media can be quantified. I'm aware it probably depends on the individual, but I would think an estimate is possible; for example, hardcore drugs may be more objectively more addictive than a sugary snack. </p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> I'm also wondering if I'm correct in assuming that, in addiction, the diminution of dopamine receptors would render <em>all</em> activities (aside the addiction itself) less pleasurable. Is this the case?</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Finally, I'm wondering if the availability of more receptors of dopamine would permit sustained release of this neurotransmitter over time. I.e. several short amounts of dopamine from natural sources would be more 'optimal' than a massive burst at one given time?</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Finally, I'm wondering if I'm completely off track given Berridge's 'wanting' versus 'liking' distinction, where dopamine mediates wanting and opioids mediate liking. Would pleasure here occur from opioids rather than dopamine?</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

"Fit a psychometric function when the maximum is not 100% (not because of lapse)","<p>I found that currently the form of psychometric function assumes that the proportion correct lies between 0.5-1 given the range of stimulus level, but how to fit a psychometric function when the subject's performance never goes to 1 (and it is not because of lapse)?</p>

<p>An example of how this situation can happen: suppose I want to study how stimulus presentation time affect a small target's visibility in a given peripheral visual field location by a 2AFC task. The target's feature is fixed throughout the experiment. I can imagine that with longer stimulus presentation time (like 1 ms vs. 200 ms), subject can make more correct responses, but because of the limit of peripheral vision, the correct response rate can never go to 100% even if you present the stimulus for a very long time. How can I fit a psychometric function (proportion correct ~ stimulus presentation time) to data like this?</p>

"How to control subject's response bias in 2-interval force choice task","<p>I am using a two-interval force choice (2IFC) task to estimate detection threshold and choose an appropriate signal level for my following experiment, by estimating sensitivity (<span class=""math-container"">$d'$</span>) for each signal level. </p>

<p>Since it is a 2IFC task with signal equally distributed on two intervals, I expect close-to-zero response bias and plan to estimate <span class=""math-container"">$d'$</span> directly from proportion correct. After running experiment on 3 subjects (one complete 2500 trials, two complete 1250 trials), two of them show slight response bias (ratio of response to interval 1 vs. 2 is 0.91 and 1.12), but one subject shows large response bias (ratio of response to interval 1 vs. 2 is 0.53). </p>

<p>Here is my question:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For the subject with large response bias, is it still valid to estimate <span class=""math-container"">$d'$</span> from proportion correct anymore? And is it still valid to estimate <span class=""math-container"">$d'$</span> directly from hit rate and false-alarm rate?</p></li>
<li><p>If I hope to let this subject to continue participating in this experiment, how should I let him/her to lower response bias? Directly telling him/her ""You have pressed key #1 too often, press key #2 more when you are not sure""? Is it going to interfere the experiment?</p></li>
<li><p>For future naïve participants, should I let them know do not bias toward one response too much before the start of experiment, or should I tell them only when they have made too much bias? If the latter case, how much bias is considered to be ""too much""?</p></li>

It's that way on purpose.  It felt like cogsci was the best place for this question and I couldn't find anything really like it anywhere on stackexchange.</p>

<p>I want to know in general, if I need to teach someone a concept and I really want them to understand it...what method, techniques, strategies are there out there which appear to have the biggest impact on the success of a teacher teaching the student a concept?</p>

<p>What other factors should one possibly consider when teaching something to someone else?  (Bias, attention span...how do I deal with these?) </p>

<p>Research for backing up anything you suggest would be ideal, but I don't want that requirement to preclude someone from posting something that could potentially be very effective but just isn't cited somewhere for some reason...maybe they experienced it with a teacher they had.  There can be value in those gems too.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'd actually like for this post to be one that has <strong>universal teaching ideas/strategy in it</strong> and not just those applicable to my context below...as sometimes the only thing precluding the use of a teaching strategy in a different or more universal domain from where it came from is the ingenuity of the teacher.    </p>

<p>Also, I tried finding a post on stackexchange anywhere containing this question in it's general sense with answers and couldn't....there is stuff on how to teach programming, but that's just programming....some of its ideas are partially applicable universally, but not all of them.</p>

1) Me drawing on a digital screen things while I'm talking
2) Using easy to relate to analogies
3) Obviously any other visuals
4) Pausing to quiz their knowledge on a previous section before they can move ahead
5) Wrapping this up in a hopefully entertaining package</p>

<p>To provide some context and the format/audience...what I'll practically be using this information for:</p>

<p>I am releasing a special documentary style video with the goal making users completely understand the entire path some special research recently published takes, its reasoning for every choice it makes, and the logic for it's sequencing and timing of element.</p>

"Counterfactual thinking and the origin of language","<p>I want to apologize in advance for my dearth of knowledge concerning cognitive science research and history, I'm an AI student.</p>

<p>I've been reading up on cognitive science/linguistics literature mostly to get a better grasp on the physical symbol system hypothesis/language of thought vs connectionism debate.</p>

<p>I read this very interesting <a href=""http://alpha-leonis.lids.mit.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/At-the-Birth-of-Language-by-Ian-Tattersall-The-New-York-Review-of-Books.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">review</a> of Berwick and Chomsky's book ""Why Only Us"" by Ian Tattersall, in which he exposes the authors' idea that language suddenly appeared as a result of a minor mutation in our ancestors' brain 80,000 years ago. However, because of the lack of linguistic archeological artefacts, it is impossible to prove. He then goes on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If that is true, perhaps the best proxies we can seek for language in
  the human archaeological record are objects or activities that reflect the working of symbolic human minds: minds capable
  of envisioning that the world could be otherwise than it is at this moment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And my question is then: why does counterfactual thinking require a symbolic mind? It seems perfectly plausible to imagine a species who can't talk but can still imagine ""other world"" scenarios using his visual system. However, a counter-argument is that animals have a highly developed visual system, yet they can't think counterfactually. (Hariri is famous for saying ""You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him that after he dies, he will get limitless bananas in chimpanzee Heaven."")</p>

<p>This all seems related to the LoT vs Connectionism debate: did we first grow a mind strong enough to do counterfactual thinking, which was also able to process language, or is language and symbolic thought really the precursor to higher level thinking like counterfactual thinking?</p>

"Is a low Emotional Intelligence (EQ) pathological?","<p>A sufficiently low cognitive intelligence is generally considered in society to be inherently pathological, or at least very nearly so.

<p>Is there a similar phenomenon with respect to <em>Emotional</em> Intelligence (EQ)?

<blockquote>
  <p>The display has a contrast ratio of 800:1. The screen is marketed by Apple as the ""Retina Display"", based on the assertion that a display of approximately 300 ppi at a distance of 12 inches (305 mm) from one's eye, or 57 arcseconds per pixel is the maximum amount of detail that the human retina can perceive.</p>

"Is there a reduction of ""Brain Fog"" with fewer hours of sleep?","<p>I've heard patients who complain of ""brain fog"" (and fatigue) claim a reduction in ""brain fog"" (and more mental clarity) when they get fewer hours of sleep (usually less than 5.5 hours).</p>

<p>Here I'd define brain fog as a lack of mental clarity, slow and muddled thinking, trouble stringing thoughts, drowsiness, a reduced ability to focus, a feeling of drifting off, and a reduced ability to shift attention.  Delirium (without hallucination) could be a close medical term.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Any theories on why this may happen?</p></li>
<li><p>Is anyone familiar with any research regarding less brain fog with less sleep?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I've read in a paper by MacLean and Datta (2007) that sleep deprivation has been successfully used to treat depression, but not so with anxiety.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, in clinical studies, sleep deprivation has been an effective
  form of treatment for major depressive disorders in humans (Clark et
  al., 2001; Giedke et al., 2003; Gillin et al., 2001); but deprivation
  has shown little or negative results in patients diagnosed with
  anxiety disorders (Dinges et al., 1997; Labbate et al., 1998). Results
  from recent REM and total sleep deprivation studies in rodents
  demonstrate the anxiogenic effect of disrupted sleep (Silva et al.,
  2004; Suchecki et al., 2002a; Suchecki et al., 2002b).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depression and delirium are two distinct things, and I'd be interested in hearing more about how sleep deprivation effects delirium -- since it seems that brain fog is not a widely used term.</p>

"Running on autopilot","<p>Sometimes, people say that they are ""running on autopilot"", meaning that they are doing the things that they normally do, without any real conscious involvement. I have read that it is not uncommon for people to drive routes that they regularly drive without any conscious memory of it - I have occasionally done this myself, and it is very unnerving.</p>

<p>But how do we do this? How can we achieve the level of co-ordination and reaction that is required to drive a vehicle for a significant period without involving our conscious mind? I realise that we do a lot of things sub-consciously, but it seems that learned tasks like driving should require at least a minimal conscious engagement.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I am not suggesting that this is dangerous in any sense. I don't think it is. I am just surprised as the level of functioning we are capable of achieving sub-consciously.</p>

"Is Decision-Making Emotionally Based, with Rationalization as the only Conscious Component?","<p>My interest is in how problem-solving decisions are made, and what, if any skills could be taught to increase people's ability to make effective decisions?  Effective, in this case, means that an external observer finds the decision a sufficient and satisfying solution to the problem given the thinker's current understanding of environment, context, and resources.</p>

<p>I understand the <em>Information Principle</em> of emotion takes the position that emotions are a ""summary"" of all that the unconscious notices about the current situation. (See this <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/a/528/464"">link</a> for an excellent overview.)  Given the breadth of its perception, and the faster processing time of its systems, emotion is tremendously powerful as an advisor. The reward system is triggered when a desired choice is contemplated, so is the role primary, rather than advisory? <strong>Is conscious thought -- what we come up with when we ""think about our decision"" -- always <em>post hoc</em>, used only for coming up with a way to explain what our feelings told us we wanted?</strong> </p>

<p>Regarding skills to increase effectiveness, I wonder at the value of learning to overcome our initial emotional response to allow the more deliberate conscious processes to make a real contribution.  I have heard that trauma victims with absent emotions dither about the smallest decisions, so I'm not talking full suppression.

"Why is a lack of response to punishment in adults considered significant in diagnoses?","<p>It seems that a lack of response to punishment is often considered useful in diagnosing conditions or symptoms.

"Is pedophilia a sexual orientation or a mental disorder?","<p>There are some different claims being made that pedophilia is a sexual orientation rather than a mental disorder.</p>

<p>At the moment there seems to be a growing group of psychologists advocating that pedophilia is, or at least should be considered a sexual orientation rather than a mental disorder.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.good.is/post/is-pedophilia-a-sexual-orientation-a-psychologist-breaks-down-what-makes-a-jerry-sandusky/"">For example</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GOOD: You're a member of a growing group of psychologists who say
  pedophilia should be considered a sexual orientation. Why?</p>
  
  <p>Quinsey: Part of the definition of pedophilia is a person has a
  preference for a particular kind of partner. [...] pedophiles,
  unlike other men, show substantial sexual interest in prepubescent
  children. As far as we know—and many people have tried—these sexual
  interests are not modifiable by any method that’s been tried yet. So
  it appears like pedophilia is a sexual orientation. [...] You also can’t modify that
  interest; it’s stable through adulthood, just like pedophilia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/pedophilia-a-sexual-orientation-experts-tell-parliament/"">Another example</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Pedophiles are not simply people who commit a small offence from time
  to time but rather are grappling with what is equivalent to a sexual
  orientation just like another individual may be grappling with
  heterosexuality or even homosexuality,” emphasized Van Gijseghem.</p>
  
  <p>“True pedophiles have an exclusive preference for children, which is
  the same as having a sexual orientation.  You cannot change this
  person’s sexual orientation.” He added, however: “He may however
  remain abstinent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also an advocacy/support group for people attracted to minors, B4UACT, who state in a <a href=""http://b4uact.org/faq.htm#stereotyped"">section from their website</a> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do you say that minor-attracted people are stereotyped?</p>
  
  <p>Popular beliefs about minor-attracted people are not supported by the

  than the general population, nor do they suffer from psychopathology

"Is performance reducible to brain activity in an unambiguous way?","<p>As a preface, let me assume that the entirety of mental states and their corresponding behaviors in a person are entirely reducible to the physical activity of neurons sending a variety of chemicals across synaptic clefts at appointed times. There's no extra-logical, metaphysical sense of being that guides our actions e.g. spirits, soul stuff, etc. </p>

<p>Beyond this provision, which is obvious, is the overarching question of how particular networks in the brain control various structural and behavioral faculties in the mind. For example, if we place a person in an MRI and ask them to count to three, we expect to find activation in a portion of the parietal lobe. <strong>Just how fine-grained is this activation?</strong> If we ask the same person to do the same counting at a different time, will a different network in the same area of the brain be used? </p>

Here, if there is no time pressure involved, a threshold value is set which has to be reached before an answer is given. Contrary, if there is a time pressure involved, the value at the last time point is used to decide which answer is given, even if the threshold point hasn't been reached at that time.</p>

<p>I wonder whether there are any extension of this model which can incorporate situations with <em>more</em> than two choices (from 3 alternatives and up to a fully continius choice space). I guess you just could incorporate more dimensions (the model referred to above is two-dimensional), but if the answers are non-independent (for example, when using a rating scale), I guess the random walk function would have to be fairly complicated. That is, if strong evidence is accumulated for number 3, how much evidence should be added to 4 and 2? Should evidence be subtracted from 1 and 5? </p>

"Why are most popular humans pets carnivores?","<p>Most popular pets are cats, and dogs. They are all carnivores. Few people have pigs as pets. More commonly, people eat pigs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why are some of the most common human housepets carnivores?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does this preference indicate anything more general about the human condition?</strong> (for example, do humans love violent beings?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:
Cows, horses, and rabbits are cattles, not pets. You don't develop emotional bonding with them. People would scream when dogs are being eaten in China. People don't scream when pigs are being eaten everywhere.</p>

<p>I am talking about the <strong>most popular pets that people form bonds with</strong>.</p>

<p>I am just wondering that perhaps we use cats in mutually beneficial ways. That is why we love them. Also cats and dogs would retaliate if we hit them.</p>

<p>We uses cows in parasitic ways (as food). That's why we don't love cows. Perhaps a good strategy to be loved is to be reasonably violent? That's what I want to know.</p>

<p>Or perhaps humans love those who kill for them (like our soldiers?). Cats and dogs kill for us or help us kill. That's why we evolve loving them as our ""allies"". Is it possible?</p>

"Is implicit and explicit memory a useful distinction?","<p>In principle I understand the distinction. Implicit memory is not consciously recollected but has an automatic character i.e. while I'm solving a task in math, I'm automatically using the concept of numbers and maybe even counting which I have stored in my memory. Explicit memory on the other hand is the conscious recollection of particular bits of memory, like explicitly counting up to ten or maybe remembering my birthday.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is this: Isn't this distinction somewhat arbitrary? Even if I consciously use a certain piece of memory to solve a task, isn't it the case that I still don't know how I manage to access this particular memory? And is this even only about memory? To me it seems that everything can be stored in some way (how I breathe, my birthday and the range of things I do when taking a shower) and isn't that the only type of memory we have? Shouldn't the distinction then be about how we use the things we have memorized? I mean is there evidence that implicit memory is stored in a structurally different way than explicit memory? Or am I focussing on the wrong question?</p>

<p>I'm asking this question out of pure interest as a cognitive linguist who doesn't have much to do with memory right now.</p>

"Is remembering a list of words an example of semantic or episodic memory?","<p>I'm having a hard time making a clear distinction between semantic and episodic memory. When presented with idealized examples, I find the breakdown clear; describing a trip to Paris is an example of episodic memory, describing the structure of a cell is an example of semantic memory.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to experimental settings, things suddenly start to look more murky. For example, say that one is presented 20 words in a sequential fashion and then is asked to repeat as many of these as possible. Are we dealing with episodic memory then? Does it make any difference if one is forced to recollect them in the same order as they appeared? Many researchers seem to consider this situation an example of episodic memory (just as an example, see van der Helm et al., 2011), and indeed, the man who invented the concept of episodic memory also did so at the time of its conception (Tulving, 1972; p.390).</p>

<p>However, later, Tulving has revised his original definition. In a more recent article (Tulving, 2002) he writes: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had been wrong in 1972 when I had assumed that the traditional, Ebbinghaus-inspired, study/test laboratory experiments of verbal learning and memory had dealt with episodic memory. They had not. Two important features of episodic memory were missing.</p>
  
  <p>One had to do with the contents of what the subjects in the experiments had to learn. Episodic memory is about happenings in particular places at particular times, or about “what,” “where,” and “when” [...] Traditional laboratory experiments, however, were almost invariably concerned with “what.” Subjects are asked, “What do you remember of the presented material?” They report their knowledge in tests such as free recall, cued recall, or recognition. Subjects’ memory for “where” and “when” was hardly ever examined.</p>
  
  <p>The other missing feature was what I referred to in Elements as “recollective experience,” or conscious awareness of what had happened in the past. In traditional experiments the experimenter assumes that the overt behavioral response reflects the subject’s mental state; that is, that behavior is a faithful index of cognition. The reasoning goes something like this: Surely, if the subject recognizes an item in a recognition test, it means that he remembers it from the list, that is, that he has a conscious recollection of the item’s occurrence in the study list. How could it possibly be otherwise?</p>
  
  <p>As subsequent history showed, it could be otherwise. Research on implicit memory [...], or so-called nonconscious memory [...], has overwhelmingly proved that one and the same behavioral response in a study/test experiment could represent conscious awareness of the retrieved item’s experimental history as readily as it could represent total lack of such awareness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So which one is it? Are there any large disagreements within the community of what episodic memory actually is? Are word list tests seen as something that at least captures a small part of episodic memory? If remembering a list of words isn't an example of episodic memory, then what is it an example of?</p>

"Enhance recollection abilites","<p>I hope this is a good way of asking this question. </p>

<p>I am not generally the guy with the best memory out there, so I looked a bit into it and I am concluding my recollection phase is the weakest. It's seems like I can store a lot but recalling it, I would come under average. </p>

<p>Well I do recall a lot because I can gather a lot from my memory, but then I stumble often in just getting the first starting point from which I would be able to gather all those memories, i.e : I can remember profusely given someone or something helps me with recalling just a part or the beginning of it. So my recalling issue is really in having a sort of catalogue or dictionary like system : once you get the word you get its definition, my trouble is in getting the word (I hope the analogy is clear). Working memory is short-term memory? Can be, what are symptoms for that ?</p>

"Learned dyslexia? adult predicament from childhood teacher´s incompetence?","<p>I have a friend, over 30, who is convinced she cannot really read. Of course; she <em>can</em>  read, but she struggles so much with sorting letters into words that she cannot absorb the content. Playing - say - Trivial Pursuit - she looks at the letters; pronounce the words, makes them into sentences, but (says) she does not understand the question until I either answer or say it back to her, or she reads it a second time. She is now, for other reasons, back to school, as she needs to find another profession. I am, in an unofficial capacity, her personal tutor.</p>

<p>The consensus during her school years was that she was extremely dyslectic, a hopeless case, and her teachers let her ""get away with it"": unlike other students, she did not have to read aloud in class etc (this makes me furious to think about, that they did not give her the help she needed).</p>

<p>She is nowhere near stupid, but insists she is, and that she is so dyslectic that there is nothing that can be done about it. Recently, she took a dyslectic-test and consistently get the worst scores possible.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that she is NOT half as dyslectic as she is made out to be: I think this is largely a learned thing. Since teachers gave up on her; why should <em>she</em> believe she <em>can</em>? Yes, she probably is dyslectic, but the result of incompetent teachers have made her predicament much, much worse.</p>

<p>Fact is; when she <em>has</em> to write things, there are not really all that many spelling mistakes, the sentences are coherent, and she is very good at the logic needed to write - say - a (slightly academic) essay, she is excellent at writing stories, petites. She does, however, have a problem extracting the essence of what she reads. I do think though, that this is largely due to the learned view ""I cannot do this, I am too stupid and massively dyslectic"". Interestingly, last semester she consistently got top grades in the (native) language class where both content and spelling was important.</p>

<p>This results in (partly learned?) dyslexia as a ""gateway"" to the crippling thought: ""I am an idiot. Why should I try? I will simply spend my life watching television."".</p>

<p>We do not read single letters in words we are familiar with; we largely see the ""picture"" of a word and make an educated guess/reasonable assumption based on the context. She is visual enough to master this. Having given up on words; there is a possibility that she does not bother to learn them, and hence cannot recognise the word-picture.</p>

<p>I realise this is a very specific example, but my general question is:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do you teach adults to read?</li>
<li>Is it possible to somehow measure the ""I have given up"" against real
dyslexia?</li>
<li>How is it possible to motivate an adult other than ""you will get
good grades if you improve on this""? (grades, as we all know, can at
times be a little arbitrary and subjective).</li>
<li>Any research on learned dyslexia?</li>
<li>Have our acceptance of dyslexia in a way gone too far? (to the point
of accepting it and ""giving up"" on students?)</li>

<p>An ANOVA test on the prestimulus baseline period yielded a significant effect of the condition. I have observed a difference between standard stimuli's wave and deviant stimuli's wave.

"Evidence-based best practices for writing a gratitude journal","<p>I was intrigued to read (in the question <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/2049/what-positive-writing-exercises-improve-happiness/"">""What positive writing exercises improve happiness?""</a>) the idea of a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gratitude diary</a> suggested as an intervention that ""causes psychological well-being levels to increase in a lasting way"".</p>

<p>Empirical studies suggest that people who use gratitude journals feel better about their lives and report fewer symptoms of illness. (<a href=""http://psy.miami.edu/faculty/mmccullough/Gratitude-Related20Stuff/Emmons_McCullough_2003_JPSP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Emmons &amp; McCullough, 2003</a>; <a href=""http://www.gapsychology.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=309"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doverspike</a>; <a href=""http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/Labs/emmons/PWT/index.cfm?Section=4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Emmons Lab</a>.)</p>

<p>However, there's also lots of dubious <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_attraction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">law of attraction-style</a> writing on the topic, <a href=""http://www.oprah.com/spirit/The-Power-of-Gratitude"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Did you know that appreciation, gratitude and love are the highest
  forms of vibration? You can only have one vibration at a time, and if
  you are noticing what you appreciate and noticing what you are
  grateful for, you can't be noticing what you don't like.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And although studies find gratitude journals to be beneficial, they disagree on the most beneficial ways to keep one. Psychologist <a href=""http://www.gapsychology.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=309"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">William Doverspike says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A daily gratitude intervention (self-guided exercises) resulted in more positive effects tha[n] did the weekly intervention.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href=""http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jason Marsh of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Writing occasionally (once or twice per week) is more beneficial than daily journaling. In fact, one study by psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky and her colleagues found that people who wrote in their gratitude journals once a week for six weeks reported boosts in happiness afterward; people who wrote three times per week didn’t.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So: which is likely to be correct in practice? And what best practices for keeping a gratitude journal can be inferred from other research, either specifically about gratitude or more generally in the cognitive sciences?</strong></p>

This is especially <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/640"">important for abstract objects</a> because our brain can memorize only visual pictures (you can visualize familiar things). For instance, instead of directly memorizing the 10 abstract <strong>amendements</strong> to (US) constitution, (1.Freedom of Speech, 2.Right to Bear Arms, 3.Protection From Quartering Troops, 4.Freedom from Unreasonable Search and Seizure, and etc), you translate them into a list of visualizable <strong>amendment images</strong>, (1. Speaker, 2. Gun, 3. Soldier, 4. Spotlight, 5. A picture of you, 6. Judge riding a fast motorcycle, 7. Jury, 8. Excessive amount of money, 9. Making a right turn with your hand over your mouth, 10. State Capitol building). Then, you come up with another, well-known list of visualizable <strong>loci objects</strong>, e.g. (head top, nose, mouth, ribs, liver, joint, cap, fibula, ball, sand),</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzcI8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Finally, you invent <strong>10 stories</strong>, to map the loci items to the amendment images. In overall, ordered loci list serves as a list of keys that we can iterate and, by means of vivid stories, map to the target abstract items. </p>

<p>Yet, I see that you memorize 4 lists (original list, keys and images and stories) in place of single amendment list alone. This is 4x more information. It would be ok if the associations were natural and teach me the world around me. However, they must be absolutely bizzare because they do not exist, unnatural and, secondly, the outlandish pictures are much better memorizable (they call this <a href=""http://www.memory-sports.com/how-to-become-a-memory-champion-part-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">thinking out-of-the-box</a>) </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lRa4L.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

Antidepressants are generally serotonin enhancers and their mechanism of action hinges on the premise that there is a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain. But not only do they not work significantly  better than placebos, but also there are antidepressants that do not enhance serotonin but suppress it. There are some that do nothing to serotonin at all, but their therapeutic effects are all the same, according to Hirsch. So the effect is independent of the chemical composition. That means the chemical imbalance theory is wrong. Is my understanding, as a layperson, correct?</p>

"What is the relationship between visual attention network and visual stream (Two-streams hypothesis)?","<p>There are two visual attention networks proposed by Maurizio Corbetta and Gordon L. Shulman (2002). These are top-down and bottom-up attention networks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also two ventral streams proposed by Melvyn A. Goodale and A. David Milner (1992). These are ventral stream and dorsal stream.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We propose that the ventral stream of projections from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex plays the major role in the perceptual identification of objects, while the dorsal stream projecting from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region mediates the required sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at such objects.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To gain insight into the relationship between M/dorsal and P/ventral activity and deploying visual attention, we used a covert cuing paradigm to manipulate attention while bottom-up and top-down perceptual stimulus variables created M/dorsal and P/ventral-biased conditions. One study examined the object advantage, where responses are faster for within-relative to equidistant between-object shifts of attention. Visual stream contributions to object- and spaced-based attention were revealed using psychophysically equiluminant conditions expected to reduce M/dorsal activity. Other studies investigating visual stream contributions to location-based inhibition of return (IOR) used IOR magnitude as an indicator of the ease or difficulty of deploying spatial attention. Greater IOR was found under P/ventral-biased conditions. Less IOR was found under M/dorsal-biased conditions. </p>

"How do you call the cognitive bias of not seeing self as the common denominator?","<p>Imagine an Italian person is living in London. A poll on the street asks them to estimate the total number of Italians in London. This person then gives a highly incorrect, overblown guess. It's simply common for people of a single nationality to notice each other in the crowd or go to the same places, so it's somewhat likely that one would have an inflated estimate in their heads.</p>

<p>Another example would be a ""reverse <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness_stereotype"" rel=""nofollow"">physical attractiveness stereotype</a>"": a person holding the belief that ""all people are friendly"".

"Does homosexuality correlate with narcissism or finding yourself attractive?","<p>I'm a heterosexual male. Male bodies do not appeal to me much. I find my own (average) body mediocre. At the same time I find average female bodies rather interesting and attractive. The same goes for faces and ""male"" and ""female"" character traits. So I wonder how homosexuals judge themselves.</p>

<p>Since gay men and lesbian women are attracted to bodies, faces and possibly personalities of the same sex, maybe they find their own bodies, faces and personality more aggreeable on average than the heterosexual, for whom persons of their own kind must by definition lack at least some aspects of attractiveness (i.e. the sexual and erotic appeal).</p>

<p>If this is so, then maybe traits like narcissism are more frequent and disorders like body dysmophic disorder are less frequent among homosexuals. In general terms:</p>

<p><strong>Do homosexuals like themselves more than heterosexuals?</strong></p>

"EPSP/IPSP amplitude values?","<p>I'm working with a Hodgkin-Huxley model that receives synaptic inputs from presynaptic neurons. If it receives a spike from an excitatory presynaptic neuron, the voltage of my HH neuron inceases by an amount $g$. If it receives a spike from an inhibitory neuron, the voltage jumps down by an amount $g \times K$ (so K is the factor controlling how much the voltage drops relative to how much it would increase from an excitatory neuron). I read in textbooks that the ratio of excitatory:inhibitory neurons is generally $4:1$. That implies that for the system to be ""balanced"", I should have $K=4$. If $K&lt;4$, then there is a net drift upwards in voltage towards the threshold values, and for $K&gt;4$, there is a net drift downwards away from the threshold. </p>

<p>I have two sub-questions:</p>

<p>1) Is there a typical value of $g$ (the EPSP amplitude) that is biologically plausible? I've seen anywhere from $0.1-0.5$ and above which is quite a big range. I know that there is often a big range based on stimulus and whatnot, but I'm looking for a biologically reasonable value.</p>

<p>2) What is a typical value of $K$? In other words, what is the size of a typical IPSP amplitude relative to the EPSP amplitude? I've seen anywhere from the amplitude being the same to the amplitude being 4x the EPSP amplitude (which of course is a mighty big range).</p>

The only thing I found are <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/psychopy-dev/u3WyDfnIYBo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these tests</a>
Has someone stumbled across a publication regarding the accuracy?</p>

Wi-Fi, Mobile and other kind of connections disabled; desktop visual effects disabled; antivirus, software updates, background programs, and other kind of asynchronous events sources disabled) and the last version of PsychoPy2.</p>

<p>I tried to do preliminary tests to measure the accuracy of my test and to measure the keystroke duration with Psychopy and my keyboard simulating device. Before renting more expensive equipment, I've tried to pretest the accuracy with a 60 fps camera recording the moment of touch and without touch to the device and measuring with Psychopy at the same, to be able to compare these to values to have the accuracy. The 60 fps means, that in between frames there are 16.67 ms. My cheap camera pretest showed, that most of the processing time would be a maximum of approximately 8ms, so that I think I will achieve even lower values with better recording equipment with a higher framerate. But approximately every tenth measurement I have 24-36 ms signal processing.</p>

<p>My questions summarized:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone know, what the reason might be that approximately every tenth measurement has higher signal processing times?</li>
<li>How could I make the measurement of the keystroke duration more accurate?</li>
<li>Has anyone measured the keystroke duration accuracy of psychopys2 different functions (e.g <code>iohub</code> and <code>pyglet</code>) in windows himself or stumbled upon literature about this?</li>

"Use of the visual cortex in mathematical thinking?","<p>In modern computers (and programming) one makes alienated use of the high powers of graphical processing units (GPU) for non-graphics-related tasks, enhancing drastically the power of the general purpose central processing units (CPU).</p>

At least the role of ""inner geometric visualization"" is often emphasized (without being completely understood, as I guess - not even what this means).</p>

<p>For example, in his <a href=""http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1983.1/Main/icm1983.1.0011.0014.ocr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">laudation</a> for the Fields medal winner of 1982, William Thurston, C.T.C. Wall says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thurston has fantastic geometric insight and vision; his ideas have
  completely revolutionized the study of topology in 2 and 3 dimensions,
  and brought about a new and fruitful interplay between analysis,
  topology and geometry.</p>

<p>So my question is for any study that might have been performed in this direction - or for any theoretical approach that has been made.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>[One guiding idea might be the following: Consider the concept of a 5-dimensional hypercube. Just <strong>trying</strong> hard and often to mentally visualize such a cube (which would correspond to some specific neuronal activities in the visual cortex) would ""improve"" (somehow) mathematical thinking about higher dimensions in other parts of the cortex - even if it's not successfull, i.e. no clear mental picture arises.

<p><em>Scenario 2:</em> Now imagine that the same parts are covered with ink, but their color differs. Again, if the difference is sufficiently small, I cannot see the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Firstly:</strong> what causes this? I am aware of the terminology of just-noticeable differences/limina, but do not understand precisely what causes them. Is there some discretization of continuous signals going on that causes `nearby signals' to be treated the same way?</p>

<p><strong>Secondly:</strong> one person may have better vision than another, but are there physical constraints that are the same for any two persons and that imply that if the difference in scenario 1 or 2 is sufficiently small, no two persons will be able to see a difference?</p>

<p>Addenda: I phrased the question informally by not defining what a `small difference' is, trusting/hoping that this does not lead to confusion. If desired, such statements can be made precise by adopting appropriate distance functions. In scenario 1, one way to measure distance between two areas covered in ink could be to use the Hausdorff distance; likewise, one way to measure the distance between colors in the second scenario could depend on the difference in responsiveness of the three types of cone cells.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Knowledge like ""never tell your immediate boss in this organization what you feel about TPS reports, or you won't be able to get your complaint past upper management"" seems like tacit knowledge. But yet it's written down as a declarative fact.</p>

"During body-scan ('sweeping') meditation, what does brain-imaging (e.g. fMRI) look like?","<p>I do not know how extensive body scans have been studied with brain-imaging techniques, e.g. fMRI.</p>

<p>Body scan is a <a href=""https://palousemindfulness.com/docs/bodyscan.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">meditation technique developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn</a>. It was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness#Jon_Kabat-Zinn_and_MBSR"" rel=""noreferrer"">derived from a meditation practice ('sweeping') of the Burmese U Ba Khin tradition</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It involves systematically sweeping through the body with the mind,
  bringing an affectionate, openhearted, interested attention to its
  various regions, customarily starting from the toes of the left foot
  and then moving through the entirety of the foot [...] From there, the
  focus moves into, successively, and slowly, the entirety of the pelvic
  region, including the buttocks and the genitals [...] and finally, to
  the face and head.""</p>
  
  <p>""We are systematically and intentionally moving our attention through
  the body, attending to the various sensations in the different
  regions. That we can attend to these body sensations at all is quite
  remarkable. That we can do it at will, either impulsively or in a more
  disciplined systematic way, is even more so.""</p>
  
  <p>""We might describe what we are doing during a body scan as tuning in
  or opening to those sensations, allowing ourselves to become aware of
  what is already unfolding.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found it quite easy to practice and had interesting and unusual experiences (mostly pleasant).</p>

<p>My question is: Would any brain and brain-imaging expert - given this description - dare to guess roughly how a body scan may look like in a ""brain scanner"", e.g. recorded with fMRI?</p>

<p>I am not such an expert, nevertheless I dare to guess.</p>

<p>Presumably, a body scan will - mainly but not solely - take place in the areas of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus"" rel=""noreferrer"">cortical homunculus</a> in the primary motor and sensory cortices.  </p>

<p>I would guess that it is here that most of body scan related neural activity will occur. But in which manner: how will activity evolve and literally move around, how will it look like in the ""brain scanner""?</p>

<p>Five possibilities come to my mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Experts and laymen will see nothing but a generally increased, enigmatically billowing activity of the cortical homunculus.</p></li>
<li><p>An expert would see some significant patterns, but only vague and hard to communicate.</p></li>
<li><p>Even the layman could see something:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>an overall increased activity of the cortical homunculus with somehow changing peaks of activity (highlights, representing the body region the attentional focus is currently on)</p></li>
<li><p>a mostly ""dark"" cortical homunculus with a wandering spotlight of activity </p></li>
<li><p>a mostly dark cortical homunculus with a fading-in/fading-out spotlight every now and then</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Which of these possibilities do you - as a brain and/or brain-imaging expert - consider the most probable one? Other possibilities are welcome!</p>

<p>And of course hints to studies where this question has been experimentally attacked.</p>

<p>(I found one <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/9/6/751/1664700/Neural-correlates-of-mindfulness-meditation"" rel=""noreferrer"">study</a> but didn't delve deeper into it: there are too few images in it.)</p>

</ol>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic,    subconscious </li>
  <li>System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical,    calculating, conscious</li>
  </ul>

<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness"">Mindfulness</a> is defined on Wikipedia as follows:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mindfulness is ""the intentional, accepting and non-judgmental focus of
  one's attention on the emotions, thoughts and sensations occurring in
  the present moment"", which can be trained by meditational practices.</p>

  of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully

"Why are counsellors not supposed to give advice or lead the client? Is it possible for a counsellor not to be leading?","<p>I’ve taken a course on counselling psychology and have attended a counselling sessions myself. All the literature I’ve read has said counsellors should not give advice. My question is why is this possible? </p>

<p>I know when talking to a counsellor they think they’re being self-empowering by not “giving advice” or asking leading questions, but I don’t believe it’s possible to have a neutral conversation with someone where they have no effect over you. In a sense, is the way councillors/psychologists speaking to people actually underhanded as they try to dress-up advice as non-advice? I know at advance stages of counselling the counsellor is supposed to challenge the client’s incongruent views. Which views the councillor challenges are up to him, so that’s exerting change on the client. Wouldn't it be better for a councillor to clearly say what he thinks instead of trying to trick a client into thinking they came up with the idea?
For example if a counsellor says “you’ve listed many bad qualities about your girlfriend” while this may be a fact, the councillor is trying to steer you in a certain direction. Wouldn’t it be more honest to say “you’ve listed many bad qualities about your girlfriend, maybe you should breakup with her?” even though the breaking up bit is considered advice?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I think I've finally found the words to express what I'm thinking. I know councilors are not supposed to give advice and act in a very ""neutral way"" as to allow the client to sort things out for them self, as this is seen as self empowering. It's been my observation that councilors (inadvertently) just find ways to mask what they are asserting as a question or a seemingly neutral statement. For example, client ""my neighbor was parked in my drive way and it made me late for work"", councilor ""I could see how that would make a person mad"" (this implies the correct response would be mad). client: ""my date cancelled on me"", councilor ""do you feel let down?"" (this is planting the idea in his head). Now wouldn't it be better if the councilor gave advice like ""there are plenty of fish in the sea"". I know councilors are not trained to ask leading questions or make leading comments, but as humans, I believe it is inevitable to do this, and it's much better just to say something directly than to (subconsciously) think up a way to hint at it.</p>

"The ""Backwards Bike"" and implications for how we think","<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's a video of a guy learning to ride a ""backwards bike""</a>, if you turn the handles left, then the wheel goes right. It took the guy forever to learn to ride a backward bike. He kept remarking that ""any disturbance would make is brain switch back to the old 'normal' bike control system"". </p>

<p>Later in the video, he did something amazing. He tried to ride a normal bike and apparently no longer could. Then after about 20 minutes worth of trying and failing utterly, suddenly the understanding of a normal bike snapped back into his mind, and in the span of about 30 seconds he could ride the bike easily. How did that sudden change happen? What state was his mind in that he couldn't reach back to the old system? And then what suddenly happened so that he was able to?</p>

<p>More generally, is there any research in this area? I think it would be awesome to hook up an EEG to someone and watch as they make this mental leap from one control system to another. Has this ever been done?</p>

<p>Note here (because there appears to be some confusion) that I'm not so much interested in brain plasticity or negative transfer. Those are interesting in their own right, but for this question I'm most interested in the ""switch back"" phenomenon. Why was the individual somehow blocked from reaching the normal bike control system, and how did this barrier so suddenly and so drastically disappear? Apparently there are now two systems in his brain, and they are somehow quarantined from one another. What mechanism makes this possible? And why would such a mechanism be beneficial?</p>

<p>I realize now that I have experienced the same phenomenon with language. I studied Spanish in high school and was pretty good at it. But after learning Japanese it's difficult to ""jump"" back into Spanish speaking mode. And if I'm in Spanish speaking mode it's hard to jump back to Spanish.</p>

"Why does ""six months"" seem like a ""long time"" even when it isn't?","<p><strong>Background</strong>: I had a (rental) property  that I was planning to put up for sale. Then I ""changed my mind"" and said that I wanted to wait for the current year's appreciation, and sell in ""six months"" (from the time our conversation took place in early March). The realtor promised to get back to me in six months. That would have been September.</p>

<p>I called back the realtor almost two months later. He was surprised to hear from me so soon. He said,"" I thought you wanted to sell in ""six months."" I said, yes, but we need three months' lead time. Two months to give the tenant 60 days' notice (May and June), under Oregon law, and one month to clean up the place (July). That would give us a target sale date of August (instead of September, originally). OK, I had moved up the sale date one month, but the real issue was three months' lead time.</p>

<p>I had a similar conversation with the property manager, who notified the tenant in March when I first intended to sell, then assured her that this would not happen for a ""long time."" Now we have to tell the tenant that the notice is ""imminent.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many variations occur, but scintillating scotoma usually begins as a spot of flickering light near or in the center of the visual field, which prevents vision within the scotoma area. The affected area flickers but is not dark. It then gradually expands outward from the initial spot. Vision remains normal beyond the borders of the expanding scotoma(s), with objects melting into the scotoma area background similarly to the physiological blind spot, which means that objects may be seen better by not looking directly at them in the early stages when the spot is in or near the center. </p>
  
  <p>[...]The visual anomaly results from abnormal functioning of portions of the occipital cortex at the back of the brain, not in the eyes nor any component thereof, such as the retinas.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RMyT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a> This is a different disease from retinal migraine, which is monocular (only one eye).</p>

  <p>Symptoms typically appear gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and generally last fewer than 60 minutes, leading to the headache in classic migraine with aura, or resolving without consequence in acephalgic migraine. Many migraine sufferers change from scintillating scotoma as a prodrome to migraine to scintillating scotoma without migraine. Typically the scotoma resolves spontaneously within the stated time frame, leaving no subsequent symptoms, though some report fatigue, nausea, and dizziness as sequelae.</p>

"Averaging a linear or nonlinear function treatment","<p>In a hypothetical PET study, my sample consists of a clinical population which exhibit brain hypermetabolism. I divide my sample into two homogenous groups. One receives a treatment whereas the other does not (control). My analysis is a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design with treatment  (receive treatment, doesn't receive treatment) as the between groups factor and treatment status (pretest, postest) as the within-subjects factor.</p>

<p>The treatment group complete a cognitive task which is expected to reduce the brain hypermetabolism to almost nothing but return to elevated hypermetabolism in up to 2 minutes. In other words, the cognitive task reduces the activity for a short amount of time but slowly the brain hypermetabolism will return to the elevated levels that distinguish our clinical sample. It is not known whether this regression to pretreatment levels will be linear or non linear.</p>

<p>In my design I compare group averages in brain hypermetabolism in the treatment vs. control group pretest and posttest. There should be no difference in our control group in the pretest and posttest stages, but there should be a significant difference in the treatment group.</p>

<p>My question is, is there a standard procedure for obtaining group averages on a linear function? If we know that the brain hypermetabolism returns in &lt;2 minutes, should we average the value of the line across 2 minutes? 1 minute? At the participant level? At the group level?</p>

<p>Alternatively, instead of working out an average, should one calculate the slope of the lines in treatment vs. non-treatment conditions and compare these?</p>

I read somewhere that people often assume that mental health issues do not get better, and that a person ends up seeing a psychiatrist forever. So I was wondering if there was a way to compare treatments for medical vs psychological issues. </p>

<p>Like let's say we pick 10 common physical illnesses and 10 common psychological illnesses. And then look at best treatments for each. For instance, assume sinus infections are the top physical illness and depression is the most common mental illness. Further assume that the best treatment for depression is CBT, and for sinus infection is nasal corticosteroids. How would I go about comparing the effectiveness of  corticosteroids for sinus infections versus CBT for depression? Is there a particular number, some effect size, or something else that I can take from one research study and compare it to the other?</p>

<p>Thanks for help or clarification. </p>

"Intrinsic relevance of ERP polarity: 'negativity' vs 'positivity'","<p>I know that polarity in a EEG signal is arbitrary, and a matter of convention, as clearly explained in <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/16574/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-peak-polarity-in-eeg-data"">this past question</a>.</p>

<p>However, assuming said conventions are well-followed, I wonder whether is there any intrinsic meaning at all to a particular ERP/component being described (as they often are in the literature) as either a <em>positivity</em> or a <em>negativity</em>? </p>

<p>It seems indeed that this aspect (voltage polarity) is a salient-enough feature of EEG components, that they are metonymically referred to by this very feature, e.g. ""this positivity is associated with cognitive process X"", as if the component's sign was just as important as its latency and absolute-value amplitude (which are of course not arbitrary, and clearly meaningful).</p>

<p>Some papers (e.g. <a href=""https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/089892905774597290"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Koelsch et al 2005</a>) seem to suggest that some cognitive tasks (e.g. perceiving some deviance in a stimulus) is only associated with one specific polarity, in this case negative:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(..)it is also possible that any kind of <strong>deviance-related negativity</strong>
  has an effect on linguistic syntax processing.</p>

<p>To sum up: is there any intrinsic meaning at all to be found in a ERP's polarity?</p>

<p>When empathising, you can actually feel the emotions the client is feeling, and you need to be able to <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/a/19301"">compartmentalise</a> these feelings by recognising that they are not yours to own.

<blockquote>
  <p>With empathy, you will feel their stress, anxiety, and anger in your body. You might feel their pain emotionally and physically. If you let these emotions sit in your body, your body and mind can be emotionally hijacked.</p>
  
  <p>Unbridled empathy can lead to concentrations of the stress hormone cortisol, making it difficult to release the emotions. Taking on other people’s feelings so that you live their experience can make you susceptible to feelings of depression or hopelessness.</p>

<p>I interpreted this as saying: a neuron had a greater effect on a downstream neuron because of tDCS, which ultimately lead to more MEP's.</p>

<p>I was confused by the fact that the neuron is an <em>afferent</em> neuron. Since efferent neurons relay signal to muscles I figured the activity of efferent neurons would be more important in the generation of MEP's. Is this not the case? </p>

"Yes-No question in 2AFC staircase test","<p>I understand the task of a 2AFC test is to select one of the two stimuli presented (e.g. the stronger one), whereas in Yes-No test there is only one stimulus presented. But is it ok to ask a Yes-No question (e.g. was there a difference between A and B?) in a test with 2 stimuli? and can it still be called a 2AFC test? (Or is it valid to do Yes-No test with two stimuli?)</p>

<p>I am asking this with regard to a threshold test using a 2AFC transformed staircase  (2 down 1 up procedure). It'd be a lot easier for subject to respond whether there was a perceivable difference between two stimuli rather than having to choose the stronger one. As my main interest is to see just noticeable difference, which is stronger is not of a concern. However, I guess there must be a specific reason why one stimulus has to be chosen over the other in a 2AFC test (re bias and sensitivity?). And I wonder what would be the implication of using a Yes-No question instead.</p>

"Amount of noise in (the recognisable definition of) an ERP","<p>As I understand it, ERPs can be reliably identified only after the noise (inherent to EEG signals, regardless of the task used to evoke the response) has been largely removed, which is done by averaging across multiple repetitions. The ERP in that case is a recognisable-enough pattern in the EEG signal that it can be reliably pointed out in a graph of the averaged trials, for several electrodes, for instance:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8EZkB.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8EZkB.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Question #1: if the averaging method is trustworthy enough - assuming enough-many reptitions - to make noise components cancel each other out while leaving reliable effects still in, then why are other <em>non-zero</em> sections of (ripples in) the EEG signal also not defined as ERPs, with some attached meaning (e.g. response to some cognitive task), since they have, after all, survived the same denoising procedure? 
It would make sense to trust the EEG signal to really not reflect any effect when the intercept (y) is zero. However, in most EEG plots this seems to (very conveniently!) only happen at the t=0 point. The signal then becomes non-zero but only part of is acknowledged as an ERP, whereas the rest seems to be considered noise even though the plotted signal has been denoised.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Question #2: why do such ERP plots - obtained by averaging across repetitions and across subjects - never (in my experience) show a confidence band to show the extent of that cross-repetition/-subject variability? Would that information not be of interest?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dr Karin Hammarberg ... said that while most
  children are born healthy, <strong>large studies of parental age were starting
  to show higher rates of birth defects and autism in children born to
  men over 40</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>A recent review of paternal age published in the Asian Journal of
  Andrology said an American study of 132,000 men found children of
  those over 45 were nearly six times more likely to have an autism
  spectrum disorder compared to children born to men under 30.</p>
  
  <p>The review also pointed to a Dutch study of 60,000 births which found
  children born to men over 40 were three times more likely to have
  autism and a US study of 5 million births which showed men over 50 had
  a 15 per cent higher chance of having a baby with birth defects
  including congenital heart disease and cleft palates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, my first thought was that the age of the father must be highly correlated with the age of the mother. Thus, an alternative explanation is that the higher prevalence of birth defects for older fathers is due to the fact that older fathers typically have babies with older mothers. Of course, the same argument could be made for the reported higher prevalence of birth defects in older mothers (i.e., they're having babies with older fathers).</p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li>To what extent is paternal age associated with prevalence of birth defects after controlling for maternal age?</li>

However I don't want to upset my team or do any lasting damage.</p>

<p>Some random ideas that have come to mind include:
- Taking a minute to talk about historical atrocities
- Having food at the session, but not letting anyone eat</p>

<p>If I go down this road, what would be a good decompression method to get people back in to a positive mindset at the end?</p>

"At what age do children typically reach adult reading speed?","<p>A kid who just started to read puts a lot of effort in processing sentences. These efforts will decrease as he/she gets older and, at some point (around 12, 15?), will read as fast as an adult.</p>

<p>My guess is that it should depend on each individual (particular pleasure/difficulty to read, variable exposition to written material), but there should be an average measure.

"Psychological explanation for perceptions of the Loch Ness monster","<p>I previously asked about whether <strong>physics could explain the occurrences of the rogue waves which could psychology explain the eyewitnesses' perceptions of the Loch Ness monster?</strong> (The <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/90372/is-optical-illusion-responsible-for-loch-ness-monster"">Physics.SE question</a> has been put on hold because not all of it is about physics.)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rL4cC.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>So the question:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is the psychological explanation for reports of Loch Ness monster?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Could it be related to the dark, undulating pattern under the crests of the white-caps?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> You are walking along a country lane, when a sudden motion on the water catches your eye. Followed by the sound of a crashing wave. Within seconds, only ripples remain on the surface. You remember the image as shown above. It could be a white-cap on a wave, but everyone who has been to the beach knows that waves come in one-after-another, and there are no other waves, so it can't be a wave. You notice the darker area under the white-cap and realize the only possible explanation is: you have just seen a large animal dive under the surface. Like a sounding whale. (Or monster?).</p>

<p>Loch Ness is located near a major fault line that has seismic activity. Physicists can explain that a wave created by seismic activity is a rogue wave or tsunami. They can also explain why the wave does not reach shore and, why the area under the white-cap is always darker.</p>

<p>So, could a collaboration between physics and psychology show this illusion is a possible explanation for Nessi?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the psychodynamic perspective, behavior is driven, or
  motivated, by powerful inner forces. In this view, human actions stem
  from inherited instincts, biological drives, and attempts to resolve
  conflicts between personal needs and society’s demands. Deprivation
  states, physiological arousal, and conflicts provide the power for
  behavior just as coal fuels a steam locomotive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm wondering if these two lists ""match up."" In other words:</p>

<ul>
<li>inherited instincts — deprivation states </li>
<li>biological drives — physiological arousal </li>
<li>attempts to resolve conflicts between personal needs and society’s demands — conflicts</li>
</ul>

<p>By ""match up, I mean are they related as elements are in the following example:</p>

<p>Freud's structural model of the psyche includes the id, the ego, and the superego, which relate to instinctual drives, the need to develop and maintain an organized and realistic perception of the world, and the internalization of cultural rules, respectively.</p>

"Is ignoring messages a learned behavior?","<p>As someone that works troubleshooting stuff, I've seen a surprising amount of people that, when confronted with messages, warnings and errors, tend to seek help fast (or early in the process) in the hope someone will understand what their problem is, rather than reading the error and searching directly for a solution, or solving what they did wrong independently. To illustrate this, consider an example (I'm not sure if this captures the <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/qi#Noun"" rel=""nofollow"">qi</a> of the problem, but here it goes):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>User $A$ performs a certain action that leads to the current error/warning/message:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Error: your input was greater than two, please use $X$ tool when input is greater than two.</p>

<li>User tries again until frustrated.</li>
<li>User tries again until frustrated and seeks help.</li>
<li>User tries again until frustrated, seeks help and doesn't get it. The user either figures out the message or just leaves things as they are.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question: why do endings <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> happen? Is the message too difficult for some people to understand, or do they believe they are not wrong and the tool should do what they want or the message should be more calling (IN CAPS or <strong>bold</strong>)? Do people ignore seemingly perfectly crafted messages? Or have we learned to ignore them, given all the <em>media</em> with which we are bombarded?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We here summarize results from a series of clinical studies suggesting that childhood trauma in humans is associated with sensitization of the neuroendocrine stress response, glucocorticoid resistance, increased central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) activity, immune activation, and reduced hippocampal volume, closely paralleling several of the neuroendocrine features of depression. <strong>Neuroendocrine changes secondary to early-life stress likely reflect risk to develop depression in response to stress</strong>, potentially due to failure of a connected neural circuitry implicated in emotional, neuroendocrine and autonomic control to compensate in response to challenge.</p>

<p>I'm interested in what <em>psychological</em> groundwork might be also laid by early life stress such as childhood illness, also contributing to the development of mental health conditions. For example, I've read of cases where chronic childhood pain may cause the patient to have an unhealthily high acceptance (not tolerance) of stress as an adult, meaning they persist in stressful situations where others would not. They've learned that pain is to be accepted and worked through to an extent beyond which many would think reasonable, and this may lead to stress related illness.</p>

"Can scientific evidence support concepts of the soul?","<p>In some spiritual premises, the <strong>soul</strong> is said to belong to the Almighty.</p>

"Why is the WCST a test of task switching rather than cognitive shifting?","<p>Why is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Card_Sorting_Test"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WCST</a> a test of task switching rather than cognitive shifting?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_switching_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Task switching</a> allows a person to rapidly and efficiently adapt to
  different situations. It is often studied by cognitive and
  experimental psychologists, and can be tested experimentally using
  tasks like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_shifting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cognitive shifting</a> is the mental process of consciously redirecting
  one's attention from one fixation to another. In contrast, if this
  process happened unconsciously, then it is referred to as task
  switching. Both are forms of cognitive flexibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I'm not understanding is, given e.g. the following screen</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zREJB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zREJB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>the participant is not <em>consciously</em> redirecting themselves? It seems quite easy to fulfill the task consciously, but its meant to be a measure of unconscious flexibility.</p>

<p>To state the obvious, and how to do so deliberately: work out what properties the card has (colour, shape, number); then work out what these are (red, cross, two); then match these to the properties of another card (one red circle, four yellow crosses, two green stars) and try each of these until you get the right answer.</p>

<p>Surely it can be done consciously, then?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDITED to add that I took this test on a site, and, with the test in front of me had to sit it twice before realizing there were three, not two, card properties. Incidentally, my score was horrific. Baffling!</p>

<p>According to the relief theory, what are we relieved about?</p>

<p>Could it be that the question invokes a feeling of stress when we don't know the answer? Do we fear that we shall have to expend a lot of energy in trying to work out the solution? Is it stressful having a question put to us which we can't answer? (Just like starting a new job where we don't know what we're doing?)</p>

<p>Or does the stress come from the fear that we will look stupid for being unknowledgeable about the answer to the question?</p>

<p>Why are we then relieved by the answer? Is it because we are relieved that we don't have to expend new energy storing new information because we the information is already so obvious? (But this might not make sense as we do tend store jokes.) But we do not have to alter any of our existing information.</p>

<p>Or does the relief come from finding out that the questioner does not have superior knowledege to ourselves. And we laugh at how idiotic this person is. Like shadenfrauder. </p>

"Are IQ tests ""beatable""?","<p>I have been watching a lot of Jordan Peterson's videos on youtube recently. One of his themes is, that IQ is among the best studied metrics, with high predictability, validity and is generally believed to be a very real thing in psychology. He also mentions, that IQ can not be improved or trained.</p>

<p>My question is, whether I could improve my IQ (by that I mean the test score, not general intelligence), by simply studying for it, trying to learn about the different types of questions and how they are generally solved and by simply doing a bunch of tests and memorizing how to solve questions.</p>

<p>I have done a few IQ tests online and at the beginning, I was very confused about everything, like from which direction to read the boxes and stuff like that. After doing a couple and seeing how it is done and reading explanations about the different questions I feel, that I am doing a lot better now.</p>

<p>Similar to that, I was on a job interview once, where they asked riddles, presumably in order to assess IQ, without doing an IQ test.</p>

<p>I knew some of the riddles and simply answered some of them by sheer memory.</p>

<p>Isn't it possible to increase your test score of an IQ test by simply studying? And if you can, what makes the tests really valid? And finally, if IQ was such a high predictor of intelligence, wouldn't most job interviews be geared towards assessing your IQ in a legal manner?</p>

"Understanding the concept behind d-prime","<p>I know that sensitivity (d') is typically calculated as follows:</p>

<p>d' = z(Hit Rates) - z (False Alarm Rates)</p>

<p>I understand this as the idea is to standardize both distributions, and to then calculate the z-score, which allows to calculate a distance within the same scale so to say.</p>

<p>What is however very confusing to me is the visualization of the process.
I am using the following plots from <a href=""https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/college-les/psych/vision-laboratory/sdtintro.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">these slides</a>:</p>

<p>(1) As in the plot above, d' is <em>always</em> depicted as the difference of the means of the two distributions (of signal and noise, for instance). Say however that I find in my data that the Hit rate (or Hit probability) is 0.8 - I would think that now, I would need to find z(Hit = 0.8), would this not be to the right of the mean:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1ehu.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1ehu.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>(2) In addition, I am am uncertain about the arrows associated with Z(CR) and Z(H) on panel A above. </p>

<p>For one, in my opinion, CR includes the entire area before the criterion. The arrow, however, associates Z(CR) with only the distance mean-criterion - why? </p>

<p>Then, if Z(X) refers to the cumulative probability density of variable X, Z(X) should be the entire density up to X. 
In the case of Z(CR) in panel A,however, it seems that it is only the part from the mean of the noise distribution to criterion. So what does then the Z(..) notation mean in this context?</p>

"Does individual work performance follow a Paretian distribution?","<p>O'Boyle and Aguinis (2012) wrote a paper arguing that individual job performance follows a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution"">Paretian distribution</a>  rather than a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"">normal distribution</a> (put simply, a very long tail to the right, rather than a bell-shape).
The abstract was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We revisit a long-held assumption in human resource management,
  organizational behavior, and industrial and organizational psychology
  that individual performance follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution.
  We conducted 5 studies involving 198 samples including 633,263 researchers, entertainers, politicians, and amateur and professional
  athletes. Results are remarkably consistent across industries, types
  of jobs, types of performance measures, and time frames and indicate
  that individual performance is not normally distributed—instead, it
  follows a Paretian (power law) distribution. Assuming normality of
  individual performance can lead to misspecified theories and
  misleading practices. Thus, our results have implications for all
  theories and applications that directly or indirectly address the
  performance of individual workers including performance measurement
  and management, utility analysis in preemployment testing and training
  and development, personnel selec- tion, leadership, and the prediction
  of performance, among others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Question</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are they correct in claiming that most researchers assume that individual job performance is normally distributed?</li>
<li>Are they correct in claiming that the Paretian distribution provides a better fit to individual job performance than the normal distribution?</li>

"Effect of words highlighting on reading comprehension","<p>I'm interested if there are studies dealing with text understanding and POS (part of speech) coloring, or coloring syntactic/semantic information. The studies should solve the questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Which combination of colors improve/deteriorate understanding and reading of texts?</p></li>
<li><p>How many colors should be in the scheme for positive/negative effects on reading and understanding of text? Which POSs should be preferably colored?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there types of people who are more efficient with/without coloring?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that a few colors with good combination could be beneficial. <strong>Has somebody conducted research to test the effect of highlighting on reading comprehension</strong>?</p>

<p>A few events inspired me in the following order:</p>

<ol>
<li>I started learning Chinese and their characters seem to have positive effect on my comprehension.</li>
<li>I've read a NL (natural language) article in English in a programming editor. I was used to colors for various programming languages.</li>
<li>I searched the Internet and found the article <a href=""http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/index.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">A case against syntax highlighting</a> but don't agree with all the author's arguments or opinions. When you have only a few carefully chosen colors it's beneficial for programming so maybe could be for NL comprehension as well. A few colors could underline the basic thought and help to draw attention of the reader. When I read a scientific text for which I have not passion I'm often bored because don't know where it directs and colors and images help me a lot to concentrate and skimming over the basic thoughts could help with decision if it has sense to read it at all. This does not hold for fiction and poetry where we read for pleasure rather than getting information.</li>

<p>I used to do such things using <a href=""http://www.empirisoft.com/medialab.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MediaLab</a> which unfortunately is proprietary software. However, implementing items and questionnaires was easy. You could program a simple html page (even using variables and placeholders) using html forms and MediaLab would present this page using ie engine in fullscreen and collect the responses. Those responses could then be used or handed over to DirectRT for response time experiments.</p>

"Sleep vs. Trance","<p>I've been recently reading about hypnosis and I'm asking this question because I've had certain personal experiences that makes me confuse the term Trance with just simple sleep. </p>

<p>I'm not a fan of Heavy Metal music, but I sometimes listen to it because it somehow calms me down and I usually listen to music while wearing my big uncomfortable headphone, sitting in my chair which is also very uncomfortable and having my legs resting on my desk. When I listen to music, I almost always start to imagine things, for example I sometimes try to imagine a trip to a certain place, or I try to make up a music video for that tune in my mind. The reason why I mentioned Heavy Metal is that, when I listen to that kind of music in that uncomfortable position, I fell asleep in a way that I can still hear the music and this goes on until the whole album is finished and when I wake up I feel really really fresh like my brain has been fully reset. However, this feeling does not happen when I just go to bed or I just get some rest. </p>

<p>What I have read about hypnosis suggests a similar condition, which is when someone is between being conscious and unconscious (or I can't describe it well). However, the videos I have seen about it emphasis on comfort. Would this be (what's I'm experiencing) a kind of trance or hypnosis, or it is just a normal nap? </p>

<p>And would there be any reason why a music full of violence, yelling, and rough sounds would calm down the brain and put it into a semi-conscious state and then makes it very refreshed afterwards? </p>

"Link between visual-spatial + verbal working memory and intelligence/academic achievement?","<p>What is the link between someone's visual and spatial working memory, their verbal working memory, and different types of cognitive abilities or tasks? More specifically, intelligence tests (WAIS, Stanford Binet, etc.) and would this relate to educational outcomes in different fields (maybe SAT scores, graduation rates in different fields, and GPA, etc.)? Is there a relationship between these variables? Some <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/07/140708092142.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cite</a> working memory as the most important predictor of early academic success. </p>

<p>Somebody who has a strong verbal working memory may generally perform well on other types of verbal tasks included on intelligence tests: vocabulary, verbal reasoning, analogies, antynoms, etc. And be better suited to learn about fields such as literature, biology, foreign languages, etc. because there is a lot of linguistic mastery required in these disciplines.</p>

<p>Or on the other hand, if somebody has a strong visual-spatial working memory they may generally perform well on intelligence tests on other types of visual-spatial tasks that also recruit reasoning ability and long-term memory. And would be better suited to learning about fields such as physics, mathematics, art, architecture, etc. because there is more of a visual-spatial component in these disciplines.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many other factors that affect ability and learning. Working memory would be a small determinant but a determinant nonetheless. Furthermore, there is <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.357.1874&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">research</a> which shows a link between spatial ability and achievement in STEM subjects up to graduate level studies for example. </p>

<p>Cognitive abilities from both of these broad areas (overall visual-spatial and verbal ability) certainly overlap highly — same with other types of reasoning abilities such as numerical and logical. However, I assume each area has a bias as to what types of cognitive abilities are used more. </p>

<p>There seems to be a very strong correlation between the two types of working memory or short-term memory. That's what I wanted to find out mainly: <strong>What is the relationship between the different types of working memory or short-term memory and other types of reasoning abilities (non-working memory reasoning tasks including verbal ability, numerical, spatial, etc.)? Are the different measures of short-term and working memory measuring approximately the same thing?</strong> </p>

<p>How common is the occurance of individuals that have poor verbal working memory and high verbal reasoning scores on intelligence tests for example? How about for visual-spatial working memory and non-working memory visual-spatial scores on intelligence tests?</p>

<p>I've read a few papers on this subject but am unsure of the answer.   </p>

<p>Hopefully, someone can point me in the right direction. Thanks.</p>

But Hawkins made some claims about artificial neural networks that seem (to me) untenable today, only 13 years later. He gives the impression that artificial neural networks are in principle not capable of what he calls invariant representations and hierarchical storage of patterns (p. 70 ff).</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did he just not (fore)see the development of deep learning which started off at the latest in 2005 (see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#History"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">History of deep learning</a>) and which includes both invariant and hierarchical representations?</p></li>
<li><p>Or are his retentions against artifical neural networks (including deep learning) justified, and the invariant and hierarchical representations of deep learning are uncompetitive to those of biological networks, i.e. the neocortex? In which respect, then?</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>About invariant and hierarchical representations (in my words and understanding):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An invariant representation - e.g. of a face - is one, that is independent of and thus invariant with respect to contingent aspects of the image of the face having to do with distance, viewing angle, lighting conditions and the like.</p></li>
<li><p>It is the representation in the highest layer of a hierarchy of representations with local geometric features being represented in the lowest layer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This describes superficially both deep learning and cortical architectures. But maybe there are details of implementation/realisation that make the one significantly and genuinely more efficient than the other, e.g. cortical columns which seem not to be present in deep learning architectures, do they?</p>

"Discovery Learning vs. Inductive Learning vs. Active Learning vs. Engaged Learning","<p><strong>Discovery learning</strong>: Novak and Cañas (2008) define discovery learning as a type of learning in which the ""individual discerns patterns or regularities in events or objects and recognizes these as the same regularities labeled by older persons with words or symbols. So, the attributes of concepts are identified autonomously by the learner. This is a phenomenal ability that is part of the evolutionary heritage of all normal human beings"" (p. 3). They exemplify that the first concepts ""are acquired by children during the ages of birth to 3 years, when they recognize regularities in the world around them and begin to identify language labels or symbols for these regularities. ... This early learning of concepts is primarily a discovery learning process.""</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bruyckere, Kirschner, and Hulshof (2015) explain that ""discovery learning"", ""which is sometimes also referred to as <strong>self-discovery</strong> or <strong>active learning</strong>, was launched by Jerome Bruner in the 1960s. According to Bruner, education needs to be organized in such a way that the learner interacts with the material to be learned in an active and self-investigatory manner. It is intended that the child should learn to think and solve problems independently. This corresponds closely with the arguments of Piaget, who stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely (Piaget, p. 715)</p>

<li><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/Xduzwk04l2E"">How to hack your todo list</a> which also contains some parts from the above mentioned book.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What this author suggests is writing down your tasks instead of keeping it in your prefrontal cortex, therefore you'll be more free to think about task at hand. I think I've read the book long time ago and there is some research mentioned (as in most books alike). </p>

<p>Except for complex tasks that need to be broken down, I almost never had the benefit of writing task to a to do list. I actually found it terrible that my brain seemed to partially forget things while relying on the list [ which I didn't bring with me or I was in the hurry and forgot to look into my phone app]. I don't know if I was biased by the content of the book or if there is some science behind forgetting tasks that you jot down on the piece of paper. </p>

<p>I understand that some people have a more complex day than me and need todo list for not-so-related things, but I find it somewhat scary that so many people so easily rely on something else remembering things for them.</p>

<p>I tried using lists because I was afraid I'll forget what I need to do. When it started bothering me, I decided not to write anything but longer grocery lists. And it's interesting how my brain started remembering things and recalling them exactly when I need them. I didn't feel my brain was cluttered, because I remembered tasks at the right time and right place[ I never thought about grocery list during working hours and vice versa].</p>

<p><strong>I don't know it there is any well known research behind this ""write things down to unclutter your brain""-thing, or it all boils down to poor memory or lack of commitment to remember something important ?</strong></p>

<p>Side question, but related :  is it even possible to quickly forget the task and leave it written on the piece of paper ? </p>

"What is the difference between creators of derivative works of art and original creators?","<p>I like to write and am a frequent user on writers.stackexchange.com. Many questions there and in other writing or art related communities ask a variation of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to use the setting / characters / names / story of this or that work of fiction to create my own. May I legally do so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While books and movies inspire the want to be creative in me, I have never felt inclined to use the world or characters or plot of another for my own narratives or create fan fiction. When I read a question like the one quoted above, I always think: ""Why don't you just invent your own world, characters, and story? Don't you have a story <em>inside you</em> that needs to be told ?!?""</p>

<p>Reading those kind of questions makes me wonder what the difference is between creators of derivative works and creators of orginal art.</p>

<p>Sure, everyone is inspired by what they read in books or see in movies, and no one comes up with a tale to tell from a vacuum. Wanting to tell a story you have made up is not per se superior to wanting to tell a (variation of a) story you have read, and many derivative works are better written and more entertaining than their originals. Nevertheless I somehow feel that there is a difference – in motivation, goals, maybe personality.</p>

<p>You could, for example, conceive of creativity as a continuum from the purely derivative to the purely original, with different creators having more or less original ideas. This is a common concept, and we generally admire original creators more, because we feel they have more creative ""genius"".</p>

<p>Or you could take another common perspective and understand artists as being more or less mentally disordered, and originality being a result of the intensity of the artist's depression, schizophrenia or borderline personality, and art being an ""outlet"" or a method of self-reflection or some other way for them to deal with their dysfunction.</p>

<p>There are other ways to interpret the difference. Looking at myself, for example, no matter if my inspiration was life or art, what made me want to write (or make movies or draw) was always a feeling of <em>lack:</em> that something was missing from the story I read, that something about how the story was told left me unsatisfied, because, no matter how touching, that story was never truly about <em>me</em>, never completely told of what concerned <em>me</em>. I don't know how you would characterize this type of motivation to create. Maybe I'm so self-absorbed and egocentric that I cannot care about the creations of others, while those wanting to <em>contribute</em> to another's invention are more socially competent, more collaboratively inclined, even more warm and caring.</p>

<h3>What is the difference – in ability or personality – between creators of derivative works and those inventing their own new worlds and characters and stories?</h3>

<li>$1948$ - Skinner performs experiments on rats. </li>
</ul>

<p>The first is that the timeline is very stretched out. Skinner invented the box and then it took him 17-18 years to publish his famous studies. What experiments was he performing with his box that weren't as groundbreaking in all those years when his groundbreaking results features a very basic setup?</p>

<p>The second is that Skinner <a href=""http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar04/skinner.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">apparently</a> swapped from rats to pigeons in his experiments because they lived longer, learnt faster and were easier to handle yet the according to my timeline the rats experiment took place after the pigeon one (or perhaps not and he just published them in that order).</p>

<p>Logically, I assume it would be yes because you are more aware about your emotions and hence more likely to notice that you are experiencing the emotion. Have there been any conclusive studies done on this subject?</p>

<p>I don't know much about linguistics but if, say, a certain isolated tribe has not come up with a word for ""happiness"", would they ever feel happiness in the same way that we do, or feel it less frequently?</p>

<p>I'm not asking how the brain <em>stores</em> representations of objects, as that's clearly up for debate. But how does the brain <em>structure</em> its internal representation of 3D visual data?</p>

<p>It's almost definitely not in some pixel-based format, as can be shown by simply visualizing an object of some sort, and then zooming in mentally on some detail and noticing the image retains its sharpness. It's probably not breaking down objects into geometric shapes either, because at least I personally don't visualize my friends as stick figures. It could be a <a href=""http://searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com/definition/vector-graphics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vector format</a>, but then it should be easier to visualize complex shapes that are mathematically simple, like this one:</p>

"Does the meta-analytic literature overestimate the relationship between conscientiousness and job performance?","<p>There are quite a few meta-analyses of the relationship between personality and job performance (for a review, see Barrick &amp; Mount, 2012; and specific meta-analyses: Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991; Murray R Barrick, Michael K Mount, &amp; Timothy A Judge, 2001; Hurtz &amp; Donovan, 2000; J. Salgado, 1997; Tett, Jackson, &amp; Rothstein, 1991). </p>

<p>These often come up with raw meta-analytic mean correlations between conscientiousness and job performance of around r = .15.</p>

<p>However, there is a lot of discussion in general at the moment about replicability  and publication bias. In particular, if papers that showed a correlation between personality and job performance, were more likely to be published, then this would inflate the meta-analytic estimate. </p>

<p>Alternatively, there have been quite a few studies of personality and performance with huge sample sizes (10,000+) and these would quite likely be published regardless of the exact results, and they also would have sufficient statistical power to detect even small effects. And for most meta-analyses, large sample size studies get a greater weighting in the estimation process.</p>

They may be insecure about their looks, their (odd) behavior, or may question whether they belong to a group (of friends, colleagues and what not). I quickly looked at some social psychological literature but I could only find that in some cultures people are more self-oriented and in others they are more group-oriented (see the abstract of this <a href=""http://link.springer.com.proxy-ub.rug.nl/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-08120-2_3#page-1"" rel=""noreferrer"">book</a>, I was not able to read more). </p>

"Other emotions relative to angry/happy base emotions","<p>In my layman's experience, I'm vaguely aware there are four base emotions: <strong>happy, sad, afraid/surprised, and angry/disgusted</strong>.<sup><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/new-research-says-there-are-only-four-emotions/283560/"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Some background:  We're training an AI to learn the difference between happy voices and angry voices.  We've had some success, by showing it 200 <strong>angry</strong> audio clips, 200 <strong>happy</strong> audio clips, and 200 <strong>neutral</strong>.  It can now reasonably tell when we're talking pleasantly or confrontationally... but the accuracy could be better.</p>

<p>Our total training dataset is made up of these audio clips: <strong>Happy, angry, neutral, calm, sad, fearful, disgust, and surprised</strong>. I think we can be more accurate by including these emotions.  </p>

<p>But this is the problem:</p>

<p>Happy/angry/neutral span opposite ends of a spectrum; like binary.  It's easy to say:</p>

<pre><code>Happy     1
Neutral   0
Angry    -1
</code></pre>

<p>That's the shape of the data we need to train a neural network to recognize 'Happy'. </p>

<p>So the question would be, is there any 'right answer' on filling in these blanks?  I've given it my best guesses below, but I'm hoping for something more scientific....</p>

<pre><code>Happy     1

<p>I've been told that a diverse team is better than a team less diverse. Of course it depends on the project to be executed, but nevertheless this is what I hear and read about all the time. There are little opposition to this position, maybe because it's politically incorrect?!</p>

"How can machine possibly possess consciousness if computation is a human idea?","<p>Suppose a computer simulates a human brain so that it passes the Turing test.

From my understanding, proponents of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_theory_of_mind"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">computationalism</a> suppose that this simulated brain would have qualia.</p>

<p>The neural network, its state, and the program code are stored on a computer, and can only be observed if someone knows how to use this computer. How a neural network is represented in memory and on disk, depends on data structures, computer architecture, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">endianness</a>, et cetera.</p>

<p>Suppose then that the last human on Earth dies, but the simulation keeps running on the computer. If there is no one in the Universe who understands how this particular computer works, then no one would be able to observe this simulated brain.  In other words, this brain would be impossible to “decode”, and yet it would supposedly still experience qualia.</p>

<p>It follows that if this is the case, then nothing prevents other “invisible” brains from existing.</p>

<p><em>We</em> know that a computer is a computational device, and it is running a complex neural network that corresponds to a human-like mind, but the Universe doesn't “know” it.  It is <em>our</em> interpretation of what is happening. I can't stray from the conclusion that if the premise is true, then there may be different processes that isomorphically correspond to computations, some of which may isomorphically correspond to minds, but we won't know it because we don't see this isomorphism.</p>

<p>Why couldn't processes inside the Sun correspond to some computation (albeit in a non-straightforward way) which corresponds to a mind? By that logic, there could be infinitely many minds, all experiencing some sorts of qualia, “encoded” in different ways in all processes in the world.</p>

<p>Conversely, what if we replace a computer with a man (with a large lifespan) meticulously following the algorithm on paper. Would his computations somehow give rise to consciousness within a brain simulated on paper?</p>

  <p>Common archetypal themes that are expressed in virtually every culture are the hero, the powerful father, the nurturing mother, the witch, the wise old man, the innocent child, and death and rebirth. Two important archetypes that Jung (1951) described are the

"Do we think in language?","<p>Can we think i.e. process the input data without relying on linguistic structures?</p>

<p>All knowledge between human is either spoken or written. When we see something, it contributes towards the construction of properties of the object seen. For example, when I see an image of red apple, I register an object which is an apple with a property of redness.</p>

<p>Now suppose a person comes and cuts the apple into two halves; I am basically witnessing the event of cutting the apple. To make any sense out of the visual, it is necessary to think (or process the input visual) that the apple has been cut. As you can see, this processing required usage of linguistic structures : cut, person, half, etc; these linguistic structures have been employed so as to be able to make a minimally acceptable sense (it is not sufficient to sense that something happened).</p>

<p>What about intuition? When smart people get what they call as 'intuition', is it, in first place, constructed in their mind on linguistic platform? Or its source is something undefinable; only attempts are made to convey the phenomenon/intuition/idea using language?</p>

<p>An equivalent question can be framed as follows: Can every possible human thought be satisfactorily communicated using a given language i.e. a set of words?</p>

<p>The hold-out problem is defined where an agent, for example a land developer, must negotiate with many lot owners and each lot owner must provide their consent in order for a project to proceed. However, since the agents know that their consent is required they can extract a portion of the producer surplus in excess of their opportunity costs. The net effect is that such large-scale projects are underproduced.</p>

<p>There are legal remedies to address this underproduction. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain"">Eminent domain</a> is a legal tool to overcome hold-out problems, however, it does not consider <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"">pareto-efficiency</a>.

<p>To my knowledge, it is established research that the brain 'knows' what emotions you are having by examining their manifestations in the body. This absurd rube-goldbergian wiring can for instance be used to force oneself to become happier (at least temporarily) by smiling for a few minutes.</p>

<p><em>This brings up the question, whether emotions have any identity separate from a cluster of bodily sensations (or even more specifically, muscle contractions) at all.</em></p>

<p>It is certainly true (by introspection for e.g.) that 'negative' emotions are accompanied by muscle contradictions. On the other hand, there are several different 'negative' emotions that can be easily distinguished by the person having the emotion (e.g. shame and fear). Unfortunately I am not able to simply recall the sensations I had when I was ashamed or fearful from memory and compare them, but I would assume you could even tell from the outside, simply by looking at the person afflicted, which of the two emotions they are going through.</p>

"Does mindful meditation inhibit diffuse thinking (aka default mode network), creativity and make studying less effective?","<p>Barbara Oakley's ""Learning how to Learn"" and ""Mindshift"" courses claim that having some break time in which diffuse mode thinking (afaik it's the same as default mode network) is active between study sessions (at least if you acquire knowledge or practice intellectual skills) is important. She says that seemingly unrelated concepts get linked, and the brain figures out what to do with all this new information during diffuse mode. It also boosts creativity. From my own experience diffuse mode also helps me think of ways to use the new information, e.g. to achieve my goals or to study more effectively (maybe it's a part of the ""creativity"" thingy).</p>

<p>Mindful meditation seems to provide multiple benefits for mental health. I wonder if replacing many breaks (aka time when I don't do intellectual work) with meditation is bad because I will not have enough diffuse mode thinking and creativity time.</p>

<p>I've tried 2 types of mindfulness meditation: body scan, during which one sequentially goes over different body parts and listens to the senses in that body part and tries not to think or do anything else; and breathing meditation, during which one focuses on one's breathing and ignores everything else. Just from how I feel during that time, I would say that I am not in diffuse mode during meditation.</p>

<p>What diffuse mode is, citations from A Mind for Numbers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the very beginning of the twenty-first century, neuroscientists have been making profound advances in understanding the two different types of networks that the brain switches between—highly attentive states and more relaxed resting state networks.1 We’ll call the thinking processes related to these two different types of networks the focused mode and diffuse mode</p>
  
  <p>Edward de Bono is the grand master of creativity studies, and his vertical and lateral terminology is roughly analogous to my use of the terms focused and diffuse (de Bono 1970).</p>
  
  <p>Astute readers will notice my mention that the diffuse mode seems to sometimes work in the background while the focused mode is active. However, research findings show that the default-mode network for example (which is just one of the many resting state networks), seems to go quiet when the focused mode is active. So which is it? My sense as an educator and a learner myself is that some nonfocused activities can continue in the background when focused work is taking place, as long as the focused attention is shifted away from the area of interest. In some sense, then, my use of the term diffuse mode might be thought of as “nonfocused mode activities directed toward learning” rather than simply “default-mode network.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UPDATE:
It turns out the the second week has a video on mindfulness and learning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>researchers can sometimes classify meditation techniques into two different types that seem to be fundamentally different. Focused attention and open monitoring.</p>
  
  <p>Focus attention types of meditations such as mantra, sound or chakra meditation appear to help enhance focus mode type thinking, this kind of meditation sometimes seems to make people feel better.</p>
  
  <p>In contrast, open monitoring types of meditation such as, vipassana and mindfulness, appear to improve diffuse imaginative thinking. With open monitoring, we don't just focus on one thing. Instead we keep our attention open to all aspects of experience without judging or becoming attached to our thoughts.</p>
  
  <p>Part of the reason that building your focusing abilities may help make you feel happier. Is that it appears to suppress the diffuse mode, while it builds the focusing mode. So what does all this mean? It means that meditation can have surprisingly different effects, depending on the type. It's all very complex, and researchers are far from sorting everything out yet. In the end, practices that encourage focusing can be a great benefit for learning. But having some daily time where your mind relaxes and wanders freely is also very important, particularly if you want to encourage creativity. <em>From a particular stand point then if you are a meditator you might try to avoid feeling you should always be stirring your thoughts back into focus, If you catch your mind wondering outside meditation sessions.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turns out that some types of meditation happen in diffuse mode and others happen in focused mode. My guess would that guided body scan and breathing meditation are focused. </p>

<p>Also I am not sure what she means saying that diffuse mode meditations may improve diffuse imaginative thinking. Did she just randomly blurt it out meaning trying to say that those types of meditation happen in diffuse mode? Or did she say that meaning that if you practice entering diffuse mode by meditating then your diffuse mode becomes better or you will enter it more often?</p>

<p>Also I think that even during diffuse mode meditations, e.g. listening to body sensations that come to attention (I thnk it's diffuse mode, not 100% sure), you don't get creative and don't link concepts and process knowledge, because you're still thinking about body sensations and nothing else.</p>

"Why is homosexuality considered ""natural""?","<p>Ok, firstly I don't know if this is the right forum to ask this question. </p>

<p>Secondly and most importantly I am an ally and a supporter of the community, its rights and for their equality.</p>

<p>Recently, I met a guy who was a military veteran and did not support the LGBTQ community and we got into a healthy argument. I told him that homosexuality was found everywhere in nature (gave him examples of a lot of animals that reproduce by having sex with the same gender).</p>

<p>But his counter argument was that none of these organisms have sex for pleasure (like humans do)! He went on to say that it was a rudimentary component of sustained growth for an organism's culture to produce progeny and continue growing to avoid extinction and that's why it is is justified in those organisms and he asked me from a purely biological standpoint, if homosexuality in humans was essential to the survival of the species. </p>

<p>Interestingly, I found his argument valid and could not produce a counter argument to it. I said I'll ask people and get back to him on this. So, Is his argument right?</p>

<p>To be objective and fresh, artists would take many 5-min breaks in one painting session. I used to do that too, until I learned a ""strange trick"" from my friend.</p>

<p>Whole trick is to take your painting and just rotate it about 90 or 180 degrees for a moment and look at it. Surprisingly, this gives a fresh (somehow new) perspective at painting.</p>

<p>I would like to ask; why is that?</p>

<p>It seems to me, that somehow brain filters out many informations about images that it knows. When I rotate my image; it is recognized as different (not ""known"").</p>

<p>Any research on described phenomenon?</p>

"Does suppressing a desire make it more powerful?","<p>Based on my minimal knowledge of old Freudian Psychoanalysis, if our drives and urges are not met they become more powerful, even overwhelming, for the individual, perhaps causing them psychological difficulties or even causing them to then project the restriction on others. This sentiment has been echoed many times in different contexts since then and it seems to me that the modern generation operates under the assumption that trying too hard to suppress a desire is unhealthy (sexual liberation, free expression etc). It is often used, for example, as a criticism of religion that attempts to impose rules and boundaries which result in the suppression of urges and even further curiosity simply because it is forbidden. I also see many pop psychology articles about this idea. </p>

<p>My question is: <strong>what empirical evidence exists to support the notion that repressed desires will make them stronger?</strong> Other relevant question that may be of interest: Is it a result of human's natural curiosity? Is it intrinsic to human drive? Is it a form of obsessive-compulsive behavior? What criticism has been leveled against this theory in the Freudian version or any modern interpretations?</p>

"Importance of interactivity in learning","<p>Not sure if this is the right place for this question that I find hard to formulate in the first place...</p>

<p>In a paper, I'd like to argue that interactivity helps to develop an understanding of a thing. This is in context is astronomy, scientists learning about the universe basically. I'd like to argue in favour of interactive data exploration. This is not going to be a psychology paper. To put it bluntly, I'd like to better understand this to write the motivational section, use the proper terms, and have a nice citation I can put at the end of it :)</p>

<p>Let me try to explain what I'm after.</p>

<p>Google Maps analogy:</p>

<p>Interative maps give an overview of the world and then allow the user to zoom in, pan around and look at streetview pics. If this information would be presented in a non-interative way, say a box you can put coordinates in and you get the streetview picture out a minute later, the user would not just be slower, but would not be able to explore and understand the world in the same way that interactive maps allow.</p>

<p>Slider analogy:</p>

<p>Say you have two parameters and an result value that results from it due to some hidden math. If I give you two sliders, you can play around with them and develop a sense for the correlation easily, a child would get an intuition for it. But if I give you a form where you have to type in two numbers and press a button to see the result, it be almost impossible to develop the same level of understanding.</p>

<p>I think that the instantaneous feedback and the ability to 'play' with it, really make it far easier for us to learn.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>

<p>Has there been some study of this kind of learning? Does it have a name? Where would I start to research this? How do I go about arguing that interactivity offers a great benefit to explore, say, a dataset? That interactivity offers more than just the efficency gained from less waiting for results.</p>

"Can human brain neural circuits understand the concept of ""other human beings"" and their motives?","<p>I've read that one of the tests of animal intelligence is whether or not the animal recognizes itself in the mirror or can determine that other animals have motives other than it's own (ex: can deceive the animal).</p>

<p>At the same time I've recently heard the following idea from evolutionary psychology - a human female has ""neural circuits"" that can evaluate and signal the willingness of the male partner to commit long term to her and her offspring. It sounded like this process is entirely subconscious and results in a certain feeling which the woman can consciously act upon. </p>

<p>Additionally, it sounded like some of these circuits have evolved independently of each other, thus capable of leading to conflicting feelings when multiple circuits signal simultaneously.</p>

<p>This made me think - <strong>are ""neural circuits"" really capable of independently processing information in terms of other human being and his/her possible motives?</strong> </p>

<p>OR, do human neural circuits related to social cognition simply operate on concentrations of neuromodulators? In terms of the example above - maybe all these circuits are doing are detecting significant oxytocin spikes, keeping the guard up until these spikes are detected?</p>

"Does thinking out loud negatively affect one's ability to think internally?","<p>I'm a professional programmer, and I also practice math. During both, I constantly talk out loud, even for simple problems. However, when I'm around other people I suppress the talking and I feel like I lose a significant amount of clarity.</p>

<p>My assumption is that speaking out loud provides additional clarity because:</p>

<ol>
<li>You're actually speaking, so you have to utilize more parts of your brain, including to physically move your mouth, which would decrease distraction/increase focus</li>
<li>You're hearing it, again utilizing more parts of your brain since you have to process external auditory signals</li>
</ol>

<p>Whereas, the auditory simulation (essentially virtual stimulus) that the brain provides during silent thought is... not as intense as the real stimulus (speaking and hearing), thus utilizing less of the brain.</p>

<p>My question is <strong>not</strong> about whether thinking out loud helps you figure out a problem. </p>

<p><strong>My question is can long-term frequent thinking out loud have negative effects over one's ability to think internally/silently?</strong> </p>

<p>And if there are negative long term effects can they be corrected in a short time by shifting your thinking back to a silent process?</p>

"Would administering oxytocin in games of deception improve performance?","<p>As well as facilitating parturition, the hormone oxytocin is thought to mediate ""prosocial behaviour"" in mammals. It’s been a while since I have read the literature, but I am aware there is robust evidence that oxytocin mediates social bonding and pair bond formation. Acute administration of oxytocin can also increase social cognition such as <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-010-1780-4"" rel=""noreferrer"">facial recognition</a> and trustfulness in games of <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7042/abs/nature03701.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">cooperation between strangers</a></p>

<p>Games of deception could be an interesting paradigm under which to study the effects of oxytocin. in poker, one's ability to bluff is a core skill. I am always amused by the percentage of pro-poker players i see on late night TV wearing sunglasses-- either photophobia is greatly over-represented in this cohort, or more likely, facial expressions and in particular, the eyes, are important cues for the detection of deception. </p>

<p>This has got me wondering: <strong>Would acute administration of intranasal oxytocin have beneficial or deleterious effects upon performance in games of deception such as poker?</strong></p>

<p>Moreover, might one expect differential effects of oxytocin among poker players with Asperger’s syndrome, such as the irreverent <a href=""https://youtu.be/gW1YOluDM3M"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tony G</a>? </p>

<p>On one hand, oxytocin could improve one's ability to recognise facial expressions, particularly <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322306009395"" rel=""noreferrer"">eye expressions</a> indicative of deception. Conversely, oxytocin might evoke some sort of <a href=""http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/1/293.short"" rel=""noreferrer"">""miscalibration of social meta-cognition""</a>, leading a misplaced sense of trust in the intentions of opponents.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I think that oxytocin's role in social cognition is far more nuanced than how I understand it to be. <em>actually, I have no doubt about that.</em> </p>

<p>For instance, aside from inconsistencies in the literature, the papers I’ve read tend to highlight a ""pro-affiliative"" skew towards oxytocin maintaining cohesion amongst those with whom we're already familiar, the in-group. With regards to the out-group, I have this impression that it's geared towards ""not throwing the first punch."" </p>

<p>Any thoughts on the possible effect of oxytocin upon poker and other games of deception, or more broadly, how to more accurately frame my understanding of the social milieu within which oxytocin functions?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rodent studies suggest that memory reconsolidating is impaired by stress. Here we examined in healthy humans the effect of stress on the reconsolidation of autobiographical memories. Participants recalled positive, negative and neutral episodes from their recent past and afterward exposed to a stressor (socially evaluated cold pressor test) or a non-arousing control condition. Additional groups of participants were exposed to the stressor without prior memory reactivation or were neither stressed nor asked to recall episodes from their past. Stress after memory reactivation impaired the memory for the neutral episodes 1 week later....</p>

"Fear of things that look like or resemble humans","<p>I remember reading this a while back. To be clear, I'm not talking about a phobia such as Automatonophobia (Fear of inanimate objects that resemble humans, such as dolls) or Pediophobia (Fear of dolls).</p>

<p>Instead, what I read about seems to be something we are all programmed to feel. What I read was that people naturally fear things that look human, but at the same time, are not quite human. A good example I once read about is a game called LSD. Now if you guys Google this and take a look at the screenshots, the game doesn't look scary at all does it? How could it when it has such out dated and hilarious graphics. If you tried to play the game however, you'll soon find yourself becoming jumpy at every little thing in the game which sooner or later, you will start to see as really creepy.</p>

<p>I read that this seems to be a reason why some people find old horror games with old graphics much more frightening than newer games where character models look much more realistic and humanoid. This might also be unrelated, however looking at the horror genre overall, aren't we mainly scared of things that look human? Jason and Freddy are pretty deformed, however in essence human's in shape. Vampires look exactly like humans, but with paler skin and fangs. Zombies look just like humans, albeit with rotting flesh. etc</p>

<p>Is there a scientific name and reasoning behind all this? I mean if you think about it, the further you create something away from a humans shape, the less frightening it becomes (a blob monster for example). Slap on a pair of red eyes on a human however or fangs, and he instantly becomes pretty scary.</p>

<p>I guess experiments testing which number of dots test subjects are able to tell without consciously counting have been performed, and that the mean number is something like <span class=""math-container"">$7$</span> (the ""magic number""). (The maximal number any test person was able to tell without consciously counting would be very interesting, too.)</p>

<p>I also guess that the magic number depends on the degree of evenness of the distribution of the dots (per test subject and on average).</p>

<p>But the magic number will depend also on the <strong>speeds</strong> of the dots. (The cases above assumed resting dots.) Two cases are to be distinguished:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not the dots, but their entirety rotates (around the center of the containing box) with angular velocity <span class=""math-container"">$v_1$</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Each dot moves independently and behaves like a billiard ball reflected at the borders of the box</p>

<ol>
<li><p>with collision among dots </p></li>
<li><p>without collision among dots, in this case </p>

<ol>
<li><p>all with the same speed <span class=""math-container"">$v_2$</span></p></li>
<li><p>with slightly different speeds </p></li>
<li><p>with very different speeds </p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>All these cases give experimental setups and one might try to determine ""magic numbers"" depending e.g. on <span class=""math-container"">$v_1$</span> (in case 1) or <span class=""math-container"">$v_2$</span> (in case 2.2.1).</p>

<p>This is case 2.1:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzeY9.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzeY9.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>But what interests me even more is the question up to which number people can actually <strong>count</strong> (not see at a glance) when asked to tell the number of some moving dots. This number will be greater than the magic numbers above - but how great? Check it out:</p>

<p>Is the magnitude, direction, etc. of this response evaluated somewhere in some type of neurons? Is there information processing in relation to, for this type of stimulus magnitude, it's evaluated which magnitude of response should be triggered by a neuron, or does the stimulus simple activate a neural pathway which activates a fixed response and the difference in the response is the result of how many neural pathways the stimulus activate?</p>

<p>To make an analogy, does reflexs work like turning several light switches for more or less light, or like inputing data into a program for different kind of responses?</p>

"What could explain the apparent association between high IAT bias scores and percentage of black americans per state?","<p>The implicit Association test (IAT) measures your subconcious preference for white over black or the other way around. It does so by letting you do a task where you have to categorize black and white faces as quickly as possible. At the same time you have to categorize words that have a positive valence or have a negative valence. The test measures your bias by looking at the differences in reactionspeed when sorting words and faces to the left or right side of the screen. If you are faster when black faces are coupled with bad words and/or when white faces are coupled with positive words then you have a negative bias towards black people or a positive bias towards white people. To see if you have any bias you can take the test yourself here: </p>

<p>According to the washington post almost all white americans have a slight to strong negative bias to black people. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/08/across-america-whites-are-biased-and-they-dont-even-know-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c9a384c22695"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/08/across-america-whites-are-biased-and-they-dont-even-know-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c9a384c22695</a></p>

<p>A score of under 0.35 means you have a slight preference for whites over blacks, a score between 0.35 and 0.65 a moderate preference and over 0.65 a strong preference according to the article. </p>

<p>You can see that the states with the strongest bias are located in the southeast of America, but the scientists behind the project implicit website are not sure what is causing this effect. This made me wonder so i googled 'percentage of blacks per state' and this is the most relevant link:</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_African-American_population"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_African-American_population</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0cWnB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0cWnB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It appears that higher bias scores coincide with higher african american populations. In the north west where very few black americans live the bias score s among the lowest, whereas in the south east where black americans live the most the scores are very high.</p>

<p>What could be causing this? Personally i think it may have something to do with blacks being poorer on average then whites thus exposing them to more risk factors (dropping out of school, abusive parents etc) which along with poverty puts them at a greater risk of becoming a criminal then whites. Wanted criminals are occasionally featured on TV when the police asks the public for help. In areas with a high percentage of black criminals can thus be seen more often on TV. If white people keep getting exposed to the black face/criminal story combination on TV, then they eventually start to subconciously associate black people with criminal activity or some other negative Association. In the north west there are hardly any black people living so the chances of the white public seeing a criminal featured on local TV that happens to be black is very low. Thus people won't get 'trained' by local TV to associate dark skin color with criminals. But this is just my own theory. I just wanted to share what i found with you guys and i would love to get some answers on my question.</p>

  <p>The brain is a very big place in a very small space. Most of the books in the brain are up here in the cerebral cortex. Down there, in the basement of the brain are the functions that our ancestors mainly depended on for survival: Aggression, child rearing, sex the willingness to follow leaders blindly. Lots of things that we can still recognize in our lives today.</p>
  
  <p>Of the higher brain functions some of them, like reading, writing, speaking seem to be located in particular places in the cerebral cortex.</p>
  
  <p>On the other hand, each memory seems to be stored in many separate locales in the brain. Old memories are in lots of places. Here is one of my earliest memories.</p>

  <p>That was a long time ago. But its imprint has not faded in the library of this brain. But the brain does much more than just recollect. It inter-compares. It synthesizes. It analyzes.

  <p><strong>The brain has its own language for testing the world's structure and consistency.</strong> But we never see the machinery of logical analysis only the conclusions. There is so much more that we must figure out than the genes can know. That's why the brain library has 10,000 times more information in it than the gene library. Our passion for learning is the tool for our survival. And unlike the musty bindings of our gene library in which hardly a word changes in a century the brain library is made of loose-leaf books.</p>
  
  <p>We're constantly adding new pages and new volumes. Emotions and ritual behavior patterns are built very deeply into us. They're part of our humanity. But they're not characteristically human. </p>
  
  <p>Many other animals have feelings. What distinguishes our species is thought. The cerebral cortex is, in a way, a liberation. We need no longer be trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of lizards and baboons: Territoriality and aggression and dominance hierarchies. We are, each of us largely responsible for what gets put into our brains for what, as adults, we wind up caring for and knowing about.</p>

The argument for it, it would seem to be different experiments show the region which activates when someone (awake I suppose) it's making a ""consciouss"" movement it's the cerebral cortex. 
Then, when a patient is in coma and makes a movement, it isnt a ""consciouss"" movement because the cerebral cortex in him isnt working. Isnt this a circular argument?

"Assessments of depression: Does the rate of false positives vary between the qualification of those testing?","<p>A friend recently asked me an interesting question to which I couldn't find the answer. Does the accuracy of depression assessments vary by the profession i.e. Nurse, GP Vs Clinical Psychologist, Psychiatrist etc, of those conducting the assessment? What is the difference in false positives or misdiagnosis between these professions. </p>

<p>I am aware the forms used are mostly the same but does the diagnosis accuracy vary?  </p>

"What, if any, objective tests were designed for the assessment of altruism?","<p>In an article by <a href=""http://www.uam.es/proyectosinv/psimasd/tdata.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Santacreu et al. (2006)</a> there is a mention of altruism assessment within the framework of the Character Education Inquiry (CEI):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we return to the first half of the last century, we can find
  important precedents of objective assessment of Personality that were
  embodied in solid and coherent research programs carried out by
  important authors in this field. Amongst these, works by Hartshorne
  and May (1928, Hartshorne, May &amp; Maller, 1929, Hartshorne, May &amp;
  Shuttleworth 1930) must be mentioned. These authors developed a set of
  tests included in their Character Education Inquiry (CEI) oriented,
  amongst other things, to measure honesty or altruism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the present moment I do not have access to the report of the CEI to verify how Hugh Hartshorne and his colleagues were assessing ""honesty or altruism"". However, <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/2092934?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Robert W. Friedrichs (1960)</a> cites the report of the CEI (along with a couple of other investigations) and claims that these studies did not have as their objective the assessment of altruism. These, so he implies, are the only studies undertaken in the field of psychology which may attract attention of those interested in the study of altruism. I tried to find attempts at objective assessment of altruism in the work published since 1960, but without success. So I'm here looking for assistance.</p>

<p>I admit that I may use the term 'objective test' incorrectly. In order to exclude any misunderstanding I would like to add that I conceive of objective test designed to assess altruism as simulated conditions in which an individual (or a group of them) is put at a moral choice being unable to uncover the simulated nature of the proceedings or to identify the qualities under scrutiny. I will be very grateful to all who help me to find reports of applications of such methods to the assessment of altruism.</p>

"Does Machiavellianism concept attempt to combine different personalty types?","<p><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism#Relations_with_other_personality_traits"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia states</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machiavellianism has been found to be negatively correlated with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">agreeableness article</a> has following words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lower-level traits, or facets, grouped under agreeableness are: <strong><em>trust</em></strong>, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, and tender-mindedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism#Game_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article on Machiavellianism</a> in some way is contradictory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was found that in a <strong><em>trust</em></strong> game, those with high MACH-IV scores tended to follow homo economicus' equilibrium strategies while those with low MACH-IV scores tended to deviate from the equilibrium</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simple words that means that high machs are closer to optimal strategy in trust games than low machs. If they are mistrustful, why are they better in trust games?</p>

<p>That's not the only contradiction. Let's look at <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">conscientiousness article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who score low on conscientiousness tend to be <strong><em>laid back</em></strong>, <strong><em>less goal-oriented</em></strong>, and <strong><em>less driven by success</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now again <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism#Motivation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Machiavellianism article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High Machs admitted to focusing on unmitigated <strong><em>achievement</em></strong> and <strong><em>winning at any cost</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But enough Wikipedia, there is more ambiguousity in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4873071/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this research article</a> (that references a bunch of other articles):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are at least <strong>two</strong> main paradigms of partner selection and both can be evidenced with previous research to be relevant to the partner selection of Machiavellians. On the one hand, similarity in level of affiliation, intimacy needs and personality traits has particular importance in ideal standards and mate choice. Previous studies provided countless evidence supporting the similarity hypothesis</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Accordingly, it is also possible that a dominant high-Mach who demands attention can form the most stable – though dysfunctional and asymmetric – relationship with a submissive and permissive low-Mach partner who he or she can manipulate and exploit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again ambiguousity. The only explanation I can propose is that there is no such thing as Machiavellianism. There are [at least] two types of personality which Machiavellianism tries to describe. Is there any concept that tried to resolve these issues? Obviuosly, Mach-IV can't separate these two types of personalities. So, are there any tests that can do it?</p>

<p>P.S. I expect that those ""machiavellianists"" who are good in trust games usually tend to choose similar [to themselves] partners for relationships and possibly, they are more goal-oriented (and should they really be a part of dark triad?). Also I won't be surprised if these two types of ""machiavellianists"" will differ greatly in emotional intelligence and mind theory.</p>

"How to prime gammatone filters?","<p>A set of gammatone band-pass filters are often used to model the filtering performed by the human inner ear. For example, ""<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554696/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BatSLAM: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Using Biomimetic Sonar</a>"" Jan Steckel and Herbert Peremans, as well as ""<a href=""http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/publications/bekolay2016.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Biologically inspired methods in speech recognition and synthesis: closing the loop</a>"" by Trevor Bekolay both use them. However, like all filters, if you start the input signal with silence, the gammatone filter responds differently than if you started the input signal with some sort of noise. Similarly, mammals are very rarely submerged in absolute silence. The environment and internal organs generate what I would imagine to be some sort of low frequency noise. Maybe it's a low-pass filtered white-noise?</p>

<p>If you are trying to use gammatone filter in a model, what do you prepend the start of your signal with? In other words, how are gammatone filters typically ""primed""?</p>

By looking, for example, at the <a href=""http://atlasofemotions.org/#states/enjoyment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enjoyment page</a>, one can see that the width of an emotion's mountain corresponds to the intensity interval of that emotion. But what do other features of, say, the amusement mountain encode? I am interested in a general answer to that question but also in the following specifics:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(Peaks) Each mountain has a peak. How is the horizontal position of the peak inside of the emotion's interval determined? How is the peak's height determined?</p></li>
<li><p>(Symmetry) Some mountains exhibit left-right symmetry, while others do not. Are the mountains designed to maximize such symmetry under the constraint that each peak be visible? Or does this symmetry (when present) encode something about the emotion?</p></li>
<li><p>(Volume) Does the overall volume of a particular mountain encode useful data?</p></li>

"Who first filmed and researched unconscious synchronized movement?","<p>I think it was in my high school sociology class, around 1980, that I learned of an anthropologist who spent three months analysing a 90 second film of a mother, father and child in a kitchen, conducting their every day affairs. And the anthropologist, playing the film in slow motion, ultimately realized that the family was dancing, unknowingly, in a coordinated way. When one person's hand reached for the cupboard, another's head might tilt just slightly. Their bodies were incessantly, unconsciously, gracefully responding to each other.</p>

<p>Please, can anybody provide a reference for this research? Do you know of any similar research? What would be key terms for me to search on? I haven't been able to find anything.</p>

<p>I observe this type of coordination in every day life, especially as an artist. From my limited experience with autistic people, I imagine that this is precisely the faculty that they lack, as if they were totally blind or partially blind, depending on where they are in the spectrum. Autistic people have to compensate, if they can at all, by consciously learning what other people are doing unconsciously. I am currently studying the origin of language and this faculty may well ground Tomasello's notion of joint intentionality. When I look at photos and videos of other great apes, they don't seem to position themselves in the way humans do, and perhaps they simply position themselves with regard to particular individuals. And this faculty is, I think, highly relevant to perceiving the sense of wholeness which architect Christopher Alexander investigates.</p>

"Why our brain can't fool itself to constantly produce dopamine?","<p>There are experiments [1] showing that our brain tries to maximize amount of dopamine.

<p>My question is: why can't our brain learn to constantly stimulate this ""reward system"" area? Why it learns such complex things like doing math, playing chess, helping other people, etc., which in the far end increase dopamine level (by feeling ""evrika"" moment, winning a competition, seeing other people grateful) when it can just fool its reward system and manually send electrical signals into it? It is a much more easier and    lucrative task.</p>

"How does Cannabis cause psychosis?","<p>Whenever I research cannabis induced psychosis, I mostly get two types of results:</p>

<p>1) Cannabis causes psychosis directly and a bunch of other issues (mostly misleading propaganda)</p>

<p>2) There is no evidence that cannabis actually causes psychosis directly, rather it seems to be a correlation issue. (also misleading propaganda)</p>

<p>However, my two best friends experienced permanent psychosis immediately after a heavy cannabis use episode (on separate occasions).</p>

<p>I am convinced that cannabis is perfectly capable of causing or ""unlocking"" psychosis. I don't think that there is any question to this.</p>

<p>But how does it actually work?</p>

<p>In one of the cases, my friend had some very strong cannabis to smoke, after which he started to hear voices, and this never ended, even months after stopping smoking. Only after anti psychotic medication (Seroquel) did the symptoms stop, and they seem to be permanent, stopping the medication causes the symptoms to come back.</p>

"Omitting word(s) when typing","<p>[Reraising <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/18437/21"">a recently asked question that was closed here</a>, but in more cogsci fashion, I hope.]</p>

<p>Some people are more inclined than others to omit a word when typing, but still be unaware of its unintended absence on a (first) proofreading. In human-computer interaction (HCI) this is called a ""misperception error"". (according to Jan Noyes, <em>Designing for Humans</em>, p. 147, Psychology Press 2002... but that's about all the book says on the topic).</p>

<p>So what else is known?</p>

<ul>
<li>First of all, is it also called something else, perhaps more specific, because ""misperception error"" is very general, so it's hard to turn up any research on this particular error using these terms in pubmed.</li>
<li>What is the prevalence among general population? It can't be something that hard to study, say among students, the low-hanging fruit of psychology and HCI studies, so I suspect some study on prevalence exists.</li>
<li>What are some abnormal psychology correlates? I would venture a guess dyslexia and ADHD, but how much more common is it in such sub-populations than in neurotypicals?</li>
</ul>

<p>I would gladly break this into separate questions if deemed necessary, but I suspect all of the above can probably be answered from one or two papers specifically on this topic.</p>

<hr>

<p>I found <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25280122"" rel=""noreferrer"">a paper</a> on a similar auditory phenomenon, which has some generally applicable ideas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the application of signal detection theory (SDT) allows
  perceptual performance to be understood in terms of both sensitivity (the ability of a system to distinguish signal from noise) and response bias (the system’s bias, independent of sensitivity, for responding either positively or negatively)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So obviously there is a stronger response bias in proofreading your own typing than another's... which probably means that general statistics for ""filling in"" missing words in a sentence need to upward adjusted for proofreading your own typing.</p>

<p>Even more interesting, and perhaps a little worrisome for those exhibiting this, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This theory is supported by behavioural evidence showing that the
  influence expectation exerts over auditory perception is stronger in those who
  hallucinate [...] This theory
  is also supported by evidence that the prediction error signal, which communicates the
  discrepancy between expectation and actual sensation [...] is reduced in those who suffer from
  schizophrenia [...].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It remains to be seen if misperception of non-existent words due to semantic expectation correlates to some kind of predisposition for visual or other kind of hallucination. It seems a bit more far fetched.</p>

<hr>

<p>Perhaps it's also worth noting here that simply <a href=""https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03197655.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">proofreading familiar text</a>, which the subject has read before in the correct version, but which is then modified by the injection of spelling errors, actually improves the detection rate of spelling errors. So not all kinds of familiarity with the text predispose to proofreading errors, at least not to proofreading spelling errors (missing or extra words were not tested in that study).</p>

"Region of Interest Proposal in Vision","<p>In machine learning, Region of Interest (ROI) proposal is a method for subsampling an image to identify ""interesting"" subregions. A canonical example is from Region Convolutional Neural Networks, where the task is to identify objects in a scene:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X3N8a.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X3N8a.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The point of the above ROI proposal is that it makes subsequent multiple object detection more efficient since the entire image no longer needs to be processed and because most objects will fall within the detected subregions. To be clear, ROI proposal is usually done using lower-level methods like looking at color gradations and estimating region boundaries. Nowedays, ROI proposal is done with convolutional layers, but even these use fairly low-level kernels to quickly propose regions. I'm specifically interested in the convolutional approaches, as they seem most relevant to the brain.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if there is any evidence of such ROI proposal in animal vision? Specifically what is our current state-of-the-art understanding of how the brain identifies multiple objects in a complex scene? Do we have reason to believe that it's not just a left-right and top-down scan of the image, but something more efficient where lower-level neurons propose subregions to explore?</p>

Now obviously, this entire ad campaign is preposterous. There's no difference between the left side of a Twix bar and the right side of a Twix bar.</p>

<li><strong>If you cannot administer a standardised intelligence test to someone, to what extent can you obtain a good estimate of their IQ from the kinds of information available about public figures?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is considered scientific best-practice in this regard?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How accurate is best practice? Do any studies provide validity estimates (e.g., correlating estimates with actual IQ test scores)?</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>In relation to public figures, a wide range of information is often available: e.g., demographics, educational attainments, career achievement, writing samples, personal achievements, samples of public speaking, and so on. Sometimes, information such as school and university grades will be available. Of course, a lot of this information will be non-standardised. I wonder what would be a good way to collect and synthesise this information to generate a prediction.</p>

"Introductory resources on developmental psychology/neuroscience","<p>I'd like to be able to answer questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>What neuro/psychological functions underly competences such as empathy (or others - see background below)? </li>
<li>What neurotransmitters are of particular importance in those functions? </li>
<li>What genes are known to be associated with those neurotransmitters?</li>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I'm an M.Sc. student in epidemiology (with a psychology undergrad) and my thesis is on ""gene x environment"" interactions (GxE). The outcome I'm interested in is child competence (construct which can be subdivided in subcomponents such as compliance, attention &amp; empathy) at 18 months. The main environmental predictor is mother sensitivity.</p>

<p>I now need to focus on some specific genes and would like to be able to choose those with a clear rationale (rather than, say, search through the literature to find the most commonly studied genes); However, at this point I lack the knowledge required to do so. </p>

"What is the standard way to analyze EEG data in a mismatch negativity paradigm?","<p>I'm running an EEG experiment using a modified auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) design, and I'm wondering if anyone can tell me the best method for data analysis (and recommend any stats programs/packages for this purpose as well).  </p>

<p>The experiment will only have a few (6-8) subjects with a high number of trials per subject (~700).  The matched condition makes up 75% of the trials.  The stimuli are selected from a closed set of 10 items, with an equal frequency of items in the matched/mismatched conditions.</p>

<p>One of the differences between this study and normal auditory MMN tasks is that the expected/unexpected stimuli vary between trials with the expectation set up on a trial-by-trial basis.  Therefore, it's possible that the difference in event-related potentials (ERPs) to expected/unexpected stimuli will be averaged out due to small variations in response to these changing stimuli.  </p>

<p>Does someone out there know the best EEG data processing and analysis techniques to detect the small ERP in response to auditory MMN stimuli?  Can anyone recommend techniques to avoid averaging out small ERPs whose latencies might vary?</p>

"Can you catch up on sleep over the weekend?","<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation"" rel=""noreferrer"">lack of sleep has many negative effects associated with it</a>. <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/9799-lost-sleep-study-suggests.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maintained sleep deprivation results in a degraded performance over time</a> (in this case reaction time).</p>

<p>Assuming one needs 8 hours of sleep each night, but during the weekdays he only sleeps 6, is it possible to catch up on those lost hours of sleep during the weekend?</p>

<p>There is evidence that 'recovery sleep' is different from ordinary sleep. Carskadon and Dement (2005) measured a sleep pattern that favors Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) after 38 hours without sleep. Personally I also experience it takes me longer to wake up after being sleep deprived, which makes me believe at least your body is trying to make up for something.</p>

<p>A study by Gumenyuk et. al (2011) concludes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reduced time in bed is associated with deficiency of the neuronal
  process associated with change detection, which <strong>may recover after one
  week of sleep extension</strong>, whereas attention-dependent neural processes
  do not normalize after this period of time in habitually short
  sleeping individuals and may require longer recovery periods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gives an indication recovery of some symptoms is possible, but recovery time is not equal for all symptoms. However, the participants in this study seem to be habitual short sleepers.</p>

<p>I am wondering whether it is possible to recover from the lost hours over the week during the weekend <strong>entirely</strong>. E.g. if you lost 8 hours, by sleeping 8 hours more during the weekend. The notion of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_debt"" rel=""noreferrer"">sleep dept</a> still seems to be up for debate, but perhaps there is more certainty on short term (1 week) effects?</p>

"Do fetuses exhibit pattern recognition in utero?","<p>I've heard that fetuses exhibit ""likes"", such as preferring sweeter amniotic fluid or the sound of their mother's voice. To show preference for specific voices as opposed to inborn stimuli like sweet, some form of pattern recognition would have to be involved.</p>

"Do ability tests predict maximal more than typical job performance?","<p>I have often read that ability tests are indicative of what people ""can do"", but that job performance also depends on what people ""will do"".</p>

<p>For example, Ackerman and Beier (2012) wrote that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a fundamental mismatch between what is measured by extant
  intelligence tests and the criteria one is most interested in, when
  predicting job-related performance measures, that is, the mismatch
  between typical and maximal behaviors. ... Although assessments of
  what someone can do will serve as an assessment of the upper bound of
  a person’s performance on the day that the applicant is assessed, I–O
  psychologists and managers are most interested in what the applicant
  will do on a day-to-day basis on the job—that is, the individual’s
  typical performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the  correlation between maximal job performance and typical job performance?</li>
<li>To what extent do ability tests predict maximal performance more than typical performance?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interested in learning about empirical studies that have tested these ideas. I also imagine that findings will vary based on factors related to the work setting, and so forth (e.g., some work environments permit greater variability in discretionary effort). Also, presumably the degree to which ability-performance correlations differ between typical and maximal will be greater where the correlation between typical and maximal is lower. I'm also interested in understanding more about the methodological challenges associated with operationalising typical and maximal performance.</p>

"Do high heels increase female attractiveness in men only through indirect means?","<p>It seems widely accepted that, overall, men tend to find women in high heels more attractive.  (There will, of course, be many exceptions to this rule.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""High heels may well be the most potent aphrodisiac ever concocted."" -- Rossi 1981</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the increase in attraction seems to be only indirectly ascribed with wearing high heels.  Typically this is described along the lines: high heels cause a change in the posture of the female, which the male finds (sexually) attractive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Question: How can we exclude the possibility that the high heels themselves are not the main cause of the increase in attractiveness?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is, how can we exclude the possibility that men, overall, primarily just like the sight of women in high heels, for some reason or another?</p>

<p>My thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If the increase in attractiveness were primarily due to these indirect factors, then we should see a comparable increase in attractiveness e.g. if a woman were merely to stand on a slope.  (Although, this would not account for the addition factors, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gait"" rel=""noreferrer"">gait</a>, and the sound made when walking in high heels.)</p></li>
<li><p>There are things that women do, such as fingernail painting, which increases attractiveness, but (arguably) not sexual attractiveness.  It seems plausible that the ""femininity"" associated with wearing high heels (as with fingernail painting) could be a large factor in the increase in attractiveness.</p></li>

"What is the relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder and fugue states?","<p>The introduction of the new edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (""DSM-5"") is on the horizon.  With it are coming some new, evidence-based diagnoses for dissociative disorders [1], which include conditions such as dissociative fugue (which will now be classified as dissociative amnesia) and dissociative identity disorder.</p>

<p>Fugue states have always been fascinating to me, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fugue_state"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> states that they are</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality and other identifying characteristics of individuality...Fugues are usually precipitated by a stressful episode, and upon recovery there may be amnesia for the original stressor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD"" rel=""noreferrer"">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a> is also precipitated by a stressful (and potentially life threatening) episode, and causes anxiety and autonomic hyperexcitablity.</p>

<p>I've never seen anything written about the level of stressor that can induce a fugue state, but based on their common etiology, I would assume that PTSD and fugue states are related psychologically and neurologically.</p>

<p>To what extent is this true, are these two seemingly different end products of the same initial event?  Is there an anatomical substrate that is common to both?  Does changing the status of ""dissociative fugue"" -> ""dissociative amnesia"" mean they should be considered in isolation?</p>

"Spurious attractors in Hopfield networks","<p>A classic ""Hopfield network"" is a type of artificial neural network in which the units are bi-stable and fully interconnected by symmetrically weighted connections. In 1982, Hopfield showed that such networks are characterized by an ""energy function"", under which stored memories correspond to local energy minima [1].</p>

<p>In a 1983 paper [2], Hopfield et al further showed that ""spurious memories"" (local energy minima that are created during training, in addition to the intended target patterns) can be suppressed by an ""unlearning procedure"", during which the network is repeatedly allowed to relax from random states, and the resulting states then ""unlearned"" by anti-Hebbian weight adjustments. The procedure affects spurious memories more than the desirable ""learned memories"", thus improving recall performance. However, the paper offers no explanation for why this should be so.</p>

<p>A 2004 paper by Robins and McCallum [3] demonstrates that spurious memories can be distinguished from learned ones because their ""energy profiles"" are different. Specifically, the ratio of lowest to highest energy contributions from individual units is significantly smaller in states corresponding to spurious memories than in states corresponding to learned memories. Again, the effect is not accounted for (except for a tentative partial explanation).</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a relationship between these two findings, i.e. does the lower ""energy ratio"" of spurious states explain their greater susceptibility to unlearning?</li>
<li>Have any explanations for either or both of these phenomena been put forward since the publication of the papers?</li>
<li>Are there other ways to suppress or detect spurious memories in the Hopfield family of neural networks?</li>

"Isolating stable EEG data across all channels in EEGLAB","<p>I'm working on some EEG data we collected using the Emotiv Epoc headset using 14 channel sensors. </p>

<p>I need to isolate chunks of data where all 14 channels are stable (non-noisy) for a given length of time (e.g. 5 seconds). I've written a MATLAB script for this, such that I calculate the standard deviation of each channel and pass an analysis window over the data, comparing the difference between maximum and minimum values in the window to this standard deviation (i.e. where maximum - minimum is less than the standard deviation [or 3-5 standard deviations], I treat that window as stable).</p>

<p>Based on this criteria, I am having some success in finding 5 second long segments but am worried this data may not be reliable (or not as stable/artefact free as desired).</p>

<p>Are there any better ways of performing this analysis? Even better, are there any functions built into EEGLAB for this very purpose?</p>

<p><strong>Further info:</strong></p>

<p>I've selected only the relevant channels and can now look through my EEG data files.</p>

<p>I am no neuroscience expert, actually I'm rather new to this sort of analysis, so apologies if this question is overly basic or off-point.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>We collected our data in a museum environment (very noisy in many ways), with participants sitting as still as possible for 2-minute sessions at a go. For this reason, there is a high likelihood of artefacts being found in the data due to movement, the environment and possibly even inaccuracies from the device itself (since we went through a rather large number of participants, cleaning and charging the headsets in between trials). </p>

<p>From what I've discussed with the team, I've been told that removing artefacts wouldn't solve the issue (though admittedly I'm no expert as to why this would be). </p>

<p>For clarity, the data we've collected looks similar to the plot below. </p>

<p>These papers from what I was able to find, lay out the basis of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). There are three possible rules for sorting the cards; color, shape, or count. I am curious why the WCST places 4 stimulus cards in front of the patient when 3 carefully chosen cards would be sufficient. With 4 cards it seems that unless the examiner makes special preparations, there might be occasions when there is more than 1 correct stimulus card to choose, or during a transition from certain rule to the next the patient may make an incorrect guess and won't be able to tell which rule to eliminate.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why there has to be 4 stimulus cards? Could I run an equally effective WCST with 3 stimulus cards?</p>

However, other sources seem to indicate the opposite (although I may be misunderstanding them).

"
"Is consciousness a sub product of the brain or is there a duality?","<p>I am trying to understand what consciousness is, based on my basic knowledge of our senses, artificial intelligence (computer vision, specifically) and some philosophy. Here's my reasoning:</p>

<p>As far as I understand it from my Neural Network class, each eye captures the light and transmits it through electric signals to the brain. Each action potential can be seen as a binary 1, no activity as a 0.</p>

<p>This stimulates some of the neurons in the visual cortex, which allows our brain to interpret and understand what the eyes have captured.</p>

<p>In computer vision, this is where ""sight"" ends: the computer detects what's in the image, based on its knowledge base - its training set - and that's it.</p>

<p>So why does the human brain take the extra steps of combining both signals into an image - i.e translating the different waves of the electromagnetic spectrum into shapes, colors, etc -, turning it upright and displaying it to ourselves?</p>

<p>The same could be said, as far as I know it, about the other senses: hearing would be detecting vibrations in the air, but the brain also translate these into sounds.</p>

<p>Does this hint that Descartes' dualistic definition could be true, that our consciousness is separate from the brain? Or could consciousness be a sub product of the brain, a consolidation of what each one of its areas are processing, in order to better understand the world (as in Stanislas Dehaene's workspace neurons cognitive model)?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: I've been thinking a bit more about the subject. If there are workspace neurons responsible for consciousness, then there should be a region of the brain that is constantly active, at all times.</p>

<p>After a bit of - <em>online</em> - research, I've stumbled upon the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""it&#39;s a wikipedia article..."">Default mode network</a> (DMN), which is anti-correlated to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task-positive_network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""another wikipedia article, sorry"">Task-positive network</a> (TPN). Interestingly, the DMN is active when the individual is not focused on an activity - at rest. Furthermore, there is a possible increase in connectivity between DMN's nodes during REM sleep - when we dream. On the other hand, TPM is most active during attention-demanding tasks. It has therefore been theorized that both are elements of a single default network with anti-correlated components (in an scientific paper behind a pay-wall, so I'm quoting Wikipedia).</p>

<p>Plus, both networks involve the fronto-parietal attention network, where it is believed the workspace neurons are located.</p>

<p>I couldn't help correlating the DMN and TPN to Carl Jung's theories of the Conscious and the Unconscious - which I am particularly fond about. If these wild conjectures I am forming are correct, then we could have the following (oversimplified) neural correlate of consciousness:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U15gQ.png"" alt=""NCC""></p>

<p>In this idea, exchanges between TPM and DMN occur through neurotransmitters, while exchanges between the conscious and unconscious happen using psychic energy (as in the energy from the psyche, <em>not</em> supernatural powers). Furthermore, the collective unconscious would then be inherited from human to human - embedded in our DNA. If true, then there would be discernible patterns in a newborn's brain...</p>

<p>So, going back to A.I, a conscious agent would not, theoretically, be a single agent, but instead a multi-agent collaborative system...</p>

<p>Now, I have very basic knowledge and lack scientific research on these topics, but I am interested in learning a LOT more. Is this theory absurd and blatantly wrong, or is it worth pursuing as a hypothesis?</p>

<p>A depressed person asked how to erase specific unpleasant memories in order to manage his depression. My answer was basically ""that's impossible, here is how you deal with these memories instead"". And then somebody asked in the comments why it is impossible. </p>

<p>I thought of tackling this question and realized I can't do it well. My best attempt was something like, ""First, you have to find out which millions of neurons (out of the billions the person has) light up together to represent 'a memory', and we don't have a method for brain imaging with that resolution. Second, you have to stop them from activating in exactly that combination, while preserving their ability to activate in any other combination, and we have no idea how to achieve that"".

"What are your thoughts on Accelerated Resolution Therapy?","<p>Recently I came into contact with my aunt, and it seems she has been doing very well. She has been developing a therapy technique that, she claims, helps resolves psychological problems from trauma, child abuse, domestic abuse, et cetera. She calls it <a href=""http://acceleratedresolutiontherapy.com/web/"" rel=""nofollow"">Accelerated Resolution Therapy</a>.</p>

<p>The essential thesis of her technique is that the problems caused trauma are being dealt with incorrectly. Therapists often try to help a patient deal with the facts of the situation. They help them understand what happened, why it happened, and why what happened should not impair their life. Unfortunately, therapy can often be slow in progress and some people never fully recover from a traumatic event. My aunt's therapy technique essentially discards the old method of dealing with facts and, instead, deals with memories and pictures. Coming to terms with facts, from a rational and conscious perspective, is usually achievable. But, for my aunt, the problem aren't the facts but the images revolving around those facts. Even when a person comes to understand their trauma, they still will suffer from depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems.</p>

<p>What she essentially does is encourage the patient to change the images to more positive, or, at the very least, into neutral memories. She does encourage them to change their knowledge on the matter; but, rather, she simply changes the physical memory into something less traumatic. The patient will still understand that they were wronged and hurt, but the image of the pain will be removed.</p>

<p>Usually I'm very skeptical with new therapy techniques and any practice that claims to solve problems within 2 or 3 sessions, but it honestly makes a lot of sense. It reminds me of ghost limbs and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL_6OMPywnQ"" rel=""nofollow"">mirror therapy</a>, and how placing a mirror next to a limb, in tact, will help a patient be relieved of his pain. He understands, clear as day, that he is missing a limb, but the physical image of having two limbs and seeing the limbs move removes many of the psychological problems associated with ghost limbs.</p>

"Can creativity be taught?","<p>I have heard of classes that teach 'creativity'. To me, the whole concept is absurd. I approached a student of the aforementioned class and asked him why he chose to learn creativity. He stated that creativity is a process in which you learn the basics and the rules and then extrapolate it. I argued that real creativity is innate, and it depends on the surroundings of which you are a part. </p>

<p>And then a thought struck me: What if no one is 'naturally' creative? After birth, a baby knows only what he sees. Whatever a person knows has been absorbed from the surroundings in the form of opinions and experiences. On these lines, anybody can be creative, provided he is exposed to the 'correct' stimulus. Ideas and philosophies are personal interpretations of experiences and opinions. It wasn't our creativity as a race that has made us who we are today, but it was actually necessity that propelled our species forward. What else would possibly stimulate our creativity as a race other than our necessity as a species to survive?</p>

"Does writing something on computer help memorize it?","<p>There is an interesting question on this site:</p>

<p><a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/68/does-writing-something-down-help-memorize-it?newreg=ad6b07f59ba04fd493e4c72fe9abfb2d"">Does writing something down help memorize it?</a></p>

<p>Now my question is, does writing something on computer (i.e. using Word, Notepad, ...) help memorize it?</p>

<p>I usually learn by rewriting texts I read on computer. I never use copy-paste and always rewrite text myself and change it a little (acording to my needs, also I often translate it).   </p>

<p>I use computer mainly because:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can write faster on computer than on paper</li>
<li>I am often lazy to find paper and I don't want to waste paper when I will probably throw it away 2 days later anyway (consider <em>environment</em>, please don't consider as a ""<em>throw away exam</em>"")</li>
<li>It easier to edit text written on computer, can search within it, ...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So does the writing text on computer have the same advantages as writing down on paper?</strong></p>

"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder and Oppositional Defiance Disorder","<p>In <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/a/21648"">my answer</a> to the question <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/21644/how-does-a-person-know-if-he-should-seek-treatment-for-depression-since-feeling"">How does a person know if he should seek treatment for depression since feeling moody is unavoidable?</a>, I have pointed out that DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) talks about a depressive disorder which is specific to 7-18 year olds only, with onset before 10 years old, and that is <strong>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)</strong> (pp. 156-160).</p>

<p>I am not sure what I think about this, as it could be seen to be</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>oh, it’s just childhood/teenage tantrums which they will grow out of.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The other side to this being in the DSM is that it says in the note under criteria J on page 156, that <strong>DMDD cannot coexist with Oppositional Defiance Disorder (ODD) and individuals whose symptoms meet the criteria for both Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder and ODD should only be given the diagnosis of Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder</strong>, however, doing this will indicate that the ODD aspects are a result of depression.</p>

<p>Page 159, under the heading of <strong>Oppositional defiant disorder</strong>, says that ""while symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typically do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder,"" the mood symptoms of DMDD are relatively rare in children with ODD, and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is not the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, page 159 agrees with page 156 which says DMDD cannot coexist with ODD, and says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only diagnosis of disruptive dysregulation disorder should be made. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why can children not suffer from ODD and have depression because they feel there are oppression attempts against them?</p>

"In the dual process theory, how are the two systems interact with each other?","<p>From my understanding about cognitive psychology and social psychology, the whole route from when people meet new unknown thing to when they making judgement about it is like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>First people <strong>perceive</strong> information about the subject</li>
<li>Then they <strong>memorize</strong> it</li>
<li>When they meet new information, they recall the old one to <strong>organize, categorize</strong> or <strong>re-categorize existing knowledge</strong>, using logic</li>
<li>This may create <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong>, and after a while they will <strong>solve this problem</strong></li>
<li>After that, the decision is formed, and their <strong>attitudes</strong> toward the subject is changed or strengthened</li>
</ol>

<p>But each topics are fragmented and studied by their owns (perception &amp; attention, memory, knowledge representation, problem solving, attitude), not unifying in a single topic. For example, I notice a recurring theme in those topics, which I term as ""clearness"" and ""fadedness"":</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.imgur.com/kmK3w4d.png"" alt=""""></p>

<p>I'm aware of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dual process theory</a> and I think this is it. However I prefer the ""clearness – fadedness"" naming because it is more visual to me than ""system 1 – system 2"". Anyway, the problem is that in that page I don't see how the interactions between two systems are discussed <strong>in its own term</strong>. All I see is that it describes which specific process belong to which system, but when it needs to describe how the two systems interact with each other, specific models are used. </p>

<p><sup>Here we see the convenience of the ""clearness – fadedness"" naming: we can say that a clearness fades away to become a fadedness, or a fadedness is unfaded and become a clearness. With ""system 1 – system 2"" we don't have the verbs and adjectives to describe it visually. Or perhaps because in our language there is no suitable word to describe the transformation of the systems, we don't have a model to describe its interactions?</sup></p>

<p>My reason for formulating this hypothesis is personal experience.</p>

<p>A simple example is when I work, sitting, at the PC. Let's say I work 25-45 minutes. When I am working my breathing becomes more shallow and it's always through my nose. Then, when I've completed the work I usually, automatically, take a deep breath ... as I physically feel relieved it's over even if it's work I enjoy. Then I notice I am a tiny bit <strong>lightheaded</strong> and, as I feel relieved, and I don't particularly want to get up, I usually have a desire to surf the web.</p>

<p>So, I'm wondering if <em>concentration causes blood pressure to increase, which then quickly reduces when I'm done with my task</em>, which is causing this feeling I am describing as <em>lightheadedness</em>. Alternatively is the blood pressure change related to the reduced breathing as I focus? ... is there such a thing?</p>

For example: in physics you can work in theory without doing experimental things or you can work in experimental without doing theory. Usually theory related to mathematics; since the language of science is mathematics. Now, in mathematics we have people who do ""computation faster"" like they solve puzzles quickly or they are very smart at games or multiply tens of digits without calculator, etc. While the other part, the theory-people, they analyze physical things to have a mathematical model and expect future results based on these models so if models doesn't work (such as no solution for the model under some conditions) then we say this result cannot happen in future under some conditions, etc. </p>

<p>From this point-of-view, I'm really interested to see whether is there any survey or research paper about ""what is the consequences to be a theory-people or non-theory-people?"" For example: I remember Michael Sipser says in his book of ""Introduction to Theory of Computation"", ""theory is good because it expands your minds"". Now, if someone is doing theory, then he expands his imagination and the way of thinking to things, but how about consequences? it seems to me for the example I had today in class that ""theory people are slower to do normal jobs, even though they understand it"". Is there any research papers about this issue! I would be happy to hear from this site anything related to this topic.   </p>

"Can drugs cause a psychosis, or only unlock it?","<p>There have been many reports, that recreational drug use can cause psychosis.

To some extent that article confuses the covert aspect/presentation with the better studied ""vulnerable"" narcissism, but this can probably be forgiven because the DSM-IV itself wasn't terribly clear on this, although the <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/per0000023"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DSM-5 makes more of an effort to distinguish between the two dimensions</a>.

(At least as far traffic violations are concerned, the rich can usually afford the fines more easily, and even if they have their license suspended, can better afford to pay someone else to drive them.) Another indicator was that the rich tended to draw themselves as bigger circles in relation to the world.

<p>Assume any model of how positive propositions $p$ are actively (opposed to synaptically) represented in a neural network, e.g. ""the cat sat on the mat"". Presumably, this will be by some kind of firing of some neurons or neuron assemblies.</p>

"How might the ""Imposter Syndrome"" typology be reconciled with the robustness of the ""self-serving bias""?","<p><strong>TL;DR
What on Earth is going on in someone's head to invert a cognitive bias that is robustly observed in people who are psychologically healthy (Cohen's <em>d</em> = 1.28) and still present in depression (Cohen's <em>d</em> = 0.21)? I am looking to reconcile the <em>self-serving bias</em> with either the <em>Imposter Syndrome</em> or <em>mental illness</em>.</strong> </p>

<p><em>""Some people""</em>, as the familiar trope notes, <em>“are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple.”</em> While we are all familiar with individuals who are thoroughly unable to accurately attribute the true cause of their achievements, rarely do we ever consider the possibility that we too are guilty of the <em>self-serving bias</em>.</p>

<p>The self-serving bias appears to be both universal and robust. Moreover, an attenuated bias is associated with mental illness:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8GtY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8GtY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

Self-Serving Attributional Bias. Psychological Bulletin, 130(5), 711–747. 
https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.711
</code></pre>

<p>Others, on the other hand, seem to be afflicted with an attribution bias <em>antipodal</em> to the self-serving bias. These people seem to completely unable  to internalise their achievements as truly their own, and appear to dismissively attribute their successes to external factors most people do for <em>everyone</em> but themselves -- the Imposter Syndrome. </p>

<p>Clance and Imes (1978) first characterised the Imposter Syndrome typology among their high-achieving female patients:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>So, how can we reconcile what seem to be two antipodal phenomena?</p>

<p>From a very cursory consideration of things, it seems that for individuals with the Imposter Syndrome, the self-serving bias is either greatly attenuated, or dare I say, inverted. For that to occur, we might presume two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>They have crushingly low self-efficacy and/or; </li>
<li>They are processing information in an aberrant manner. </li>
</ol>

<p>So, how does social, cognitive, or abnormal psychology reconcile the self-serving bias with the Imposter Syndrome? Is the Imposter Syndrome even a <em>thing</em> or simply a cognitive style that occurs among people with depression? If so, what are their similarities, and what are their departures? In other words, is the phenomenology of someone with severe depression effectively the same as someone with the Imposter Syndrome?</p>

"Why are EEG markers usually sent over the parallel port?","<p>Usually, a study participant is viewing stimuli on a computer screen while their EEG is recorded through the hardware provided by a manufacturer. To later synchronize the EEG data to stimuli, an experimenter will send so-called 'markers' from the stimulation computer to the EEG hardware so that the markers are encoded in realtime together with the EEG data.</p>

<p>Why do most manufacturers use the old-fashioned <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_port"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">parallel port</a> for that?</p>

<p>I know, that the parallel port allows for a <em>parallel</em> transmission of up to 8 bits (i.e., 255 possible marker values and one '0' marker to indicate 'no marker') ... however, while that is a clear advantage, it comes at the cost of using a legacy port that is not available on modern computers.</p>

<p>Couldn't we just use a USB port to send data serially (in smaller bit packages) ... and then join these bits to a byte (8bits) to get the same number of possible markers? USB would in theory be fast enough to even compensate for the extra time needed to 'buffer' single bits and then encoding them as a byte.</p>

"Long term effects of a high self monitor who voluntarily chooses a contradictory self-presentation","<p>Are there any cases or studies of a <code>high self monitor</code> who intuitively chooses to act ""by impulse"" in order to reform said impulse? </p>

<p>In other words when the HSM behaves as a <code>low self monitor</code> they selectively and willingly embrace a <code>low self presentation</code> in order to challenge (or embrace flaws) within their own pride, ego, or some other aspect of psychology.</p>

<p><strong>Additional questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What else can be said of this situation? </p></li>
<li><p>What other questions, or background is necessary to analyze this occurrence? </p></li>
<li><p>Is this behavior indicative of other problems worth investigating? (e.g. morally flawed premise for taking such action)</p></li>
<li><p>What negative effects could there be on the ego and super-ego by behaving this way over long periods of time? </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>At a young age, this HSM may have discovered that behaving as a low-self-presentation allowed them to abdicate responsibility.  This was later corrected in adulthood when the subject decided to actively pursue accountability on past and present behavior... thus leading to overall character improvement. </p>

"How much tablet time is bad for kids?","<p>In a <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/behind-online-behavior/201604/what-screen-time-can-really-do-kids-brains"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Psychology Today blog</a> we read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When very small children get hooked on tablets and smartphones, says Dr. Aric Sigman, an associate fellow of the British Psychological Society and a Fellow of Britain’s Royal Society of Medicine, they can unintentionally cause permanent damage to their still-developing brains. Too much screen time too soon, he says, “is the very thing impeding the development of the abilities that parents are so eager to foster through the tablets. The ability to focus, to concentrate, to lend attention, to sense other people’s attitudes and communicate with them, to build a large vocabulary—all those abilities are harmed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mkay, there's little doubt that if kids play some phone/tablet-based video game all day long, they'll miss on other activities (an obvious <a href=""https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/opportunity_cost"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">opportunity cost</a>), but how much is too much? Are there studies quantifying this effect? And is there something specific about phone/tablet-based ""screen time"" that's particularly damaging? I mean besides the availability/portability factor, which is obvious.</p>

<hr>

<p>A theory as to how an interactive time-waster is worse than a passive one <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/does-spending-too-much-time-on-smartphones-and-tablets-damage-kids-development-a7067261.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has been proposed</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>many apps are designed to be stimulus-driven, with exciting audiovisual rewards for completing tasks. Experts call this the “I did it!” response, which triggers the reward pathway in the brain. Because of this, tablets and smartphones make for excellent pacifiers, particularly on long plane journeys and in restaurants. But while this can be helpful in the short term, it’s important for young children to be able to develop internal mechanisms of self-regulation, whether that’s learning without constant rewards or being able to sit patiently without constant digital stimulation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is there evidence that is actually more damaging to development than a more passive time-waster? Ok, maybe that makes it more potentially addictive... so there's potential to wasting more time like that. But if we controlled for time spent, is there any other difference?</p>

<p>And the end of the latter article seems to indicate that interactivity can cut both ways:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BedTime Math is one [opposite] example. The app delivers engaging maths story problems for parents and their children. It is one of the few tools that have been shown to make kids smarter; children who used the app even just once a week for a year improved their maths by more than a control group did. The impact was particularly strong for children whose parents were anxious about maths. </p>

For the sake of keeping the samples simple, I will ignore prior moral or religious convictions that a regular person would hold.</p>

<p>I figured ""empathy"" at first but that would require emotional transference with a real or hypothetical individual which is not given in this case.

<p>My first impression was that this is some sort of punishment, i.e. because of your behaviour (not having a loyalty card) we're throwing these points that you earned away.</p>

<p>This is based on definition 1, for punishment, from the Penguin dictionary of psychology (2nd ed.):</p>

"Applications of computational learning theory in the cognitive sciences","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_learning_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Computational learning theory</a> (CoLT) is a branch of theoretical computer science associated with the mathematical analysis of machine learning. A lot of the early ideas of the field take inspiration from human learning. The field has developed into a very rigorous, mathematical, and precise science, but I have not seen it used much in the cognitive sciences directly. There is some indirect use through CoLT's interaction with statistics and machine learning algorithms (say, <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/a/253/29"">analyzing neural networks through VC-dimension</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Are there examples of rigorous uses/applications of CoLT to build theories in psychology, neuroscience, and/or cognitive science?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>The only two examples I am familiar with are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.lps.uci.edu/~johnsonk/Publications/Johnson.GoldsTheorem.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gold's theorem</a> on the unlearnability in the limit of certain sets of languages, among them context-free ones.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://homepages.cwi.nl/~rdewolf/publ/philosophy/phthesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ronald de Wolf's master's thesis</a> on the <a href=""https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/2023/33"">impossibility to PAC-learn context-free languages</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first made quiet a stir in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_of_the_stimulus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">poverty-of-the-stimulus debate</a>, and the second has been unnoticed by cognitive science.</p>

<p>I am interested in approaches of this flavor. I am relatively comfortable with CoLT as it is studied in mathematics, and am only interested (for this question) in approaches that have direct bearing on theories of human/animal cognition/learning, and not classic machine learning results. I am <strong>looking for general mathematical and asymptotic approaches</strong>, not the running of specific types of algorithms (be it neural-nets, bayesian, or otherwise) to simulate human performance as is typical in computational modeling in cogsci (which I am relatively familiar with).</p>

<p>I am <strong>not interested</strong> in arguments that try to trivially undercut the whole approach, even if they have empirical validity. For instance, the whole approach can be derailed by asserting that human brains are finite and thus asymptotic arguments are useless. This is the same as arguing that all of computational complexity theory is pointless because computers (and the whole universe, for that matter) are finite. It is a valid empirical argument, but boring from the point of view of theory building.</p>

"Models of barriers to ""Flow"" (being in ""the zone"")","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"">This Wikipedia article</a> is an excellent overview to the concept of Flow. </p>

<p>The problem is, from personal experience, in one specific area, I think it's incomplete. To quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Schaffer (2013) proposed 7 flow conditions:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Knowing what to do</p></li>
  <li><p>Knowing how to do it</p></li>
  <li><p>Knowing how well you are doing</p></li>
  <li><p>Knowing where to go (if navigation is involved)</p></li>
  <li><p>High perceived challenges</p></li>
  <li><p>High perceived skills</p></li>
  <li><p>Freedom from distractions[22]</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And there are times when I can check the above off but still be feeling unable to get in the zone. My best guess is the weak point is either:</p>

<ul>
<li>distractions - it's a broad term, and feeling under pressure, even if completely self imposed, comes under that category. </li>
<li>Knowing how to do it. If there are several options, and you know how you might do each, but can't decide which might be best, it becomes an issue, even if there is no obvious difference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are there any alternative models which explore possible barriers in more detail? Or any concepts such supplement flow theory to give further preconditions for flow? Stating the obvious perhaps, nearly any aspect of a person's general state of mind can be a barrier. Stress, even on unrelated tasks, is an obvious one. Is that already coversed in the above model? It would hamper decision making (knowing how you're going to do it), even though you do know how to do it. Perhaps it also counts as a distraction?</p>

<p>One last thought: perhaps, checking off the above, but feeling unable to achieve flow is itself a sign of incorrect cognition, since one or more points have been incorrectly assessed. (Assuming the model is correct and complete).</p>

<p>When we see someone put gun on someone's head, we are more likely to think, we should punish this robber rather than thinking what does he want. On the other hand, people are more willing to pay tax that goes to welfare recipients. That's probably because we think that robbing is wrong, while voting for welfare is right.</p>

<p>But I can't seem to find an MB profile that maps to the following Jung cognitive function combination</p>

<ul>
<li>Primary function - Introverted Intuition</li>
<li>Auxillary function - Introverted Thinking</li>
<li>Tertiary function - Introverted Feeling</li>
<li>Inferior function - Extroverted Sensing</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it because the Jung cognitive function combination I stated is a theoretically and/or practically impossible?  If so, why is that the case?</p>

"What does the visual feed from the retina look like before it is processed by the visual cortex?","<p>I was recently at the ACM Symposium on Applied Perception, where I saw a keynote on visual attention. The speaker (<a href=""http://ilab.usc.edu/itti/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Laurent Itti</a>) showed an animation that blew my mind. It showed a video of fish swimming in the ocean, and next to it, the same video as ""seen"" by the retina. The latter was upside down and distorted beyond recognition except at the fovea, which darted around to salient locations in the video. I had heard it explained before that ""your eye doesn't 'see' images, your brain reconstructs them,"" but I had never before seen it illustrated so well.</p>

<p>I want to find a similar animation to show friends and students, but I'm having trouble finding anything. Searches yield mostly diagrams of light passing through the eye or something similar. The only thing I've found that shows what an image actually looks like when it reaches the retina is this picture.

<p>Can you help me find such an animation? Something that shows what a raw visual feed actually looks like?</p>

"Thinking with organs/systems other than the brain","<p>Neurohormones are produced in many different bodily systems other than the brain--skin, intestines, stomach, etc. Has there been any research suggesting whether or not some people might actually perform cognitive functions normally associated only with the brain (like processing sensory input to make complex decisions) with parts of their body other than their brain? </p>

<p>For example, crows have demonstrated they are capable of complex problem solving, even though they do not have a cerebral cortex. Scientists now believe crows use their telencephalon to perform complex reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>Thus, crows use a part of their physiology not previously associated with complex reasoning for complex reasoning.</p>

<p>So, to extend the idea even further, could humans also be using organs or systems to handle processes usually presumed to be handled only by the brain? </p>

<p>Since so many bodily systems produce neurohormones, they seem like likely possible candidates.</p>

<p>Has any research been done to test this proposition?</p>

"Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity interpretation","<p>A paper I'm looking at titled ""Synaptic Modifications in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons: Dependence on Spike Timing, Synaptic Strength, and Postsynaptic Cell Type"" (can be found <a href=""http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/201/readings/02.09-OrigSTDP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) showed a relationship between spike timing and LTP/LTD. However, I'm having a bit of difficulty understanding what Figure 7 shows:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3NApw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3NApw.png"" alt=""Figure 7""></a></p>

<p>Since this photo I've seen published in multiple textbooks and reviews, it seems like a very important figure to understand what is going on. According to what they wrote in the introduction:</p>

<p>""Our results showed that postsynaptic spiking that peaked within a time window of 20 msec after synaptic activation resulted in LTP, whereas spiking within a window of 20 msec before synaptic activation led to LTD""</p>

<p>My understanding is that you have two neurons, a presynaptic neuron and a postsynaptic neuron and then based on their relative firing timings, that tells you whether or not there is an increase or decrease in the synaptic weight provided that the timings are close enough together. What confuses me as a non-biologist is how a postsynaptic spike could occur before the presynaptic spike does? I would think the only way a postsynaptic spike occurs is when the presynaptic neuron fires into the postsynaptic one. And then this time interval... is it from when the timing of the last presynaptic spike to the first spike of the postsynaptic one? Or from the first presynaptic spike since you would need multiple of them to induce a spike from the postsynaptic one? I'd mainly like to ask for more clarity over how to interpret what is happening.</p>

<p>For example, can depressed people recall the feeling of happiness by remembering a time when they were happy or thinking of something they enjoy?</p>

<p>My understanding is that if happiness can be evoked even once then they haven't lost the sense of it and maybe they can be trained to evoke it whenever by focusing on what is positive instead of what is negative. Much harder than it sounds I realize, you have to first believe you CAN be happy but I guess I am just asking if anyone lost happiness permanently, maybe through brain damage, or was born without it.</p>

"What is the opposite of an insult for the purposes of triggering lasting positive affect?","<p>Over the centuries, western cultures have developed dozens of swear words, insults and curse words that are intended to trigger acute negative affect in the recipient. If one particular word does not work, the insulter would typically cycle through the words until he/she finds the one that ""strikes a chord"" and causes the intended level of emotional distress.</p>

<p>What interests me is that the right insult quickly triggers emotional pain. Unless a person knows how to mitigate the effect, the negative emotion is likely to stay with the person for minutes to hours.</p>

<p>This makes me ask - <strong>What are there opposite of insults for the purposes of triggering positive emotion that lingers on afterwards?</strong> </p>

<p>Is there some kind of word or action that instantly triggers positive emotions of equal magnitude? Terms like praise come to mind, but I'm not sure praise is as powerful as insults.</p>

"Why is chess considered special for educating a mindful person?","<p>I can find countless quotes like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In many countries chess is incorporated into the scholastic
  curriculum. Countless researchers and studies have shown over the
  years that chess does indeed strengthen a child's mental clarity,
  fortitude, stability, and overall health. In this technologically
  driven world, chess helps aid in the synthesis and growth of certain
  areas in the brain and mind where many children can benefit as they
  grow older from the game. ""It's all condensed in a playful manner in a
  game format and it's extremely fascinating because first of all I'm in
  control of my own destiny, I'm in charge. You have to be responsible
  for your actions, you make a move, you had better think ahead about
  what's going to happen, not after it happens, because then it's too
  late. Chess teaches discipline from a very early age. It teaches you
  to have a plan and to plan ahead. If you do that, you'll be rewarded</p>

<p>These beilefs are so strong that even got <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_as_mental_training"" rel=""nofollow"">a recognition in Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I often wonder if there are any benefits to playing these games. I know that the repetitive nature creates neural pathways in the brain, but I don't think this newly developed ability is going to be used outside of one game in particular. </p>

<p>A friend of mine mentioned that perhaps these games would improve neuroplasticity, and some research indicates that certain types of games do have cognitive health benefits, (for example, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196565/#!po=7.00000"" rel=""nofollow"">in older adults</a>).

"How does the brain learn abstract maths?","<p>I have found quite a bit of information of how, on a neurological level, we learn the most basic forms of maths. We seem to be hardwired from the get go, to deal with manageable quantities, can intuitively decide whether something is more or less and even add or subtract small integers together. There have even been tests that six-month-old children already have an intuitive sense of small numbers.
Basically, this covers basic arithmetic on natural numbers.</p>

<p>However, I had a hard time finding anything about how we learn to deal with more abstract, higher level maths. What happens in our brain when we deal with functions and variables?

<p>This idea came to me through observation of how politics and media works, whether scientifically intended or just mere learned through experience, in instigating seemingly unrelated concepts in a comparison situation, and enforcing that comparison on the masses to create such rivalry between the two concepts; then have the ability to influence external factors to skew the mass opinion one way or the other. It works because they're using it then with the oldest trick in the books: divide and conquer. So they get those two things, put them in such a rivalry comparison where if one existed the other can not exist at the same time, creating division and ""teams"" of sort, then appealing to each team in some way or the other to win its loyalty.</p>

One of the benefits of their system that they tout is <a href=""http://miniscope.org/index.php?title=FAQs#How_does_the_Miniscope_system_differ_from_the_nVista_system_from_Inscopix.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">the ability to have a commutator on the data cable</a>. A commutator allows for a cable to rotate without twisting, a major problem when trying to record from freely moving animals. Other methods that I have heard of to allow rotation include a MMCX connector on the cable.</p>

<p>I haven't seen any specific recipes for solving this problem; the <a href=""http://miniscope.org"" rel=""nofollow"">miniscope website</a> has no instructions on including a commutator in the cable, only vague references to the possiblity.</p>

"Model for the Un/Conscious Mind","<p>As far as modern psychology is concerned, is there currently a standard scientific model for the conscious and unconscious mind, as well as conscious experience/perception? If so, are there any recommended resources (scientific books/articles) that detail this model? </p>

<p>I am currently reading <em>The Mind Illuminated</em> by John Yates, and while the book itself is tremendously helpful in the study and practice of mindfulness, I wanted to do some fact checking and research on the information presented in the book. </p>

<p>In the book John Yates describes all conscious perception, that is, 
<em>visual</em>, <em>auditory</em>, <em>somatosensory</em>, <em>gustatory</em>, <em>olfactory</em>, and <em>mind sense</em> (thoughts, memories, emotions)
as taking on one of two qualities:</p>

<p><strong>Attention</strong>: The cognitive ability to select and analyze specific information (sensory input, thoughts, memories, emotions, etc.) and ignore other information arising from a vast field of internal and external stimuli</p>

<p><strong>Awareness</strong>: A general cognizance of sensory information; mental objects like thoughts, memories, and feelings; and the overall state and activity of the mind. Unlike attention which isolates and analyzes specific objects, peripheral awareness is inclusive holistic, and only minimally conceptual.</p>

<p>For example, in vision, objects of <em>attention</em> result in focused and sharper visual perception, whereas object of <em>awareness</em> form our periphery and are more blurry. </p>

<p>In the <strong>Mind-System</strong> model, Yates describes the mind as having a structure depicted in this image</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNNBh.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pNNBh.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>Where the mind is divided into Unconscious and Conscious, and the Unconscious Mind is composed of the Sensory and Discriminating Mind. </p>

<p>My question to academics: does this information sound consistent with what is presented in modern day psychology &amp; cognitive science? And where may find more academic explanation of these types of models. </p>

"Evolutionary game theory in the cognitive sciences","<p>Game theory models something very relevant to psychologists (in particular social psychologists): conflict and cooperation between decision-makers.

<p>Economists and mathematicians (and others) have taken two approaches to overcome this problem.

The other is the bottom-up approach of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">evolutionary game theory</a>: start with the simplest agents (that can't even make decisions) and have natural selection, imitation, or another simple dynamic process evolve the population over time.

"What salient features of a {conditioned stimulus,unconditioned stimulus} pair are represented in the lateral amygdala?","<p>In classical conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (CS, e.g., a tone) is presented just before an unconditioned stimulus (UCS, e.g., a mild toe pinch) in repeated trials, such that the CS will eventually evoke the unconditioned response (e.g., withdrawal reflex) on its own.</p>

<p>Such memories of fear and discomfort are said to be held in the lateral amygdala, with a representation of the CS and its UCS (Díaz-Mataix et al, 2011).</p>

<p>Certain areas of the brain have particular representations of stimuli, e.g., a tone of a given frequency, as the primary auditory cortices have ""tonotopic"" zones in which different areas have a differential response to separate frequencies.</p>

<p>Since the CS/UCS pairing is more abstract than a single tone, I'm curious as to what type of representation of the CS/UCS is actually encoded within the local subnetworks  amygdala.  I can't imagine that, for the above example, a particular area holds a representative frequency of a tone used as a CS in tight collaboration with a ""pain"" signal.  It might be realistic, but anatomically, that whole area would also have to reflect an exhaustive set of all of the other possible ""life events"" that the animal has experienced.  </p>

<p>So, is this representation in the lateral amygdala just a placeholder to retrieve other pertinent memories stored elsewhere in cortex -- is the hippocampus a major player in keeping this sorted?  If, in fact, all these pairings are just weak bindings of diverse stimuli, why is it so difficult to untangle and extinguish more complex types of fears in human patients?</p>

"Knowability of ""repressed"" in Freud's theory","<p>Both Popper and Grünbaum took issue with Freud's theory, but they critiqued it for different reasons, in which the main difference seems (to me) to come down to this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Popper <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00022548"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">interprets</a> Freud as saying that something (say homosexuality) being repressed by the subject means it's a completely hidden state, so we can never know the truth value of statements like ""subject X is repressing his homosexuality"". So Popper argued that psychoanalysis is untestable because testing inferences like ""if P then Q"" (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Paul_Schreber"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">repressed homosexuality can lead to psychosis</a>) is impossible for we can never know the truth value of the antecedent (P). </p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, Grünbaum <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00022287"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">considered</a> that statements like ""repressed homosexuality can lead to psychosis"" propose testable etiologies. And it's not hard to conceive that (say) using a penile plethysmograph one can test for homosexual preference. Once we agree we can test for the latter (even if not with perfect accuracy), we can also test for (statistical) associations etc. Kihlstrom pretty much takes this view in <a href=""http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~kihlstrm/freuddead.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">listing</a> most Freudian common ""knowledge""/lore as false rather than unfalsifiable.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, Freud's theory is screwed in either case (for this example, and probably for most other). Whether it's screwed as non-falsifiable from the get go, or as falsifiable but almost certainly false ... is not incredibly interesting to most people.</p>

<p>But for the sake of curiosity, did Freud make explicit what he considered to be knowability of ""repressed""? I.e., did he assert about any repressed condition (as he conceived them) that we cannot really know whether it's really there? Is something called repressed by Freud if and only if it is a true hidden state? So, as an example ""truly repressed"" homosexulity could never show up on any plethysmograph, by this (Poppler-ian) definition of repressed. But did Freud explicitly define ""repressed"" in this absolute way?</p>

"Does MEG measure the sum of neural activity or the maximum?","<p>According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, neurons give a response that generates a readable MEG signal when they are firing in a relatively synchronized manner and their current carrying dendrites/axons are all aligned.

"Is there a known mechanism by which people fall asleep less easy after watching TV?","<p>It's my experience that people (I am one of them) tend to fall asleep while watching television. Afterwards, when lying in bed, sleep doesn't come as easy as when they were watching television. </p>

<p>Is this because only the ""small"" part of the brain that is involved in watching television (and when you experience that what you're watching ain't worth looking at, so you fall asleep before you can switch the canal) and the other parts ""wake up"" when you're lying in bed, which makes it harder for you to fall asleep? Or is it just linked to being tired (in which case you would expect to fall asleep easy in bed)?</p>

<p>You can examine this by letting a group of people (<strong>or</strong> men <strong>or</strong> women, not both) of about the same age, physical health, etc. letting perform the same things (like eating, waking up at the same time, doing the same physical tasks), and before going to sleep letting them watch the same movie on TV. I think doing this a month suffices. After a month of collecting data (from questions asked and physical examinations), you're maybe able to say something useful.</p>

"Can non-spiking neurons have a sustained synaptic output current?","<p>I'm trying to better understand neural models, specifically non-spiking neurons in invertebrate motor control circuits.  I know that a spiking neuron produces spikes in membrane potential that rapidly go away and exhibit an all-or-none response.  I've also been reading that non-spiking neurons generally exhibit a graded potential.  What I don't know is if that graded potential is sustained, or if it rapidly goes away like in a spiking neuron.  In other words, if the membrane potential rises, is it possible for that membrane potential to stay elevated for long periods of time?  If so, what types of mechanisms might cause that?</p>

  past that goal to succeed? Why haven’t these results been published?”</p>

"Thinking Fast and Slow: Similarity of Linda problem and Dinnerware case","<p>While reading Daniel Kahneman's ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" I've been stuck on the claim that Linda case and Dinnerware case have the same structure.</p>

<p><strong>Linda problem:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She
  majored  in  philosophy.  As  a  student,  she  was  deeply concerned
  with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also
  participated in antinuclear demonstrations.""</p>
  
  <p>""Which alternative is more probable?</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Linda is a bank teller.</li>
  <li>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It is well-known that the majority of respondents chooses the second options (as most plausible, though the original question is about probability).</p>

<p><strong>The Dinnerware case:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being presented two sets of dinnerware:</p>
  
  <p>Set A: 40 pieces / Set B: 24 pieces</p>
  
  <p>Dinner plates: 8, all in good condition / 8, all in good condition
  <br/> Soup/salad bowls: 8, all in good condition / 8, all in good
  condition <br/> Dessert plates: 8, all in good condition / 8, all in
  good condition <br/> Cups: 8, 2 of them broken / NONE <br/> Saucers:
  8, 7 of them broken / NONE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is known that respondents tend to select Set B, though it is more beneficial to select set A.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the question:</strong> </p>

<p>The dinnerware case is explained via the notion of 'averaging'. That is, person's System 1 (Kahneman's terminology) performs some kind of averaging and goes to conclusion, that as Set B items are not broken and in average cost more, then the whole Set B shall be preferred.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From the perspective of economic theory, this result is troubling: the
  economic value of a dinnerware set [...] is a sum-like variable."" I.e.
  pure summation shall be performed where averaging and subsequent
  assessment is carried out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Linda problem and the dinnerware problem <strong>have exactly the same
  structure</strong> (??).  Probability,  like  economic  value,  is  a 
  sum-like  variable,  as illustrated by this example: probability
  (Linda is a teller) = probability (Linda is feminist teller)
  + probability (Linda is non-feminist teller)"" ""System 1 averages instead of adding, so when the non-feminist bank tellers are removed
  from the set, subjective  probability  increases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is my difficulty: I do not see how the 'averaging' notion applies to the Linda problem. When I myself think about Linda question, I do not realize that try to average something, I just want to construct something that fits my stereotypes. Otherwise, when I think about dinnerware, I agree that subconsciously try to maximize the average price of item.</p>

"What are the conditions of deliberate practice?","<p><strong>TL;DR: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for deliberate practice?</strong></p>

<p>Longer version:
I've read a number of books/articles on deliberate practice and its role in acquiring expertise.  The texts make a compelling case for the argument that a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate practice is required to develop expertise in a particular field.  The implication of the research is undoubtedly optimistic (as it largely dispels the notion of being born talented - with certain semi-exceptions, notably, athletes).  However, I struggle when it comes to translating the research into practical takeaways for myself.</p>

<p>As someone who'd like to apply the concept of deliberate practice to his profession/hobbies, it would be useful to have a rigorous/comprehensive definition of deliberate practice that I could effectively use as a check-list.  But in the material I've read, it seems that ""deliberate practice"" is effectively defined as (and I'm paraphrasing): ""the type of practice of which 10,000 hours are needed in order to develop expertise"".</p>

<p><em>So, to put it differently (from the TL;DR above):<br></em>
<strong>How do I know if I'm practicing effectively?  (Aside from practicing a certain way for 10,000 hours and seeing if I become an expert)</strong></p>

<p>When a fictional character is killed, no one dies – and the readers and viewers know this, no matter how much they identify with the story. So what does this narrative device actually mean? Aristotle thought that the death of a character evokes emotions in the viewers that then allow the author to convince them of his narrative argument. He calls this ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos"" rel=""nofollow"">pathos</a>"". Following Aristoteles, the death of a character ""means"" that the audience becomes more susceptible to what the author wants them to believe (the moral of the story). But that is the author's perspective on what he can do with the death of a character, and does not explain how the audience experience and understand it.</p>

<p>To answer this question, we may have to first understand how the audience perceives the character.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A character is no more a human being than the Venus of Milo is a real woman. A character is ... a metaphor for human nature. ~ Robert McKee, <em>Story</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A character is a symbol that stands in for something that affects the reader or viewer: their deams and aspirations; or their fears. And thus the death of a symbol may symbolize that a dream will remain unfulfilled or a fear is overcome. Death in the media, I believe, is not final but transformative, and not real but symbolic, and this becomes most apparent in the journey to the underworld (read ""death"") of many mystical heroes. But that is only my opinion.</p>

<p>Is there research that tries to answer this question from the perspective of psychology?</p>

<p>Or, in the absence of such research, how would <em>you</em> study it?</p>

<hr>

<p>In his comment, Steven Jeuris remarks, that a fictional character's death means that he dies in the fictional world. Let me elaborate on that.</p>

<p>Readers of fiction don't read like news readers. A newspaper reader reads to learn what has happened in the world he lives in, and (maybe) to understand why. Because these events (and their reasons) affect his own life and the decisions he has to make.</p>

<p>Readers of fiction, on the other hand, do not read to be informed. They read to experience emotions, to escape their own lives, to be inspired, and so on. The facts of the fictional world are irrelevant to their own lives, but the emotions they elicit, the ideas they generate, and the time spent away from the demands of their own lives are important to them.</p>

<p>If a neighbor, politician or artist dies in the real world, and I read about it, this affects my own life. My life has been changed (because a person is missing from it) or it will be changed (because politics will change). If a fictional character dies, nothing changes in my life.</p>

<p>What is changed, is the <em>story</em>.</p>

<p>And story logic is not like the chains of cause and effect (or chance) that govern the events in real life. In the real world, many (if not most) people die through forces that lie outside of their influence. They die of old age or are run over by drunk drivers. In the fictional world, everything happens by design, and that design is based on the story's premise and the characters actions. In a fictional world, no one dies by chance, and even old age has a meaning.</p>

<p>Very simplified, in a (classic type of) story a character achieves his goals, if he overcomes his deficits. If he refuses to grow, he fails. Death is the reward for moral failure. Think of the hero killing his antagonist or the first two knights being eaten by the dragon: these characters don't just die and then they are dead, but their death means that their way of life was wrong.</p>

<p>But of course stories are usually more complicated than that today. Characters aren't simply good or bad, they are ""realistic"", like real people. And the world they inhabit isn't as simply structured as that of a fairy tale, it is ""realistic"", like the real world. In Game of Thrones, characters die apparently like in the real world: despite being the good guys.</p>

<p>But still, it is not the real world. If the good guy dies in Game of Thrones, it is <strong>not</strong> because Game of Thrones is realistic and characters in its world die just like people in real life, but because it is not what we are used to from narrative conventions and it surprises us. The death of the good guy in Game of Thrones means that we cannot trust what we have learned about how stories work. It does not mean that someone died. It is sad and frustrating, because we wanted Ned Stark to succeed, but at the same time it is thrilling and satisfying, because it is novel.</p>

<p>These are just examples, and there will be disagreement over the <em>interpretation</em> of these stories, but I hope they serve to illustrate that the death of a fictional character does <strong>not</strong> mean (<strong>to the reader !</strong>) that this ""person"" has died in the fictional world. It means something different or on top of that to the reader (who knows, which is important, that no one has died !).</p>

<p>Of course, every death in fiction might be interpreted differently – depending on the specific story. But I think that it must be possible to generalize and find an underlying similarity or several ""types of fictional deaths"".</p>

<p>Finally, I think that this question does not belong on another site, because the study of the psychology of reading books or viewing movies (that is, the psychology of the audience) is the task of the psychologist just like advertising psychology (which also deals with how stories work on their audience).</p>

<p>So if you want, think of my question of belonging in advertising psychology: Does the clean shirt the housewife pulls from the washing mashine mean that the shirt has been cleaned? No. It means that the washing powder is better than other washing powders (or, if you are a cynic, that that is what the advertiser wants us to believe). The meaning of the clean shirt depends on the intent of the narrator and the circumstances of the narration (in an ad).</p>

<p>Similarly, the meaning of a fictional death will depend on the (reader perceived) intent of the narrator (who, by the way, is not the author) and the circumstances of the narration (a book, a tv show). But I don't want to do a (subjective) literary interpretation (like I did here), but learn how this has been studied or, if no such studies have been undertaken, study it with psychological methodology.</p>

<p>Hope this now makes a bit more sense.</p>

"Combining unbiased hit rates","<p>I am analysing data on an emotion perception task, where participants must decide if a given face is happy, sad, angry or fearful (essentially a forced choice between 4 options).</p>

<p>I am confident that I want to calculate an unbiased hit rate for each emotion (as in Wagner 1993). This takes a confusion matrix (toy example below):</p>

<pre><code>        Happy    Sad    Angry   Fearful
Happy     4       1       0        1
Sad       0       3       2        1 
Angry     0       0       6        0
Fearful   2       0       0        4
</code></pre>

<p>And the unbiased hit rate is then the correct answers squared, divided by the number of times that answer is used multiplied by the number of trials where that answer was correct. So in the above example:</p>

<pre><code>Hu(Happy) = 4^2 / ((4+0+0+2)*6) = 16/36 = 0.444
Hu(Sad) = 9/24 = 0.375
Hu(Angry) = 36/48 = 0.75
Hu(Fearful) = 16/36 = 0.444
</code></pre>

<p>These are then converted with an arcsine tranformation on the square root for use as the dependent variable in regression.</p>

<p>However, I want to use this data to assess general ability at emotion recognition in faces - what is the correct way to combine the unbiased hit rates? That is, can I generate a single value that accounts for all off these, or should I run four separate analyses and examine the overlap in the results?</p>

"How to ethically research the effect of expert lies on lay people","<p>I'm conducting a study about the effects of a verbally administered placebo.</p>

<p>The actual setting and intervention are different from the example I give here, but similar enough that the example may serve as a basis for discussion.</p>

<p>In the study, a team of psychologists running a local practice offers a new experimental service. The psychologists have developed a diagnostic tool that allows them to predict with surprising accuracy if a single person will fall in love within the upcoming four weeks. To further test and refine this diagnostic tool they now offer a public service after having tested it on a small sample of students. So they invite local residents to their practice to be tested through an advertisement and offer them a free diagnosis, whether or not they will fall in love within the next two weeks. The participants are told that the diagnostic tool for this prognosis is being evaluated in its predictive power and that they should report back after four weeks and tell the researchers if they had fallen in love or not.</p>

<p>Of course there is no diagnostic tool. The psychologists believe that they are being perceived as experts by the laypeople, and that if they make such a prediction after some impressive psychological examination, this prediction will <em>cause</em> people to fall in love, if without this intervention they would not have, or remain ""out of love"", if they had fallen in love.</p>

<p>Obviously, the researchers do not want to give negative (not fall in love) prognoses, because they do not want anyone to refuse and miss out on an ""offer"" they would have been happy about. (They do not believe that they will cause people to fall in love with unsuitable suitors and cause grief, only that participants with a will-fall-in-love prognosis will react more benevolently and accepting to offers they receive.) And, in the absence of negative prognoses, the researchers will need a control group that receives no prediction, but still reports back after two weeks.</p>

<p>The psychologists do not know how to set up this experiment so that they can give positive (fall in love) diagnoses or no diagnosis to random participants, without raising suspicion. Some of the patients will obviously know each other and talk about this experimental ""service"", and they will notice that they know no one with a negative diagnosis. That would seem odd to them. Also the reason to not give a diagnosis to many participants must be valid without raising doubt regarding the validity of the prognoses that were given.</p>

<p><strong>What would you tell your participants to allay their doubts over the absence of negative prognoses?</strong> And how would you explain that often you do not give a prognosis, without invalidating the prognoses you give?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>

<p>Since the ethic concerns are being pushed to the forefront of the discussion, I have edited my question to include an example that more closely resembles the real research. Yet, I want to repeat that <strong>this is an example only</strong>, so please don't get hung up on the specifics of falling in love. The real study includes psychologists and a behavior prediction, but not about falling in love. Similar research has been done in a laboratory setting, the difference is I want to do it out ""in the field"".</p>

<p>If you are worried about psychologists lying to their participants, you need to understand that cover stories are a common method in psychological research. They are in fact so very common, that it is easier to list instances where cover stories are <em>not</em> used: only if the knowledge of the purpose of the study cannot falsify the results are participants told in advance what is being studied and how. In all other cases the researchers lie to the participants and debrief them after the experient.</p>

<p>Of course, if there is any danger that this lie would have lasting or strong negative effects, such research will not be conducted.</p>

<p>You can safely assume that</p>

<ul>
<li>participants will be informed that they are taking part in an experiment and asked to give their consent (this is easily part of the cover story, as it allows to not give a prognosis to some of the participants)</li>
<li>participants will be debriefed by a trained psychologist</li>
<li>participants will be given contact information and told to contact a team member when they observe any kind of effect at all, positive or negative (since we want to measure these effects, this is easily part of the cover story)</li>
<li>an ethics commitee of our university will evaluate the study design</li>
</ul>

<p>Since similar ""lies"" have been told to participants of other experiments before, I am quite confident that this study will be approved by our ethics committee also.

<p>As it turned out, it was the sounds of waterfalls, leaves and trees for the whole 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Even though I like this 15 minute sound clip, I wonder how this could help in improving positivity if we listen to it regularly?</p>

<p>This is the whole text that I received as e-mail after signing up for the AD,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some people report feeling much more relaxed. Others feel that time speeds up -- or slows down. Almost everyone reports that it's an enjoyable experience! And what about the sounds of rustling leaves and trickling waterfalls? We travelled to Derbyshire, in the heart of rural England, and spent a month capturing the natural sounds used in the BrainEv program. But what you might not realize is...There's actually much, much more going on in the background! You see, the sounds of the streams and trees are really just a rich ""sound mask"" for the powerful brainwave recordings that are playing in the background. Let me explain a little more...Your brain cells all talk to each other using tiny little electrical signals. With billions of these brain cells talking at once, that's a pretty significant amount of electrical activity -- and can be detected with an EEG machine. This electrical activity is what we call a brainwave. And the brainwave frequencies change, depending on what state you're in. When you're happy, when you're focused, when you're asleep -- your brainwaves all have very specific frequencies. And here's the exciting part. Using a science known as 'brainwave entrainment', we can now create special brainwave audio recordings, which play specific frequencies to the brain. The brain copies these frequencies, and effectively RECREATES the original brainwave pattern. That means we can recreate brainwave patterns that help you relax and release stress... that activate your intelligence... that improve your mood... that help you feel more focused during the day. Not only that, but by accessing these peak performance states on a daily basis (as with the BrainEv program), they'll start becoming second nature -- and available to you literally on-demand.</p>

"What makes some things more fun than others universally?","<p>Recently I have been presented with the question, ""What makes something addictive, and why are some activities more addicting than others?""

<p>My question is: <strong>what makes some fun things addictive and some things not, and overall, ""What is fun?""</strong> For example, your average adolescent would find playing video games, watching television and communicating through social media ""fun"", while also finding recreational activities like drawing, playing sports, and, say, board games ""fun"".

For example, is it possible to know experimentally whether the muscle memory required to play a piano needs more memory/resources than the memory needed to read a piano sheet? </p>

"Jung - Anima and Animus","<p>In the book <em>Man and His Symbols</em> Jung discusses the <em>Anima</em> and <em>Animus</em> extensively.  As I understand it they are the two primary anthropomorphic archetypes of the collective unconscious.  The Anima is expressed as the inner feminine personality in the unconscious of man; the Animus as the inner masculine personality of the unconscious of female</p>

<p>I found it strange that Jung only talks about the Anima in terms of the male psyche, and the Animus in term of the female psyche.</p>

<p>My question is why isn't there an Animus concept in the male psyche or an Anima concept in the female psyche?</p>

<p>Where is the archetype of the male part of the male unconscious and the female part of the female unconscious? Is that just another piece of the psyche the Jung defines as part of the Self?  Where does the Animus live in the male total psyche? </p>

"What form might Jungian archetypes take in the brain?","<p>Modern psychology and psychiatry are very well grounded in scientific principles.  Both, however, have a history in various analytical philosophies.  Jung had the notion of an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes"">archetype</a>, a universally known symbol.  While these are perhaps fanciful concepts, I think that it can be interesting to try to reconcile them in terms of current knowledge.  </p>

<p>A modern author (Knox 2001) makes the following assessment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suggest that although, like Freud, Jung contradicted himself at times, there is a lot of evidence that he viewed archetypes as innate predispositions with an organizing function.  I think it is one of the possible models for archetypes that we need to research extensively by investigating the ways in which an understanding of 'frames' and image schemas may advance our concept.  We need to gain a clearer understanding of the extent to which archetypes are 'hard-wired', genetically inherited structures or, on the other hand, self-organizing patterns that emerge as a central part of the development of meaning by the human brain as...recently proposed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the arguments about genetically driven versus self-organizing patterns are fascinating, but in this question, I'd like to presuppose the latter.  </p>

<p>If these patterns were to exist, what sensory modalities would be stored in combination?  Are they exclusively visual, or is there a tight binding between the visual and auditory components of these memories?  Could different memories be combinations of modular archetypal ""bases"" or would each be unique?</p>

"Is there a region of cortex which over a period of development becomes the seat of self?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Mountcastle's hypothesis, which is based on the observation of uniform cortical anatomy, suggests that the there might be a uniform cortical ""algorithm"". The only reason that some cortical regions seem to be specialized for particular functions, like vision, hearing, etc. is that they happen to be connected to corresponding sensory input. The <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/25/science/rewired-ferrets-overturn-theories-of-brain-growth.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ferret sensory input rewiring experiments</a> confirms this hypothesis (rewiring auditory cortex in ferrets to receive visual input, lets them see just as good). </p>

<p>Regions of the cortex which are not connected directly to any sensory input listen in on the broadcasts that are sent by neighboring regions, either directly or through the thalamus (which is currently thought to be some sort of relaying mechanism) and do further transformations and refinements at a more abstract level. For example in the case of vision, it is known that the primary visual cortex, V1, consists of a sheet of cells/columns that are sensitive to edges oriented and/or moving in particular directions. The ""higher"" regions of visual cortex, take the output of V1 and further process it. Neurons in V4, for example, are known to be sensitive to objects like a chair or a dog <em>or your grandmother</em>. Much of this is discussed in detail by Jeff Hawkins in <em>On Intelligence</em> where he speculates that cortical regions are connected up in a hierarchy something like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCMRh.jpg"" alt=""Cortical Hierarchy - On Intelligence""></p>

<p>Hawkins, however, does not talk much about that top level region, and only makes a passing speculation that it might be the hippocampus. <strong>But, it seems to be screaming at you, that whatever it is, it must be the seat of the self.</strong> </p>

<p>Googling on these ideas led me to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_theater"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cartesian Theater</a>, a term that philosopher, Daniel Dennett derisively uses to refer to the idea that there is a central place in the brain, where everything comes together. For example, in the <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Multiple_drafts_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Multiple drafts model</a> Dennett says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The multiple drafts model of consciousness was developed as an
  alternative to the perennially attractive, but incoherent, model of
  conscious experience called Cartesian materialism, the idea that after
  early unconscious processing occurs in various relatively peripheral
  brain structures ""everything comes together"" in some privileged
  central place in the brain, which one might call the <strong>Cartesian Theater</strong>
  -- for ""presentation"" to the inner self or homunculus. <em>There is no such place in the brain</em>, but many theories seem to presuppose that
  there must be something like it.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I didn't find his arguments very compelling.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p><strong>Given that there are regions of cortex that are dedicated to vision, sound, touch processing, etc., is there a region of cortex, that listens to only the final assembled portions from several ""lower"" regions of cortex, which then over a period of development (by age 1.5?) becomes the seat of self?</strong> </p>

<p>If this is the case, Dennett's criticism of the Cartesian Theater and a 'homunculus' observing it is outdated.</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>I believe the source of all the homunculus confusion to be the little green homunculus in <em>Men In Black I</em>, and Daniel Dennett's use of this imagery to caricature any argument for a region in the brain where everything comes together and therefore being the seat of the self. </p>

<p>In essence what I'm saying is that only a small subset of the brain is the seat of consciousness, the reason being that large portions of the cortex seem to essentially be doing pre-processing steps. For example, V1 the largest area of the cortex seems to be <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/1125/where-is-the-visual-image-that-we-see-finally-assembled"">assembling the visual field from the split up portions</a> coming from the eye via the LGN in the thalamus. </p>

<p>This by itself does not lead to an infinite regress, as the problem (of making sense of the world) is simplified a lot after all the pre-processing steps. </p>

<p>Another way of putting my point is via the following simple analogies:</p>

<pre><code>| body        | brain                         | Self      |
|-------------+-------------------------------+-----------|
| corporation | executive staff               | CEO       |
| army        | officer corps                 | General   |
| nation      | congress/senate/supreme court | President |
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Some more clarification on the homunculus fallacy confusion:</strong> 
Almost everyone agrees that no fallacy whatsoever is being made by saying that the brain is the seat of consciousness (SoC). Similarly, no fallacy is made merely by claiming that a subset of the brain is the SoC. A homunculus fallacy is made if it is further claimed that by identifying the SoC, an explanation of consciousness has been given. <strong><em>As Dennett rightly says, an explanation of consciousness should not contain components that are themselves fully conscious</em></strong>. Doing so only postpones the problem and leads to infinite regress. In my question's background, I'm not trying to imply that I have explained consciousness, all I'm saying is that there is evidence that only a subset of the brain is the SoC, and this SoC could be regarded as being at the center of a Cartesian theater. And of course, instead of light and sound being projected/played in this theater, there are only streams of neural spikes, representing light, sound, etc. in transduced form.  </p>

"Why do participants prefer to give input values that are ""round numbers""?","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I have just been analysing some data where participants attempt to control a dynamic system with integer numeric inputs between 0 and 100. I've noticed that there is a general tendency for participants to give responses that are divisible by 10 (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 30, etc.). After that participants' second favourite input values are those divisible by 5 but not by 10 ( e.g., 5, 15, 25, 35, etc.). After that excluding some general patterns in the data, all the other input numbers appear about equally common (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, etc.).</p>

<p>Perhaps in a related way, I can also remember from market research that when you ask people how often they do certain things, as the number gets larger, they will often show a similar tendency to approximate and use numbers divisible by 10 or 100 and so on.  I also seem to remember reading research where people report number of sexual partners, where a similar tendency was observed.</p>

<p>Thus, this tendency is consistent with a preference for what are informally referred to as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_number"">""round numbers""</a>, where as in Wikipedia it is argued that ""a number ending in 5 might be considered in a way more ""round"" than one ending in neither 0 nor 5. ""</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<ul>
<li>What explains people's general tendency to prefer certain input values when trying to control a system (e.g., numbers divisible by 10 or 5)?</li>
<li>Is there any specific research that has quantified this effect in another system control task?</li>
<li>Does a similar mechanism underlie the popularity of such numbers in a system control task as does in a frequency estimation task?</li>

<p>The top level is activity itself, oriented towards its <em>motive</em>. At a lower level lie conscious <em>goal</em>-directed <em>actions</em> that must be undertaken to fulfill the object.

At the lowest level lie automatic processes which happen subconsciously, called <em>operations</em>. This is how actions are eventually carried out.</p>

<p><strong>I'm not entirely sure where the distinction lies between motives and goals.</strong> A motive is an object that meets a certain need of the subject, while actions are goal-directed processes that must be undertaken to fulfill the object. (Kaptelinin 2009)</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>I am creating an iPhone app where I need to show transient confirmation messages. For example, when a user submits a comment, I pop up a message saying ""<em>thanks for submitting your comment</em>"". Shortly after, the message will fade away. There exist many such transient messages all over my iPhone app. </p>

<p>What I would like to do is to calculate the optimal time to show each message based off of the number of characters in that message. I want users to have enough time to comfortably read the message, but not so long that the message annoys them. The purely UX version of this question is here:</p>

"Medium-term effects of polyphasic sleep on performance","<p>Typical sleep patterns of one big block of 6 to 9 hours with no naps is usually referred to as monophasic sleep. A second natural sleep pattern is biphasic sleep which breaks up your sleep into two chunks (<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x/abstract"">Wehr, 1992</a>; <a href=""http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/106.2/ah000343.html"">Ekirch, 2001</a>). My question concerns <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep"">polyphasic sleep</a> which partitions your sleep in 3 or more periods during the day.</p>

<p>From personal experience (and anecdotal evidence; this is a <a href=""http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=892542"">popular</a> <a href=""http://officialuberman.blogspot.ca/"">blogging</a> <a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/4/15/103358/720"">topic</a>), I know that the first one to two weeks of trying to keep a difficult polyphasic sleep schedule (say uberman that divides your day into 6 evenly spaced half-hour naps) produces very low performance. At first you are unable to fall asleep and you need your alarm clock to wake up and you feel groggy, agitated and slow. However, after the first week, a lot of these negative effects seem to disappear as you grow accustomed to the schedule. You start to get very vivid dreams during your naps (and I started to wake without the need for alarm clock) suggesting REM sleep. However, I have never subjected myself to proper performance tests while attempting polyphasic sleep.</p>

<p><strong>What are the medium term (more than 2 weeks, less than a year) effects of polyphasic sleep on performance of tasks like working memory, reading speed and comprehension, and IQ tests?</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, most sleep studies are less than two weeks in duration and report the obvious negative effects; except on working-memory which benefits from naps. Alternatively, they are military studies that only track vigilance (not having micro-sleeps)(<a href=""http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00207459809000648"">Porcu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=""http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=678063"">Rhodes &amp; Gil, 2003</a>) , or have physical measures of no interest to me (<a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02678378908256879"">Stampi, 1989</a>).</p>

"How do you predict a cognitive bias theoretically using dual process theory?","<p>Disclaimer: I am a complete layman in psychology, with no education in the field whatsoever. This question was prompted by my reading Kahneman's ""Thinking Fast and Slow"", in which he discusses the model of System 1 and System 2 extensively. </p>

<p>I thought many of the cognitive biases and other psychological effects were fascinating to read about, and I really enjoyed it. But every time he brought the ""two systems"" into the discussion of a particular cognitive bias (such as the affect heuristic or hindsight bias), it felt like he was using it as a post hoc explanation of how the effect could be described by certain characteristics of the two systems. It was never clear to me how you can show that the dual process <em>implies</em> the existence of the discussed effect.</p>

<p>I think he did a far better job showing how certain psychological effects result from prospect theory. It's easy to show, for example, how prospect theory implies the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect#Theoretical_explanations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">endowment effect</a>, as shown in the given link. Even though knowledge of the endowment effect existed before prospect theory, it's easy to see how the endowment effect could have been <em>predicted</em> by prospect theory. You can even <em>prove</em> that it would exist, given the utility function of prospect theory and the right axioms.</p>

<p>But I'm confused about how you can do the same with dual process theory, and the cognitive biases that it supposedly explains. <strong>How can you use dual process theory to predict the existence of a cognitive bias?</strong> Are there examples of cognitive biases that were, or can be explicitly predicted using DPT? </p>

<p>If this is just a poorly framed question--if predicting cognitive biases is not one of the purposes of the theory--then what is the purpose of dual process theory?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: I want to make a few clarifications here.
My concern is neither with the predictive success of DPT - or other theories to which I compare it - nor is it with whether the things that DPT can predict have already been discovered before DPT. The example I used - prospect theory, and its ""prediction"" of the endowment effect - is both retroactive (the effect was known before the theory), and according to the answer by Fizz, has questionable predictive verification. However, the manner by which you can use the theory to make the prediction is quite clear. If we assume the value curve given by prospect theory, and the claim of prospect theory that a person's perceived value of a gain or loss is relative to their current position rather than absolutely dependent on the final state, then it follows logically that an individual's perceived gain in value for acquiring something is lower than their perceived loss in value for losing the same thing. This can be answered in theory, on pen and paper, given the framing of the scenario and the axioms of prospect theory.</p>

<p>With dual process theory I want to understand:</p>

<ol>
<li>what kind of predictions it can make about human behavior</li>
<li><em>how</em> to make those predictions using the theory</li>
</ol>

<p>Since this is seemingly a very celebrated modern theory of human behavior, I just want to know how it's <em>used</em>. I don't mind if every known consequence of dual process theory was discovered before the theory, nor do I mind if the method is not as rigorous as that of a physics theory.</p>

"Psychological effects of statutory rape - differences by gender?","<p>Occasionally, criminal cases where female teachers have sex with male students make the news. I have the impression that many people are much less critical of that than when the victim is female, and some say they'd have been thrilled at the prospect of that happening to them when they were teenage boys.</p>

<p>I don't see the same happening when girls get raped by their teachers; I don't see similar jealousy from women. <strong>That makes me wonder:</strong> is there a significant difference in the psychological effects of statutory rape on teens, assuming the teens saw the rape as consensual from their perspective? Are there insights by gender on how many teens that were victims of statutory rape considered the events consensual (ignoring whether we would classify their ""consent"" as such in a cognitive-development sense), and how that affected the effects of the rape on their psyche?</p>

<p>Googling these issues brings up a large body of heavily political opinion with very scattered actual references and data that I could look into, and none of the material I could find addressed the questions I'm curious about scientifically. Even an article on <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-act-violence/201208/female-teachers-sexual-predators"" rel=""noreferrer"">psychologytoday.com</a> that seemed relevant doesn't have any actual references to data or studies.

<p>scholar.google.com had a lot of material, most of it was focused on the experiences of females, and I couldn't find any that compared the effects on males and females, or that made any evaluation that took the willingness of the victims into account.</p>

<p>Basically, there's a lot of politicized material that's largely useless as a source of knowledge about the subject, and a decent amount of scientific material that I don't have the necessary skills and knowledge to evaluate or navigate. </p>

This article by <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1068%2Fp160049"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mcleod (1987)</a> may be a better, more reliable benchmark for my question, as it comes from a more reputable source and states both the low and high bounds  of tested human reaction times (p. 49):</p>

"In what contexts is loss aversion least controversial?","<p>Loss aversion (and related phenomena like the endowment effect) are somewhat controversial, it seems; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion#Questions_about_its_existence"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recently, studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. In several studies examining the effect of losses in decision making under risk and uncertainty no loss aversion was found.[6] There are several explanations for these findings: one, is that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes; the other, is that the generality of the loss aversion pattern is lower than that thought previously. Finally, losses may have an effect on attention but not on the weighting of outcomes; as suggested, for instance, by the fact that losses lead to more autonomic arousal than gains even in the absence of loss aversion.[7] This latter effect is sometimes known as Loss Attention.[8] Even in a non-risky domain, prospective affective judgments about gains and losses show that loss aversion is magnitude dependent such that for low magnitudes there is no loss aversion [9]</p>
  
  <p>Loss aversion may be more salient when people compete. Gill and Prowse (2012) provide experimental evidence that people are loss averse around reference points given by their expectations in a competitive environment with real effort.[10]</p>
  
  <p>David Gal (2006) argued that many of the phenomena commonly attributed to loss aversion, including the status quo bias, the endowment effect, and the preference for safe over risky options, are more parsimoniously explained by inertia than by a loss/gain asymmetry. Gal and Rucker (2018) made similar arguments.[11][12] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, are there some areas/contexts in which loss aversion isn't controversial? Large payoffs for instance? And are there enough studies to reliably conclude anything, e.g. via meta-analyses (say with moderator analysis)?</p>

"Is there some cognitive test besides (visual) working memory in which some animals are superior to humans?","<p>Assuming the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.027"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">research of Matsuzawa et al. (2007)</a> (see also <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BBC video (2013)</a>) isn't misleading, are there any other cognitive areas where chimpanzees (or other primates) have been observed to surpass humans?</p>

<p>For more context: trained chimpanzees seem to be able to memorize the random position on a screen of numbers from 1-9 in a very short amount of time, beating humans in the same test. There is one report from <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-008-0206-8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">US researchers</a> which could not replicate this though.</p>

<p>Based on those observations Matsuzawa has advanced the <a href=""https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199549221.003.11"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cognitive-tradeoff (evolutionary) hypothesis</a> (there's a longer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vsauce video</a> on that): essentially the idea is that humans ""gave up"" a good working visual memory for  improvements in other kinds of cognitive abilities (This formulation is a little improper since chimpanzees evolved separately from our common ancestor with them, hence the scare quotes.) </p>

<p>Anyway, I want to know if this is the only known cognitive phenomenon in which (some) animals beat humans. Since training does play a significant role in the research mentioned above (and this seems to be crux of the controversy surrounding), I'm lowering the bar to asking if trained animals can beat untrained humans on some other cognitive task. I still think this question is informative (e.g. with respect to the power of learning), even with a stacked deck training-wise.</p>

To make the last question clear, in machine learning the typical approach is to compute the gradient of a loss function which compares the model's prediction with the ground truth, and the model's parameters are updated by moving the parameters in the direction of the gradient. If the visual cortex is learning advanced visual skills by virtue of a similar learning mechanism, then what kind of loss function is the visual cortex optimizing?</p>

"Relation of serotonin level and mood/depression","<p>Not a biologist. Not even related to science, however I read a lot of popular psychology stuff, plus read some info about antidepressants and a question tortures me :)</p>

<p>Antidepressants arise amount of serotonin in blood in short period of time. However, you should take antidepressants for quite a long period of time so that it took effect. Up to 1-4 months.</p>

<p>As I heard there is no explanation about this fact. On the one hand we know that serotonin affects our mood, on the other hand for some reason we cannot fix our mood by just increasing its level straight away.</p>

<p>So the question is: is there any explanation of this, and what I (as a non-scientist) am wondering more about is that why then we feel better after consuming such things as chocolate, sugar etc, which indirectly might increase serotonin level? </p>

<p>Plus, why we cannot consume large amounts of L-tryptophan for example? If I overdose tryptophan nothing scary happens, while if I overdose prozak or zoloft, I can end up with coma probably.</p>

<p>There are a lot of pop psychology articles talking about hormones, however I suspect that trying to change the level of hormones by some actions (which are advised by the articles, I don't know, starting from eating sweeties and ending with doing sports) won't change it much. I know that there should be some ""normal"" values of serotonin in blood (ng/mL). But I don't believe that if I go to sauna and eat snickers it will increase this level drastically :) Nevertheless I'll feel better. While if I take antidepressants and they will indeed increase the level, I won't feel happy right away. Why so?</p>

<li>lowering serotonin in otherwise healthy volunteers, with no history of depression</li>
<li>lowering serotonin in subjects with a history of depression</li>
<li>lowering serotonin in SSRI (or similarly) medicated patients</li>
</ul>

<p>Potentially, we could try to matrix the type of subjects with the type of intervention, although at the moment I can recall only one intervention that could (ethically) be used: depletion of tryptophan (which is serotonin precursor) via competition from other amino acids. (Selective) neurotoxins, which are used in some animal studies, being a rather obvious no-no in live human subjects.</p>

<p>And to the extent that one can address this concisely (if not perhaps suggest/ask a different question), what are the methodological limitations of such experiments? One that I can think of is that since antidepressants need a bit of time to build up their effects to clinically detectable mood changes, perhaps the same time-related issue holds in the opposite direction, i.e. how long serotonin depletion lasts potentially could matter for the mood outcome of such experiments.</p>

"Is tianeptine addictive?","<p>A recent <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2014.30"" rel=""noreferrer"">(2014) study</a> in cell cultures has found that tianeptine is a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist (and [mentioning for completeness] delta opioid receptor agonist as well, albeit weaker).

  <p>When current IQ tests are developed, the median raw score of the norming sample is defined as IQ 100 and scores each standard deviation (SD) up or down are defined as 15 IQ points greater or less,[2] although this was not always so historically. By this definition, approximately two-thirds of the population scores between IQ 85 and IQ 115, and about 5 percent of the population scores above 125.[3][4]</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Who (organization/person/entity) establishes or updates the coefficients which make the average test score for given age to correspond to IQ of 100, and the standard deviation increments of 15?</p></li>
<li><p>Who is the test group: how is the tested population providing the raw data for establishing the above selected?

"Qualitative scoring for responses to design fluency task","<p>Before I can ask my questions, I have to give a little background information.  I'm involved in a study using a measure of design fluency.  Subjects are shown a page full of squares, like the one shown below.  Each square contains 5 dots.  Subjects are given 60 seconds to generate as many different designs as fast as they can by connecting dots in each square.  The criteria for correct designs are that the designs must contain 4 lines and that all the lines in the design must be continuous.  There are 2 trials in the test: one with 5 black dots and one with 5 black dots and 5 white dots.  In the second trial, the extra dots are included as form of interference. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WCJts.png"" alt=""two dots boxes""></p>

<p>Here are examples of correct designs produced in the first trial of the design fluency task.  Similar designs would be likely produced under the second trial.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oM0dk.jpg"" alt=""three correct designs""></p>

<p>The way this measure is usually quantified is by counting the <em>number</em> of correct designs produced.  However, I'm interested in looking at this task a little differently.  I want to know if members of a clinical group, say Alzheimer's disease (AD), will produce a <em>quality</em> of designs that is different than normal controls.</p>

<p>One way I thought about doing this was by looking at the frequency of designs produced.  This has been observed for tasks of verbal fluency, with <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13803399508406584"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">patients with AD producing words of a greater frequency than controls</a>.  The problem is that while counts of word frequency are readily available, there is no equivalent source for production on the design fluency task that I know of.</p>

<p>Here's how I thought about approaching this.  I'd start by taking the responses produced by a large number of controls and coming up with a way of classifying them, say 4 or 5 <em>types</em> of designs.  Then I'd count the number of times each of these design types occurred in the control sample and apply a weight to them so that design types with lesser frequency would have a greater weight (think <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/inverse-document-frequency-1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inverse document frequency</a>).  I'd then look at a smaller AD sample and a equivalent control sample matched on demographic variables.  I'd count the number of each design types produced by each subject in both groups, and multiply the number of each design type by the weight assigned to it.  The average frequency would be calculated for each subject for each trial type (the 5 dot trial and the 10 dot interference trial).  Group performance would then be compared in a repeated measures ANOVA.</p>

<p>There are the two questions that I have. The control sample that I have to determine the frequency of the design types is small: less than 70 subjects.  Is this too small for determining the frequency and weights of the design types?  Secondly, when comparing the clinical sample to a control sample, would it be possible to draw the small control sample from this larger control sample used to derive the frequency and the weights, or is there some reason that I should not do this?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your attention and response.  Any input would be greatly  appreciated.  I realize this question may be off topic for this site.  If you feel that's the case, would you mind suggesting a more appropriate forum.  I've previously <a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/157221/use-of-a-sample-to-define-a-criterion-and-to-examine-difference-with-clinical-sa"">posted this question on Cross Validated</a>, with no replies, so I'm hopeful for better reception here.</p>

"Are adult negativity or resentment related to an infant crying for attention?","<p>I've recently came across an idea, expressed by a spiritual author Ekhart Tolle, that for adults, the internal experience of negativity or resistance to life situations can be far more harmful than the situation itself. Typically a person cannot take immediate action to resolve such situation.</p>

<p>For example, a loud car alarm outside interrupts some activity. A person may become focused on how inconvenient it is to hear this alarm, and start thinking negative thoughts, like <code>""I can't believe that jerk has such a loud alarm on that a piece of junk car. Who would steal such a thing? I wish someone would put a brick though his windshield"".</code></p>

<p>This got me thinking - <strong>What is the process by which negativity or resentment to situations arise in a person?</strong> The scenario of a crying infant came to mind - a baby cries to express some discomfort and frustration at a situation that the baby cannot fix himself. <strong>Are adult resentment and infant crying using the same pathways in the brain?</strong></p>

"Has the inverted spectrum thought experiment ever been conducted (and if not, why)?","<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_spectrum"" rel=""nofollow"">inverted spectrum</a> thought experiment posits that you (the subject) wake up one morning to find that your colour spectrum (or some part of it anyway) has inverted.  This experiment has important implications for the idea of ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"" rel=""nofollow"">qualia</a>"".  While we may not have a way to manipulate qualia directly, this experiment still seems like it would be valuable to conduct.  In Daniel Dennett's version of the experiment - ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia#Daniel_Dennett"" rel=""nofollow"">alternative neurosurgery</a>"" - he points out that you wouldn't know if your optic nerve was messed with, or your memories, and I would extend this to any apparatus that inverts spectrum at any point along the sensory pathway.</p>

<p>I imagine that the technology to develop goggles (similar to the prism glasses, colour filters, distortion lenses, etc, used in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_adaptation"" rel=""nofollow"">perceptual adaptation</a> experiments) that invert colour is available.  However, I have not seen any reference to such an experiment being conducted.  Has it?  And if not, why not?  Are there practical limitations?</p>

<p>It seems to me that the construct of qualia hinges on there being some property of experience that is independent of behaviour/function/physical state, and the subjective experience of colour is often touted as a perfect example of this, via the inverted spectrum experiment.  So then the practicality of this experiment - whether or not an inversion of some kind is possible without a functional impact - is crucial.  If the experiment cannot be conducted because no inversion exists that can be done without functional impact, then it would constitute a severe blow to qualia as independent of function, and conversely, if it can be done, and the effect shown to be independent of behaviour, then it would surely be a problem for functionalism...  So why not try it?</p>

<p>But some claim that there is more to this than just preference. There are several blogs that claim that using a normal concert tuning of 440 Hz is bad for our health, but then what do you expect from something first promoted by the Nazis?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The recent rediscoveries of the vibratory / oscillatory nature of the universe indicate that this contemporary international concert pitch standard may generate an unhealthy effect or anti-social behavior in the consciousness of human beings … There is a theory that the change from 432 Hz to 440 Hz was dictated by Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. [Source: <a href=""http://www.zengardner.com/440hz-music-conspiracy-to-detune-us-from-natural-432hz-harmonics/#sthash.hcAIX7N2.dpuf"">Zen Gardner</a>.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also,</p>

<p>432 Hz is said to be mathematically consistent with the patterns of the universe. Studies reveal that 432hz tuning vibrates with the universe’s golden mean PHI and unifies the properties of light, time, space, matter, gravity and magnetism with biology, the DNA code and consciousness. When our atoms and DNA start to resonate in harmony with the spiraling pattern of nature, our sense of connection to nature is said to be magnified. The number 432 is also reflected in ratios of the Sun, Earth, and the moon as well as the precession of the equinoxes, the Great Pyramid of Egypt, Stonehenge, the Sri Yantra among many other sacred sites. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From my own observations, some of the harmonic overtone partials of
  A=432hz 12T5 appear to line up to natural patterns and also the
  resonance of solitons. Solitons need a specific range to form into the
  realm of density and span from the micro to the macro cosmos. Solitons
  are not only found in water mechanics, but also in the ion-acoustic
  breath between electrons and protons.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Brian T. Collins </p>

<p>Another blog wrote that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The noticeable difference music lovers and musicians have noticed with
  music tuned in A=432 Hz is that it is not only more beautiful and
  harmonious to the ears, but it also induces a more inward experience
  that is felt inside the body at the spine and heart. Music tuned in
  A=440 Hz was felt as a more outward and mental experience, and was
  felt at the side of the head which projected outwards. Audiophiles
  have also stated that A=432hz music seems to be non-local and can fill
  an entire room, whereas A=440hz can be perceived as directional or
  linear in sound propagation.</p>

If an attitude is only restricted to being a positive or negative disposition towards an object, how does it differ from a preference? </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Nick Stauner's answer includes a citation claiming that an attitude is not affect. But the same citation insists that an attitude is about favorability, and if we reduce attitudes to ""I like X"", how is ""like"" not considered affect? </p>

"Why is Mr. Monk unsure?","<p>One of the funniest and most psychologically intriguing characters on TV (in my opinion) is Adrian Monk. If you don't know who he is, I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.tv.com/shows/monk/watch/"" rel=""nofollow"">watching the TV show</a>. It's called ""Monk"" (naturally).</p>

<p>In the show, Monk is a character with pretty much every phobia imaginable. He has all the quirks and OCD stereotype characteristics. One of the challenges Monk faces often is inhibition when trying to make up his mind. Watch this clip for an example of what I mean:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU5AZ2bq09s"" rel=""nofollow"">Monk - Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever</a></p>

<p>I know that Monk is a fictional character, but the symptoms he has are very real and suffered from by many people daily (although seldom all at once, as is Monk's case).
What I want to know is: </p>

<ul>
<li>What specifically is the trait that Monk exhibits in the clip? </li>
<li>Does he have a phobia of being wrong, or is he just incapable of being sure of himself? </li>
<li>Is it as simple as him just being very indecisive?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Thanks Nick Stauner for pointing this out. I will clarify: This question is based on the premise that Monk (or any other person) exhibiting this behavior does this frequently; not just a one time occurrence.</p>

"Is it good practice to try to recall things when we are tired?","<p><strong>Background.</strong> It happens often that, at the end of the day when I return to home, I try to recall past events that took place that day or the day before (memory rehearsal), but surprisingly I find that I have lost almost all details about some of them: while some  details are kept ""in good state"", other are altered (false memory: wrong order of events, memory gaps, inconsistent and incoherent memories), and the rest are forgotten! Boundaries between details are blurred! Such things happen when I'm tired. </p>

<p>On the one hand, if I don't try to recall events, e.g. when I postpone such practice to a later moment (after resting), I will forget some details as I have wasted time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when I try to rehearse some memories that happened the same day, it seems that the biological state of tiredness affects the ability to recall in such a manner that details become altered and false memories are produced (again a loss of information)! Both cases are bad, but which one is the worse?</p>

<p>The point of this question is to know whether the biological state of tiredness can definitely alter some critical events when we try to recall.</p>

<p>Should we avoid trying to recall events when we are tired?</p>

"Can placebo effect be increased by modifying the perception about prescription/intake setting?","<p>I've noticed the following pattern within my own thinking - multiple unrelated events ""combine"" to produce a certain action, particularly creativity and innovation. I'm trying to understand if this phenomenon is true or common among people. As a way to learn more about this, I thought that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Expectancy_and_conditioning"" rel=""noreferrer"">placebo effect</a> would be a good place to start.</p>

<p>To clarify my question: imagine you are going to get a drug prescription. It will be a placebo, but you don't know that. <strong>Would combining factors like below increase the effectiveness of placebo?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>clean doctors office</li>
<li>a traditional white coat doctor like on stock photos treating you</li>
<li>positive demeanor of staff</li>
<li>perception of privacy</li>
<li>thinking you are being prescribed a drug you have researched well and feel safe about</li>
<li>seeing a presentation about the advances of modern medicine within a week before </li>
</ul>

<p>Contrast this with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a dark, cramped waiting room</li>
<li>long wait and short consultation</li>
<li>a physician assistant or a nurse practitioner seeing you instead of MD</li>
<li>unknown drug you have never heard of</li>
<li>perceiving some negative news within last week</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm trying to understand <strong>if a combination of unrelated events indeed does combine to affect the effectiveness of placebo?</strong> If so, is there the primary cause of change (like PA-C prescribing vs MD)?</p>

"What is the basis behind the idea of Dom-Tert loops in Jung Function Theory?","<p>I have come across a theory relating to Jung Function Theory normally addressed as 'Dom-Tert' loops. I will briefly explain:</p>

<p>In Jung Function Theory, everyone has 4 of 16 functions. They split into Introverted/Extroverted, Sensing/Intuiting, and Thinking/Feeling. These, in broad strokes, aim to explain how people function in both Information Gathering (S/N) as well as Information Processing (T/F) and whether that has a subjective base, or an objective base (I/E).</p>

<p><a href=""http://personalitycafe.com/articles/25205-dominant-tertiary-loops-common-personality-disorders.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This</a> theory lays out that the first (or <b>dom</b>inant) function and the third (or <b>tert</b>iary) function form a feedback loop, and the second function becomes underdeveloped. Below is an excerpt that hopefully gives an example of this at work (Myers Briggs notation is used as shorthand here):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ENTP/ESFJ: Ne/Fe or Fe/Ne--Narcissistic Personality Disorder.</strong> This type often behaves impulsively and manipulatively, needing constant approval and admiration from others, running around investing in new thing after new thing, but never developing the self-confidence of a strong, subjective perspective. Fe used negatively may use its awareness of the cultural standards of others to intentionally offend or upset them, in order to service Ne's curiosity about the patterns in their responses. If Ti/Si were working properly, it would give the user a balancing sense of personal, subjective importance and free him of his dependence upon the adulation and unconditional acceptance of others. (Horrible example: Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crux being that everyone must use a balance of subjective and objective reasoning and perception to function correctly.</p>

<p>Now I realise that Jung Function theory is a favourite with armchair psychologists, and it's validity <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/1402/4413"">has</a> been <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/1553/4413"">questioned</a>, but I wanted to know if this theory is either <strong>a)</strong> expressed formally in any kind of Jung Function theory study, or <strong>b)</strong> if something like this imbalance leading to personality disorders exists in other psychological theories? </p>

"What is the psychological function of nostalgically reenacting activities from before we were born?","<p>I'm asking specifically about nostalgia for a time before you were born, e.g. the Blitz parties / 40s tea dances that have big in the UK for the past decade, or the popularity of Speakeasy-themed bars in the US.

<li>ritual and emulation</li>
<li>social visibility and desirability</li>
<li>self-exoneration</li>
<li>escape through action and excitement</li>

"How do clinicians control for their own mental disorders?","<p>Has any research been done on how clinicians' (either internists or psychiatrists) known psychological conditions influence the diagnoses, misdiagnoses, and prognoses they make?</p>

<p>(I'm also curious how medical, non-psychological conditions affect the above, but that wouldn't strictly-speaking be on topic so I'm limiting this to psychological problems for now.)</p>

<h2>the kind of studies I mean</h2>

<p>What I'm envisaging is a study akin to the following, and am curious about what similar studies have found:</p>

<ul>
<li>two pools of practicing clinicians are chosen (with random partitioning between the two),</li>
<li>everyone in pool A is screened for current psychological disorders by a subset (say, three) of <em>multiple, randomly chosen</em> individuals from pool B,</li>
<li>the professional (diagnostic) history of every clinician in pool A is reviewed, and</li>
<li>the experimenter looks for patterns of correlation between mental disorders in the clinicians themselves, and the disorders that those individuals tend to diagnose / misdiagnose (sensitivity v. specificity). </li>
</ul>

<h2>the kind of (statistically significant) results I'm curious about</h2>

<p>So, for example, do clinicians who have (to choose two disorders randomly) NPD tend to diagnose depression more often than those without NPD? And, when they do diagnose depression, do they tend to have more favorable or less favorable prognoses for their patients? What are their recommendations? And how often do their recommendations work out well v. badly? What mental characteristics are adaptive v. maladaptive within this extremely specific context?</p>

<p>More to the point, does it ""take one to know one"", or does a lack of personal experience with something provide better objectivity?</p>

<p>And are some disorders (maladaptive within larger society) unambiguously good across-the-board in a clinical setting, are they all harmful, or should people with disorder X specialize in disorder Y, and avoid treating patients with disorder Z?</p>

<p>Obviously, pool A doesn't actually need to be psych clinicians. It could be applied to GPs, oncologists, surgeons, etc.</p>

"Method Acting Used For Cognitive Behavioral Modification","<p>I was always fascinated by the stark contrast between the character played by Brad Pitt in True Romance (small role) and the character Rusty in Ocean's Eleven. Same person, completely different persona. Gary Oldman is another one that is so chamaeleon like, it is often difficult to recognize him in character (nevermind the makeup and costume).</p>

<p><strong>I am curious to know if the techniques associated with method acting, attempting to live in the shoes of a desired character, have any basis for helping a normal person become the type of person they desire to be (behavior and persoanlity).</strong> I am not sure if method actors ever actually 'become' the character they are portraying, but from outward appearances it would be difficult to tell. They may very well easily discard their character once finished. However, I have heard that DiCaprio suffered from some residual effects of portraying Howard Hughes in The Aviator. This type of behavioral modification is similar to ""fake it until you make it"", or simply performing a repetitive action until it becomes natural. Nothing new. But I am wondering if method acting (and its associated techniques) could contribute something new to this process affecting our natural selves. Does this take advantage of our neural plasticity?</p>

<p><strong>If the answer is yes, how long would one have to perform these techniques before any noticeable chamge would occur? This, I supose, would help to compare its efficacy against other techniques.</strong></p>

<p>What causes us to think \$200 isn't that much?</p>

<p>But if shopping in a store where the top priced GPS was \$700 and all the others are priced around \$500, now \$200 seems too much.</p>

<p>Or how about a homeowner trying to sell a house for \$200,000 when a potential buyer bids at \$185,000 because of water damage in one room.  The seller accepts even though the cost to repair the damage might be only \$10000.  The \$5000 doesn't seem like that big of a loss for the hassle of having to do the repair, but in a lot of other circumstances (like selling a car) it's a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Another.  Take a trip to a neighboring town and you might go a mile or two out of your way to see an attraction you just discovered.  Take a trip across the country and you might visit a whole other state, hundreds of miles out of your way.</p>

  anything he wants (be it legal, be it illegal).</p>

"Does self-directed speech help or hurt a blind subject's auditory recognition?","<p>Recently, it was found that self-directed speech was helpful to sighted subjects engaging in a visual search task:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Participants searched for common objects, while being sometimes [<em>sic</em>] asked to speak the target’s name aloud. Speaking facilitated search, particularly when there was a strong association between the name and the visual target. As the discrepancy between the name and the target increased, speaking began to impair performance. Together, these results speak to the power of words to modulate ongoing visual processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, if the subject were to be looking for a chair in a picture, saying the word ""chair"" aloud would lead to a more effective search.  Since the two modalities (vision and hearing) are separate, one set of information can compliment the other set and ""constructively interferes,"" if you will, in the scenario above.  </p>

<p>In trying to establish whether a similar ""constructive interference"" would occur in the auditory domain, so I'm wondering whether an experiment wherein a subject who is blind (since birth) repeating a word to themselves would show an difference in that subject's ability to discriminate muffled or otherwise disguised words that they were asked to listen to and identify as part of a task.  </p>

<p>Would the degree to which repeating a word was helpful or harmful still depend on the similarity between the word spoken out loud and the word to be discriminated?  Or would there be a ""destructive interference"" effect under any circumstances, due to the same modality of hearing being used for the both discrimination of the information and the perception of the self-directed speech?</p>

"What cognitive strategies diminish bias in decision-making beyond those outlined by Larrick?","<p>Larrick (2004; <a href=""http://psych.colorado.edu/~vanboven/teaching/p7536_heurbias/p7536_readings/larrick_debias.pdf"">pdf</a>) offers a small number of suggestions for strategies to diminish bias in decision making, which he breaks down into four categories. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>""Consider the opposite"". Tell decision-makers to ask themselves ""What are some reasons my initial judgment might be wrong?""</p></li>
<li><p>Training in rules. Teach statistical and logical principles to decision-makers, e.g. give them lessons on the law of large numbers and regression toward the mean.</p></li>
<li><p>Training in representations. Teach decision-makers to represent problems in ways that are likely to ameliorate biases.  For instance, encourage decision-makers to represent problems in terms of frequencies rather than probabilities, since evidence suggests people reason more accurately when thinking about the former than about the latter.</p></li>
<li><p>Training in biases. Larrick suggests that this boils down to seeing if teaching decision-makers behavioral decision theory has positive effects. Larrick implies that so far there is little evidence to suggest this method would work. </p></li>

"What articles use structural equation modelling in a meta-analytic context to model mediation?","<p>I'm interested in structural equation modelling (SEM) meta-analysis and its application to modelling mediation relationships.</p>

<p><a href=""http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/psycwlm/internet/"">Mike W.-L. Cheung</a> has written a few articles on the topic of SEM Meta-Analysis (e.g., Cheung, 2009). He's also written the <a href=""http://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/psycwlm/Internet/metaSEM/index.html"">metaSEM package in R</a>.</p>

<p>One basic approach to SEM meta-analysis is a simple fixed-effect two-step approach. First, you extract a weighted average correlation matrix from the component studies. Second, you analyse that correlation matrix using standard SEM approaches. </p>

<p>However, in reality, things are more complicated. </p>

<ul>
<li>Correlations often vary between studies by more than just sampling error, suggesting that a fixed-effect approach may be invalid. If a random-effects model is adopted, this raises issues of whether to categorise the correlation matrices into groups of fixed-effects matrices or whether to somehow incorporate the random-effects into the overall SEM.</li>
<li>Some studies may not have all the variables of interest, which introduces a  form of missing data, which in turn raises issues of how to define sample size and the standard error.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in general, I'm interested in reading examples of SEM meta-analyses applied in psychology to get a sense of how others have dealt with the various issues. In particular, I'm interested in meta-analysis SEM that incorporates the modelling of indirect effects (i.e., mediation).</p>

"Neurotransmitter based imaging techniques","<p>All the brain imaging techniques I know fall into two categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Tracking blood</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either by looking at the magnetic (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"">fMRI</a>), or near-infared absorption (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_optical_imaging#Diffusive_optical_imaging_in_neuroscience"">diffuse optical imaging</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_infrared_spectroscopy#Medical_uses"">NIRS</a>) properties of hemoglobin, or</p></li>
<li><p>Injecting tracers into the blood stream (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"">PET</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"">SPECT</a>)</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Tracking electric and magnetic fields in neurons (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"">EEG</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography"">MEG</a>).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The problem with the first approach is that it is fundamentally secondary in nature: it tracks the response of the vascular system to brain activity. Although the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood-oxygen-level_dependent#BOLD_hemodynamic_response"">BOLD signal</a> correlates well with neural activity, it is still an indirect indicator of firing rate, has time lags, and limited spatial (limited by distribution of capillaries) and temporal (limited by flow rate) resolution.</p>

<p>The second  approach is better, but still not perfect from a pharmacology perspective. Although it gives us good information about the post-synaptic potential (EEG) or intraneuron potential (MEG), it still provides no information on specific neurotransmitters released. The approach also suffers from limitations on spatial resolution and the fact that EM-fields follow the superposition principle and thus it is mathematically impossible to reconstruct signals that interfere destructively outside the neuron but before the sensors.</p>

<p>The perfect approach for a pharmacologist would be to track individual types on neurotransmitters. <strong>Are there imagining techniques that use the resonance, absorption, or other properties of neurotransmitters (instead of hemoglobin)? Or is there a fundamental reason why this won't work?</strong></p>

<p>I know that the same exact techniques as for hemoglobin won't work (since as far as I know most neurotransmitters don't contain nice things like iron to play with), but is there a reason other resonance or scattering techniques wouldn't work?</p>

<hr>

<p>The closest work I know in this direction is the event-related optical signal (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661300017010"">Gratton &amp; Fabiani, 2001</a>) because it tracks the light-scattering properties of something other than hemoglobin: neural tissue. Unfortunately, this is still tracking activity of the neuron and not neurotransmitters.</p>

"What is the correlation between self and other ratings of goal orientation?","<p>In educational psychology <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal-oriented"">goal orientation</a> is a popular construct.

"Inferring relationships between psychological variables in clinical samples and issues in generalisation","<h3>Context</h3>

<p>I sometimes speak to researchers studying the relationship between variables in clinical psychology samples.
A typical example is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>100 patients with diagnosed depression</li>
<li>many clinically relevant variables are measured such as demographics, anxiety, intelligence, drug and alcohol use, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Researchers often want to then develop models of what predicts depression.</p>

<p>However, the problem is that the sample was selected because they already have been deemed to possess a certain threshold level of depression.
Substantial variation still remains in depression with some participants being more severe than others.</p>

<p>Thus, there are problems in trying to generalise observed relationships to describe what predicts depression, because it is not a random sample of the population.</p>

<p>I use depression as a specific case, but the problem applies to many studies of clinical populations (e.g., kids with behavioural problems, kids with intellectual disabilities, OCD, etc.).</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<ul>
<li>What advice would you give to such researchers about how to analyse and generalise from such data?</li>
<li>Are there any references that provide an example of best practice of how to analyse and generalise from such data?</li>

"What constructs help explain limited cognitive processing and the cognitive effects of rules that limit decision making choices?","<p>Supposed that I'm a married man, and my wife asks me to pick out a paint color for our new house. It's not terribly mentally taxing. However, my wife starts to add rules. The color can't be too bright, no green, neutral, etc. The additional rules that my wife give me add an additional burden to the process of selecting a color. So in my mind, there is the base cognitive effort required to select a color, and a secondary cognitive burden that requires me to process the rules that my wife gave me.</p>

<p><strong>What mental effort constructs would apply in this scenario?</strong></p>

<p>From instruction design, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load"">cognitive load theory</a> defines intrinsic load, extraneous load, and germane load. In my example, I think intrinsic load would map somewhat to the base effort required to choose a color, and extraneous load would map to the additional rules imposed by my wife. However, I'm not sure that the process of <em>learning</em> as explained by cognitive load theory translates well into this scenario where a <em>choice/decision</em> is trying to be made. <strong>Are there other constructs that would be more applicable?</strong></p>

<p>This would give rise to sleep measurements on multiple days and for multiple individuals. Thus, we could define $y_{ij}$ as the amount of sleep of person $i$ on day $j$. Descriptive statistics could be calculated on the set of daily sleep measurements of person $i$ such as the mean and standard deviation.

"Modern treatments of Alan Turing's B-type neural networks","<p>In the cognitive sciences Alan Turing is best known for launching AI with his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_machinery_and_intelligence""><em>Computing machinery and intelligence</em></a> (1950). However, this was not his first contribution to the cognitive sciences, in his unpublished 1948 technical report <a href=""http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/archive/l/l32/L32-001.html""><em>Intelligence Machinery</em></a> he foresaw connectionism with his <a href=""http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/connectionism/Turing%27s%20neural%20networks.html"">B-type neural networks</a>. </p>

<p>The model is a recurrent neural network that is wired at random, and synchronized by a global clock. The neurons are two input $\mathrm{NAND}$-gates. The connections have one of two states: they either forward their signal perfectly ($0 \mapsto 0$ and $1 \mapsto 1$), or replace it by $1$ ($0 \mapsto 1$ and $1 \mapsto 1$). The learning algorithm adjusts the states of the connections. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the director of the National Physical Laboratory rejected Turing's work and it was not published until significantly after Turing's death. The original manuscript, though predates <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory"">Hebbian learning</a> (1949) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron"">Rosenblatt's perceptrons</a> (1957; and they weren't as sophisticated, only doing feedforward as opposed to recurrent).</p>

<p><strong>Was Turing's B-type neural networks are the earliest neural-like models of computations capable of learning?</strong></p>

<p>Although by modern standard Turing's approach is dated, and has been supplanted by more realistic and general treatements (for instance ones that incorporate dynamic Hebbian updating on weighted connections without a need for central clock synchronization). <strong>When did the state of connectionism first surpasss Turing's B-type neural networks?</strong>  <strong>Is there modern treatments of B-type neural networks and their learning abilities?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Balanced bilinguals</em> mix their two languages and are effected by linguistic categories from both. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Dominant bilinguals</em> seem to switch on the categories of the language they are using, and suppress the categories of the language not in use.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The task Peltola et al. (2012) studied was phoneme categories. The boundaries between vowels are arbitrary and set by the language of the user. The researchers focused on two sounds that are categorised as different vowels in Finnish, but are the same vowel in Swedish. When dominant bilingual participants were briefed about the study in Finnish, they distinguished the sounds quickly. When the same participants were briefed about the same experiment a week later in Swedish, their ability to distinguish the sounds slowed significantly. The balanced bilinguals were equally slow under both briefings.</p>

<p>A similar arbitrary language-dependent categorization exists in colour perception (<a href=""http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences//retrieve/pii/S1364661309001454"">Regier &amp; Kay, 2009</a>).

"Psychological explanation for the success of ""class systems"" in video games","<p>Over the last decade, Role Playing Games and Mobile Online Battle Arenas have been a dominating force in the video gaming industry, millions of people playing sometimes every day and often being quite passionate about their favorite game.</p>

<p>The thing that strikes me when looking at the most successful of those games (not sure I'm allowed to say any names) is the recurring presence of ""class systems"", ways to label characters and players with a specific set of abilities and roles.    </p>

<p>Examples of this are the classic ""warrior, mage, hunter, assassin..."" classes attributed to RPG characters or the the ""tank, support, damage dealer..."" roles that players in MOBAS take on in a team.</p>

<p>What I find interesting is that players seem to like having a more or less defined role, class or play style in these systems.
One such example of this phenomena is the use of the pronoun ""a"" to refer to someone or oneself:</p>

<pre><code>      ""I am a mage player""
      ""He is a [insert MOBA character name] main"" (main here means most played character)
      ""Where the heck is our support?"" (referring to the player playing in the support role)
      ""She is the best [insert MOBA character name] on the     EU server""
</code></pre>

<h2>Is there a psychological explanation to why people seem particularly attracted to these systems that ""label them"" in a way?</h2>

<p>My hypotheses:</p>

<pre><code>  - The discomfort of not fully knowing one's personnality and capabilities drive people to ""symplify their personnalities"" by endorsing specific roles in these games.

  -  Players ""specialize "" themselves as a way to get singled out and feel special.

<blockquote>

<p>I looked into Hyman's papers and I found a fairly cited (~500 in Google Scholar) <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8561194"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper of his some 20 years ago in AJP</a>, co-authored with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_J._Nestler"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eric J.

<blockquote>
  <p>drug-induced neural plasticity [...] underlies the long-term actions of psychotropic drugs in the brain [...] Biological investigation in psychiatry has often focused too narrowly on synaptic pharmacology,
  especially on neurotransmitter turnover and neurotransmitter receptors. A paradigm is presented to help understand the long-term effects of psychotropic drugs, including
  the latency in onset of their therapeutic actions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The paper further details that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Acute dosing of the antidepressants
  produces little in the way of subjective or
  behavioral effects (other than side effects). Initial doses
  of the antipsychotic drugs produce subtle motor effects
  or some degree of sedation, and initial doses of the
  stimulants produce euphoria and locomotor activation.
  However, substantial improvement in depressive or
  psychotic symptoms, or the development of addiction
  to psychostimulant drugs, occurs only if the drugs are
  taken at adequate dosage and with adequate frequency
  and chronicity. For example, depressive symptoms
  would not be expected to improve if an antidepressant
  were taken at too low a dose, only occasionally, or for
  too short a period of time.</p>
  
  <p>We therefore conceptualize antidepressant-induced
  increases in synaptic serotonin or norepinephrine, antipsychotic-
  induced blockade of dopamine neurotransmission,
  and cocaine- and amphetamine-induced increases
  in synaptic dopamine as initiating events for longerterm
  changes in neural function. It is the adaptive response
  of the nervous system to adequate repeated perturbations
  mediated through these initial targets that
  produces the therapeutic responses to antidepressants
  or antipsychotic drugs or, in the case of the psychostimulants,
  addiction [...].</p>

"(Why) Do US studies of violence and mental illness tend to report no link but European studies seem to find one?","<p>Studying the link between mental illness and violence seems a sure way to</p>

<ol>
<li>get attention from the mass media, and</li>
<li>contradict some other study, and not necessarily one published that long ago.</li>
</ol>

<p>A pretty old review (and not in some high impact venue) by <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1525086/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stuart (2003)</a> seems to me to still hold water 15 years later with respect to a few general observations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definitive statements are difficult to make and it is equally possible to find recent literature supporting the conclusions that the mentally ill are no more violent, they are as violent, or they are more violent than their nonmentally ill counterparts. [...]</p>
  
  <p>Because of the significant methodological challenges faced by researchers in this field, the nature of this association remains unclear. For example, violence has been difficult to measure directly, so that researchers have often relied on official documentation or uncorroborated selfreports. The prevalence of violence has been demonstrated to differ dramatically depending on the source. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it goes on to talk about confounders as the perennial problem of epidemiological studies.</p>

<p>Stuart also highlights a (highly cited) US-sample study of the ""no-link"" variety (at least if substance-abuse is controlled for), <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9596041/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steadman et al. 1998</a> ... and I certainly found some newer ones myself, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188537"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Elbogen &amp; Johnson (2009)</a> or <a href=""http://ftp.iza.org/dp6577.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anderson et al. 2012</a>, just to mention some picked up by the press.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Oxford group of Fazel has been publishing study after study on European samples including on <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanpsy/PIIS2215-0366%2814%2900128-X.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sweden (2015)</a>
 or <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2017.05.016"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UK, Finland and Netherlands (2017)</a> that do find a link between depression and violence... and these have also been picked up the press. There are older studies in Scandinavian countries which concur; <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8639031/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hodgins et al. (1996)</a> for instance.</p>

<p>So is this a trend? And (the really tough question) is there a meta-analysis of such studies that does moderator analysis (e.g. by meta-regression) to determine which study parameters matter most with respect to the finding? Is it the case that the Europeans are less violent overall so that the ""inherent"" violence of the mentally ill ""stands out"" in Europe but ""gets lost in the noise"" of the higher society violence in the US? (It certainly is the case the US is more violent than Sweden.) Or is it some other factor that is dominant, e.g. is depression more conductive to violence than other forms of severe mental illness (makes sense to ask since 2 of 3 US studies I've looked at aggregate severe mental illnesses — SMIs). To give you an example of the kind of meta-analysis I'm hoping to find, for ADHD prevalence it seemed that there might be geographical differences between US and Europe, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17541055"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">but they turned out to be methodological</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I found a paper by <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359532"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Van Dorn et al. (2012)</a> reanalyzing the same data as Elbogen &amp; Johnson, and coming to a European-style conclusion of a link between SMI and violence. The difference in methodology came down (in this case) to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>important is spatio-temporal contiguity (i.e., the causal factor must be
  spatially near the effect).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So merely lifetime SMI prevalence wasn't a good predictor but recent symptoms (within 12 months) were. That and the fact that the control group of Elbogen &amp; Johnson apparently was not clean enough (of substance abusers) apparently tipped the scales.</p>

<p>But Eblogen didn't quote concede the field, and in a <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702615619363"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2016 study</a> on the exact same data (using 12 months window this time) but with more attention to confounders... found again in favor of their original findings:</p>

   model</a> revealed
  that the positive association between SMI and violence
  was by and large indirect. Statistically controlling for
  impellance and disinhibition completely wiped out any
  positive relationship between SMI and violence. </p>

<p>The question arose to me after having read Fischmeister et al. 2016 (""Self-similarity and recursion as default modes in human cognition""), a paper that contrasts the roles of the DMN and FPCN, each seen as archtypes of the task-negative and task-positive (task-based??) networks respectively.

<ol>

<li><p><em>Is your hair black?</em>
This one is only available while thinking of a memory, but like the last one it could be semantic too.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Do you know how to ride a bike?</em>

Wikipedia has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung#Legacy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a short paragraph about his legacy</a>, which is mostly about how cited he was (and that does not, alas, entail much how correct his ideas ultimately were), which mentions MBTI as a concrete offshoot of Jung's ideas. I know MBTI was mostly superseded as personality theory. In an <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cui-bono/201603/are-scores-the-mbti-totally-meaningless"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog discussing the latter matter</a>, John A. Johnson (prof of psychology at Penn State) says of the wider Jungian works</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jung's scientifically dubious ideas about archetypes, alchemy, synchronicity, the collective unconscious, the paranormal, and so forth are irrelevant to his theory of psychological types. Jung's theory of types gave us the concepts of introversion and extraversion, which modern, scientific personality psychologists are perfectly happy to use today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mostly summarize Jung's legacy? I know there have been entire books on his works like <em>The Handbook of Jungian Psychology</em>, but I don't want to read all that to come to a conclusion. Also it seems that book has a single review in the <em>Journal of Analytical Psychology</em>, which looks like an in-house thing; nevertheless the review (by psychoanalyst Joseph Reppen) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although psychology is one of the most popular American majors, Freud,
  Jung, and depth psychology are rarely present or are marginalized in introductory
  psychology texts. As one colleague remarked to me, if Freud gets a page, Jung
  gets a paragraph. And that paragraph probably includes a short comment about
  extrovert-introvert–case closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which kinda mirrors what Johnson wrote, but with a bitter tone. The rest of the review is book-oriented, but Reppen seems to me to fail to make a clear case what else is important, legacy-wise in Jung's work.  So, are there other reasonably concise takes on Jung's scientific legacy? And do they agree or disagree with Johnson's take on that?</p>

"Eyewitness testimony study from Power of Habit","<p>In his book <em>The Power of Habit</em>, Charles Duhigg refers to some study from the University of Western Ontario: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>STEP THREE: ISOLATE THE CUE</p>
  
  <p>About a decade ago, a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario tried to answer a question that had bewildered social scientists for years: Why do some eyewitnesses of crimes misremember what they see, while other recall events accurately? (...)</p>
  
  <p>She wondered if researchers were making a mistake by
  focusing on what questioners and witnesses had said, rather than how
  they were saying it. She suspected there were subtle cues that were
  influencing the questioning process. But when she watched videotape
  after videotape of witness interviews, looking for these cues, she
  couldn’t see anything. There was so much activity in each interview –
  all the facial expressions, the different ways the questions were
  posed, the fluctuating emotions – that she couldn’t detect any
  patterns.</p>
  
  <p>So she came up with an idea: She made a list of a few elements she
  would focus on – the questioners’ tone, the facial expressions of the
  witness, and how close the witness and the questioner were sitting to
  each other. Then, she removed any information that would distract her
  from those elements. She turned down the volume on the television so,
  instead of hearing words, all she could detect was the tone of the
  questioner’s voice. She taped a sheet of paper over the questioner’s
  face, so all she could see was the witnesses’ expressions. She held a
  tape measure to the screen to measure their distance from each other.</p>
  
  <p>And once she started studying these specific elements, patterns leapt
  out. She saw that witnesses who misremembered facts usually were
  questioned by cops who used a gentle, friendly tone. When witnesses
  smiled more, or sat closer to the person asking the questions, they
  were more likely to misremember.</p>
  
  <p>In other words, when environmental cues said “we are friends” – a
  gentle tone, a smiling face – the witnesses were more likely to
  misremember what had occurred. Perhaps it was because, subconsciously,
  those friendship cues triggered a habit to please the questioner.</p>
  
  <p>But the importance of this experiment is that those same tapes had
  been watched by dozens of other researchers. Lots of smart people had
  seen the same patterns, but no one had recognized them before. Because
  there was too much information in each tape to see a subtle cue.</p>
  
  <p>Once the psychologist decided to focus on only three categories of
  behavior, however, and eliminate the extraneous information, the
  patterns leapt out.</p>

"Psychoanalysis and its metaphores derived from ancient Greek mythology","<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>It's fascinating how many of the key concepts of psychoanalysis are presented by metaphores of the ancient Greek mythology. One might wonder whether the Greek mythology is actually the whole psychoanalysis in disguise.</p>

<p>Some examples to remember are the myth of “Narcissus and Echo” (embodied in Freud's essay ""On Narcissism""), the Oedipus and Electra complexes, the Icarus complex, the Medusa complex.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>My question is, could the building blocks of psychoanalysis be derived from the mythologies of other peoples, as well?</p>

<p>(The same questions from another perspective: could we find corresponding myths in the mythologies of other cultures. E.g, is there an equivalent to the myth of “Narcissus and Echo” in the mythologies of other cultures?)</p>

"""High-conflict people""","<p>While having a look at a recent question here, I ran into some (non-peer reviewed) articles with a <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/5-types-people-who-can-ruin-your-life/201711/how-quickly-spot-high-conflict-people"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">description like</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High-conflict people (HCPs) have high-conflict personalities. This means they have an ongoing pattern of all-or-nothing thinking, unmanaged emotions, extreme behavior or threats, and a preoccupation with blaming others. They have a Target of Blame, whom they regularly bully, harass, blame, humiliate, annoy, spread rumors about, and subject to many other adversarial behaviors. This pattern increases and maintains interpersonal conflicts, rather than reducing or resolving them — which is what most people try to do. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you google the HCP term, you'll find several articles with a similar definition, most from the same author. One was even published in the <a href=""https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/dealing-with-high-conflict-people-20120812-242hl.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mainstream mass media</a>,</p>

<p>Eventually this HCP is cast a sort of cross-sectional aspect of several personality disorders (at least in one article)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Narcissistic HCPs are characterized by an underlying fear of being inferior or powerless, so they are constantly putting themselves above other people — which alienates them in the process and tends to make people look down on them. Borderline HCPs have a deep fear of being abandoned, so they are constantly clinging and demanding reassurance, but alternating that with occasional rages when they feel abandoned — which often pushes people to abandon them. Antisocial HCPs really don’t want to be dominated by others, so they try hard to dominate others, but often end up in prison, where they are dominated. Paranoid HCPs have a fear of being betrayed by those around them, so they may overreact and attack those they fear — which tends to drive people to turn on them. Histrionic HCPs are preoccupied with being the center of attention and will often publicly criticize other people’s behavior (their Targets of Blame) in an effort to get sympathy and more attention. Knowing these patterns makes it easier to spot them, especially when this is combined with observing the four characteristics of HCPs at the top of this article. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has some similarities with the <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471981/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alternative (research) abnormal personality model from DSM-5</a> in the sense that the latter is also using some traits which possibly span several conventional personality disorders:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the alternative model, the essential criteria to define any personality disorder are: a) moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning, and b) the presence of pathological personality traits. A “level of functioning” scale is provided, and sensitivity and specificity data supported the designation of “moderate impairment” as the appropriate threshold to indicate the presence of a personality disorder. As defined in the alternative model, personality functioning consists of the degree to which there is an intact sense of self (involving a clear, coherent identity and effective self-directedness) and interpersonal functioning (reflecting a good capacity for empathy and for mature, mutually rewarding intimacy with others). Pathological personality traits are organized into five trait domains (negative affectivity, detachment, antagonism, disinhibition, and psychoticism), each of which is further explicated by a set of trait facets reflecting aspects of the domain itself. This trait system has been shown to correlate well with the Five Factor Model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>""High-conflict people"" don't quite seem to match any of those 5 traits specifically, but I suppose they would score high on antagonism, disinhibition, negative affectivity, and possibly even psychoticism. (On the FFM they'd probably score low on Agreeableness, high on Extraversion and on Neuroticism.)</p>

<p>Is there peer-reviewed research on ""High-conflict people"", perhaps under different terminology? Or is this more of a fringe-scientific grouping?</p>

"What is the psychology behind epiphany?","<p>What are the neural precursors that lead up to the epiphany? How can one, have more creative insights? How this affects our psyche? What's the psychology behind it? </p>

<p>The word ""epiphany"" has a deep, archetypal resonance for us, dating back to ancient Greece. It comes from the Greek ""epiphaneia,"" meaning ""appearance"" or ""manifestation,"" and referred to the revelations brought to us by the gods. Today ""epiphany"" carries a range of meanings, including ""an intuitive grasp of reality,"" ""an illuminating discovery, realization, disclosure, or insight,"" or simply ""a revealing scene or moment."" </p>

<p>An ephiphany may change your life and most likely the life of the people around you. It could be as simple as braking a mental model, which could open many new doors or neural pathways... For that matter, lets share an interesting examples: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allegedly Albert Einstein was struck as a young child by being given a
  compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it
  move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred
  in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to
  reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a
  trolley car to home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in
  Bern and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light,
  he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later
  remarked, ""a storm broke loose in my mind,"" which would allow him to
  understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two
  years later in 1907 which he called ""the happiest thought of my life""
  when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger
  would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of
  falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him
  to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a
  curvature in spacetime.</p>

"How long it would take to form a conceptual framework to justify a belief?","<p>From what I understand, the reason to set 1 week as the time between two therapy sessions is for the clients to do homework, which can be: take notes on recursive thoughts and emotions, remember important information that lead to the belief, rewire the brain to build a new habit.

<p>But from my experience, it takes up to 3 days or less to fully remember the necessary information and organize it in a clear, succinct manner.

"Psychopathy, conscientiousness, selfishness","<p>Having read a miniscule amount about concepts like secondary psychopathy and conscientiousness, I am wondering about how and why psychologists  have decided (or maybe the field of psychology has) that eschewing social norms is a sign of selfishness&mdash;if I have understood or characterised that means of measurement correctly.</p>

<p>From my point of view, the norms of any particular society as a whole cannot be relied upon to be a good indicator of what it is right or wrong to do. Many, if not most, societies inadvertently endorse behaviour which causes extreme suffering to others without any due justification.</p>

<p>In the face of this huge problem facing any moral individual, whereby their inadvertant actions, if they are not thought through (but are merely followed through because they are expected), may cause  or contribute to massive suffering to others, why should anyone think it morally correct or psychologically 'beneficial' to fall back on or adhere to social or societal norms? </p>

<p>How would someone who didn't care about reporting their neighbour for harbouring disfavoured people (Jewish people, gay people, communist people) in Nazi Germany come out on a secondary psycopathy scale, or conscientiousness scale? And how would they fare if they didn't really care too much about when they got their paperwork in, or how punctual they were, because there was far more important stuff to worry about?</p>

<p>If we don't want to fall into the trap of endorsing whatever violence one's society wishes to inflict upon a disfavoured or invisible group, don't we need to be sceptical about the priorities that we are superficially handed down arbitrarily by our immediate society and try and find out what it is actually important to do or not do?  And if we don't undertake to do this, but instead follow societal norms, are we not risking inadvertently blindly sending people or other sentient beings to ends involving huge amounts of pain and suffering? And is this, and other norm-following behaviour not a form of indolent and lazy selfishness?</p>

"Impact of pre-college schooling on IQ (WAIS)?","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>I'll give context for my question from personal experience, but then I'll generalize my question so that it's broadly useful.</p>

<p>When I was a child, my mother home schooled me. When I entered the 9th(?) grade, I dropped out. And for a few years prior to that, I cheated through most of my schoolwork. Someone suggested that even if I was cheating, I was still learning; this wasn't the case, because my cheating involved memorizing ""A A B D B B A."" </p>

<p>My understanding of the WAIS is that it merely serves as a way to approximate general intelligence, but it can't directly measure it (except perhaps working memory). And at least in cases like these, it won't work very well because it relies heavily on crystallized knowledge. When I took it, there were questions which I might have learned from school, but obviously I didn't have that experience; I believe this harmed my verbal IQ. You'll understand how verbal similarity and perhaps other sub scores could be likewise impacted. I also imagine that my math score suffered. My thinking is that there are numbers I would have been familiar with, thus reducing my response time. And I am more prone to error in my responses, due to lack of practice. I also would have had better schemes to quickly translate the data into an answer.</p>

<ol>
<li>Total years of schooling the child missed</li>
<li>Age of child when those years are missed (college vs highschool)</li>
<li>Child's general intelligence (not as measured by the WAIS)</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> </p>

<p>How would increasing total years missed accumulatively affect IQ (e.g. 6 years = 9 points)? There's an article below about college increasing students' IQs, but what about K-12--would missing earlier years affect IQ more severely? And would missing school have <strong>more</strong> or <strong>less</strong> severe impact on IQ scoring among more intelligent children?</p>

<p>If the child (perhaps now an adult) studies, would the child's IQ increase relatively drastically? When I say relative, I mean relative to someone else who also studies and has the same <em>real</em> general intelligence, but did attend K-12. And to keep it simple, let's stick to math IQ score for this question. </p>

<p>Lastly, is there a better test for measuring such a person's intelligence?</p>

<p>I asked many questions, <strong>probably more than exists within current research</strong>. If you work in psychometrics or have approximately relevant knowledge, <strong>I'd be happy to hear your assumptions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>And if I need to reduce my questions,</strong> then consider the full-scale scores below. If those are the scores of someone who missed school as I described, then what score would you expect them to earn had they not missed school? ... And, is there a better test for them?</p>

"What are some criticisms of HEXACO from the Big Five camp?","<p>I read the 2009 review-ish chapter of McCrae <em>in The Cambridge Handbook of Personality Psychology</em> and I noticed he never once mentions HEXACO (or its 6th axis: honesty-humility), although McCrae does spend the spacetime to debunk a (totally obscure to me) Polish model of personality that had added a 6th spirituality factor. That to me felt like sweeping HEXACO under the rug, so to speak.</p>

<p>Most of the research on relating HEXACO to Big Five has come (unsurprisingly) from the researchers/proponents of the former, see e.g. <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/15654/what-are-the-correlations-between-hexaco-and-neo-pi-factors"">What are the correlations between HEXACO and NEO-PI factors?</a> </p>

<p>So, has there been some explicit criticism of HEXACO from the Big Five ""heavyweights"" (well known researchers/promoters)?</p>

<hr>

<p>There is a passage in the same book in another chapter by Boele De Raad noting that: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Big Five structure has found large adherence, claims for psycholexically
  based factors beyond the Big Five have been made, for two reasons mainly.
  The first reason is that the correlation matrices may not be optimally exhausted,
  and the second reason is that the trait domain may not be truly exhausted. This
  second reason comes in two versions, one suggesting that the psycholexical
  approach has been too restrictive in selecting personality descriptors (Almagor,
  Tellegen andWaller 1995), and the other suggesting that the psycholexical approach
  has been restricted to the use of trait-descriptive adjectives (cf., De Raad and
  Hofstee 1993).</p>
  
  <p>Ashton and Lee (2001) argued along the lines of exhausting the correlation matrix.
  They suggested that an additional Honesty-Humility factor, representing such
  traits as honest, sincere, fair and just, versus dishonest, conceited and boasting,
  could systematically be extracted. Support for this sixth factor was observed in
  several languages (Ashton, Lee, Perugini et al. 2004), but not, or not clearly, in all
  languages where this sixth factor was studied, as in American-English (Ashton,
  Lee and Goldberg 2004), Turkish (Somer and Goldberg 1999) and Croatian
  (Mlacic and Ostendorf 2005).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is basically lexical criticism, but since the lexical perspective was hardly dominant in the development of the Big Five (according to the highly cited <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00970.x"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">review of McCrae and John, 1992</a>), this lexical criticism seems like a rather minor point.</p>

<p>Also note that De Raad himself appears to favor lexicalism, having <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.347"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proposed</a> an eight-factor model from the latter perspective, by extending analysis to more parts of speech than the traditional approach using just adjectives. So De Raad's criticism of HEXACO being from a lexical perspective isn't surprising.</p>

  One key input (left-hand panel) reaches M1 from the supplementary
  motor area (SMA) and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), which
  in turn receives inputs from the basal ganglia and the prefrontal
  cortex.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I'm failing to disambiguate the ending phrase (emphasis mine)  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>basal ganglia <strong>and</strong> the prefrontal cortex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is the ""and"" meant to be interpreted as a <em>logical AND</em> or <em>logical OR</em>? In other words, does a readiness potential in the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA) require an active input from both the basal ganglia <strong>AND</strong> the prefrontal cortex <strong>concurrently</strong> or is a sufficiently strong signal from <strong>either</strong> region alone sufficient? </p>

<p><strong>Hunch</strong> </p>

<p>My guess is that the latter is the case. For example, on the very same caption of Figure 1 part b, the author indicates that the signal from the frontopolar cortex starts a chain that ends with voluntary action of the right hand. This indicates that executive control from the frontopolar cortex  alone can trigger an eventual movement. Since this is only a hunch, I still want to clarify the point of confusion.  </p>

<p><strong>Intent</strong></p>

<p>I'm asking this question because I want to figure out a situation at the behavioral level, namely if people can trigger movements purely by executive function and independently of primal urges/apprehensions.  </p>

<p>Generally i would like to determine the d' or A' and bias measures for each hemifield, the correct calculation of FA% is crucial.</p>

<p>The Hit rate determination for LVF and RVF seems straight forward: correct left and right presses, each divided by 64, since there are 64 word presentations in each hemifield.</p>

<p>Question 1: when it comes to determining the false alarm rate for one hemifield which i would like to use for d' calculation: should i divide the measured FAs on one side by all possible FA occurences on that side i.e. 192 (128  bilateral nonword presentations + 64 nonwords in word-nonword trials)?</p>

<p>Training Working Memory: Why and how
Make your working memory work for you.
William R. Klemm Ph.D.
<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/memory-medic/201203/training-working-memory-why-and-how"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/memory-medic/201203/training-working-memory-why-and-how</a></p>

<p>Klemm makes the claim IQ is not fixed. He claims IQ improves dramatically in the early school years in all children. Moreover, a recent study shows that both verbal and non-verbal IQ can change (for better or worse) in teenagers. The recent study is cited in the above psychology today web link.</p>

<p>Is it a fact or a neuromyth to claim IQ is not fixed for adults? Processing speeds slow down as we get older, and working memory steadily deteriorates/declines as we get older, too. Are we doomed to get slower and have poorer working memories as we get much older (50, 60s, 70s, 80s)?</p>

<p>Or can we maintain our intelligence, working memory, and processing speeds for a longer period of time if we do physical exercise, keep physically fit, and live healthy lives? </p>

"Is it really possible to ""go too deep inside the killer's mind""?","<p>We've all seen it in film and hour-long format TV dramas, a brilliant criminal profiler, seen as the best in his field by their peers, delves 'too deeply' into the mind of the killer/rapist/undesirable he or she is looking for and disastrous consequences ensue. This often turns out in one of a few ways (the profiler committed the last N crimes unaware, he/she is led into a trap, he/she becomes the new killer, etc.).</p>

<p>My question is could this realistically happen? Would spending enough time trying to make yourself think like a serial murderer/crazed sex offender/phantom peanut butter thief really cause someone to 'slip in' to their behaviour patterns, unbeknownst to the profiler?</p>

<p>On one hand it seems like if you were trying to force yourself to <em>think</em> like a killer, eventually with enough dedication and time it might become second nature. But it still seems a little far-fetched that a perfectly normal (aka. non-murdering) person would be capable of it. Is this really even a technique used in this field?</p>

"Is continuous split or meta - awareness a scientifically supported concept?","<p>There are a number of spiritual practices that practice self-awareness and continuous awareness of one's thoughts and actions (for example the teachings of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle#Teachings"" rel=""nofollow"">Ekhart Tolle</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tolle writes that ""the most significant thing that can happen to a
  human being [is] the <strong>separation process of thinking and awareness</strong>"" and
  that awareness is ""the space in which thoughts exist"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also a number of techniques employed by people who practice lucid dreaming - namely reality checks and being aware of one's thoughts and surroundings. Lucid dreamers expect that this kind of awareness would carry over into the dream experience and help achieve lucid dreaming.</p>

<p>Both have a common goal - to create some kind of a meta-awareness, or a watchdog awareness, similar to a background process on a computer. A watchdog task on a computer can wake the computer up if some other process has hanged, or some other task is taking up too much resources.</p>

<p>My question is - <strong>Does modern science (2015) have evidence to support that human brain is capable of running the ""background process"" kind of meta awareness of one's thoughts and actions for extended period of time""?</strong> </p>

<p>My question about ordinary daily activities - can this kind of background awareness process be running all the time, regardless of activity performed?</p>

"Research on aversion to cognitive effort?","<p>I was reading Danny K's recent book for fun (<em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>, 2011), and he suggests briefly that some people's reliance on their intuitions (i.e., ""System 1"") might sometimes indicate a sort of aversion to cognitive effort (i.e., ""System 2"").  </p>

<p>For example, if you give a participant ""Joe"" a tricky problem that has an intuitive but false answer, Joe might not think too hard about the question, so he'll just give his (false) intuition.  In this case, Joe does not attempt elaborative processing or sustained cognitive effort (i.e., engaging System 2) because he has learned that this can be unpleasant and/or tiring.  Thus he relies on his intuition and gets the question wrong.</p>

<p>While there are probably many alternative explanations for Joe's behavior, it seems that aversion to mental effort could be one.  Is there any research exploring this idea? Or any research that frames it in another way (e.g., something to do with affective forecasting, learning, self-regulation)? Or am I totally making this up?</p>

"Consumer vs creator, what are the differences?","<p>Creators create, consumers consume what has been created. Consumers watch TV, creators write the script. Consumers play the game, creators design and make the game.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of creators and consumers I guess, from chefs and gourmets to artists and art collectors. Architects and people who like buying cool houses, mechanics/engineers and car enthusiasts, graphic designers and whoever uses their designed software.</p>

<p>In the end though the situation is always the same, on one hand we have a person or a group of people who created something, and on the other hand we have a person or a group of people that bought and ""consumed"" it. (There is a fine line between creator and someone doing what he's paid to do though)</p>

<p>I'm wondering on which side the grass is greener on the psychological level. Given that the creator likes to create what he's creating, and the consumer likes to consume what he's consuming, which is going to be happier? The artist while he paints, or the person while he admires the painting, the chef while he creates the recipe and cooks, or the person enjoying the food afterwards, the game developer or the person playing the game?</p>

<p><strong>Is the creator or the consumer more likely to be happy in the short</strong> (while it is being created vs while it is being consumed) <strong>and long term?</strong> (after it has been created vs after it has been consumed)</p>

"Correlation between BIS and BAS responses","<p>As a part of my lab experiment, participants had to answer questions for BIS and BAS (BAS reward, drive and fun) scales. The correlation matrix shows that BIS is significantly positively correlated with BAS reward, BAS fun and BAS drive. Has anyone experienced similar issues? Is this an issue? If yes, is it possible (and how) to correct for that?
BIS (Behavioral Inhibition System) and BAS (Behavioral Activation System) - I administered the scale developed by Carver and White (1994), as presented on pg. 323 in their work ""Behavioral inhibition, behavioral activation, and affective responses to impending reward and punishment: The BIS/BAS scales"" (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 67, 319-333). I would assume that BIS should not be positively correlated with any of the BAS scales as BIS is related to avoidance motivation and BAS is related to approach motivation.I.e. a person scoring high on BIS should not be scoring high on BAS measures and vice versa. 
The variables are intended as predictors. I want to examine if BAS (approach motivation) sensitivity predicts a rightward bias in product choice, and if BIS (avoidance motivation) sensitivity predicts a leftward bias. </p>

<p><strong>Edit -</strong>
<strong>To clarify as asked in the comments:</strong>  </p>

<p>This feeling of intense present can be <em>analogous</em> to the moment of having a dream full of action and chaos, then all of a sudden awaking to a dead silent and still bedroom. Or another example; one is sitting in a library and a large air conditioning system is running but not consciously noticed. Then, all of a sudden it switches off and there is a feeling if intense quietness and stillness and awareness of its absence. (These are <em>analogous moments</em>, where there is that dramatic switch in state... that is the subject in question but in this case not tied to any external event or dream.)</p>

<p>So why do we like stories at all? Why do some of us like stories to the point of obsessing over them?</p>

<p>How does this happen? And is this something that can be controlled (i.e. could you make someone who prefers violent stories prefer switch over to preferring romance stories? Can someone be conditioned to not be interested in any stories at all no matter what they may be about?)</p>

<p>Why is it also that once we start with a story, it can be hard to stop because you want to know what happens next or want to know how it ends? Why do some of us care if people ""spoil"" the ending for us by telling us what happens before we see or read or hear it, while some of us seem not to care?</p>

<li>understand both written, pronounced and somehow sound-coded form (like Morse)</li>
<li>write and say it naturally</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is not to teach computer speak to people, but to teach people speak to a computer in his language. In general, human brain can be taught anything. It is a programmable computer. However, you can only program it very slow. If you can teach your subconscious to multiply numbers, why can't you teach it to encode MD5? Or decoding HTTPS data given a key? Even bruteforce? </p>

<p>So the question is if there are any researches on the topic, or the people who tried such learning? Are there any techniques? Also, what if we teach a 2-year old child this language, will it be natural for him just like the English is natural for English-grown child?</p>

"Does classical music enhance intelligence in children more than other genres?","<p>This question is based on a previous question I have written on Parenting SE: <a href=""https://parenting.stackexchange.com/q/21080/17089"">Does playing classical music for infants and young children make them smarter?</a></p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Are these claims actually saying classical music is more intelligence enhancing than other forms of music? If so, is that true?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a composer, I would find this interesting because I think certainly there are many different kinds of music and it seems very surprising to single out one genre as requiring more intelligence. </p>

<p>For instance, suppose you say Mozart is more sophisticated then the Boss (Bruce Springsteen) and therefore more intelligence promoting.  By that logic then, Schoenberg's music should be better for children than Mozart since Schoenberg is certainly more complex than Mozart (e.g. chromatic vs diatonic scales; polymeter vs single meter). But I would never play Schoenberg for my child instead of Mozart because I find Schoenberg unnatural to listen to because it is so weird and complex. The point is I think simply saying classical music is more sophisticated or superior isn't a very meaningful distinction and greater clarification should be given about why classical music in particular enhances learning (if in fact that has any basis). </p>

<p>Another way of saying this is, why doesn't music in general enhance it then?  Why classical music in particular?  </p>

"Research on properties of effective feedback","<p>I've been searching everywhere I know of for research concerning the topics listed below, but have been unable to find anything. The best I can come up with is general literature on feedback. Specifically I am looking for research on the following subjects:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The effects of feedback on an artifact given <em>in-context</em> of artifact versus <em>out-of-context</em>. A concrete example is feedback on a report; is it preferable to provide written feedback in the report margins (in-context) or in a separate document (out-of-context), and why/why not?</p></li>
<li><p>Context switches in workflows and why they are bad/good in general.</p></li>
<li><p>Related to 2: theory supporting integration of related workflows into a single computer, supported workflow. A concrete example is Microsoft Word which has a feature to edit images inside the application itself even though it is a word processor. Why is this preferable compared to e.g. editing the image in an external application and inserting it afterward?  And is it (always)?  Are there special cases where it may be counter-productive?</p></li>
<li><p>Properties of effective feedback. Preferably supporting the theses that:</p>

<p>4.1 feedback on a produced artifact is more effective if given early than late. This could be supported by arguments about memory and learning in general, e.g. that it's easier to remember what you did just now than a few hours ago, and thus also easier to comprehend feedback about what you did and the artifacts you produced in that time.</p>

<p>4.2 feedback on an artifact is more effective when the receiver is in the same ""environment"" he was in when the artifact was produced. A counterexample would be to give feedback on a report written in Microsoft Word by copying the report onto a web page and writing the feedback there. In that case the environment where the feedback is read by the receiver (the webpage) is completely different from the one where the artifact was produced (Microsoft Word). This has negative effects on effectiveness (which and why?).</p></li>

<p>I imagine the literature would be within cognitive load theory, learning theory, user interface design, usability design etc, but any suggestions are very much appreciated.</p>

Usually I generate my own, but when I draw on existing literature to use reliably reproduced measurement scales, sometimes the items are poorly worded or vague enough that I would not consider them appropriate or valid. Consider the item:</p>

<p>""Weeds should be eradicated because they inhibit the full development of useful and ornamental plants.""</p>

<p>A participant can say that they disagree with this item. So do they think weeds shouldn't be eradicated? Or that they <em>should</em> be eradicated, but not for the reason given. Maybe they think that weeds <em>do</em> inhibit the full development of useful plants, but that is not sufficient cause for eradication of weeds. The question is vague enough that it doesn't confer any useful information about the participant's broader view on weeds except in the one fringe case where they agree with it as stated. Clearly it should be split into two items and already the scale is much improved by it.</p>

<p>There are other examples that are much more shockingly bad, but have been reproduced enough times that they form reliable scales. Is it better to use them as-is, with all their flaws, or to use them as fully as possible while fixing any glaring errors, or not to use them at all?</p>

<p><strong>What are the cognitive effects of increasing testosterone levels in men?</strong>. There's a tremendous amount of anecdotal evidence from body builders, etc, but I'm looking for hard science, where the levels were measured before and after, and the trials were less than a month long.</p>

<p>Some of the claims made about increased testosterone levels seem very interesting, and I would like to know if any of that is true. </p>

<ul>
<li>does increasing testosterone levels increase subjective feeling of well being in men?</li>
<li>does increased testosterone benefit concentration ?</li>
<li>does increased testosterone benefit non-sexual motivation or ambition?</li>
<li>does increased testosterone benefit logical/math/engineering endeavors?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what I see on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone#Brain"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia snippet on testosterone and brain</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>literature suggests that attention, memory, and spatial ability
  are key cognitive functions affected by testosterone in humans</strong>.
  Preliminary evidence suggests that low testosterone levels may be a
  risk factor for cognitive decline and possibly for dementia of the
  Alzheimer's type,[70][71][72][73] a key argument in life extension
  medicine for the use of testosterone in anti-aging therapies. Much of
  the literature, however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic
  relationship between spatial performance and circulating
  testosterone,[74] where both hypo- and hypersecretion (deficient- and
  excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on
  cognition.</p>

"Progress on Arnheim's perceptual forces in vision","<p>In the second edition of Rudolf Arnheim's <em>Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye</em>, published in 1974, (Google Books Preview available <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Art_and_Visual_Perception.html?id=9RktoatXGQ0C&amp;redir_esc=y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>) the opening chapter on ""balance"" begins with a discussion of ""perceptual forces"" in static imagery, such as line drawings and paintings. For Arnheim, perceptual forces are literal forces that act on perceived objects, with a point of application, a direction, and a magnitude. They usually do not have direct counterparts in physical reality, but ""Perceptually and artistically, they are quite real."" On page 17, available <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9RktoatXGQ0C&amp;pg=PA17"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, Arnheim states that he doesn't know where these forces are represented in the brain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… Where, then, are these forces?</p>
  
  <p>In order to answer this question we must recall how an observer obtains his knowledge of the square and the disk. Light rays, emanating from the sun or some other source, hit the object and are partly absorbed and partly reflected by it. Some of the reflected rays reach the lenses of the eye and are projected on its sensitive background, the retina. Many of the small receptor organs situated in the retina combine in groups by means of ganglion cells. Through these groupings a first, elementary organization of visual shape is obtained very close to the level of retinal stimulation. As the electrochemical messages travel toward their final destination in the brain, they are subjected to further shaping at other way stations until the pattern is completed at the various levels of the visual cortex.</p>
  
  <p><strong>At which stages of this complex process the physiological counterpart of our perceptual forces originates, and by what particular mechanisms it comes about, is beyond our present knowledge.</strong> If, however, we make the reasonable assumption that every aspect of a visual experience has its physiological counterpart in the nervous system, we can anticipate, in a general way, the nature of these brain processes. We can assert, for instance, that they must be field processes. This means that whatever happens at any one place is determined by the interaction between the parts and the whole. If it were otherwise, the various inductions, attractions, and repulsions could not occur in the field of visual experience.</p>
  
  <p>An observer sees the pushes and pulls in visual patterns as genuine properties of the perceived objects themselves. …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) What scientific progress on this problem has been made in the 40 years since?</p>

<p>Have we confirmed the existence of a universal, involuntary process that generates perceptual forces? If so, what is its mechanism? Where and how early are the forces perceived? To what extent are they influenced by top-down attention? Does the mechanism share neural resources with the perception of motion, or with other senses?</p>

</ul>

<p>it is presented as an undisputed fact that depression is an inflammatory disease.</p>

<p>For example (the first sentence of the abstract):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We now know that depression is associated with a chronic, low-grade inflammatory response and activation of cell-mediated immunity, as well as activation of the compensatory anti-inflammatory reflex system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, AFAIK, we are far from understanding the etiology of depression (perhaps there is no universal one). Sure, there are many correlates (for example – levels of neurotransmitters), but I haven't heard  that there a single, accepted cause (except for the cited paper). For the reference, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia mentions inflammation as one of multiple related conditions in the ""Other hypotheses"" section</a>. </p>

<p>So, as of now, <strong>is it universally accepted that depression is an inflammatory disease?</strong>
And if not, is it at least one of many mainstream opinions?</p>

<p>Consequently, I'm curious as to why this is false. Why does having the ability to fire and read the firing information off of individual neurons not imply that a seamless human-computer interface is possible? I'm assuming that this has something to do with the limits of the processing power of our brain and the limits of neuro-plasticity, but my experience in this domain is limited.</p>

<p>If this question is too broad (and I think it is), it can be reframed as a request for references. What current research is being done on this problem? What are the current approaches? Who is working on it? Are there any publications that nicely describe the progress in this (hypothetical) domain?</p>

"Is there difference between a memory of a dream and memory of waking experience?","<p>I'm very interested in dreaming and have pretty good dream recall. This makes me able to recall and distinguish hundreds of experience within my memory and label them as ""dreams"". <strong>I'm trying to understand if there's indeed some feature of a dream memory that makes it different from an ordinary waking memory?</strong></p>

<p>Upon reflection on my personal experiences, it appears to me that <strong>when I recall a waking life memory</strong>, typically the process is two fold and sequential - first recall the scene then recall the action and combine the two. For example: <em>I was sitting in a room at a local hackerspace + I was talking to fellow hackers there.</em> I can then proceed to try to recall pieces of that conversation. This process seems sequential to me.</p>

<p>However, <strong>when I recall the dream memory</strong>, it seems that I recall both place and action at the same time, together, with a typically longer sequence of events all recalled much quicker. For example: <em>I was locked in a room with no exit and has created a portal in the wall to escape from the room, flying out of a portal in some other location.</em>  These events are recalled all together, in less than a second, and are clearly identified as a dream along with the recall. The content of that dream, although clearly non-real is similar to a video game called ""Portal"" that I played on a computer in the waking life. I can recall the waking life expeirence of playing that game, although in a linear fashion.</p>

<p><strong>Has there been any brain imaging studies or other evidence that supports the idea that the recall of dreams is different from the recall of waking life experiences?</strong></p>

"Signal detection theory: How to calculate c' when d' is 0?","<p>Reframed the original question to include more background information:</p>

<p>My experiment concerns the recall ability of individuals concerning information about animals. Within-subject design: Whether an animal is dangerous or safe (danger). Whether an animal lives in Africa or Australia (location). In the recall phase, participants had to identify the animals they saw as dangerous/safe, African/Australian. 
Responses were coded as Hit (stimuli danger, response danger), Miss (stimuli danger, response Safe), correct rejection (Stimuli safe, response safe) and finally false alarm (stimuli safe, response danger)
We expected that sensitivity depends on the importance of the information to wellbeing (this has been found in other studies as well), but also that bias is affected by individual differences. D’ refers to sensitivity as it is the difference between the signal (danger) and noise distribution (safe). C refers to the bias (the criterion of the respondent, a tendency to say yes or no) and c’ is c relative to d’ . However, d’ in some cases is 0, when the proportion of hits (hits/(hits+misses) is equal to the proportion of false alarms (false alarms/(fa+correct rejections)) making it impossible to compute c’ (c/d'). As such, my question is whether there is a commonly used and supported correction? 
More information about signal detection theory and its use in cognitive sciences can be found <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_theory"">here</a></p>

"The relationship between creativity and focus","<p>From what I have read here and there, I've managed to stitch together some superficial understanding of focus and creativity. My understanding is that focus and creativity seem like opposites.</p>

<p>I've seen references (which all seem to originate from a coursera course on learning) to two distinct ""modes of thought"". One called 'Focused' and one called 'Diffuse'. In focused mode, we focus on doing something we already know how to do. In Diffuse mode, we don't focus on a specific task we are instead searching for a way to do something, until we come up with an idea - it is at that point we focus on completing a task.</p>

<p>Whether this view of thought is scientifically grounded or not, there does seem to be some truth to it: the default mode network, whose activity is reduced during certain types of meditation (at least, according to wikipedia), from what i can understand is linked to creativity . The explanation of this default mode seems similar to the ""diffuse"" mode of thought.</p>

<p>It seems (at least, to me), that focus and creativity are opposites - which makes sense in some ways. But is it really so?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are creativity and focus competitive as far as the brain structures that support these are concerned? That is, if I improve my ability to focus, will it interfere with my <strong>ability</strong> to be creative?
This seems somewhat ridiculous to me, but I suspect it's only because I want to believe it isn't so. For the moment, my understanding is that creativity and focus are separate,  and require ""switching"" between them, which leads to the next question:</p></li>
<li><p>Are creativity and focus competitive as far as brain activity goes? that is, if I try to focus on something right now, will it interfere with my ability to be creative? If I focus on solving a problem I know how to solve, I probably won't be looking for a creative solution (also, there is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Einstellung effect"">Einstellung effect</a>).

The article says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The origin of consciousness reflects our place in the universe, the nature of our existence. Did consciousness evolve from complex computations among brain neurons, as most scientists assert? Or has consciousness, in some sense, been here all along, as spiritual approaches maintain?' ask Hameroff and Penrose in the current review. 'This opens a potential Pandora's Box, but our theory accommodates both these views, <strong>suggesting consciousness derives from quantum vibrations in microtubules</strong>, protein polymers inside brain neurons, which both govern neuronal and synaptic function, and connect brain processes to self-organizing processes in the fine scale, 'proto-conscious' quantum structure of reality.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 18th century, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hartley_(philosopher)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>David Hartley</strong></a> proposed in his book <strong><em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_on_Man"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Observations of Man</a></em></strong> that counciousness arises when particles of matter vibrate in our brain. Wikipedia says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hartley's physical theory gave birth to the modern study of the intimate connection of physiological and psychical facts. He believed that <strong>sensation is the result of a vibration of the minute particles of the medullary substance of the nerves</strong>, to account for which he postulated, with Newton, a subtle elastic ether, rare in the interstices of solid bodies and in their close neighbourhood, and denser as it recedes from them. Pleasure is the result of moderate vibrations, pain of vibrations so violent as to break the continuity of the nerves. <strong>These vibrations leave behind them in the brain a tendency to fainter vibrations or ""vibratiuncles"" of a similar kind, which correspond to ""ideas of sensation.""</strong> This accounts for memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Joseph Priestley</strong></a> expanded on this idea in his essay <strong><em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disquisitions_relating_to_Matter_and_Spirit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Disquisitions Relating to Matter and Spirit</a></em></strong>. Priestley believed that all matter had the power of attraction and repulsion  (<a href=""https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/5265/was-joseph-priestley-describing-fundamental-interactions-in-the-18th-century"">fundamental interactions?</a>) and that perception and thought arises from this phenomena in our brain through <strong><em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_ideas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">association</a></em></strong>. Priestley says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Nothing but a precise and definite knowledge of the nature of perception and thought can authorize any person to affirm, whether they may not belong to an extended substance, which has also the properties of attraction and repulsion.</strong> Seeing, therefore, no sort of reason to imagine that these different properties are really inconsistent any more than the different properties of resistance and extension, I am, of course, under the necessity of being guided by the phenomena in my conclusions concerning the proper feat of the powers of perception and thought.</p>

"Neural field application question","<p>I am following a class where we have just learned about so-called neural fields (the prof called them recurrent neural networks and said they are used to model large populations of real neurons). Now we received homework to get to know the method using a simulation, but we got stuck at the last question, about the usefulness of a certain behaviour.</p>

<p>These are our guidelines:</p>

<p><em>Reset the field; make sure it can memorise one bump. 
Give two equal inputs &lt; 15 degrees apart. Reduce until the activity level forms one concave signal (so not like in the picture below).</em> </p>

<p>This all works. As soon as the difference goes below 10, the bump changes from the signal below to a concave one, just as the input signal does. However, then we get the question:</p>

<p><em>In what situation would such behaviour be useful?</em>   </p>

<p>And we're sort of stuck there. Is there someone who could point us into the right direction? </p>

"Why is Biological plausibility in Machine Learning important?","<p>I have found that many authors of machine learning papers, that employ the <em>Hebbian learning</em> rule, refer to the <strong>biological plausibility of it</strong>, as one of the arguments to use it instead of the well known back-propagation algorithm

"What is the frequency range of electrotactile stimulation?","<p>I have been trying to find out what the (human) electrotactile frequency range is. Since this is a much more experimental method (and <a href=""http://www.uta.fi/sis/tie/hui/schedule/HUI2013-3-tactile-applications.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more unpleasant</a>) than the traditional vibrotactile method, the research is more limited. </p>

<p><em>E.g.,</em> for vibrotatctile I could find in <a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2015.00038/full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sonar and Paik (2016)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mechanoreceptors responsible for vibrotactile sensation are the rapidly adapting (RA) and Pacinian corpuscle (PC) receptors with perceptible frequencies ranging from 3 to 100 and 100 to 400 Hz, respectively (Choi and Kuchenbecker, 2013).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually that seems to contain a typo or misquote of the paper they cite, which puts the PC at 10-500 Hz:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GRe4N.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GRe4N.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Anyhow, for electrotactile I could only find what some researchers have used in some of their devices, e.g. <a href=""https://tcnl.bme.wisc.edu/sites/default/files/2007-Okpara-NE-BMES-4x4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Okpara et al., 2007</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on our prior unpublished work, the four levels of frequency were set at 100, 35, 15 and 10 Hz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That suggests a lower range perhaps of only 10-100 Hz. But is that the full range range that can be felt using electrotactile stimulation?</p>

<p>It's been suggested to me that it may be exactly the same as for vibrotactile, but a <a href=""http://www.uta.fi/sis/tie/hui/schedule/HUI2013-3-tactile-applications.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">set of slides</a> comparing various methods says about electrotactile:</p>

"How is hypnosis not mind control?","<p>OK, you might have to bare with me on this one.</p>

<p>The concept that someone might influence another, even through suggestions, has never once sat comfortably with me.</p>

<p>Across the internet people seem to be in two camps about hypnosis – those who have no idea what hypnosis is and portray it as blatant mind control, and those that reckon they understand what it is, saying that people under hypnosis have complete control and can reject suggestions if they do not agree with them – if this were entirely true, you wouldn’t be able to induce hypnosis on unsuspecting victims in the first place.</p>

<p>However, I feel that the truth lies somewhere in between.</p>

<p>While it is true that people can reject suggestions in hypnosis, it appears to me that this can be simply bypassed through a correct strategy of wording suggestions.</p>

<p>By wording suggestions that avoid evoking conflict with the subject’s belief system, a hypnotist can make the subject feel like the hypnotist’s interests are enjoyable and relaxing, even if the subject wouldn’t ordinarily consent.</p>

<p>For example, the suggestion
“The deeper you go, the better you feel, the better you feel, the deeper you go” followed by
“every step deeper you go, you feel 10x more comfortable with the words I say” - helps the subject to believe that following the hypnotist’s instructions is the right thing to do, even if it doesn’t follow their moral code (and why should they care, they feel really really good because they are following the instructions).
The first suggestion focuses on going deeper, and the second uses that deepening loop as a lever to strengthen the suggestibility of the subject. After extended suggestion and deepening, does this not allow for more ‘edgy’ suggestions because the subject is more comfortable with the words that the hypnotist says?</p>

<p>It’s often commented by hypnotists that a patient can wake up at any point if they do not feel comfortable with the suggestions, but the whole key to hypnosis is creating comfort and using that comfort to embed suggestions. Most people are looking to relax and enjoy themselves. If a hypnotist associates doing something illicit with relaxation and joy, I foresee the patient being easily manipulated, which in laymen terms, is brainwashing.</p>

<p>This was demonstrated by Derren brown, whereby he uses hypnosis to compel a man to shoot a target on command (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xfZJQzAhc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xfZJQzAhc</a>). (the patient meanwhile completely oblivious to the fact that he is being trained to assassinate someone, only believing that he is shooting an inanimate target)
Furthermore, cases such as (<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/15/ohio-lawyer-hypnotized-six-female-clients-then-he-molested-them/?utm_term=.aadcde7accb1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/11/15/ohio-lawyer-hypnotized-six-female-clients-then-he-molested-them/?utm_term=.aadcde7accb1</a>) show that men have taken advantage of women under hypnosis, leaving the women memory less and confused only to find out they were under hypnosis from a lucky police investigation. Essentially, is this not the definition of mind control?</p>

<p>Even if hypnosis is not as simple as: “you are now hypnotised, now kill this person/have sex with me”, is this principle not still the same through carefully worded suggestions, manipulation and making the person believe what they are doing is desirable? (as Darren Brown proves can be done)</p>

<p>If such manipulation is possible, then HOW is this not discussed with more criticism?
And, probably more importantly, HOW can anyone trust a hypnotherapist if they have the ability to slowly word their way around your belief system one suggestion at a time?</p>

<p>After-all, what are we but animals without a personalised belief system?</p>

<p>Given the above, how close is hypnosis truly to the infamous 'mind control' that it is depicted as in pop culture? And why is this always overlooked by hypnotherapists when discussing hypnosis? Have I missed something? Is Derren Brown, the world famous hypnotist a fraud?</p>

"Is hypnosis-enhanced therapy more efficacious than its non-hypnotic counterpart?","<p>There is a farily upvoted question hene (and so are answers to it) on whether <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/4473/does-hypnotherapy-hypnosis-in-any-form-for-any-type-of-disorder-work"">""Does hypnotherapy/hypnosis, in any form, for any type of disorder, work?""</a>. To me, that's a pretty weak and confusing question to ask. You can interpret it as ""is hypnotherapy better than no therapy"", which is quite a different question than ""does hypnosis enhance (or not) another therapy, i.e. is hypnotherapy better than (a similar enough) non-hypnotic therapy"". The latter question is in some sense superior because it tries to isolate whether hypnosis is worth the hassle when you can also do without. </p>

<p>And the studies I could find on this latter contrast are not as clear-cut as one would like. An <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7751482"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1995 meta-analysis</a> on various conditions reported that hypnosis significantly improved outcomes, but a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8698944"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">re-analysis a year later</a> of just the obesity subset showed that the initially reported meta-analytical conclusion critically hinged on one study that was an outlier in terms of the effect size it reported; upon exclusion of that study the overall result lost statistical significance. Furthermore this re-analysis found numerical errors in the original one. From this, it's unclear to me whether the conclusion of the 1995 meta-analysis is tenable for any illnesses.</p>

<p>Likewise a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22655330/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2012 review of CBT vs CBH</a> for anxiety disorders could not really come to a conclusion and called for more research.</p>

<p>So--my question is--is there an illness for which hypnosis unequivocally enhances treatment outcomes compared to a similar enough non-hypnotic therapy? By unequivocally here I mean at least a review based on several studies deemed of reasonable quality.</p>

"Memorization of incorrect math facts","<p>Today I had a talk with a friend who told me that according to him, it is possible to ""destroy"" someone's ability to do math for his entire life by taking the person at age 5, telling him something totally wrong (for instance that the digits used in the decimal enumeration system are in order something like 8, 5, 4, 9, 2, 3, 0, 6, 1, 7 and calling them respectively ""three"", ""seven"", ""one"", ""six"" and so on) so that once the wrong information has been assimilated in the long-term memory it would be impossible for the person to correct and ""overwrite"" something that has been learned by heart.</p>

<p>Of course this example is an exaggeration, but I was wondering whether this would explain some difficulties people have who write hundreds of times the same mathematical errors like (a+b)<sup>2</sup>=a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>, and other stuff like this, even after many mathematical teachers explain to them that they are wrong. My assumption here is that the ""correct"" way had not yet reached the long term memory, so it would have done less harm than in the first situation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The visuospatial ability referred to as mental rotation has been shown to produce one of the largest and most consistent sex differences,
  in favor of males, in the cognitive literature. The current study utilizes both a paper-and-pencil version of the mental rotations test (MRT)
  and a virtual environment for investigating rotational ability among 44 adult subjects. Results replicate sex differences traditionally seen
  on paper-and-pencil measures, while no sex effects were observed in the virtual environment. These findings are discussed in terms of task
  demands and motor involvement. Sex differences were also seen in the patterns of correlations between rotation tasks and other neuropsychological
  measures. Current results suggest men may rely more on left hemisphere processing than women when engaged in rotational tasks.</p>

"How to counteract the deterioration of speech in stutterers by targeting sympathetic arousal?","<p>I am quoting a good overview from a Quora member about the reasons why people stutter when exposed to stress:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...The underlying physiological basis of why stress provokes stuttering
  has been addressed by <a href=""https://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=1778933"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Weber &amp; Smith, (1990)</a>. It shows that speaking
  increases autonomic activity (elevated blood flow, increased heart
  rate, sweating) and that this sympathetic arousal was correlated with
  increased stuttering behaviors in stutterers. Interestingly, the
  sympathetic arousal of stutterers was found not to be outside the
  range of controls. The authors bring up several hypotheses as to why
  sympathetic activity may deteriorate speech fluency in stutterers:</p>
  
  <p>Increased autonomic activity has been associated with <strong>irregular
  breathing</strong>, which may affect speaking; </p>
  
  <p>Release of the <strong>stress hormone adrenalin</strong> may induce <strong>muscle tremor</strong> and <strong>spasms</strong> that can affect speech production; </p>
  
  <p>Sympathetic regulation of <strong>afferent control of the
  sensitivity of sensory receptors</strong> (muscle spindles and
  mechanoreceptors) in the <strong>oralmotor, laryngeal and respiratory system</strong>
  may affect speech motor processes; </p>
  
  <p>The <strong>gain of reflex arches</strong>
  (feedback) involved in the <strong>musculature engaged in speech</strong> may be
  modulated such that speech fluency is negatively impacted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, clinical research in this field is not that advanced and good evidence on human studies is yet to be seen.</p>

<p>My question is whether we already know compounds whose mechanisms can <strong>in theory</strong> help to deal or ameliorate these pathological process in stutterers? </p>

They were then asked to estimate the number of jelly beans.</p>

People who made their own estimate first (self-anchoring) were initially about 46% accurate, but after seeing Jelly Bean Counter 5000's estimate, they increased to about 72% accurate.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss to explain why people exposed to an accurate estimate (Jelly Bean Counter 5000) ended up being less accurate than people who formed their own inaccurate opinion first. Can anybody provide any alternative explanations? Are there any theories that might be applicable?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Updating of working memory has been associated with striato-frontal
  brain regions and phasic dopaminergic neurotransmission. We assessed
  raclopride binding to striatal dopamine (DA) D2 receptors during a
  letter-updating task and a control condition before and after 5 weeks
  of updating training. Results showed that updating affected DA
  activity before training and that training further increased striatal
  DA release during updating. These findings highlight the pivotal role
  of transient neural processes associated with D2 receptor activity in
  working memory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joe Hardy goes on to claim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This result shows that cognitive training with exercises similar to
  those on Lumosity can change the way the brain works at a fundamental
  chemical level. Indeed, we’ve known for several years that the right
  kind of cognitive training can enhance brain functions like working
  memory.</p>

"Can the Go/No-Go Association Task be faked?","<p><a href=""http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/gnat/""><strong>Go/No-Go Association task</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The GNAT (pronounced like the bug) is a flexible technique designed to
  measure implicit social cognition.  Conceptually similar to other
  implicit measures like the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald,
  McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, JPSP, 1998), the GNAT assesses automatic
  associations between concept (e.g., gender) and attribute (e.g.,
  evaluation) categories.  The GNAT has two features that distinguish it
  from other measures of implicit social cognition.  First, the GNAT is
  designed to be use signal detection statistics in its calculation of
  automatic associations (d-prime), but can also be adapted to utilize
  response latency as its operational dependent variable.  Second, the
  GNAT is flexible in the establishing of contextual characteristics for
  the evaluative situation.  For example, the IAT requires an attitude
  toward one category (insects) be assessed relative to a second
  category (flowers). With the GNAT, experimenters can vary whether
  insects are evaluated in the context of a single category (flowers), a
  superordinate category (animals), a generic category (objects), or
  with no context at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The GNAT is often used with the intention of obtaining an implicit measure of self-esteem, sexism, racism, aggression, and so on. In some cases, test takers may be motivated to score in a particular way on the GNAT (e.g., not implicitly sexist or racist). </p>

"How to efficiently get a sense of the meaning of a score on a non-aptitude test that you encounter in a journal article?","<p><strong>Context:</strong> When reading research articles in psychology, you often encounter new non-aptitude self-report psychological tests (e.g., measures of personality, well-being, psychopathology, learning style, stress, goal orientation, etc.). Most of these tests involve obtaining the sum or the mean of a set of items for one or more scales or subscales. Each item typically involves item text and a consistent set of response options (e.g., Likert-type response scales, yes-no response scales, etc.). There are thousands of such scales, some which are frequently used; others are used only once.</p>

<p>A lot has been written about how to assess <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_validity"" rel=""nofollow"">test validity</a>. However, here I wanted to focus particularly on how to assess what a particular individual or group score means. Specifically, I'm thinking of the situation where you are reading a journal article and you encounter a scale that you have not seen before, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 10-item measure of self-esteem on 1 to 5 scale; group mean is 3.2. Is the sample generally high, low, or moderate in self-esteem?</li>
<li>A 30-item check-list of good eating habits with a mean of 20.7. Does the sample have good eating habits? </li>
</ul>

<p>For well developed tests, there is a test manual. Other times there is a website or key journal article with information. Finally, in some cases, very little information is readily available. In some cases useful information is given in the methods section, but typically, on its own, this is inadequate. 
Thus, the process of trying to locate information such as item content and normative comparisons begin.  </p>

<p>A lot has been said about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm-referenced_test"" rel=""nofollow"">normative</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterion-referenced_assessment"" rel=""nofollow"">criterion referenced test</a> interpretation.  If you are using a test in clinical practice or you are using a test in your own research, you should invest time in understanding what different scores on the test actually mean.   However, when casually reading a journal article you can encounter many tests. 
In such cases, the article is one of many, and you might just want to get a quick sense of what a given score means.</p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is a good way to get both a normative and absolute understanding of the meaning of a group or individual non-aptitude test score?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What is an efficient way of obtaining the information required  to make such a judgement?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Note the use of the term ""non-aptitude"". I'd like to exclude discussion of intelligence testing, ability testing, and knowledge testing, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To clarify, I didn't mean to imply in the question that item information was not available anywhere. I guess the question is referring to the general situation where there probably are previous uses of the measure in the literature, and there might be a key article that describes the measure somewhere. I guess I'm thinking of a good general strategy for securing relevant information and then using it to form an understanding of the scale properties.</p>

"Is the Myer Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) a reasonable scientific theory?","<p><strong>Background:</strong>
MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. It's a theory that suggests that people can be divided into 16 types, based on the way they percieve and analyse information (whether they make decisions based on logic or their feel, rely more on intuition or direct sensoric perception, and whether they are more on judging or percieving approach to things happen).</p>

<p>All of these ""preferences"" are fit into the ""consciousness model"" in the way, in which you can understand the appearance or behavior of a certain ""type"" by looking what are the dominating preferences (feeling against thinking, sensoric perception against intuition, judging vs percieving).</p>

"Problems with using personal feedback to motivate participation in an online psychological experiment?","<p>I am planning on running an online psychological experiment where participants must learn about various simulated environments and then make inferences about them. Because completing the experiment would require a nontrivial amount of attention and time, I have been toying with the idea of giving personal feedback at the end of the experiment (i.e., using gamification). </p>

<p>I am considering giving participants feedback regarding how their responses compare to our computational model's predictions and/or to the average. The hope is that receiving a ""score"", even when it's made clear that such a score is not evaluative or absolute, will get people to pay more attention and will make them more likely to complete the task. The feedback would only be offered following the experiment itself, and its precise nature would not be revealed until that time. Moreover, I wouldn't specify how our predicted scores are derived. Calculating the exact values by hand would be extremely time consuming, so even if the derivation is explained I don't see how anyone could realistically bias their responses with that knowledge.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Does giving personal feedback raise any ethical problems? </li>
<li>How might it affect response patterns?</li>
<li>Will giving personal feedback elicit higher completion rates and more attentive responding, without any significant complications?</li>

"To what degree do fetishes differ from conventional sexual orientation?","<p>If a person can develop - through some function of psychology/imprinting - an explicit attraction to some object (objectophilia - and in some cases, such individuals go so far as to have fully expressed relationships with such objects), then is it possible for a homosexual to develop a 'fetish' towards members of the opposite sex, or similarly a heterosexual towards members of the same sex?</p>

<p>Furthermore, how would such an attraction differ (if at all) compared to 'non-fetish' based sexual orientations such as individuals that identify as bisexual? Or would they appear, at least superficially, indistinguishable?</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I was reading different studies on the whole, ""nature vs nurture"" debate regarding homosexuality - controversy aside, it sparked the idea that perhaps, like paedophiles who become infatuated with children etc, whether its possible for a person to become (through some exceptional circumstances) infatuated with members of the opposite/same gender, even if they would not otherwise be considered as bisexual. </p>

<p>My point being, if someone is able to become attracted to cars in early childhood, that we can easily label as a fetish because of its context: is it therefore possible for a naturally gay person (or otherwise) to become infatuated with the gender which they would not otherwise be attracted to, because of the similar circumstances that, in my described example, would drive a man to fall in love with his car – and would we be able to identify this as such. (In short becoming 'bisexual', but perhaps superficially)</p>

<p>(Ps - for the people arguing over my use of the term ""fetish"", I do not presume to be an expert on the subject, and frankly wouldn't want to :), but seeing as people can be attracted to objects: objectophilia, animals: zoophilia, children: paedophilia, etc, it seems to me that just because the opposite gender doesn't fit into an accepted category as a ""non-genital body part"", it couldn't occur under the guise of bisexuality. And, as one comment so enthusiastically assented, ""Anyone who has an attraction to both sexes is bisexual,"" which is what we all assume, and yet, should my proposed hypothesis be true, this might not be as straight forward as it is intuitively understood.)</p>

<p>Perhaps gamma waves (in the orbitofrontal cortex and areas of the prefrontal cortex) are generated from simply a deeper focus. However, if that's the case, it's still not clear to me how one can attain this. What kind of techniques are likely to lead to this phenomenon? Is it more likely that a more open/wide focus (example cue: ""pay attention to all thoughts/feelings/sensations that appear in your mind and, if you get distracted, just come back to the meditation"") or narrow/sharp focus (example cue: ""pretend to receive a huge reward for focusing on your breath with high clarity and minimal distractions"") leads to gamma activity? Are there any other dimensions of mindfulness meditation that are relevant here?</p>

"Is decision making inference?","<p>Inference is the process of generating further premises from information. Sperber et al (2012) write:</p>

<p>'An inference, as the term is used in psychology, is a process that, given some input information reliably yields as output further information that is likely to be true if the input information is. Inference is involved not only in thinking but also in perception and in motor control. When you see a three-dimensional object, a house or a horse, for instance, you have sensory information only about the part of its surface that reflects light to your retina, and perceiving it as a house or as a horse involves inferring from this sensory information about a surface the kind of three-dimensional object it is. When you decide to grasp, say, a mug, you use your perception of the mug and of your own bodily position in space to infer at each moment throughout the movement the best way to carry out you intention. Inferences so understood are performed not only by humans but by all species endowed with cognitive capacities. They are an essential ingredient of any cognitive system.'</p>

<p>Judgement and decision making are different processes.</p>

<p>Judgement, the process of generating factual conclusions from evidence using generalisations is clearly inference. Jolls et al (1998) refer to judgement as '[assessing] the probability of an uncertain event.' Baron (2008) confirms '[T]he term “judgment,” ... refers to the process of inference.'</p>

<p>However, is decision making, the process of choosing a course of action based on a judgement about the state of the world also an inference? If not, what is it?</p>

<p>Also, when I'm playing a game or playing music, I think about embarrassing myself, making mistakes and think what may the audience/team mates thinking about me? So I avoid it and when I actually get a chance of play, I make mistake and regret/punish myself mentally for making a mistake or regret quite a bit. So, basically, this results me in being low confident. </p>

<p>I'm thinking about ""impressing people"" and me resulting in an embarrassing situation, acting stupid, sounding stupid would spoil my ""impression"". 
However, I want to act stupid or sound stupid sometime and be ok with it. 
Somehow my biology/mind prevents me every time and I feel the resistance. </p>

According to <a href=""https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/science-says-were-sending-our-kids-to-school-much-too-early-and-that-can-hurt-th.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/science-says-were-sending-our-kids-to-school-much-too-early-and-that-can-hurt-th.html</a>, it's better to start school at an older age. I think they mean it's better to start grade 1 at an older age because of course those who don't go to kindergarten then start grade 1 at the normal age start an an older age than those who do go to kindergarten then start grade 1 a year later than normal. Maybe for some things people can become too old to learn. For example, Mary and Janelle from Sister Wives were raised very differently and then they had trouble understanding each other's way of thinking until they went to a therapist to understand each other. That doesn't mean there's a universal tendency for everything to be harder to learn when you're older. Maybe the real reason why students in China learn fractions so quickly and well is not because they're taught so young but either because of the method they're taught fractions as described in the video or because there's a general tendency for Chinese people to be more likely to be smart because of their genome.</p>

<p>Maybe Mary and Janelle being too old to learn each other's way of thinking actually meant they were very smart. They cannot possibly figure out absolutely everything anyone else can figure out like a God and maybe being too old to learn means they're smart enough to be quite well aware that although there are risks with doing things exactly the way they are used to, there are also risks with trying doing things in a new and different way.</p>

<p>I think that in addition to that, sometimes when somebody learns something while they're so young, they're more likely to misinterpret what they're getting taught. <a href=""https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/10247/how-to-teach-adults-elementary-concepts/10248#10248"">This answer</a> appears to support my claim. According to <a href=""https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/926/whence-the-everything-is-linear-phenomenon-and-what-can-we-do-about-it"">https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/926/whence-the-everything-is-linear-phenomenon-and-what-can-we-do-about-it</a>, maybe some students learn something wrong and then after unlearn it later. Also in one episode of ""My 600 lb life"" the adult patient who is overweight during the episode, at the time she was 5, her parents kept saying ""You're too fat. You can't have it"" meaning dessert and then she thought it was a punishment for being fat and got very depressed. Unconsciously, that's probably because it's possible to deduce from the fact that she got a punishment that she did something wrong. I think that actually she was too young to be able to figure out how to interpret the message the way she was intended to and an older person who's fat if that was said to them would be able to figure out that the parents weren't trying to be so mean and meant they should not have dessert because it's very sweet and might make them fatter and then they might die of a heart attack.</p>

<p>Is it actually true that students tend to learn better from school when they start grade 1 at an older age? If so, could one reason be because those who start grade 1 at the normal age are more likely to face the problem where they are not yet ready to learn the basics and then they move on from the basics before they were ready to be able to learn them and then struggle to learn the later material because they're missing the basics? Could another possible reason be because they're less likely to be young enough to misinterpret what they're getting taught?</p>

"What is the state of the art on the wiring optimisation problem?","<p>One of the earliest neuroscientists, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, postulated that brains are arranged to minimise wire length [1]. In [1] Dmitri Chklovskii and Charles Stevens formulate this problem as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wiring a brain presents formidable problems because of the extremely
  large number of connections: a microliter of cortex contains
  approximately 105 neurons, 109 synapses, and 4 km ofaxons, with 60% of
  the cortical volume being taken up with ""wire"", half of this by axons
  and the other half by dendrites. [ 1] Each cortical neighborhood must
  have exactly the right balance of components; if too many cell bodies
  were present in a particular mm cube, for example, insufficient space
  would remain for the axons, dendrites and synapses. Here we ask ""What
  fraction of the cortical volume should be wires (axons + dendrites)?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the formulation of this problem continues to evolve and its solution is far from settled, I am motivated by its potential impact on different areas of neuroscience. In particular, the areas of developmental neuroscience, network neuroscience and biophysics(i.e. the energetic constraints on information processing in human brains). </p>

<p>Due to its historical importance and potential impact on the field of neuroscience, I'd like to learn more about the state-of-the-art on this problem. From my own literature review and a question I asked on Twitter, I managed to gather the following references listed below. </p>

One thing I find curious is that although there has been an explosion of neuroscience data since the year 2010 nearly half the papers I have found that directly attempt to answer the question were written before 2010. </p>

"What are the ethics (for clinical psychiatrists) of posting videos on Youtube with poorly-worded guidance about disorders?","<p>I've watched a few Youtube videos about dealing with narcissists and I noticed a few patterns.  </p>

<h2>Videos.</h2>

<p>The videos appear to be genuine attempts to provide <em>some</em> help to people who are dealing with narcissistic abuse.  The people publishing them are either practitioners or coaches.  Usually they post contact information in the video descriptions to promote their practices.  This seems par for the course.  Some videos provide examples of narcissistic behavior by showing recorded episodes of interactions with extreme narcissists.  They claim to have been recorded legally, which is fine.</p>

<h2>Comments.</h2>

<p>I also noticed that many of the comments to the videos seem to express a great deal of hostility towards current of former narcissists in their lives.  Frankly, I am having trouble telling the difference between the narcissists, as they are described in the videos, and those who claim to be their victims in the comments.  </p>

<p>It's not that there is just a rage directed towards those whom they perceive as having taken away their control over their lives.  It's that these supposed narcissists do not acquiesce to the victims' various demands.  Which shows both a feeling of entitlement and a lack of self-awareness.  And it is, in fact, expressed with a great deal of rage.</p>

<h2>Contradiction.</h2>

<p>I am having a difficult time making sense of it because, on the one hand, the ""victims"" do describe some patterns of behavior which the videos attribute to narcissists.  On the other hand, the ""victims"" themselves seem to exhibit behavior symptomatic of narcissists.</p>

<p>The recorded audios of narcissists abusing their victims demonstrate clearly abusive behavior.  But the <strong>definitions of narcissistic abuse, given in the videos, seem to ""cast too wide a net"".  They provide good guidance for what makes a narcissist, but do not provide any real tests to exclude the possibility of someone being a narcissist</strong>.   They can probably provide a justification for actual narcissists to justify their abuse of their victims, as they appear to do in the comments.</p>

<p>The fact that all these practitioners can correctly identify narcissists as such, but give poor definitions, as guidance for other on how to identify potential narcissists, makes me think that the practice of making such videos should be unethical.</p>

<h2>Question.</h2>

<p>Is it unethical though?  Is the idea of avoiding the risks of casting aspersions (through definition which are overly pathologizing of normal behaviors) a part of ethics of clinical psychiatry?  </p>

"Generosity in the World Happiness Score","<p>One factor in the <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/World_Happiness_Report#/2018_report"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">World Happiness Score</a> is <a href=""https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Generosity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generosity</a>. I had trouble to understand what this actually means and how it enters into the score. </p>

<p>These were my specific questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does ""generosity"" mean that the individuals <strong>feel</strong> or <strong>are</strong> generous themselves (which feels good)?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it mean that the individuals <strong>experience</strong> generosity by their fellow citizens (which would affect happiness in a different way)?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it mean that the individuals experience generosity by their government or employer or other superior party?</p></li>
<li><p>Does it mean <strong>all of this together</strong>, giving a cumulated number of some kind?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is generosity preferred to other similar factors like <strong>fairness</strong> or <strong>solidarity</strong>?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>At <a href=""https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/41357/generosity-in-the-world-happiness-score?noredirect=1#comment161140_41357"">Politics (Beta)</a> I got this answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to <a href=""https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/changing-world-happiness/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/changing-world-happiness/</a> </p>
  
  <p>Generosity is the residual of regressing the national average of GWP responses to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on GDP per capita.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But for several reasons, this question - even with regression to GDP per capita - doesn't give a good measure for generosity, I believe:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many people (in the Western world) donate money mainly around Christmas.</p></li>
<li><p>The amount of money they donate can hardly be considered really ""generous"".</p></li>
<li><p>Many people in poorer regions of the world don't have enough money to give some of it away (but possibly other things).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So my questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why did ""generosity"" enter into the World Happiness Score nevertheless, and in the way it does? And why so prominently, on an equal footing with social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, and - also quite surprisingly - perceptions of corruption?</p></li>
<li><p>Why is especially ""generosity"" believed to help quantifying ""happiness""? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>(Of course it's easy to believe that someone who <strong>is</strong> generous and <strong>experiences</strong> generosity is happier than someone who is greedy and experiences greed. But the same holds for fairness, solidarity, etc.)</p>

"Are there scientifically grounded alternatives to analytical psychotherapy?","<p>I'm a physicist and am interested in exploring taking therapies to help me overcome anxieties and other issues that I have that seem to me to be psychologically founded. Anecdotally, a few people close to me have been in therapy over the years and have strongly advocated its efficacy. However, and equally, someone close to me tried therapy and found it useless. Moreover, as a scientist I am deeply sceptical of psychoanalysis as a theory and therefore quite adverse to contributing to its continuation. </p>

<p>So, are there alternative therapeutic techniques I could consider that have a more objective, scientific grounding? Or, am I simply wrong headed and modern psychoanalysis has evolved to the extent that it can be considered objective and scientific?</p>

<p>My question, is the act of studying more a defense mechanism? If it is, under which category we can classify it?</p>

<p>I thing closest is displacement, but as I understood if you are angry you redirect your anger with displacement. We can substitute other emotion for anger. If it is frustration, frustration needs to be redirected. But the person pushes herself more here so she is not redirecting her frustration(you can always clarify if I understood a concept wrong or send me a resource to clarify, I study by myself I just like learning).</p>

"Information Encapsulation of Geometric Module vs Cortex Remapping","<p>According to experiments by <a href=""https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/avc/cheng/geometric.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gallistel and Spelke</a>, there seems to be a specific geometric module in the brain that doesn't (cannot?) use feature information (eg. color of walls) for reorientation. From the little that I know, it seems that Elizabeth Spelke <a href=""https://youtu.be/5YDn7pkXzRI?t=832"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">even goes so far as to say</a> that the whole brain is modular, and language permits breaking of information encapsulation by ""dropping in"" information to other modules.</p>

<p>But <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_remapping"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cortical remapping</a> seems to indicate the opposite. At least certain areas of cortex seem to be ""general purpose"", in that they can be remapped to other areas (visual for auditory?) and still learn to perform the same function.</p>

<p>The explanation given is that birds could not recognize cats as predators and/or did not have natural predators in the environment. This made me think - is there any part of a bird that on a genetic level knows that some other organism is a predator and is to be avoided?</p>

<p>For animals that live surrounded by predators, for example a house sparrow - <strong>how does a bird learn that cats are predators, but squirrels are not?</strong> </p>

<p>OR</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe the anticonvulsant drug profiles are like this because much more money is invested in R&amp;D for psychoactive drugs used in psychology than is invested in R&amp;D for epilepsy drugs. And, during the R&amp;D process the anticonvulsant property of a drug is discovered as being the <em>side effect</em> of the drugs whose main property is psychoactivity. And this might be why the anticonvulsants being sold are psychoactive?</li>
</ul>

<p>Viagra was discovered during R&amp;D into high blood pressure. Viagra <strong>does</strong> lower high blood pressure. Viagra <strong>also</strong> has a side effect. People take Viagra for the side effect.</p>

During R&amp;D into psychoactive drugs, Zonisamide was discovered to have the side effect of elevativing the seizure threshold. Zonisamide <strong>is</strong> psychoactive. Zonisamide <strong>also</strong> elevates the seizure threshold as a side effect. People take Zonisamide for the side effect?</p>

Classical example would be that we tend to think that people from another state drive badly.

And from there, we would generalize that people from that region are bad drivers as we don’t check the license plate of good drivers.

"How is the effect of current vote scores on people's votes interpreted in psychology?","<p>On a site that people can vote on others' posts (like Stack Exchange sites), I believe people tend to be affected by the current vote score (and for Stack Exchange, if the user has enough reputation, the current vote counts as well) before they cast a vote, or even more, before they decide to whether cast a vote.

"What is an explaination for the light-headed and slow-motion feeling after a long hard mental exam?","<h3>Question</h3>

<p>After taking a long final exam, people often report feeling like the world is moving in slow motion. I've heard this exam effect jokingly called ""zombie feeling"" or ""brain-fog"". I describe the effect as strong desire to stare with a blank mind. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Based on answers from this question: <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/839/238"">https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/839/238</a> the amount of energy the brain uses doesn't really change when awake. So what could this effect be caused by?</p>

<p>Why can't reading work the same way? When I look at words I recognize them but they have no meaning until I <em>read</em> them in my mind.</p>

<p>Is there even anyone who got rid of subvocalization completely and can read a 300 page book just in one evening understanding pretty everything?</p>

<p>It even works the same the other way around. If I try to <em>see</em> a textural representation of some thing like let's say a table, I first have to <em>say</em> in my mind. Why is it so? It's really annoying.</p>

"Term for using hyperbole to make a softer argument seem more palatable?","<p>Say that I wanted to convince a person that oranges tasted nice. One particular method I could use would be to go on an hour long spiel, where I take on two voices - a hyperbolic voice (which says that we should ONLY eat oranges every single day because they are LITERALLY the best tasting thing ever) and a rational voice (which is more subtle, gives reasonable arguments as to why oranges taste nice like 'they have high sugar content', and is generally less explosive)</p>

<p>After hearing the hyperbolic ""WE SHOULD ONLY EAT ORANGES"" message, which the person will probably immediately reject, it seems likely that the person will accept the more rational message that 'oranges taste pretty nice' as a <em>compromise</em>. </p>

"What does the literature say about why women aren't attracted to nice guys?","<p>Dating coaches make the point that women may ""like,"" or ""appreciate"" a nice man, but they aren't likely to be attracted to, or fall madly in love with such behavior (until fairly late in the relationship, e.g. steady dating or engagement).</p>

<p>One such person, Leil Lowndes in ""Undercover Sex Signals,"" noted, ""A woman subconsciously listens to her genes."" That one quote opened up a whole new way of thinking to me.</p>

<p>For instance, a domineering, hard-as-nails man might not be pleasant to live with, but a woman might be attracted to him because he is signaling that he would be a good (protective and providing) father for her children. Likewise for the ""bad boy,"" who is unconventional, independent, and seemingly courageous, even though he may be ""independent"" to the point of being unfaithful. </p>

<p>Is it true that at some level, women and men who are dating ""rate"" each other based on the other's presumed parenting ability (e.g. that men prefer good looks as a sign of good ""motherhood"")? And that members of the opposite sex that aren't perceived as good parenting material are often <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_zone"" rel=""nofollow"">""friend-zoned""</a> despite their other virtues?</p>

<p>Of course, dating coaches have their points of view, but they are ""street smart."" More to the point, they sometimes cited scientific studies to prove their cases. So what to the ""scientists"" have to say about this matter?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This question is not about ""externals"" preached by pick-up artists like Pellicer, using such techniques as body language, eye contact, or good conversation skills. This is about the theory of a woman (Lowndes) who hypothesizes that we are only one step (in evolutionary terms) away from ""cavemen,"" and that therefore evidence of good cavemen traits (toughness and self sufficiency for men, physical appeal for women) still makes one attractive (at a visceral level) to members of the opposite sex. Even though other traits such as intelligence, humor, and empathy might be more relevant in the modern world, they might not do as good a job at sparking immediate attraction as the more primitive traits.</p>

<p>What I am doing now is given a correlation $r$ I generate the first and second values, $X_1$ and $X_2$, with $n$ samples from the standard normal distribution. Then from there I make $X_3$ a linear combination of the two $X_3 = r X_1 + \sqrt{1-r^2}\,X_2$</p>

"What information does the connectome actually contain?","<p>I am not a brain scientist but the following question seems reasonable to me. </p>

If I understand correctly, connectome is basically the graph whose vertices are neurons and whose edges are synapses (strictly speaking, there are many different kinds of neurons so the vertices of the graph should be colored, but let us forget it for now). </p>

<p>The title then appears to be a (probably intentional) oversimplification, since even though we do not understand how exactly memories are stored in the brain (and there are many different kinds of memories), things I will roughy call ""electrical and chemical variables"" play some role in it (so simply remembering whether there is a link or not between two neurons is not going to fly). I understand that studying these ""electrical and chemical variables"" is like over a half of the brain science but the exact definition is not particularly important for this question. If my understanding is correct, then one should not get overly excited about the present achievements of the Brain Preservation Foundation (the most promising one is, I think, preserving the connectome of a mammal for some time after its death using a chemical solution/freezing), since they have not shown that they can preserve any of the ""electrical and chemical variables"".</p>

"What are effective methods to overcome the initial psychological resistance towards an unpleasant task?","<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>

<p>Some self-help books note the difficulty of starting a boring or cognitively-difficult task (relative to maintaining the 'momentum' once the task has been started). Sometimes they describe an analogy to physical systems whereby a certain amount of 'activation energy' needs to be provided in order for a process to start.  </p>

<h2><strong>Examples</strong></h2>

<p>To generate this initial energy, some self-help authors have described simple techniques:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The moment you feel an instinct or a desire to act on a goal or a
  commitment, use the Rule. When you feel yourself hesitate before doing
  something that you know you should do, <strong>count 5-4-3-2-1-GO</strong> and move

However, it is not clear whether any of these methods would actually be effective.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The brain is a highly specialized organ with innumerable nuclei and pathways, and yet the brain of one individual is surprisingly similar to that of another.

<li><p>Now consider the case of a newborn and suppose his/her brain structure has been established somehow. As he/she grows, the brain starts taking sensory input and learns to process it better through neuroplasticity. If so, then why does everyone's, say amygdala only process fear, anxiety, etc. What prevents it from maintaining autonomous functions? Are the functions of different parts also determined by our genetics? (Is neuroplasticity the only force dictating learning?)</p></li>

"Any research on IQ (general) and coping with abstract concepts?","<p>Is there any good research on how general IQ correlates with levels of abstractions people can easily handle?</p>

<p>I understand, that abstractions are different, but here it's probably enough to cover base logical reasoning, set (in math sense) membership and such, maybe some other classification. Also, of course there are situations when language already contains metaphors, which allow people to reason (like ""file"" can be put into ""folder""). My question is more about situations, when there are no suitable ready metaphors (""X"" can contain ""Y""). (memory can also be a factor?)</p>

<p>The notion of complexity of abstract concept systems is also interesting (if there are several), but my hope is to find an answer for any good notion. Basically, ""common sense"" logic whatever it is is probably enough reference point.</p>

<p>The idea is simple. Lets say, people with IQ greater than X can understand and recognize part-whole relationship and use that understanding in their work. Then, of course, it is easy to calculate how accessible some system is: IQ has very simple statistical definition (given standard deviation).</p>

<p>I am not a psychologist so I do not quite know even what are the right terms to search. However, my interest is in making software applications accessible to more users and user interfaces oftentimes rely on users handling of abstract concepts. So my interest is pragmatic. Still I think this question is more on psychology side than UX.</p>

<p>I believe IQ matters because if a user can't figure out something in a ""moment"" (in seconds), system is not usable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you will not <strong>reveal</strong> yourself to others, you cannot reveal yourself
  to yourself. That  does not only mean that you suppress who you are,
  although it also means that. It means  that so much of what you could
  be will never be forced by necessity to come forward. This  is a
  biological truth, as well as a conceptual truth. When you explore
  boldly, when you  voluntarily confront the unknown, you gather
  information and build your renewed self  out of that information. That
  is the conceptual element. However, researchers have  recently
  discovered that new genes in the central nervous system turn
  themselves on when an organism is placed (or places itself) in a new situation. These genes code for new 
  proteins. These proteins are the building blocks for new structures in the brain. This 
  means that a lot of you is still nascent, in the most physical of senses, and will not be 
  called forth by stasis. You have to say something, go somewhere and do things to get 
  turned on.</p>

<p>For reference, the ""Your Baby Can Read"" series proposes that babies even can ""read"" even before they can talk by watching videos and looking at books which show words and then show a picture or short video that explains the word.  This is intended to make the connection between the word and what it represents, and ideally guide the child in a reaction to indicate they know what it means.

"Have the abilities of John Lorber's patients with limited cortical mass been further evaluated in adulthood?","<p>Short of minor lesions or infarcts, most high-functioning adults have an intact cerebral cortex.  Yet, a surprising result published anecdotally in Science in 1980 caused a lot of scientists to take note of Dr. John Lorber's hydrocephalus patients in England.</p>

<p>Most famously, Lorber reported:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There's a young student at this university...who has an IQ of 126, has gained a first-class honors degree in mathematics, and is socially completely normal.  And yet the boy has virtually no brain...instead of the normal 4.5 centimeter thickness of brain tissue between the ventricles and the cortical surface, there was just a thin layer of mantle measuring a millimeter or so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, arguing that the subject had ""virtually no brain"" is perhaps a bit of hyperbole, but the fact remains, he had accomplished an academic feat which many ""normal"" humans have not.  What's even more astonishing about this particular case is that this subject was purportedly not even aware of his condition until the initial brain scans were performed.</p>

<p>Aside from 1-2 other publications in peripheral journals around the same time period, I have never heard anything further about these patients that Dr. Lorber was following.</p>

<p>In the intervening 30+ years, have there been any follow-up scans/studies of these patients particularly those featuring the mathematics scholar mentioned above?</p>

<p>What mechanisms does the cortex use in these unusual circumstances to counter the effects of decreased cortical thickness?  Are the cortical columns shorter, and in what sense does their connectivity compensate for lower neuron counts/lower cell densities?</p>

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actigraph"" rel=""nofollow"">Actigraphy</a>), and have built a couple of smartphone apps using its principles. The apps look at gross motor activity of an individual. Up until now, most of my reading into the field has been focused on the study of sleep. With Actigraphy, there are clear ~90 minute activity patterns visible over the course of the night that roughly correlate with the 4 stages of sleep. There are algorithms by <a href=""http://support.theactigraph.com/faq/find-documentation-sadeh-cole-kripke-algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">Cole and Sadeh</a> which describe how to score sleep using activity counts.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Are there any uses of actigraphy for awake patients?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Are there any investigations of the correlation between the overall activity pattern/level and the brain wave frequency (alpha/beta/...)?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Are there any wake-related actigraphy algorithms?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong> thank you for answers and comments! Let me clarify the question. I'm interested in comparing a rather long history of events for the same individual wearing an actigraph.</p>

<p>For example we have a person who's both an athlete and also does meditation. I'm interested in using actigraphy to determine the length of the meditation sessions, along with any increase/decrease of overall activity pattern that may accompany meditation activity (ex: deeper concentration moves the brain to a different brainwave and relaxes the body, or nervousness and fidgeting rising, the person cannot get to the correct brainwave and cuts the session short).</p>

<p>Lets say the same person is a runner. Wearing an actigraph during sessions displays two important characteristics:
When the person is and is not running. (going out to run is an action that requires conscious action.
How long the person is running.  If a person is feeling ""negative"", the person may not go out to run). If a person does go out to run, the running session may be cut short if a person is not in the right state of mind.</p>

<p><strong>Combined with self-reported events (ex: running session started, meditation session started), such actigraphy data may be plotted day by day. I'm interested if there have been studies of such data.</strong> </p>

"Are intelligence scores correlated with detection of second stimulus in an Attentional Blink test?","<h2><strong>Definitions</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Attentional Blink:</strong> An attentional blink is a phenomenon where when presented with rapid visual stimuli if you are asked to track two particular stimuli you will fail to notice the second if it is preceded shortly after the first (Raymond, Shapiro, &amp; Arnell, 1992).</p>

<p><strong>Intelligence:</strong> A quantifiable score, or set of scores, aimed at measuring human cognitive capacities (such as the Raven's Progressive Matrices test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, etc.).</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>The results of Attentional Blink Tests have led some to see attention as a commodity that can be allocated, by will or nature, but needs time to be restored before additional attentional resources can be spent on subsequent activities (Raymond, Shapiro, &amp; Arnell, 1992).  It has been noted  that emotion plays a role in recognition of the second target – particularly, if there is an emotional investment or relevance in the second target it is more likely to be detected (Schwabe, 2010). This illustrates that emotion can mediate attention.  My question is whether intelligence could also mediate attention. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Does intelligence increase a person’s attentional abilities?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Does, or would, an intelligence score positively correlate with the detection of the second stimulus in an Attentional Blink Test?</strong></li>

"How can STDP fit with reciprocal connectivity?","<p>I have rather technical question regarding STDP dynamics. 
I am working on a neural network implementing an STDP learning algorithm, and have noticed that it is extremely anti-reciprocal. When two neurons have bidirectional connectivity between them, the conditions that will strengthen one direction will inevitably weaken the other, as far as I can understand. If B consistently fires immediately following a spike in A, the A->B synapse will strengthen, however the B->A synapse would weaken, as the pre-synapse / post-synapse roles are reverse. 
This wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for empirical evidence of high reciprocity in cortical connectivity.  </p>

"Can processing effort for sub-tasks in neural networks be measured?","<p>I often heard statements like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>80% of your brain processing is computing the effect of gravity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or, similarily:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You only use 20% of your brain power</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question isn't about the truth of these statements but if they are well-formed: can we measure 'processing' in the brain (or a sufficiently complicated artificial neural net) to quantify how much of the processing resources are allocated towards specific sub-routines?</p>

<p>As an example of when this is doable in another domain: consider a computer with a standard von Neumann architecture. In this case we can tell how much processing goes into sub-routine by simple counting the number of steps each subroutine holds the processor. However, this simple counting is only possible because of two features:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a clear central processor, and data is not transformed by anything except it.</li>
<li>There is a clear duality between software and hardware allowing us to identify when a specific sub-routine (software) is being allowed access to the processor (hardware).</li>
</ol>

<p>Both features are missing in a computer with a neural architecture. <strong>How can we measure the resources that a computer with neural architecture (example: the brain) devotes to subtasks?</strong></p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>I am interested in settings where there isn't an obvious localization of sub-tasks. So an answer like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>we can measure the amount of resources that go towards recognizing faces by looking at the metabolic uptake of the fusiform face area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is not that interesting to me, since it is only valid for sub-tasks that happen to have specially-devoted areas. Of course, if there is an argument that any reasonable (or more restricted: human-like) neural-architecture <em>has</em> to compartmentalize its computations then I would like to hear that. However, the answerer would be left with the task of explaining how to identify the group of neurons that should be associated with a specific sub-task.</p>

"Does each sensory neuron type have a characteristic spike sequence pattern?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>It is known that all sensory information is input to the brain as neural spike sequences. Now, to distinguish between the spike sequences generated by retinal red/blue/green cone cells from each other, and these from the cochlear (inner ear) hair cells, and so on, some sort of encoding scheme must be used. </p>

<p>To further clarify, in the case of retinal cone cells, the rate of incident light quanta in a given energy range, is the primary information that is coded. But, if all 3 types of cone cells generated identical responses for a given rate-of-incidence, like the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device#Color_cameras"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CCD pixels</a> in our digital cameras do, then there would be no way for upstream neurons to tell what type of cone cell a spike sequence came from. Instead, my guess is that, each type of cone cell encodes the rate-of-incidence in its own characteristic way, <em>similar to how different types of musical instruments sound differently, even when playing the same pitch at the same intensity, via <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">timbre</a></em>. </p>

<p><a href=""http://curtismacdonald.com/harmony-and-timbre/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">An oversimplified illustration of Timbre</a></p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p><strong>Is there evidence that each sensory neuron type has a characteristic spike sequence pattern?</strong></p>

<h1>Why message type must be encoded in the message itself</h1>

<p>During the <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10888368"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">development of the visual system</a>, the retina, the LGN and the visual cortex develop separately initially and sometime later, axons from the retinal ganglions grow into LGN, and optic radiations from the LGN grow and reach into the cortex. <em>As far as we can tell</em> it is not guaranteed that a specific ganglion will project its axon to a specific neuron in the LGN. All that is guaranteed by the growth process is that ganglions close together will project to LGN neurons that are also close together. </p>

<p>Given this development process, when a higher region say in the V1 receives a spike stream from a neuron somewhere lower, the question arises: how does it know that this spike stream means, red, blue or green? A simple idea that occurred to me from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">information theory</a> is that the message type could somehow be encoded in the message itself. </p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>

<p>Evidence for characteristic spike patterns for each sensory neuron type would take us one more step towards understanding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">qualia</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the hard problem of consciousness</a>. <strong><em>My speculation is that qualia are the neuronal analogs of timbre in musical instruments.</em></strong></p>

<p>Erwin Schrödinger thought we'd never get there. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia#Erwin_Schr.C3.B6dinger"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">He said</a>, <em>""The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective picture of light [as] waves [or as quanta]. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so.""</em> </p>

<p>I guess he's right in the sense that we will never be able to fully wrap our minds around the mysterious and ineffable nature of qualia. </p>

<p>However, evidence of characteristic spike patterns would offer resolutions to qualia related thought experiments, such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary%27s_room"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Is there something about Mary?</a>, that philosophers seem to be <a href=""http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/RoboMaryfinal.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pulling their hair out over</a>. </p>

It seems that in order to effectively solve the problem, you need an appropriately formulated <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement"" rel=""nofollow"">problem statement</a>, yet I can't find anything about the methodologies or processes to do so stated formally.</p>

"Advantage of active learning on classification tasks","<p>I am looking for a specific type of experimental test of active learning.

There is some underlying function $f: X \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ to be learned, this function can come from some restricted function class $C$. The subject knows the description of the function class, but has to learn the specific parameters that define the function.
I am looking for experiments that had two conditions of this type:</p>

<ol>
<li>The subject is given labeled samples $(x,f(x))$ from some distribution on $X$ that they have no control over.</li>
<li>The subject is allowed to ask for specific $x \in X$ and receive the labeled sample $(x,f(x))$.</li>

<p><strong>Can you provide references to specific experiments that would fit in this paradigm? What were their results? On what sort of tasks does active learning provide an advantage? How significant is this advantage?</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>An example would be a subject sitting in front of a blank screen. They are told ""there is a straight line that divides this screen into a red and green region. Can you find it?"". Thus, the set $X$ would correspond to coordinates, and an input $x$ would be a specific coordinate, say $x = (1,3)$. The function class would be the set of straight line partitions of the screen. A specific function with $0$ meaning red and $1$ - green might be: </p>

<p>$$f((a,b)) = \begin{cases}0 &amp; \mathrm{if} \; a &gt; b \\ 1 &amp; \mathrm{otherwise}\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>In the active task, the participant can click on any point $x$ on the screen to turn it from blank to either red (if $f(x) = 0$) or green (if $f(x) = 1$). In the passive trial, some number of points are selected and revealed at random to the subject.</p>

"How does human brain pick out the most likely representation of object when an object is ambiguous?","<p>For example, it is dim light and an object is in partial shade, hiding some features of an object. It is a rounded, dark brownish object. The object is rather ambiguous - it could be a rock, a potato, a turtle, a grenade, a ball, etc.</p>

<p>When looking at an ambiguous object like that described above, <strong>do different neural networks get activated with different intensity?</strong> Does the brain pick the highest probability and the person label the object with that name? For example, does the brain get input like:</p>

<ul>
<li>63% of potato detecting neurons get activated, saying it looks like a potato</li>
<li>50% ball</li>
<li>34% turtle</li>
<li><p>28% grenade</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BVIZ9.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is that I found<a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/5740/are-there-recent-theories-on-physiognomy"">this answer to question about facial features and personality</a>. Within an answer, there's a link to this paper: <a href=""http://www.alittlelab.stir.ac.uk/pubs/Penton-Voak_06_kernaloftruth_SocCog.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Personality judgments from natural and composite facial images</a>.</p>

<p>The paper suggests that ordinary, untrained people <strong>are capable of naturally recognizing and rating a face on a big 5 personality traits</strong>. The author proceeds to show that composite faces that are rated high on the ""socially - desirable"" traits, like extraversion, openness and agreeableness are rated as more attractive by the study's test subjects:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TY84l.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Here are the attractiveness ratings summary from the male faces above:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9dui6.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>When using my app, the user's brain is tricked into recognizing the composite image as one's own, because it is made of a live camera image + static image, and the image can blink, smile, frown, etc. The brain merges the two images, potentially distorting the true geometry of one's face by perceiving a composite image.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from that article on the self fulfilling prophesy effect (page 635):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, people with facial features that elicit attributions of
  agreeableness may be treated as more trustworthy and may perhaps
  consequently develop more agreeable personality characteristics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm interested if perceiving such composite can activate the same mechanisms used to judge other faces, thus creating the same self-fulfilling prophesy <strong>and having an impact on one's personality?</strong></p>

<p>Probably a part of the answer to the question is in answering the question: <strong>""does one's own image in the mirror affect one's personality?""</strong></p>

"How long does the trace of a memory last in the brain?","<p>With long-term plasticity one refers to the phenomen by which synapses are modified by neural activity and these modifications last for long times, a day perhaps of the order of days. This phenomenon is often described in contrast to short-term plasticity, where the response of a synapse has a non-linear component that depend on the history of the presynaptic activity in a short time in the past of the order of hundreds of ms.</p>

<p>Plasticity is in fact a much more complicated subject and involves processes at different levels, at the synapse, neuron, network and whole brain (e.g., homeostasis) level. Given our current knowledge of memory systems in the brain, how long are we able to trace even small bits of the memory of a stimulus we were exposed in the past?</p>

<p>Obviously one can answer the question at the cognitive level, i.e., we can rephrase the question and ask instead: What's the oldest memory I can recall? It is well known that our behavior as adults is a reflection of even the oldest memories of our lives. However, I would argue that this is an inderect effect, namely those events that happened in our childhood had an influence on how and what we experience say in the adolescence, and then what we experience as adults is a reflection of what we experienced in adolescence. One known phenomenon that seems to ""elongate"" memories in the future is the one of replay, i.e., the fact that our brain spontaneously recalls memories of the past like in dreaming.</p>

<p>In computational neuroscience, we can trace bits of patterns stored in a neural network with plastic synapses by probing the network, e.g., by presenting a noisy version of a training pattern and testing if the network is able to recall that pattern, something like an associative memory paradigm. A statistical tool used to test the scaling properties of synapse models is the signal-to-noise ratio analysis. Using this analysis, one is able to address the question of a memory lifetime by assessing whether the synapses maintained some information of a pattern in the past (the signal) with statistical arguments (i.e., with respect to the ""noise"" of all the other memories interfering with the old one).</p>

<p>Is anybody aware of any experiment where people tried to trace single bits of memories at a single synapse level? In models, the weight of single synapses is maintained for ever unless other memories interfere with that. In reality, it would be interesting to see whether single biological synapses can maintain information on long time-scales (days? months? years?), even considering protein turn-over, or if its the network dynamics that plays a crucial role in maintaining those memories or refreshing them.</p>

<p>Note that answers that go beyond the synapse level are also welcome, that's why the main title doesn't specify to much details.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting theories of the etiology of ADHD that I've read posits that the disorder may be one of neuroenergetics - the result of insufficient and variable neuronal energy production due to insufficient ""formation and supply of lactate"" in astrocytes. As the theory goes, this impairs immediate response to cognitive demands due to a lack of sufficient ATP for ""rapidly firing neurons,"" and also affects development of the brain by impairing myelination on longer time scales. Abstract here: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16925830/"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16925830/</a></p>

<p>I'm quite interested in how ketosis can be therapeutic for neurological/cognitive issues in general, and how it might ameliorate ADHD symptoms in particular - there appears to be some experimental evidence (at least in rat models) that it might do the latter. There also appears to be experimental evidence that ketosis increases levels of lactate in the brain: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11043913/"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11043913/</a></p>

"Is it conceivable that even basic human behavior is genetically determinined only to a very limited extent?","<p>I'm wondering whether even basic human behavior (beyond what appears to be directly wired into our nervous systems, like swallowing and face-related mirror neurons) are indeed facilitated by genetically determined features of the body (and by features of the environment), but only acquired through either operand conditioning (i.e. through exploration) or observational learning (i.e. through culture).  Cats, for example, have an innate urge to catch things, but they only really learn to hunt from <a href=""http://labs.libhub.org/denverpl/portal/Understanding%20cats%20:%20their%20history,%20natu/CFEaoc87/"" rel=""nofollow"">copying other cats</a>. To some extent, the art of hunting can be thus seen as cat culture (it might just be very easily re-discoverable).  In this interpretation, the genetic predispositions for a fit phenotype are partly outsourced from a genetic to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics"" rel=""nofollow"">memetic</a> encoding, and even basic behaviors require a fairly universal learning apparatus to be acquired. Given that a basic behavior such as hunting is not fully genetically encoded in cats, can we assume that no behavior roughly more complex than <em>chasing things</em> is directly genetically encoded in humans, and that more complex behaviors are at most genetically facilitated in the body to be acquired by exploration and observation? Could, for example, the mother instinct be broken down to heuristic rewards a mother receives from seeing a small human, from empathic rewards from caring, from a heuristic attachment of the baby to a food source and warmth, and the rest is a matter of operand conditioning, exploration and culture?</p>

<p>Are there any explanatory approaches along these lines in the literature?</p>

"What is the relationship between the ego, amygdala and consciousness?","<p>I've been reading a lot about emotional responses lately, and the following points seem to surface in different writings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala"" rel=""nofollow"">Amygdala</a> is a very ancient system, intended to quickly alert a
  person of danger"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the same time, we have a part of our consciousness, where thoughts of danger, lack or negativity towards others may arise. I've seen spiritual/personal development writers attribute these thoughts to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego"" rel=""nofollow"">function of the ego</a>. I'm not sure if they are using the term correctly, as they have a mostly negative perception of the ego, as something that strives to dominate cognition and act out of fearful/selfish desires.  Here's a description from wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ego is the organized part of the personality structure that
  includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive
  functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm trying to understand - <strong>Is person's ego a projection of the responses of their amygdala onto the conscious experience?</strong></p>

"Which format of secret would be the most efficient for human memory?","<p>In information security a shared secret is often used to authenticate users. (so-called sth-you-know authentication factor; examples include passwords, passphrases, numeric pin-s, graphical passwords (<a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/12/16/signing-in-with-a-picture-password.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/12/16/signing-in-with-a-picture-password.aspx</a> , <a href=""http://passtouch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://passtouch.com/</a>).</p>

<p>A common form of secret, 8-character password over all 95 ASCII chars, would contain ~53 bits of entropy ($95^8$ possibilities).<br>
A password in top 1000 most common passwords would contain only ~10 bits of entropy (1000 possibilities) but would be easier to remember.<br>
A 4-word passphrase over 10'000 most common words would also contain ~53 bits of entropy ($10'000^4$ possibilities), but would maybe(?) be easier to remember that 8 random characters.</p>

"Are there any practical implications for the purported neuroprotective effects of lamotrigine?","<p>Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug used to treat seizures. Off-label, it is used to treat a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Judging from Google Scholar, lamotrigine continues to be the subject of active research: both on the neuroscience end to elucidate its mechanism of action, and on the clinical end to investigate its efficacy in treating disorders beyond its approved usage for seizures. </p>

<p>There are interesting statements in the literature regarding the neuroprotective effects of lamotrigine, for example: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... several studies have investigated
  LTG’s neuroprotective effects in models related to the toxic
  effects of glutamatergic agents. <a href=""https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2003&amp;issue=10000&amp;article=00011&amp;type=abstract"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like the other mood stabilizers lithium and valproate, 
  LTG also has neuroprotective properties but its exact mechanisms remain poorly defined. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1017/S1461145712000429"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are additional, supporting studies cited within the previous two references. I believe this bibliography, though of course not exhaustive, is at least representative.</p>

<p>My question is this: What on earth is the <em>relevance</em> of these statements for real-life scenarios involving humans? Neurodegeneration is a relatively common occurrence in human populations, resulting from such diverse sources as toxins, physical injuries to the head, and aging. Based on what is known so far about the involved neurological mechanisms, could lamotrigine potentially protect against neurodegeneration in any of these cases?</p>

<p>One particular case that came to mind is neurodegeneration due to binge drinking. I have heard that neuronal cell loss in this case has been hypothesized to arise from glutamatergic mechanisms, which could be relevant for lamotrigine since lamotrigine is thought to suppress release of glutamate. On the other hand, this article calls into question the glutamatergic explanation for alcohol-induced brain damage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the mechanism [for binge-drinking induced brain damage]
  is not directly related to glutamate neurotoxicity. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ALC.0000113416.65546.01"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another case that occurred to me is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesic_shellfish_poisoning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">amnesic shellfish poisoning</a>, an illness caused by the neurotoxin domoic acid, which has a strong affinity for glutamate receptors.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert in neuroscience and/or pharmacology, so I have limited ability to take 1) the theoretical understanding of lamotrigine's mechanism of action, and 2) the theoretical understanding of various neurodegenerative disorders; and make some hypothesis about a possible neuroprotective effect, if any.</p>

<p>Is it likely that lamotrigine could have neuroprotective effect against the two illnesses mentioned above? Or are there other examples? </p>

"How does this experiment prove a causal relation between coherence and good feelings?","<p>I'm reading <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> by Daniel Kahneman and I came across the following text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Remote Association Test has more to tell us about the link between cognitive ease and positive effect. Briefly consider the two triads of words:</p>
  
  <p>$$\text{sleep mail switch}\\\text{ salt deep foam}$$ You could not know it of course, but measurements of electrical activity in the muscles of your face would probably have shown a slight smile when you read the second trial, which is coherent (<em>sea</em> is the solution). This smiling reaction to coherence appears in subjects who are told nothing about common associates; they are merely shown a vertically arranged triad of words and instructed to press the space bar after they have read it. The impression of cognitive ease that comes with the presentation of a coherent triad appears to be mildly pleasurable in itself. The evidence that we have about good feelings, cognitive ease, and the intuition of coherence is, as scientists say, correlational but not necessarily causal. Cognitive ease and smiling occur together, but do the good feelings actually lead to intuitions of coherence? Yes, they do. The proof comes from a clever experimental approach that has become increasingly popular. Some participants were given a cover story that provided an alternative interpretation for their good feeling: they were told about music played in their earphones that ""previous research showed that this music influences the emotional reaction of its individuals"". This story completely eliminates the intuition of coherence. The finding shows that the brief emotional response that follows the presentation of a triad of words (pleasant if the triad is coherent, unpleasant otherwise) is actually the basis of judgments of coherence. There is nothing here that system 1 cannot do. Emotional changes are now expected, and because they are unsurprising they are not linked causally to the words.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Kahneman refers to the automatic and intuitive way of thinking as system 1)</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong> Why does the adding of the cover story in this experiment show that good feelings lead to intuitions of coherence (that there is a causal relation)? I find this conclusion rather strange. I'm probably mistaken but it seems to me that Kahneman is saying: the fact that there was no intuition of coherence when these participants were expecting to respond emotionally to music, shows that there is a causal relation between the good feelings and the intuition of coherence. Why would this make sense?</p>

"How to implement an incidental processing task without a fMRI-compatible response box?","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I'm planning an event-related fMRI-experiment to investigate the difference in processing natural and computer-generated facial emotion expressions. My supervisor and I are discussing different task instructions for the scanning session (see below).</p>

<p>Two often applied task instructions involve:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Passive processing of facial emotion expressions</strong> Subjects are instructed to passively attend to the stimuli shown, no motor response or judgement required</li>
<li><strong>incidental processing of facial emotion expressions</strong> For instance, subjects are required to press a button in case an inverted face appears (in 10% of all cases for example)</li>
</ul>

<p>As we do not have a MRI-compatible response box available, <strong>I prefer the passive processing task instruction</strong>, even though possible attention interferences may emerge as we cannot ""control"" cognitive processes of the subjects while scanning. <strong>My supervisor prefers the incidental processing</strong> because of these possible attention interferences and suggests subjects may answer with a hand signal. For me it will be impossible to track those hand signals because of the room setup and I am bothered about reviewers criticizing that we implemented a task that we were unable to control and report. Furthermore, I'm worried that the hand movements may interfere with the image quality as subjects are moving. My supervisor rejects all those arguments as sustaining attention of the subjects is the strongest argument for him and he thinks reviewers will criticize that if we implement a passive task.</p>

<p><strong>How to implement an incidental task with low cognitive demands without a response box?</strong></p>

<p>We discarded a recognition task after the scan (e.g. have you seen this picture before?) or a counting task during the scanning session (e.g. how many female faces?), as the cognitive load may be too high during the scanning session.</p>

"Study claims that human brain does not produce new brain cells?","<p>Neurogenesis is one of the most fascinating subjects to discuss. However, <strong>it seems like scientific community has difference of opinion about whether neurogenesis is possible or not in adult humans</strong>. The aim of my question is to gain insights about whether neurogenesis in adult humans is possible or not.</p>

<p>According to an article presented in <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-birth-of-a-brain-cell-witnessing-neurogenesis/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scientific American ""The Birth of a Brain Cell: Scientists Witness Neurogenesis""</a>, Mirjana Maletic-Savatic, an assistant professor of neurology at Stony Brook University in New York State, <em>claims that neurogenesis is possible</em>. Her study is based on brain imaging and suggests that scientists ""witnessed"" neurogenesis and the birth of new brain cells in adult human brain.</p>

<p>However, on the other hand, there is a Californian study, reported on <a href=""https://www.sciencenews.org/article/study-casts-doubt-whether-adult-brain-hippocampus-makes-new-cells"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in ScienceNews ""Study casts doubt on whether adult brain’s memory-forming region makes new cells""</a>, that <em>claims that neurogenesis in adult humans does not exist</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Analyzing the study contradiction</em></strong></p>

<p>These two studies contradict each other. One may try to reconcile these two studies by claiming that humans only produces new cells in only certain parts of the brain but not in other parts of the brain, including hippocampus. Hippocampus may not be able to produce more brain cells, but other parts of the brain may generate new brain cells. However, this explanation and the above mentioned study <em>directly</em> contradicts another study that was published by <a href=""http://dev.biologists.org/content/140/12/2548"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Berg D.A. et al., 2013</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>active adult neurogenesis is confined to two distinct locations: the
  subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles in the forebrain;
  and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the
  <strong><em>hippocampus</em></strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can see that the <em>Californian study contradicts the other study clearly when it comes to studying and analyzing neurogenesis in the hippocampus</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The question</em></strong></p>

<p>This theory and the <em>Californian study</em> does not explain why people who suffer from memory loss in some parts of their lives regain memory and perform much better on memory tests.</p>

<p><strong>If the hippocampus does not make new brain cells, then how do people regain memory by eating the right diet and exercising? Is neurogenesis possible in the hippocampus region of the brain?</strong></p>

"Validity of the ""Common Factors"" perspective","<p>Research and practice in psychotherapy has been deeply influenced by two different approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>the <strong>Empirically Supported Treatments (ESTs)</strong> movement, due to the development of Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) attitude in the mental health field, and</li>
<li>the <strong>Common Factors perspective</strong>, and the importance of common factors in the explanation of the therapeutic process.</li>
</ol>

<p>These two different approaches are well described by Terence Tracey et al. (2003):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One view is that each model of therapy has distinctive effects on clients. This assumption of distinctiveness leads naturally to the inference that some models are more effective than others with particular client types</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>A  competing and perhaps complementary view is that different theoretical approaches are comparably effective” (p. 401).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>ESTs can be tested with randomised controlled clinical trials (Herbert,  2003; Morrison,  Bradley, &amp; Westen, 2003);, however there is a growth of studies about the “Common Factors” perspective confirming the notion that all therapies are equally effective — the so-called “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodo_bird_verdict"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dodo Bird Verdict</a>” (Luborsky et al., 2004; Luborsky &amp; Singer, 1975).</p>

Yet, <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/a/17325"">there are shortfalls with CBT</a> and some say that the efficacy was artificially inflated.</p>

<p>While I can understand the standpoint of those who push for scientific scruitiny of psychotherapeutic approaches, <a href=""https://psychology.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2248"">as can be seen in Psychology.SE meta</a> I am also a defender of approaches which have been denounced as purely pseudoscientific and therefore invalid.</p>

Actually, The assignment is not out of my ability, sometime I could do my assignments in few hours for several days, but without any reason I lost that spirit again. What is wrong? how can I deal with it? and why it happens on me while some other people could just control their self easily? is there any scientific explanation for this?</p>

<p>It perhaps the most stupid wrong placed question you have ever found, but I need your help, indeed. If you ever experience the similar thing, please share.. Thank you</p>

"What is the difference between affect and feeling?","<p>What exactly is the difference between affect and feeling?</p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affect_%28psychology%29"">Affect</a> seems to refer to conscious experience:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Affect</strong> is the experience of feeling or emotion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And confusingly, so does <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling"">feeling</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In psychology, the word is usually reserved for the
  conscious subjective experience of emotion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize that the definitions of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion"">emotion</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_%28psychology%29"">mood</a> are dicey as there are several different approaches (with corresponding definitions) in common use today.  But is it the same for affect and feeling?  Are there accepted definitions, or even accepted parts of definitions?  Or do definitions depend on the emotion model?</p>

"Can compulsions be defined in a way that is independent of obsessions, culture, etc?","<p>DSM-V defines compulsions (as part of OCD) and then adds a bunch of qualifications.  I wonder if we can define compulsions in a more objective way.  Compulsions are repetitive behavior/thoughts intended to reduce distress and/or prevent a potentially serious situation.  In this way they are different from other repetitive behavior, for instance, in autistic disorders.  </p>

<p>But this definition alone does not seem to be enough to distinguish compulsions from socially sanctioned and justified rituals and activities, be it praying for hours, working 16 hours a day, or whatever.  In addition, when we talk about compulsive gambling, shopping, gaming, TV watching, studying, eating, whatever, about people feeling ""compelled"" to do things in a certain rather rigid and repetitive way, how are we defining compulsions?  Is it about reduced wilfulness (as in addictive behavior)?  Is it about how irrational the behavior is (though it's hard to decide logically how we should live our life, as even philosophers can differ on this point)?  And so on.  </p>

"Judgments of similarity between samples of writing","<p>I was thinking last night about the possibility of an experiment that investigates the factors contributing to peoples' judgments of 'stylistic similarity' between two samples of writing.

Each participant would be asked to make a judgment of either ""Which 2 of these writings are most similar in style?"" OR 'Which 2 of these writings were most likely created by the same person?"".</p>

"Controlling for response bias in a forced choice memory task","<p>I want to present participants a pair of items $a$ and $b$, each with an association $x$ or $y$.

<p>Much of the impetus behind the movement is a commitment to treating new members better, and it's safe to assume that a majority of these new members are here for help in the process of learning something (e.g., programming, statistics, new software).  Comments can both set the tone while also being a means through which to deliver learning.</p>

<p>The actual Stack Exchange study is measuring the response of a third party to the comments made on the site, but, as more readily available system, I'd like to find out if a teacher who projects a ""friendly"" attitude positively affects the learning process.  Conversely, it's not ideal if a teacher uses ""unorthodox"" methods to motivate students (e.g., sarcasm), but controlling for all other factors, could these methods actually motivate some students to learn better?</p>

<p>While the analogy between educators, students, and Stack Exchange participants is far from perfect, is there support in the educational psychology literature for the notion that teachers reported by students as ""friendlier"" (on average) help those students achieve higher levels of performance on standardized tests and other evaluations?</p>

"Are there any personality theories that use the scientific method?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have come across a number of personality theories. There are even <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_psychology"" rel=""noreferrer"">disciplines</a> of personality theories, dividing these theories according to the assumptions they are based upon. The most accepted/used theories seem to be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits"" rel=""noreferrer"">Big 5</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator"" rel=""noreferrer"">Myers–Briggs Type Indicator</a> (MBTI). However, I assume these theories use traits to determine people's personality types too.</p>

<p>For example, the Big 5 traits seem to be of very limited scope. Also, measuring traits like introversion and extroversion using some random questions which have polar opposite choices seems to be a <em>fitting into a box</em> sort of thing. There seems to be no scientific method while testing to determine whether people fall into one region or other for all the defined traits. </p>

<p>By scientific determination, I mean one could use methods like the one laid out in ""<a href=""http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?Volume=156&amp;page=252&amp;journalID=13"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cerebral Blood Flow and personality: A Positron Emission Tomography Study</a>"" to determine between, say, introversion and extroversion traits.

"Do the Jungian Cognitive Functions/ Processes really exist?","<p><strong>Background</strong> </p>

<p>Many of us must have come across personality theories like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator"" rel=""noreferrer"">MBTI</a> which use part of Carl Jung's concepts to make a theoretical system used to divide people into <em>types</em>. For example, MBTI says that <em>if</em> the person is not neurotic or something like that, <em>then</em> he/she must fall into one among the 16 personality types that have been defined. Over simplification of the MBTI over the Internet has made the base of this theory unknown to many people, but talking about that in this question helps nobody.</p>

<p>MBTI as taken by psychologists, seems to be centered more around the concept of Functions more than the four letter model. Typing a person is done generally after recognizing their <em>Dominant</em> function. Some psychologists seem to have made their own different models about these <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_cognitive_functions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cognitive Functions</a> (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Beebe"" rel=""noreferrer"">John Beebe</a> and <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Personality_Type.html?id=sLvbTw5adxIC&amp;redir_esc=y"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lenore Thomson</a> for example). Some claiming 8 exist in the human Psyche, and some claiming 4 exist, some saying they gradually develop, some opposing the views and so on...</p>

<p>Recently, I have come across a <a href=""http://youtu.be/MGfhQTbcqmA"" rel=""noreferrer"">Youtube video</a> in which a researcher claims to have made this theory scientifically observable and researchable - and seeing that this video has been made at Google Talks makes it believable. </p>

<p>I think Jung's concepts - which are based on observation, introspection, Energy flow etc. seem to be somewhat like Pseudoscience to any scientific mind. However, after watching this video I started to wonder whether what he says is really true or not?</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Questions</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Short version: Is the evidence quoted in the above source (the forum link) a valid evidence to support a concept like Cognitive Functions as described by Jung?</p></li>
<li><p>Long version: There are two main things in the above source (the forum link) that I want someone to confirm as a proper evidence. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, as quoted by the source above, Nardi speaks about various regions in Neo Cortex region where he placed these EEG sensors. From what I have read, it seems that he mapped the regions to some activities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPoZ2.jpg"" alt=""Regions where EEG sensors have been placed""></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here's what he says about these regions is like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fp1 ""Chief Judge""  (is used when/to)</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Provide a reason</p></li>
  <li><p>Decide between options</p></li>
  <li><p>Detect an error</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing all of them here would make this question look like a book, but I want to know whether all this is as rigid as it looks or not. I want to know where Nardi is making a mistake in this research. (There could be some activities which might have been mapped wrongly, or those which have deeper mechanisms in brain rather than just in Neocortex region.) </p>

<p>Secondly, I will not be long here, but there is a similar part where he speaks about various patterns (in regions of brain ""lighting up"") he observed during this observation. Although asking for an evidence to this would be basically an extension to the first question, but my question here would be whether such patterns (not necessarily the same ones) have ever been classified/suggested in literature already? </p>

<p>Lastly, (this might be rhetoric question) if the answer to the above question is affirmative, Does this imply that theories like MBTI are really valid, and that there are really types among people's brains? (Nardi tried to map those patterns into types of people, as I said their dominant function)</p>

"Is the theory of Information Metabolism a reasonable scientific theory?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have been checking out various personality typing assessments lately when I came across a Personality typing system known as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socionics"">Socionics</a> which aims at explaining relationships between people of different types. It's based on some of Freud's ideas, Carl Jung's Psychological Types and Anthony Kepinski's theory of <a href=""http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Information_Metabolism"">Information Metabolism</a>. </p>

<p>Socionics uses a mixture of all the above to create its own sound theory about human psyche for each <em>type</em> of person. Socionics is considerably different from MBTI and other typing systems in its approach largely due to ideas from Information Metabolism.</p>

<p>While digging out more about Information Metabolism theory, I have found out that it implies things like information that is exchanged between people are like inputs and outputs from our brain. Socionics theory seems to extend this concept saying <em>""Psychological features such as attention, interests, memory and motivation are components of this theory of information metabolism""</em>, because people differ in the way they process information. </p>

<p>Whether our brain really has parts corresponding to information elements like that is a different question, but I first doubt the scientific reason behind the theory of Information Metabolism. It seems to be based on Freud's ideas (which seem like mere observations), but yet on the other hand speaks about parts of brain.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is this theory of Information Metabolism based on Scientific grounds?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any theories/research like Information Metabolism that has been developed or in development and is/are scientific? Does <a href=""http://www.shelleycarson.com/your-creative-brain/the-creates-brainset-model"">CREATES brainset</a> model qualify to be one such in development?</p></li>
<li><p>This may seem like a tangential question, but I will ask it because it's somewhat related: Do these Information Elements, provided they really exist, influence our facial expressions and body language while we interact with others?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last question is to check out the validity of infamous <a href=""http://wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Visual_identification"">Visual Identification</a> used in Socionics communities for typing people by <em>looking at them</em>.</p>

"Do the motivations and fears behind Enneagram have any scientific reasoning?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality"">Enneagram</a> personality typing system defines set of motivations and basic fears for its nine personality types among people.</p>

<p>The system seems to be aimed at personal development of a person, and uses various approaches for the same (like one type integrating into other - which is essentially the person overcoming their basic fears using their motivations in a different manner etc.). For more info regarding the system, look <a href=""http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/intro.asp"">here</a>.</p>

<p>A large part of this system seems spiritual and based on very strange assumptions, but equally strangely - I don't know why or how - many people identify themselves with these basic motivations and fears in a way that doesn't seem like Forer effect - at least to me. The system is flexible enough that a person can identify his/her motivations towards one type and to some extent towards another type.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are the motivations and fears for people listed in Enneagram typing system discussed in any other scientific theory about motivations among people?</p></li>
<li><p>There doesn't seem to be much of Forer effect taking place because people seem to identify themselves and <em>""grow into other types""</em>. If we assume people are basically overcoming their fears doing so, what is the scientific term/explanation for such a process? </p></li>
<li><p>Provided we have a flexible system here, people may <em>develop</em> in a more complex manner than by just overcoming their basic fears while integrating/dis-integrating into other type. What are people doing to themselves doing so?</p></li>

"What makes people easily subscribe to pseudoscientific theories?","<p>There are <strong>many</strong> theories/disciplines that have been categorized as pseudoscience in the scientific community.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience"">list</a> includes many things that are regularly even quoted in media like graphology, astrology, psychoanalysis, personality types, etc. </p>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>What attracts people to such theories? Do any cognitive biases make people believe them easily? Which part of pseudosciences acts as a stimulus that triggers this cognitive bias?</p></li>
<li><p>If there's a cognitive bias behind people believing in pseudoscience, knowing that a majority of the population does that – is there any term for such a phenomenon in social psychology?</p></li>
<li><p>A majority of the population believes in some kind of pseudoscience. Does this signify an evolutionary aspect of our minds – that people are still evolving into better species that might one day believe in proper science? Pseudoscience seems to be older than science; correct me if I am wrong here.</p></li>

"System 1 and unconsious","<p>Kahneman (2011) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apparently suggests</a> there is system 1 and system 2 in decision making.</p>

<ol>
<li>If I am not wrong he says system 1 is <strong>more prone to error</strong>s because it is automatic. <strong>Is this correct assumption of mine?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If yes, next question I have is: Is system1 related to unconcious? If yes, then isn't there a conflict between above assumption and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_thought_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> one:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>that unconscious thought (UT) is better at solving complex tasks,
  where many variables are considered, than conscious thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if UT is related to System 1, then doesn't it contradict Kahnemans view that System 1 is more prone to errors (because if it is prone to errors according to Kahneman how is it better at decision making according to Wiki)? Needless to say there are articles which don't agree with wiki article I linked. This one for example: Acker (2008). </p>

"What thoughts should one contemplate to minimize sleep latency?","<p>While trying to fall asleep on night, I was wondering what my strategy would be if I was challenged to a competition where the goal was to fall asleep as fast as possible once I was lying in bed. The only degree of freedom would be thoughts. I.e., we assume I can't take a sleeping pill or exploit any other external factors (which are assumed to be averaged out).  </p>

<p>What thinking strategies would likely yield the best results in terms of sleep latency? We're considering an average person here (i.e., not a person with special circumstances like insomnia or a biological predisposition/talent for falling asleep immediately). </p>

<p>That rumination will lead to the complete opposite effect has been documented in several studies (<a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902001204"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's one among many</a>) and is also intuitive. It has also been shown that <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.324.4175&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gratitude reduces sleep latency</a>. For me personally, imagining myself in cozy environments (e.g., a treehouse covered in moss) has been more effective than any other strategy (including mindfulness, trying to think about nothing, counting and others). The worst thought strategy for me was observing the process of falling asleep and I've never been able to fall asleep while in this mode of thinking (while I have been able to with heavy rumination in some cases).  </p>

<p>Besides gratitude, have there been other thinking modes that have proven effective or are likely to be effective to minimize sleep latency? Perhaps there are other common themes in the positive psychology literature that pose likely candidates. </p>

"Question about interrole conflict","<p>Katz &amp; Kahn defined the interrole conflict as a conflict between two roles that are incompatibles, or when more than one person has the same role.</p>

<p>I had a question today in an exam about role conflicts induced stress in the workplace and wondered if someone could shed some light about this.</p>

<p>Its a true/false question that goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>A policeman is in a situation where he must rescue someone while risking his own security.
This is an interrole conflict. (T/F)
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote false, because the question does not imply the policeman necessarily has other roles in conflict with this one. For example what if he doesn't have any family, any friends, etc.? But I ain't sure! Is simply being alive an implicit role? Is being healthy and in a state of security a role?</p>

<p>Isn't it more an intra role conflict then? In the sense his job probably doesn't ask for him having to put his own security at risk? I found this one quite difficult to answer.</p>

<p>I would like some opinions on this! I want to understand this correctly.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for any help!</p>

"At what age a child would develop a sense of racism or a minority discrimination?","<p>I wonder if what happened with my son(6yo) is a matter of concern or just a coincidence.</p>

"How important is it to have a job that is aligned with one’s passion?","<p>Ever since I left high school I kept reading and being told that it was of great importance to look for a job that alignes with one’s passion. Brochures distributed by both high schools and universities were stressing the need to choose the right subject; and judging from newspaper articles even a new profession had appeared, namely the “carrier advisor”, who was supposed to help high school graduates find the job or course that was aligned with their talents and passions. While I can’t remember this explicitely stated, I have feeling that it was implicetly assumed that one’s passion was not subject to their conscious choice, rather it had been predetermined (by genes? environmental influences in early childhood? I don’t know), and so it was important that one correctly discovers what really interests them and what they are really talented at.</p>

<p>In the field of IT I kept hearing similar stuff. Namely, I witnessed quite a few times when an experienced programmer was straightly recommending someone to not continue pursuing qualifications in this field. The arguments were usually along the lines of this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have to make yourself programming or learning to program, if you don’t program because you deeply love this work and wouldn't go for a higher paid job even if you had an opportunity - do yourself a favor and find a different job. If you like programming in your spare time, do yourself a favor and keep it as a hobby. Going to this profession because it is well-paid is a major misunderstanding. You will soon hate your job so much that the very thought of sitting in front of the computer again will make you want to vomit. You might even become a decent programmer, but you will never be a great one, and those are paid best – so you will not even be getting the proper money you want in exchange for your wasting of your health.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember university trainers also saying something similar, however, they were putting more emphasis on the need to have the proper innate talents.</p>

<p>So I kind of accepted the above as facts.</p>

<p>However, then I asked a man I know who is a psychologist and, as far as I'm aware, is highly respected in his field. To my surprise he told me something entirely contrary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Go ask a miner if he has a deep passion for his job and if he loves it so much that he wouldn’t exchenge it for a more highly paid one even if he could. He will tell you, ‘F*** off, I do this because I have a wife and kids to feed, I hate my job!’ And yet the society needs miners. All this talk about the need to find a job aligned to one’s passions completely ignores the simple fact that the main purpose of having a job is not to fulfill one’s passions but to make a living. While it is good to have a job one also has a passion for, this is a secondary goal, only to be pursued after one has already achieved financial stability. Ironically, those who reject the opportunity to work at a stable, relatively convenient and well-paid job because they choose to pursue their dreams to be, say, musicians or athletes or any other high-risk occupation often fail and have to work in a lowly qualified, poorly paid, tiresome and inconvenient jobs that do not even give them opportunities to pursue their hobbies in spare time. I also do not believe that IT is any different – on the contrary, a passionless job in IT might provide one necessary foundations to start trying to requalify.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must say I'm confused.</p>

<p>To add one last thing to the mix. In the Uni we were told that symbolic operations, commonly found in computer science, mathematics, programming, and the likes, are not what our brains evolved to and, therefore, they are <em>painful</em> for our brains and one has to force themselves to perform such operations; as opposed to e.g. pattern-matching our brains like to do and are good at. Thus, people usually do not like, do not want and will not perform symbolic operations unless this innate aversion is offset by necessity or rewarded by satisfaction.</p>

<p>I’m now left with 4 hypotheses, not sure which one (if any) is correct…</p>

<ol>
<li>It is unconditionally necessary for a job to be aligned with one’s passions, otherwise their quality of life and satisfaction will suffer greatly. (But the miner example! – on the other hand, I remember having read that many people are farmers out of deep passion rather than necessity, so maybe it also applies to lowly qualified, physical labors?)</li>
<li>A person may work physically without deep passion – this will be suboptimal but not unsustainable. As many people work at McDonald’s. However, highly qualified, intellectual work actually requires deep passion, because otherwise the subjectively felt urge to not work in this field and rather find something else to do may become unendurable.</li>
<li>This requirement to have a deep passion for one’s work is a trait appurtenant to intellectual work that requires symbolic opperations, like mathematics, programming or science; a person may, however, do a more humanities-related intellectual work out of pragmatism rather than passion.</li>
<li>The need to have a passion for one’s job is being over-emphasised regardless of the scope; it is first and foremost required to find any job that allows one to make a living and it is possible to work at such a job even without passion. Then, and only then, a passion may be pursued.</li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose this topic had to be tackled by experts? What is the correct answer?</p>
"
"What does it mean to ""accept my shortcomings""?","<p>The need to accept one's faults and shortcomings; or accept oneself in whole, with all faults and shortcomings; or self-acceptance is being repeatedly stressed by psychologists.</p>

<p>However, I've always had problems with this. Whenever I was hearing something along the lines of ""acceptance is a necessary precondition of change"" from a professional therapists I would usually start arguing with him. This is what was reaching me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be able to change something in your life you must decide you want to change nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for example, an alcohol addict must decide he will continue drinking until he meets his grave in order to be able to stop drinking? This seemed to me to be either an oxymoron or a particularly twisted form of self-delusion.</p>

<p>Today I read in a newspaper an interview with a professional psychologist and dietician, who was criticizing people who oppose the promotion of self-acceptance among obese people. She elaborated that the dichotomy between obese people accepting their bodies and the fact that obesity is unhealthy and is a both personal and societal problem to be solved is a false one. She pointed out that people who think that way are thinking stereotypically, that this stems from lack of knowledge, that this is a way people cope with cognitive dissonances, etc etc. She claimed that according to research positive motivation is far better than negative motivation that stems from the society rejecting obese people and from obese people not accepting their bodies; instead, if the society accepts obese people and obese people accept themselves, we will take a step closer towards solving the problem of obesity. She explicitly claimed that this does not mean, contrary to a popular belief, that an obese people will not wish to lose weight.</p>

<p>Ah. So apparently, contrary to what I was understanding, ""acceptance"" in the mouths of psychologists does not mean ""decision not to change"". Then what does ""acceptance"" mean?</p>

<p><a href=""https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/accept"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">These are the definitions of '<em>accept</em>' according to the Cambridge Dictionary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>to agree to take something</li>
  <li>to say yes to an offer or invitation</li>
  <li>to consider something or someone as satisfactory</li>
  <li>to believe that something is true</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitions 1-2 seem clearly not relevant here.</p>

<p>Definition 3 seems to me to be this exact faulty definition that I had in mind and that was preventing me from understanding was psychologists were really trying to communicate. For example, I suppose, the verb ""accept"" is used here in the same definition as in the sentence ""*The editorial board rejected Mr. Smith's paper two times already, but finally <em>accepted</em> the third revision for publication*"". So the paper had to be changed two times until finally it was deemed satisfactory and no longer in need of change.</p>

<p>Finally, definition 4, while not <em>obviously</em> inapplicable, nonetheless doesn't seem to be relevant here: I have feeling psychologists, when they are saying that obese people should accept themselves, don't actually mean ""<em>obese people should stop deluding themselves into thinking they are thin</em>"".</p>

<p>Therefore, what does a psychologist mean when they say ""<em>acceptance</em>"" or ""<em>to accept</em>""?</p>

"Separation of romantic and sexual attraction","<p>Occasionally I meet people who say that they are sexually attracted to X group of people (e.g. men) and romantically attracted to Y group of people, X and Y not being the same (Sometimes they overlap, e.g. a bisexual person who is only romantically attracted to people of the opposite gender,but sometimes not at all). Recently I got into an argument with a friend about to what extent this viewpoint (i.e. to what extent such separation is real vs. imagined) is supported by professional researchers and by hard data.</p>

<p>I found a variety of old articles regarding distinguishing between the different neurological and evolutionary bases for these being different separate systems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1019888024255"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1019888024255</a>) Defining the Brain Systems of Lust, Romantic Attraction, and Attachment</p></li>

</ul>

<p>and a couple articles from Lisa Diamond which specifically address whether these two modes of attraction can diverge:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.110.1.173"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.110.1.173</a>) What does sexual orientation orient? A biobehavioral model distinguishing romantic love and sexual desire.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In the lattermost article, Diamond argues in the abstract ""not only can humans experience these feelings separately, but an individual's sexual predisposition for the same sex, the other sex, or both sexes may not circumscribe his or her capacity to fall in love with partners of either gender.""</p>

<p>Diamond's work, being the work most directly addressing the question, seems to give a pretty direct answer - yes, this separation a real thing. The articles are <em>very</em> highly cited, making me think that this viewpoint is viewed favorably throughout the field.</p>

<p>However, my friend is not convinced and demands further evidence. I've had trouble finding more research or data that follows up on this topic one way or another. Is there more recent research or data on this question that follows up or supports Diamond's work? Diamond herself admits that she doesn't have much hard-data to draw upon at the time (over 15 years ago).</p>

But I ignorantly only tested subjects on 'signal + noise' trials, i.e. there always was a speed difference in each trial. There never was a catch trial (no speed difference). Thus, I can't estimate the false alarm rate. I only have the Hit and Miss rates for a given speed difference stimulus.</p>

<p>Can I still use SDT by any chance? Or the estimation of the 'threshold' of detectable speed difference my only option?</p>

"Can humans unconsciously realize that they are being sold?","<p>It is said in the marketing community that the order in which you present ""Price"" and ""Value"" in business propositions changes the consumer behavior. </p>

<p>It is said that when price is presented first, the customer goes into a ""is it worth it?"" kind of reasoning when looking at the price. And that when ""value"" is presented before price, the customer goes into ""Do I like this?"" kind of thinking. </p>

<p>I have to main questions: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do you know of any scientific source for that framing?</p></li>
<li><p>If it is actually a framing, would that mean that the customers can realize that they are being sold? That making them expect the value after seeing a price or expecting a price after being presented with the value. </p></li>

"Can you prevent your biases from swaying your logic if you're aware of them?","<p>As in the title. 
Assuming you are aware of all your biases,and how they interact with your ideas, can you foresee how your biases will warp your judgement or logic, and stop that from happening? </p>

<p>Living a bias free life sounds like a lot of work though, my curiosity is simply in knowing if it would be possible to do so with the necessary knowledge, or if there is some sort of bias-avoiding killer hidden somewhere in the brain.</p>

<p>It looks like similar questions have been asked before, but none literally answer mine.
Introspection Illusion, IF it affects you only when comparing yourself to others, then it's of no obstruction to my question. 
Superficially, the Introspection illusion doesn't look like a roadblock if all you're considering is ""I know i like strawberries. I like no other fruit i tried, so if given the choice between strawberries and other fruit i tried, i will always pick the former."" </p>

<p>The Bias Blindspot, superficially doesn't look like a negative answer to my question either. 
Confirmation Bias is a good candidate for a negative answer. (<a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias</a>) As described by the writer, Confirmation Bias is caused by wishful thinking and desires. But what if one was to remove any emotional investment from a belief, if that's even an option? Charles Darwin was a strong advocate of this detachment from information.</p>

<p>Here (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917255/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2917255/</a>) are listed some ways to avoid bias in a research setting, but what about normal everyday life? That's what i'm most interested in, and no reseach i was able to find can answer yes or no decisively. After all, everyday life is a flood of information.</p>

<p>If i may use myself as an example, i get slightly sick when i am typing biased arguments or fallacious ones, usually before i actually write them out, but sometimes the revelation of bias comes to me later on.
One example was one time i was talking about abuse, and having been the target of some types of abuse, i recognised beforehand (Because i was getting sick after predicting where my conclusion was going), that i was about to say that all abuse is equally damaging, but only based on my experience, and not on hard data or some experiment's conclusion. My experience was blinding my conclusion and i noticed, but can you do that with every bias out there?</p>

<p>I definitely don't think of myself as avoiding all bias just because very often i feel sick during debates or essays. When i have the information, i can also reliably predict my future behaviour, and if i can't, i just say ""I don't know"". It would still be useful to know if some research which i can't access because i'm a mere layman said anything about it.</p>

"Psychology of guessing number of objects","<p>Someone I know is a pretty good guesser. One day we had a guessing contest, and went around the house guessing how many objects were in different containers. </p>

<p>I was surprised that I was outperformed every single time, and the other person guessed faster than I did every time as well. For example the person I was competing against guessed correctly, after taking less than five seconds to think, that a container had 218 marbles in it. This individual continued to perform consistently, test after test.</p>

<p>The person's accuracy rate over <span class=""math-container"">$10$</span> different tests was about <span class=""math-container"">$95$</span> percent, and <span class=""math-container"">$98$</span> percent for objects with over <span class=""math-container"">$200$</span> objects and less than <span class=""math-container"">$300$</span> objects.</p>

<p>What is the psychology of a person being able to accurately guess the number of objects in a container? Are there any neuro-correlates for this ability? Is there a certain time frame that one should guess in and not overthink too much?</p>

<p>I googled ""the psychology of guessing objects"" and didn't find anything useful. But I did find that as the number of objects increases, the accuracy tends to decrease linearly.</p>

<p>My own thoughts on the matter are: </p>

<p>1) It might have been a lucky day for the guesser. </p>

<p>2) They guessed with relatively few objects in the containers. If we had guessed with 500 or 1000 objects I think he or she would have seen a linear decrease in accuracy.</p>

"Could an ethic stating that everyone should care about himself go into justifying exploitment?","<p>Let's assume that one man has the following <em>belief</em>:</p>

<p>1) <strong><em>Everyone</strong> has to take care of himself; <strong>it's not mandatory for people to be nice</strong> and good, <strong>it's mandatory to defend ourselves</strong> from others and to avoid letting the others exploit us.</em></p>

"Can attention be improved to reduce the frequency of mistakes?","<p>There is a class of error that is sometimes colloquially referred to as ""not paying attention"". These are the sorts of error where the subject knows the correct way to perform a task, but fails to follow it due to a lapse in whatever mental process is responsible for ensuring that actions are carried out according to intention.</p>

<p>Some examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A mathematically competent adult solving an advanced math problem incorrectly because of a simple arithmetic mistake, such as 5+3=15.</li>
<li>A well-prepared student getting a multiple choice question wrong because it was asking ""which of the above are not true"", but she mistakenly selected the ones that are true.</li>
<li>A skilled roboticist damaging an expensive circuit because he accidentally wired the components incorrectly.</li>
<li>Mixing up two terms which refer to different things, despite understanding very well the concept that either term refers to.</li>
<li>Typos and simple grammar errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that I do not necessarily mean attention in the sense of being able to concentrate on and pay attention to a topic. I am specifically talking about the ability to not make mistakes (where mistakes are simple errors, which the subject is capable of recognizing as errors, but happens not to <em>in that particular instance</em> - not errors committed because of imperfect knowledge, understanding, or reasoning). Thus, ""mistakes"" are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not reproducible: If the subject is asked to repeat the task, they will probably do it correctly.</li>
<li>Unrecognized: The subject believes that the task was completed correctly, until explicitly checked.</li>
<li>Paradoxical: If asked about how the task should be performed, the subject answers correctly - but occasionally fails to perform as described.</li>
<li>Mental: The mistake is not due to failures in fine motor control but has to do with the output of the mind. The mistake may be due to incorrect interpretation of sensory stimulus, but not due to an overt corruption of the stimulus itself (a person with good vision ""misreading a word"" in a brightly lit room from a black on white page with a suitably large font counts, but trying to read by starlight on a moonless light doesn't).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So, my question: Is there scientific research dealing with ""attention"" in this sense (ability to make few mistakes)? What factors influence it? Can it be trained, or is it an innate, invariant quality of a person that can only be accepted and accommodated?</strong></p>

<p>Also, I am asking specifically about ""healthy and normal adults"", not disorders such as ADHD (unless the pathology helps elucidate the healthy case). As the saying goes, to err is human - but some humans err more than others, and I am interested in understanding why (and what strategies are available to reduce this tendency).</p>

  <p>However, White (2009) also observes that if the work of Robert Yerkes

  performance until a certain optimum level</strong> of arousal has been reached.
  <strong>Beyond that point, performance deteriorates</strong> as higher levels of
  anxiety are attained', <strong>if a person steps beyond the optimum
  performance zone they enter a ""danger zone"" in which performance will
  decline rapidly</strong> as higher levels of anxiety or discomfort occur.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, scientific evidence are suggesting that anxiety <strong>initially</strong> improves the performance but when it raises it has the opposite effect. Since that the word ""excess"".</p>

<p>Sometime is really less intuitive that a raise of something which is initially good will become un-optimal. </p>

<p>But it's very less intuitive. Starting from this consideration, at an intuitive level, I would guess that every good thing when applied and applied will become suboptimal.</p>

<p>(*)The concept of ""too-much"" and ""excess"" is already bound to the consequence and applies only when there are negative consequences. </p>

"Parasite that takes over cognitive functions","<p>I am testing an idea for a book. The backbone of the story is that there exists a parasite that can enter the brain of a creature and take over its cognitive functions. I imagine that it could wire itself in some central part of the brain or neural system, but I am not an educated physician. Let us assume that the being infested is a human. I would like some input:</p>

<p>1) Is this at all possible? I know it is possible with parasites that infest insects.</p>

<p>2) What area of the brain/neural system would it have to take over, or how at all could this happen?</p>

<p>3) The parasite just hijacks the brain, does not destroy it. If it decided to retreat, how much of the information/memories acquired during the infestation period could it carry with it? How much of the events happened during this period would be accessible to the subject after retreat?</p>

<p>4) If we assume a parasite that itself has some cognitive ability, and does not act just out of infestation instinct, how large would it have to be in order to be able to have its own (even basic) thoughts, and retain memories of the subject?</p>

<p>I would appreciate any input on these questions, and any related thoughts you might have.</p>

<p>This question has been put on hold because <em>answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise</em>. With all due respect to the hard work of the moderators, I have to disagree. To begin with, all answers to all questions and even the questions themselves are exclusively opinion-based. Otherwise we would have to assume that there really is any truth that can be objectively be known and agreed upon. No one has ever been able to prove that anything besides our consciousness exits. But if even we have to tone down our agnostic perspective (why do we have to do that?) if you mean that there is not (in the world that you believe you perceive) enough evidence and research to support informed answers, then again this is not right. A user replied with an example of something like this occurring (evidence) and another with a very elaborate answer with examples and cited references to how something like this could happen. I strongly believe that more informed answers can come through.</p>

"How does one respond to an ADD/ADHD diagnosis of one's self or one's child?","<p>I read:</p>

<p>Apparently, there is much controversy over ADHD, according to Wiki (not enough reputation)</p>

<p>I'm guessing initial prescription, if any, is going to be experimental. From there we see if dosage needs to increase or decrease or if medicine needs to be changed or stopped. How then should one evaluate a doctor's decision?</p>

<p>Part 2:</p>

"How much communication is -really- verbal?","<p>It is often said that only a small part of our daily communication is through words, sometimes accompanied with claims that X% is through words, Y% through body language, Z% facial expressions, etc.</p>

<p>However, several studies show that introverts and extroverts communicate differently.</p>

<ul>
<li>Several studies show that introverts are more precise and effective at giving information with their communication.</li>
<li>At least 1 study shows that extroverts use more body language than introverts.</li>
<li>At least 1 study shows that extroverts use more eye-contact than introverts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on this I am certain that communication style can be used as a cue to personality traits.
<strong>So I'm looking for studies that could tell me several correlations on this at the same time. A study that can tell me correlations like these:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The correlation between Big 5 traits and communication through body language?</li>
<li>The correlation between Big 5 traits and communication through eye contact?</li>

Or, if there is an incentive, would it mostly be a cultural one?</p>

"Are Sex Offender Treatment Programmes (SOTPs) effective?","<h2>Background to my question on SOTPs</h2>

<p><a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-offender-management-service"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NOMS</a> is the UKs National Offender Management Service, which is now called <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/her-majestys-prison-and-probation-service"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service</a>.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href=""https://www.justice.gov.uk/offenders/before-after-release/obp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the UKs official website on Offender Behaviour Progammes (OBPs)</a> run by <a href=""https://www.justice.gov.uk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Her Majesty’s Ministry of Justice</a>, it states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is growing international evidence that the type of cognitive-behavioural techniques that NOMS accredited programmes apply are the most effective in reducing offending behaviour; evidence Fact Sheets are available from Interventions Unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trying to find these fact sheets is difficult, but a document titled <em>Suitability for Accredited Interventions</em> (<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/259175/annex-sotp-programmes.doc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NOMS, 2010</a>) has the following on page 5.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A number of offenders are either diagnosed with Personality Disorder or present complex needs linked to their risk. The degree of complexity may prevent them from engaging fully with a shorter programme or may make shorter interventions inadequate. In this instance, a referral should be considered for a Democratic Therapeutic Community (DTC).</p>
  
  <p>Participation in a DTC can occur at any point during the sentence, depending on the needs of the offender. Some will benefit from completing shorter programmes, such as ETS/TSP first to support responsivity and engagement in the DTC. Other offenders may find the therapeutic community approach can prepare and support participation in future high-intensity offence-focussed interventions, if applicable. DTCs currently exist in the Category B and C closed prison estate.</p>
  
  <p>Further information on DTCs can be found at Appendix D.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Appendix B (Page 45) covers all the tyes of SOTP in detail</p>

<p>Appendix D (Page 65) states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Democratic Therapeutic Communities (DTCs) (Custody)</strong></p>
  
  <p>Democratic TCs provide a living-learning intervention for offenders whose primary criminogenic risk factors need to be targeted whilst simultaneously addressing psychological and emotional disturbance.</p>

<p>This is followed by details of the risk assessments required, including a</p>

(1998)</a> <strong>again used offender questionnaires</strong>!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two approaches were used to evaluate treatment impact. The first approach examined the extent to which treated child abusers showed statistically significant changes in their levels of denial, pro-offending attitudes, and social competency/acceptance of accountability. Using this approach it was found that both shorter (80 hours) and longer treatment groups (160 hours) were effective in producing statistically significant reductions in these areas<br><br>
  The second, and more sophisticated, analysis considered to what extent the child abusers had, by the end of treatment, a ‘treated’ profile.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<h2>Are there any studies which evaluated effectiveness using data on reoffending rates?</h2>

<p>A study on Californian programmes (<a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11194-005-1212-x#citeas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Marques, et al. 2005</a>) states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The study was a randomized clinical trial that compared the reoffense rates of offenders treated in an inpatient relapse prevention (RP) program with the rates of offenders in two (untreated) prison control groups. No significant differences were found among the three groups in their rates of sexual or violent reoffending over an 8-year follow-up period.</p>

<h2>Has there been any further evaluation, and is this the same with the UK SOTPs and the rest of the US?</h2>

<p>I <em>assume</em> that it is possible to prioritize the <strong>System I</strong> early on in one's life because it is a fast way to the end.
(Example: In elementary/high school Maths, many tasks can be solved somewhat intuitively since they are simple reoccurring problems. And instead of real deep understanding of the rules, the problems can be solved by application of problem-solving patterns. This applies especially to situations when competition is promoted, thus speed is rewarded.)</p>

"How does one escape learned helplessness?","<p>I've been researching learned helplessness lately, an idea that seems to be responsible for much of the negative behavior observed in humans. Basically, the idea is that once repeatedly exposed to an inescapable pain, a subject learns to accept the pain even when it becomes avoidable.</p>

<p>This was first described by Martin Seligman who observed such behavior in dogs, who, upon being placed in a box that would shock them at random times and then moved to a box where the shock could be escaped by jumping over a barrier, refuse to even attempt to jump the barrier to escape, whereas dogs that could stop the shock in the first box with a lever would easily jump the barrier.</p>

<p>In all my research, however, it seems that the ""learned helplessness"" could only be unlearned by manually moving the dogs' legs to simulate the behavior to overcome the obstacle. However, in humans, such helplessness situations are often very abstract, for example the idea that no matter how hard one works they will never be able to escape debt, or pay their taxes. In such cases, ""manually moving people's legs"" is anywhere from extremely impractical to impossible. Does this mean that human learned helplessness is most cases is insurmountable?</p>

<p>How in the case of abstract helplessness conditions can human learned helplessness be escaped?</p>

"In TD learning, is the weight function used as a linear filter?","<p>In the Temporal difference learning algorithm (TD-learning), an agent seeks to predict the total value of future rewards that will be received during the current trial. The agent updates the prediction as the trial progresses, based on conditioned stimuli (CS) that have been seen so far. Specifically, the prediction is calculated as a weighted sum of the intensities of past CS presentation. At time $t$, the prediction is calculated as </p>

<p>$$v(t) = \sum_{z=0}^t w(z)u(t-z)$$</p>

<p>where $v(t)$ is the prediction at time $t$, $u(t)$ is the CS intensity at time $t$, and $w$ is an array of weights.</p>

<p>My question is: why are we summing the terms $w(z)u(t-z)$, rather than $w(z)u(z)$, i.e. why isn't each weight associated with the CS strength at a particular time?</p>

<p>[Thanks to user honi's reply, I subsequently understood that each element of the weight array is associated with an elapsed time since seeing the CS. For example, $w(3)$ is the weight given to the CS strength experienced three units of time ago.]</p>

<p>[Original phrasing of the question: I am reading Theoretical Neuroscience by Dayan and Abbot, and I am confused by the use of $w(t)$ in equations (9.6) and (9.7).

Is this (a) an unfortunate use of the same name for two different things, or (b) is the weight function really used as a linear filter to calculate $v(t)$?]</p>

<p>Now, Tappy tells me that one term he picked up from his $350/hr psychiatrist is the concept of ""doublebookkeeping"" ... My impression is that it has to do with </p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/double_bookkeeping"" rel=""noreferrer"">From wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Double Bookkeeping.</strong> The tendency, among those who experience delusions, to perceive reality and the delusions as both being real, while remaining unbothered by the discrepancy or inconsistencies between the two.</p>

"Jung's Anima and Neurological Basis in Split-Brain Patients; Left-Persona and Right-Anima","<p>So, having skimmed some studies on split-brain patients, it makes me wonder about the whole ""left-brain/right-brain"" dichotomy that made its rounds in public perception some time ago.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much of that is really good science, but it looks like there's some real truth to the different sides taking on different roles and cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>One thing in particular I wonder about now, is can you map Carl Jung's concept of Anima (I'll refer to the Anima, but what I have to say applies to Animus, as well) onto the right half of the brain?</p>

<p>Jung's idea of Anima was essentially the male brain's mental image of ""the typical woman"". Thus it would posses typically feminine traits.</p>

<p>Since the right half of the brain is associated with creativity, emotional response to (ie, recognizing) faces, and is more typically ""feminine"", would it be possible to devise an experiment with MRI to see if invoking the anima fires more neural activity on the right half of the brain?</p>

<p>Say, have a subject describe ""the typical woman"" and watch activity, have them describe ""the typical man"" and some other controls to also invoke creativity and see how the neural activity compares? See if when men don a dress, their right-brain fires more activity than if they just don any other unfamiliar clothing (a hospital gown or a robe are gender-neutral but may also be unfamiliar enough to control for that part alone)?</p>

<p>It's a very roundabout way of asking, but hopefully the questions kind of highlight the underlying question; </p>

<p>in terms of Jungian Psychology, is it reasonable to hypothesize that you could split the hemispheres of the brain into ""persona"" and ""Anima"" as ""left"" and ""right""? (and perhaps reversed for Persona and Animus)</p>

<p>The interesting thing is that this leads to a testable hypothesis perhaps some people here already know the answer to: Is there any link between gender dysphoria and right-brain dominance? If there is, that would seem to support that hypothesis that the left hemisphere generally takes the masculine identity and the right houses the Anima (in general, though I would expect if the Anima exists as a largely separate neural network (or combined set of networks) that it would probably at least share a little activity on the left hemisphere).</p>

<p>My question is about the losses part: Here also the slope of the graph is getting smaller away from the reference point. This implies that if someone would either lose 100 euro or have a 50% chance of losing 200 euro, he would go for the gamble and become risk seeking.</p>

<p>But to me this doesn't make intuitive sense for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I am loss-averse, which I am, then why would I take a gamble with my second 100 euro's? I would look at it as if I already lost 100 euros and then I can take the gamble of 50% of winning 100 euro or 50% losing another 100 euro. Since I am loss-averse I would not take the bet.</p></li>
<li><p>Let's say I only own 200 euro in total: in that case I would definately want to hold on to my last 100 euro, since then I can at least pay for the rent.

"What's the difference between Confirmation Bias and the Affect Heuristic?","<p>I've been reading ""Thinking Fast &amp; Slow,"" by Daniel Kahneman. At the end of Chapter 9, he introduces the ""Affect Heuristic,"" a concept introduced by <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7f12/9787664da49795bc3ecd517c86b31d17bac7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Paul Slovic</a> that effectively states that people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world.</p>

<p>Isn't this just an extension of confirmation bias - e.g. that people look for confirming evidence when evaluating ideas? It seems obvious that if you like something or dislike a concept, you'll search for evidence to affirm your preexisting position. For example - if I was a conservative and I learned of a bill introduced by a liberal politician, I'd naturally make the assumption that the bill is misguided and search for evidence to confirm that assumption (and vice-versa).</p>

<p>What's the difference between them? I'm having trouble defining the ""Affect Heuristic"" clearly in my mind.</p>

  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
  Maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization may contribute to the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. Because cortical organization can be modified by behavioral training, we attempted to reduce tinnitus loudness by exposing chronic tinnitus patients to self-chosen, enjoyable music, which was modified (“notched”) to contain no energy in the frequency range surrounding the individual tinnitus frequency. After 12 months of regular listening, the target patient group (<em>n</em> = 8) showed significantly reduced subjective tinnitus loudness and concomitantly exhibited reduced evoked activity in auditory cortex areas corresponding to the tinnitus frequency compared to patients who had received an analogous placebo notched music treatment (<em>n</em> = 8). These findings indicate that tinnitus loudness can be significantly diminished by an enjoyable, low-cost, custom-tailored notched music treatment, potentially via reversing maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization.</p>

<p>The article which seems to be related is <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1116981109"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pilati, et al. (2012)</a>, which states within the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here we investigate mechanisms contributing to excitability changes in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) shortly after exposure to loud sound that produces hearing loss. We show that acoustic overexposure alters synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN in different ways. A reduction in the number of myelinated auditory nerve fibers leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells, which cannot be restored by increasing auditory nerve fiber recruitment. In contrast, a decreased membrane resistance of DCN granule cells (multisensory inputs) leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells that is overcome when additional multisensory fibers are recruited. Furthermore, gain modulation by inhibitory synaptic transmission is disabled in both auditory and multisensory pathways. These cellular mechanisms that contribute to decreased cellular excitability in the central auditory pathway are likely to represent early neurobiological markers of hearing loss and may suggest interventions to delay or stop the development of hyperactivity that has been associated with tinnitus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following is also in the article:</p>

<p>Acoustic overexposure (AOE):</p>

<ul>
<li>induces hearing threshold elevations (shifts of hearing
thresholds of 20–30 dB sound pressure level were observed for frequencies above
the frequency used during the AOE protocol),</li>
<li>decreases fusiform cell excitability,</li>
<li>down-regulates auditory nerve (AN) and multi-sensory (MS) synaptic transmission to fusiform cells (FCs)</li>
<li>reduces FC maximal firing rate upon AN stimulations</li>
<li>decreases the number of myelinated AN fibres in the cochlea</li>
<li>reduces FC maximal firing rate upon MS input stimulation and</li>
<li>decreases granule cell membrane resistance</li>
<li>disables FC gain control by inhibitory synaptic transmission</li>

<p>Not having a background in neurology, I am wondering if altered synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN equates to brain damage or is the altered synaptic transmission caused by information received from the damaged cochlea?</p>

<p><strong>In other words, has it really been found that the cause of Tinnitus is brain damage which can be repaired through playing sounds or music with a ""notch"" in specific frequency spectrums?</strong></p>

"How does the brain project pain on to a particular part of the body?","<p>How does our brain translate periheral sensations due to injuries into pain perceptions? As an <em>in silico</em> analogy - if a stimulus is applied to a sensor it can be transmitted to a microprocessor. The micro processor then processes the information. However, a microprocessor will not cause the sensor to ""feel"" that stimulus. In other words, the processed information of the sensor is not projected back to that sensor as a perceived stimulus. Hence, in electronic circuits the information is processed unidirectionally. In contrast, in the peripheral nervous system sensory inputs are processed in the central nervous system, ultimately resulting in perceived sensations on the location of the sensor. Thus, apparently, the peripheral and central nervous systems operate in a feedback loop. </p>

My own sense is that the simple familiarity of the scale would allow for more reliable answers, and I have no desire to list (each time) ""Not at all, a little, somewhat ..."" which I anticipate will simply exhaust my already time-strapped and generally no-nonsense population. 1:10 is fast, and low burden. Or will that familiarity itself result in biases?</p>

"Why do suicide has been kept in natural selection?","<p>Since I've heard about evolution theory, I tend to think about new things with the help of this theory. While not being always accurate, I find the reasoning that makes this theory possible very interesting.</p>

<p>We can ask a question like <code>Why do humans have 2 eyes?</code> and answer hypothetically that it was more advantageous for creatures to have 2 eyes than having 1 or 3. We can imagine that having 1 eye wouldn't allow to see the depth and make the creature able to live even when losing 1 eye. This answer isn't correct but makes sense.</p>

<p>We can do the same with behavior. <code>Why do we tend to be jealous?</code> We can imagine that forcing your sexual partner to stay with you gives your more chances to spread your genes. I'm not saying that this is the only answer but that's one hypothetical answer that makes sense.</p>

<p>However, what about suicide? From what I have read, people tend to suicide when their amount of pain is higher than what they can support. I don't see any reason why creatures(or anything from bacteria to human) would be advantaged from committing suicide. Why didn't the natural selection keep the individuals that can endure anything since they have more chances to stay alive and spread their genes?</p>

"Could any kind of learning be framed as learning a language?","<p>People learn (or actually acquire) languages naturally. As we grow up, we learn also multiple other skills which we then use in everyday life. </p>

<p>A lot of these skills are often compared to a language, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Playing musical instrument</li>
<li>Programming languages</li>
<li>Law</li>
<li>Playing chess (proven to rely on patterns)</li>
<li>Dancing</li>
<li>Painting or, more generally, producing works of art.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above have been compared at one point to a language. They are used to communicate ideas, emotions and information. </p>

<p>The language is used for communication. In the same way, one person knowing the law/programming language/accounting wouldn't actually possess any useful skill without the presence of other lawyers/computers/tax system. So one can argue that all these skills are relevant and can be evaluated only in the presence of other people who receive the message expressed using them.</p>

<p>In the same way, if one person invents their own language but nobody else understands it, we wouldn't classify it as a language.</p>

<p>So, could it be that most of the skills we learn could be described as a language? 
What would be arguments against it?
Is there any evidence I can look into with regards to similarities between learning different skills and learning languages?</p>

"How sound is the psychology of Westworld?","<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am very much a layman in these areas of research, so please do amend the question in order to conform to conventional usage of terminology and definitions thereof.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the series <em>Westworld</em></a> (not the film from 1973), there are a number of themes related to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consciousness</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience#Philosophy_and_sentience"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sentience</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-awareness#Psychology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">self-awareness</a>. However, it seems that the main in-universe theory of what drives consciousness<sup>&dagger;</sup> is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, a version of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bicameralism</a>, namely that the (sentient) mind is, was, or &mdash; in the case of Westworld &mdash; <em>can be defined as being</em> composed of an active part ""generating"" thought and a passive part which ""accepts/consumes/processes"" this thought.</li>
<li>Secondly &mdash; and, according to my limited knowledge of psychology/cognitive science, perhaps more accurately &mdash; that <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">memory</a> and (past) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">experience</a> is a fundamental part of the development of consciousness/sentience/self-awareness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I know that ideas in psychology and the philosophy of mind are extremely difficult to prove <a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/scientists-replicated-100-psychology-studies-and-fewer-half-got-same-results-180956426/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">even empirically</a>, let alone formally. However, it is still possible to not only do experiments which provide corroborating evidence proving the above but also to intrinsically evaluate the above hypothesis for general consistency. Therefore, <strong>regardless of how accurately these ideas describe how <em>human</em> minds actually work, how plausible is it to define <em>some</em> form of consciousness according to the above?</strong> (yes, I know that one point of the entire series is to drive home the idea that there is no magical ""switch"" to ""turning on"" consciousness/sentience; It's not a binary distinction).</p>

<h2>Own speculations</h2>

<p>At least in the human mind, <a href=""https://naturescienceart.org/2011/10/30/memory-and-consciousness/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">memories in fact involve complex chains of synapses which, allow us to, in some form, indeed ""re-live"" past experience to some degree</a>. In fact, (please help me find the citation), it has been shown that people thinking about doing physical activity display activity in parts of the brain responsible for planning of the actual motor movement for that activity. Given that <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5e58f8/plot_hole_or_something_to_be_explained/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Hosts in the series are able to ""perfectly"" re-live past experiences</a>, is it possible that ""consciousness"" could even more plausibly emerge as a complex interaction between these networks, i.e. sensory input triggers multiple memories (which are in fact parts of a larger <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">neural network</a>), which then ""output"" a response of some kind?</p>

<p>Even in humans, what constitutes a ""mind"" develops over time (cf. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#Development"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">theory of mind</a>) &mdash; whether or not this is due to accumulating experiences and memories is beyond my (current) knowledge. Since even we aren't born with some sort of ""fully-developed"" cognition, is it not plausible that some other being/machine/whatever could develop cognitively from a ""lower"" point than what children start at to something similar to our own adult ""cognition"" (ignoring the problem of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">philosophical zombies</a>)?</p>

<p>However, if cognition <em>can</em> be driven by such a network of  ""memories"", is this not in fact then incompatible with the notion of a ""bicameral"" mind? Does that not mean that, despite how smart/sound the individual ideas in the show seem in isolation, that Westworldian cognition is intrinsically unsound?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>&dagger;</sup>In this question, I conflate <em>consciousness</em> and <em>sentience</em> for the sake of convenience; Is there not a more proper term which encompasses both?</p>

"How is the size of a video related to its perceived quality?","<p>Video is often presented at different sizes. On the Internet, many websites provide quite a few size settings. In the store, you can buy TVs of many different sizes. In both cases, it's the same resolution video being stretched to a various sizes. To the technically savvy, making the same pixel occupy a larger physical space does not increase the quality of the video. But to the average consumer, he may think bigger is better. </p>

<p>What does the graph of perceived quality VS physical size look like? Is it linear, that is bigger is always better. Or is it parabolic? That is, there is a perfect ratio of pixel to size and any deviation from this ratio will result in a worse perceived quality. Or is it some other shape?</p>

"Do personality survey responses correlate to the success or failure of minimum wage employees?","<p>I recently watched a friend fill out a personality survey for a minimum wage job. These surveys generally have a few dozen to as many as a couple hundred statements with which the applicant must agree, disagree, or stay neutral. The survey is designed to filter candidates. What puzzles me is what basis they use for this filtering.</p>

<p>Some of the questions are obvious correlates with negative employee qualities:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Sometimes I shout at customers to get my point across.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, gee, I wonder if I should ""strongly agree"" with that one?  Others, however, are not so clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>I will work hard to get a job as an executive at a large company.</p></li>
  <li><p>My former bosses all say I'm the best employee they've ever had.</p></li>
  <li><p>I spend a lot of time thinking through about a problem before solving it.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, being a self-starter might help or hinder a job behind a cash register. Exercising leadership is great until you're one of 40 people restocking the shelves. Thinking through problems is a useful skill unless the problem facing you is trivial, in which case ""consideration"" might be construed as ""procrastination"". Based on examples like these, it's not inherently obvious if these questions measure positive or negative qualities, or what the model response might be.</p>

<p>Moreover, the size, type, and prevalence of these questionnaires suggests a level of sophistication in the selection process that I'm not convinced it is due. Supposing they test 5-10 core competencies, qualities like leadership, professionalism, and decorum, there are more than enough responses to establish <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmpi#Validity_scales"">inter-survey response validity.</a> Of course, that assumes these employers spent millions of dollars developing valid, proprietary psychometrical measures, or co-opted something in the academic domain. </p>

<p>So what are these surveys really testing?  Tongue-in-cheek, if faced with such a test, what would agreeing, disagreeing, or remaining neutral with the statement, ""Employer personality tests correlate with success or failure in the workplace?"" reflect about an individual?</p>

"Do measures of Big 5 personality have a positive bias towards extraverted, conscientious, emotionally stable, ageeable and open individuals?","<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>One free measures of the Big 5 is the <a href=""http://ipip.ori.org/New_IPIP-100-item-scale.htm"">IPIP</a>.
I have noticed that IPIP items seem to have a positive bias towards items loading on the extraversion (EX), emotional stability (ES), conscientiousness (C), agreeableness (A), and openness/intellectance (O) pole of the scale.</p>

<p>For example, for agreeableness, you have items ""I am interested in people"" (positive) and ""I insult people"" (negative), or for conscientiousness you have items ""I pay attention to details"" (positive) or ""I make a mess of things"" (negative).</p>

<p>However, at the level of a construct there are positive aspects to all the other poles of the Big 5. Being disagreeable could mean that you are comfortable confronting people when you believe they have done something wrong or that you are comfortable pointing out social injustice. Being lower on conscientiousness may mean that you don't feel the need to do everything perfectly in life or that you believe that sometimes it's better to be a little messy so that you can focus on more important things.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>Thus, I'm interested in the <strong>positive bias</strong> in measures of the Big 5 towards conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability, and openness.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any research that quantifies the degree to which different measures of the Big 5 display this positive bias?</li>
<li>Are there any Big 5 measures that specifically try to avoid this positive bias?</li>
<li>To what extent is this positive bias inherent to the concepts of the Big 5?</li>

"Chunking Patterns and Enjoyment of Applying Patterns","<p>I've been reading a book ""The Theory of Fun in Game Design"" it talks about two concepts of psychology that I wanted to confirm are true. The writer the book isn't a psychologist. </p>

<p>The two concepts are Chunking Patterns and Enjoyment of Applying Patterns. </p>

<p>So, according to the book he says we are pattern matching all the time. That's one of the things our brain does best. Once we recognize a pattern enough we chunk it. So when we drive to work every morning we don't sometimes remember the details because we do it so often we chunk those details. </p>

<p>Art, Movies, Music, Games, etc... that interest us are because they are introducing new patterns that we can either learn or combine with previous patterns. </p>

<p>This has been essential to our survival so <strong><em>our body rewards us for processing these new patterns by releasing endorphin's</em></strong>. </p>

"Is there cognizance or meta-awareness of classical conditioning?","<p>Behaviorism's initial popularity was largely due to it's ability to take cognition and consciousness out of the equation; bringing it close to something that could be tested completely objectively by judging behaviors. Two of the most significant remaining findings of behaviorism are classical and operant conditioning. Because these acts can be studied in terms only of stimulus and reaction, cognition is largely ignored in related studies, especially in the traditional radical behaviorists' work. </p>

<p>My question is, to what extent is cognition actually at work during classical conditioning? Has it been shown that participants in studies are actually aware that they are starting to associate the conditioned stimulus with either the unconditioned stimulus or the conditioned response?</p>

<p>I'm excluding operant conditioning as I assume that at least for humans it is much more likely that a conscious awareness of the associations between stimuli and punishment/reward will result; perhaps this assumption is incorrect, I just thought it would help narrow the scope of the question. Feel free to correct me if it's wrong, I thought it should probably be a separate question however.</p>

<p>I'll also exclude Conditioned Taste Aversion as it's a rather special case and often only takes a single exposure to stimulus.</p>

<p>Is there evidence of conscious awareness of classical conditioning, especially while the association process is still going on?</p>

<p><a href=""https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/163633/4488"">One person cites</a> an unpublished manuscript by Dehnadi and Bornat (2006) who state in an abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All teachers of programming find that their results display a 'double
  hump'. It is as if there are two populations: those who can, and those
  who cannot, each with its own independent bell curve. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said, educators have choice in how individual assessments are scored, how assessments are combined, and whether and how any final scores are scaled. These could all influence the shape of the final grade distribution.</p>

<p>I also imagine that to get a double hump would suggest that the variables that best predict student performance (e.g., time spent on subject, general ability, subject-specific ability) would have to either show a double hump or show a discontinuous relationship with performance. In particular, I can see that students that drop out of a subject without formally un-enrolling are likely to fail very badly and appear in a separate hump. I also suspect that certain types of subjects where answers are clearly correct or incorrect and where intuition from everyday life is less directly relevant may also give rise to a process where it appears as if people can either do the subject or they can't.</p>

"Cultural brain hypothesis and gene-culture co-evolution","<p>Recently, <a href=""http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/Published.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joseph Henrich</a> of UBC has been <a href=""http://edge.org/conversation/how-culture-drove-human-evolution"" rel=""noreferrer"">promoting his cultural brain hypothesis</a>. The goal is to explain a selection pressure behind the development of the human brain and general intelligence. The basic premise is that our brains evolved to be better and better at accurately replicating cultural information (or memes) between generations. A secondary part of his hypothesis is that there was a tight co-evolution between culture and the genes that shape us.</p>

<p>This seems contrary to the more orthodox thinking of that genes shaped the base of humans largely without large-scale culture (when we were small hunter-gatherer tribes and thus culture was minimal), and then recently (on an evolutionary time scale) large-scale culture 'turned on' and there has not been a sufficient time for this to produce large genetic differences. In simplest terms, the co-evolution was minimal and instead we should think of the key players being gene evolution followed by cultural evolution (on different timescales).</p>

<p>To confuse things further, some scientists (like <a href=""http://personal.lse.ac.uk/Kanazawa/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Satoshi Kanazawa</a> of LSE) <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2012/06/quick-study-satoshi-kanazawa-intelligence"" rel=""noreferrer"">view</a> most of what we associated with the 'perks' of human brain (such as general intelligence) as mal-adaptive on the individual level. Thus there seems to be a large distinction between the 3 general threads, which raises the question:</p>

<p><strong>What is the key evidence for the cultural brain hypothesis and gene-culture co-evolution?</strong></p>

<p>The only evidence I know of potential recent co-evolution of culture and genes is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1904158/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dediu &amp; Ladd's (2007)</a> suggestion that the split between tonal and atonal languages is related to a recent (~6k years ago) mutation in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASPM_(gene)"" rel=""noreferrer"">ASPM gene</a>. <strong>Is there other evidence of recent co-evolution between genes and large-scale culture?</strong></p>

"At what point does a complex become pathological?","<p>I've a first question so I apologize if the format is completely awry.</p>

<p>I'm reading <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/087477618X"">Meeting the Shadow: The Hidden Power of the Dark Side of Human Nature</a> and I came across this passage by Edward C. Whitmont:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The shadow cannot be eliminated. It is the ever present dark brother or sister. Whenever we fail to see where it stands, there is likely to be trouble afoot. For then it is certain to be standing behind us. The adequate question therefore never is: Have I a shadow problem? Have I a negative side? But rather: Where does it happen to be right now? When we cannot see it, it is time to beware! <strong>And it is helpful to remember Jung's formulation that a complex is not pathological <em>per se</em>. It becomes pathological only when we assume that we do not have it; because then it has us.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bold is my own addition to emphasize where my question stems from. This is the whole paragraph to the end of the chapter so as much context as I could give on it. To me (psychology as an interest/hobby with no classes or experience) this means that when we ignore the effects a complex has on us then it becomes pathological. </p>

<p>An example: Say I have an amputated hand and am lividly jealous at the sight of people doing things two-handed. By refusing to acknowledge and deal with this dilemma, I am relegating it to others to deal with by default and it thusly becomes pathological.</p>

<p>Is this accurate? Are there other important factors to take into consideration when considering a complex pathological?</p>

"How do songs trigger memories associated with previous experiences of listening to the  song?","<p><strong>Background</strong>:
If I like a particular song, I listen to it while doing other things until I get sick of that song. This creates an extremely strong bond between the two things: the song and the activity. The activities usually being programming languages or video games. Whenever I hear the song again, the emotions and/or visuals of whatever I was doing flood my brain, and I can remember them vividly.</p>

<li>How does hearing a song trigger memories associated with that song?</li>
<li>Is there anything special about songs and memory associations?</li>
<li>Has any particular research been conducted on the association between songs and memory?</li>

"Upper Bounds on Rat Maze Complexity","<p>Suppose you make a rat run through a maze to find it's food. Every day, you put the rat into the same maze. The first few times this rat has to run the maze, it will probably take a little while to figure out. After doing it several times, the rat will find a path through the maze and stick to it; he'll make a habit out of each turn, and become an expert in his path, finding the food quickly every day.</p>

<p>I'm wondering: has anyone ever performed a study quantifying rat-maze complexity in terms of the number of decisions (left, right, or straight), and then measuring the number of daily maze-traversals required before the rat habituates a path through the maze for his food? </p>

<p>Does the number of traversals required to habituate a path increase linearly with the number of decision-points in the maze, or is there a curve in the relationship between traversals and decision-points?</p>

<p>Is there an upper-bounds on complexity, where the rat will no longer be able to habituate a path? </p>

<p>The reason I ask is first of all just to learn about animal psychology, but also to provide myself with an organic baseline for path-finding and path-normalization algorithms I'm writing into some code for a programming project.</p>

"How to determine an unbiased estimate of threshold in a single-stimulus forced choice experiment?","<h1>Objective</h1>

<p>I need to estimate the unbiased threshold of detectable speed difference in a car-following task. The details are as follows:</p>

<h1>Experiment Design</h1>

<p>This experiment was performed in a driving simulator. In each trial, the participant drives a car in a single lane. </p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<ol>
<li>Initially, the participant's car and the lead vehicle (car or truck) moved at 100 km/h (27.78 m/s). The lead vehicle was at one of the two distances from the participant's car in a given trial: 50 m or 100 m.   </li>
<li>After few seconds, the 'Observe' message appeared on participant's windscreen. At the onset of this message, the lead vehicle began to change its speed (increase or decrease) by 1 m/s or 3 m/s at the rate of 0.5 m/s (e.g. it would take 6 seconds to decrease speed by 3 m/s).   </li>
<li>Once the speed difference was complete (e.g. lead vehicle reached 27.78 - 3 = 24.78 m/s speed), the participant was given 4 seconds to observe this change in speed. Then the 'Change Speed' message appeared. At this point, participants were forced to push either the gas pedal or the brake pedal to indicate that they noticed a positive speed difference (e.g. +3 m/s) or a negative speed difference (e.g. -3m/s). They had to provide their reaction even if they did not see any speed difference. Please note that the instructions were given before the experiment began.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Details/Limitations</h2>

<ol>
<li>There were no catch trials, i.e. there was no trial in which a speed difference was not created.</li>
<li>The trials were done with random combinations of spacing and speed difference. Sometimes negative speed difference trials were done consecutively; in other cases the trials were positive speed difference followed by a negative one. For example: 50 m and +1 m/s -> 50 m and +3 m/s -> 100 m and -3m/s -> 100 m and -1 m/s. These could be in any order.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Possible sources of bias</h2>

<p>A smaller distance of 50 m is relatively unsafe compared to 100 m, especially when the lead vehicle is a truck. So, with small distance, small speed difference and/or a truck, participants might be biased to apply brakes even if the lead vehicle accelerates. </p>

<h1>Results</h1>

<p>I now have proportions of correctly detected responses for each combination of distance and speed difference. </p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>How do I determine an unbiased measure of the threshold of speed difference in each case? Does a speed difference that is correctly detected in at least 75% of the trials an appropriate threshold? </p>

<p>Kindly share any beginner-friendly resources for estimating threshold in a single stimulus forced choice task. Thank you in advance.</p>

"Why do we like music?","<p>Why does music sound good to us? Why is it that a single guitar bend, blues riff on a piano, or a scream by a singer can cause us such a sensation? What makes it better than just noise?</p>

<p>As a physicist, I tried to think of this question from our perspective. Every sound, song, noise or what have you can be decomposed to single frequency waves. We can write the spectrum, i.e. what frequencies (or equivalently musical notes) compose this particular sound and at what intensity. 'A' is well known to have a 440 Hz frequency, for example. </p>

<p>Composed music usually have well defined frequencies. Most of the frequencies will have no effect on the composition (zero intensity), only the ones that the composer decided. Maybe some frequencies will be added due to the digital nature of modern recording, but the highest intensities will be at the frequencies that the composer / pianist played.</p>

<p>Noise, on the other hand, is usually composed of all frequencies (ideally). Every frequency will have a significant contribution to the overall noise. Maybe there will be a central frequency that dominates a bit, but it would not have a significantly higher intensity than the other frequencies.</p>

<p>So my question is, can our brain prefer compositions with well defined frequencies over a scramble of frequencies? Can this be one of the reasons we like composed music better than noise?</p>

"What research is there into content of conversations vs IQ?","<p>I wonder if there is any research into the content of a conversation between two people and how that relates to IQ. My casual conversations are that people of, lets say a more humble background, which generally correlates to a lower IQ, the topics of conversation tend to involve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Food: What did you have for dinner. </li>
<li>Drink: How many pints did you/will you have this evening/last night.</li>
<li>Relations: Who said what to who, e.g. ""He said.. then she said... then..""</li>
<li>What you like: Do you like Jam? I like Jam. Do you like Marmalade? I like Marmalade.</li>
</ul>

<p>i.e. fairly simple stuff. I don't think it would be too hard to program that into a computer. In fact, I would even say there is a lower form of conversation along the lines of:</p>

<p>""Alright?"" ""Aye"" ""Yup."" ""Aye"". ""Ow's it going?"" ""Aye. Good."" ""Yup"". ""Aye"".</p>

<p>(Some might argue that such utterances actually have deeper meaning learned through years of use.)</p>

<p>Whereas I would characterise higher IQ conversations tend to involve more imagination, meta-language, ""And then he said... but why? And what were the motives?"" Critical thinking, and going against the grain. But then this could be because it's more socially acceptable to have these ideas, whereas in working class areas you don't want to be seen as different or above your station.</p>

<p>I don't think this is a class thing. Because you can have quite rich people whose conversations are quite simple. e.g. like the stereotype of the Valley Girl who just like talks about like clothes like thing like. </p>

"What's the pathfinding algorithm the human brain uses?","<p>I was trying to build a software simulation of people using different pathways in a city to get from point A to point B. I do know the Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm, but what they do is to find the shortest path between two nodes. Those algorithms can be used to do it, but they problem is that they only do that, they just find the perfect shortest path. And when I see realistic population movements in a city, I see different people choose different pathways to get from point A to point B, even the same person sometimes chooses a different pathway in two different moments.</p>

<p>I know part of that depends on emotional factors that would be impossible to predict. But my point is that when you look at a map and you decide yourself the path you are going to use to go from you location to a desired destination, you don't seem to run a Dijkstra or A* algorithm in your brain. In fact, I can't possible know the length of every road which is something necessary to run a Dijkstra or an A* algorithm. What algorithm does the brain use to choose a path? It's clearly not always the shortest path. I'm not just talking about the seemingly randomness that other factors like safety of the road can add to the result, or other emotional factors. Because even if my only goal is to choose the shortest path between two points, I am probably going to choose a pathway that is different from the one another person would choose, even with the same goal. I even saw that men and women tend to have brains adapted for this in a different way; in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OfQFYZ-BAc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=278"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Brain Games episode from National Geographic</a> they briefly mention it, I don't know how scientifically accurate it is, but well, that's why I am asking.</p>

"Can meditation be associated to lucid dream?","<p>The principal reason of this question is that I know people that can willingly enter in lucid dream (and so do what they want in it, and wake up when they want).

So it's still sleep (the brain waves length are said to be sleep). But they can basically fall asleep and start lucid dream.  </p>

<p>Important point to mention: those people are doing polyphasics sleep, hence the capacity to fall asleep for a nap really easily. But because of this they don't try to sleep outside their schedules.</p>

<p>However, the thing is that they relax and then fall asleep in a lucid state. </p>

<p>For the parent, the textbook states that this an example of negative reinforcement. Now this seems very intuitive, but I am wondering why this could not be an example of a punishment?  The definition of punishment that I have been given is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""If the behaviour brings about a negative outcome, it's less likely to occur in the future"". </p>

<p>I would've thought that the if the son's behaviour changed from misbehaving, this is an example of a punishment (albeit a tasty punishment). If the son continued to misbehave after receiving the lollies, then this would be typical of a reinforcer.</p>

"Is a concept of good and bad innate or learned?","<p>Some people would say that without religion, there would be no moral code to tell us what is good and bad.</p>

<p>Some Darwinist's like Dawkins say that acts like sharing and feelings like guilt are innate and that we don't need religion. And that we can have morals without religion. He gives the examples of a monkey sharing it's food. </p>

<p>However there appear to be some religions, e.g. human sacrifice in paganism, or death for apostasy in Islam, which seem to suggest that the notion of what constitutes good and bad is more flexible. And the feeling of guilt would be more a social construct.</p>

<p>Sure we can have laws without religion. But these laws might just suit the majority not the minority.</p>

<p>So for instance would a person who had never been taught that murder is bad. But that murder as a revenge for steeling (for example) is good. Would they then feel guilt after comitting a murder? (As Dawkin's might posit). Or feel like they have done a good deed?</p>

<p>Ref. to the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Laurent Itti, Christof Koch (2000). A saliency-based search mechanism
  for overt and covert shifts of visual attention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Page 2, left column, second paragraph from the top, it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Much evidence has accumulated in favor of a two component framework for
  the control of where in a visual scene attention is deployed
  [References here]: a bottom-up, fast, primitive mechanism that biases
  the observer towards selecting stimuli based on their saliency (most
  likely encoded in terms of center-surround mechanisms) and a second
  slower, top-down mechanism with variable selection criteria, which
  directs the ‘spotlight of attention’ under cognitive, volitional
  control. Whether visual consciousness can be reached by either
  saliency-based or top-down attentional selection or by both remains
  controversial.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this article being from 2000 and pretty much every reference to support this dated between 1980 and 1998, is there any current work (2000+) to support this model, or has it even been refuted?</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of visual attention distribution models centering around saliency as the core parameter that seem to fit pretty well, but what about the second component of the framework that is suggested here?</p>

<p>Looking forward to some interesting answers. I can provide additional references if needed.</p>

"Would a patient benefit from continuing cognitive therapy even after solving his pathology?","<p>According to this question: <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/5861/would-most-people-benefit-from-psychotherapy"">Would most people benefit from psychotherapy?</a> most people would benefit from psychotherapy.</p>

<p><strong>I'm trying to narrow that question to only the people who have experienced some <em>psychopathology</em> and went into a <em>cognitive therapy</em>.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counseling#Differenze_tra_counseling_e_psicoterapia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> explains that the differences between psychotherapy and counseling can be summarized in the following sentence:</p>

"How is ""mislabeling"" cognitive distortion different from ""labeling""?","<p>David Burns in his book <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good%3a_The_New_Mood_Therapy"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Feeling Good</em></a> describes ""labeling and mislabeling"" <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion"" rel=""nofollow"">cognitive distortions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Personal labeling means creating a completely negative self-image based on your errors. It is an extreme form of overgeneralization. The philosophy behind it is ""The measure of a man is the mistakes he makes."" There is a good chance you are involved in a personal labeling whenever you describe your mistakes with sentences beginning with ""I'm a..."" For example, when you miss your putt on the eighteenth hole, you might say, ""I'm a born loser"" instead of ""I goofed up on my putt."" Similarly, when the stock you invested in goes down instead of up, you might think, ""I'm a failure"" instead of ""I made a mistake.""</p>
  
  <p>Labeling yourself is not only self-defeating, it is irrational. Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river than a statue. Stop trying to define yourself with negative labels—they are overly simplistic and wrong. Would you think of yourself exclusively as an ""eater"" just because you eat, or a ""breather"" just because you breathe? This is nonsense, but such nonsense becomes painful when you label yourself out of a sense of your own inadequacies.</p>
  
  <p>When you label other people, you will invariably generate hostility. A common example is the boss who sees his occasionally irritable secretary as ""an uncooperative bitch."" Because of this label, he resents her and jumps at every chance to criticize her. She, in turn, labels him an ""insensitive chauvinist"" and complains about him at every opportunity. So, around and around they go at each other's throats, focusing on every weakness or imperfection as proof of the other's worthlessness.</p>
  
  <p>Mislabeling involves describing an event with words that are inaccurate and emotionally heavily loaded. For example, a woman on a diet ate a dish of ice cream and thought, ""How disgusting and repulsive of me. I'm a pig."" These thoughts made her so upset she ate the whole quart of ice cream! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But labeling and mislabeling seem equivalent. I see no difference between, ""She's irritated by me, therefore she's an uncooperative bitch,"" and, ""I ate a dish, therefore I'm a pig"". How does David Burns differentiate between these cognitive distortions? How do other cognitive therapists differentiate?</p>

"Is Allen Carr's ""easy way to stop smoking"" a form of cognitive therapy?","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Burns"" rel=""nofollow"">David Burns</a> is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">cognitive therapist</a>, who in his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good%3a_The_New_Mood_Therapy"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Feeling Good</em></a> describes how to overcome depression. He states that depression is a logical result of irrational negative thoughts, which can be generalized to a finite set of thought patterns called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion"" rel=""nofollow"">cognitive distortions</a>. For example, one such cognitive distortion is <strong>over-generalization</strong>, an example of a negative irrational thought matching this pattern is <em>""this girl rejected my advances outright, i'll probably never have success with  a girl""</em>. In general, cognitive therapy states that our thoughts determine emotions, feelings, moods, habits and behaviors. Thoughts here not only mean thought-phrases, but also perceptions, interpretations, attitudes and beliefs.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Carr"" rel=""nofollow"">Allen Carr</a> was a smoking cessation expert, who wrote <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Easy_Way_to_Stop_Smoking"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Easy Way to Stop Smoking</em></a>. In short, his method revolves around changing your perception of smoking and quitting, and if you succeed, you will quit easily, painlessly and instantly, as if you were never a smoker. First, Carr deconstructs every single argument for smoking, such as concentration, relaxation, stress coping aid, taste, hobby and so on, showing that they are just incorrect rationalizations of an addicted mind. Then he explains the mechanism of addiction — you smoke to relieve the unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, your mind associates sense of relief with the cigarette, therefore cigarette deprivation is so painful, even though it itself doesn't bring pleasure, only returns you to the state, in which non-smokers always are. Finally, he goes through the fears of quitting and deconstructs them by showing that physical withdrawal symptoms are mild, and the cravings are creatures of the deluded mind, that quitting is not a sacrifice and a chore, and the only obstacle was fear.</p>

<p>Carr meticulously describes every facet of smoking, therefore his book doesn't propose written exercises and ideally takes only one reading through to quit smoking. Burns's approach, in contrast, is generic and gradual, he gives you some tools, namely, list of cognitive distortions and a vast amount of written exercises, and asks you to manually apply them in everyday situations. His therapy course lasts for several weeks.</p>

<p>My question is, can Carr's method viewed as a kind of cognitive therapy? What is its relation to a vast ontology of cognitive-behavioral therapy variants, what is the same and what is different? Do mainstream cognitive therapy academics acknowledge Carr's method and his similarities with their approach?</p>

"Is it possible to permanently improve long-term memory?","<p>Many similar questions here ask either about working or short-term memory, or about various tricks and techniques to efficiently remember information. My question is, is it possible to improve the capability for remembering long-term itself? So that learning/memorizing something would take less time or repetition, and the acquired knowledge/information will be stored for longer and with less distortions.</p>

<p>The effect might not be permanent, but it should be prolonged and substantial. To illustrate my point, let's assume for argument's sake that learning poems has the effect of improving long-term memory. This would mean that, after regularly memorizing new poems for several weeks, i find that i'm able to memorize new poems spending less time, the poems retain remembered for longer. I'm also able to remember content of non-fiction and fiction texts better too, so that i can recall tricky facts and logical inferences, which before memorizing poems i tended to forget. So, is there a method to improve the general efficiency of your long-term memory? In other words, ability to retain more information for longer periods with less effort?</p>

"What brain regions are activated when a dream is remembered?","<p>Some people remember dreams, others don't. The same person can wake up with dream recall one day and without on other days.

<p>My question is about the dream recall phenomenon – imagine a person is woken up from a dream while his brain is being scanned. <strong>What is the difference in brain region activations shortly before awakening between the case where a dream is recalled and a dream is not recalled?</strong> In both cases polysomnographic readings would conclude that REM is experienced and probability of dreaming is high.</p>

<p>Dreams are prone to be ""episodic"", where a continuous dream of say 20 minutes may contain several very distinct scenes (2–5 minutes each) that have no relation to each other. I'm interested if such dream changes involve the same mechanism that HM experienced when he was distracted.</p>

"Full list of the capabilities of human brain","<p>I am studying the concept of multi-tasking. The premise upon which I am asking this question is my belief that multi-tasking is a myth(as discussed in a few books on the same topic) and that the brain processes its tasks/brain requests sequentially, one by one. The moment we try doing two tasks, that interfere with each other in terms of the areas of brain that are activated while doing those tasks, we hit an efficiency bottleneck; our efficiency of brain resource usage goes down. </p>

<p>The same belief now led me to think that an efficient way of performing any task is to schedule the task in the brain in such a way that its adjacent tasks have no chance to interfere with the current task in terms of their usage of brain's resources. So, what are those different brain resources that together accomplish an activity? Can anybody give me a full list of the abilities of the brain as per the latest scientific results available?</p>

<p>In the process I tried to list down the various activities that we enjoy doing while we are able to give our full attention/concentration to them and then tried to see what are the varieties of things that a brain can actually do, so that we can quickly identify the activity and classify it in terms of its effect on brain's usage.</p>

<p>A few significant things brains beautifully do are:</p>

<p>calculations(math) = counting</p>

<p>Literature = imagination + verbal</p>

<p>music skills = counting + aesthetic</p>

<p>learning new language = memory + verbal usage + pattern detection</p>

<p>falling in love = reproductive + courting</p>

<p>imagery and sexual fantasy = reproductive + visual imagination + aesthetics</p>

<p>poetry = verbal + counting(metre) etc</p>

<p>traveling = recall + curiosity</p>

<p>adventure = same as above</p>

<p>sports = strategy + motor skills etc
etc etc</p>

<p>The above list includes the types of creative activities that brain does, but does not list the basic, elementary set of abilities that together accomplish these activities. So my question here is, what are those various distinct faculties that a brain uses to accomplish a task? You may provide a list of all the faculties(RHS of the above ""so called"" equations :)), or map the different parts of brain with unique abilities, or provide a totally different way of looking at the brain altogether...</p>

"Moral Foundations Theory and trigger word combinations","<p>Moral foundations theory splits morality into <a href=""http://www.moralfoundations.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">six categories</a>. In his book, <em>The Righteous Mind</em>, Haidt mentioned that looking at church sermons of southern baptist vs less conservative christian Church sermons showed strong moral splits into ""Conservative"" and ""Liberal"" mindsets, defined by subsets of the six foundations, in particular those that <a href=""http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jessegra/papers/GrahamHaidtNosek.2009.Moral%20foundations%20of%20liberals%20and%20conservatives.JPSP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">triggered more often in the texts</a>. Specifically, this was done using a <a href=""http://www.moralfoundations.org/sites/default/files/files/downloads/moral%20foundations%20dictionary.dic"" rel=""nofollow"">predefined list such as this one</a> and then doing a word count for each category, thereby binning the sermon into one of the two mindsets. Lets call such words ""trigger words."" </p>

<p>My question is the following: has there been any work done on looking at combinations of these trigger words from different categories? Let me be more specific. Lets take the sentence:</p>

<p>""Hurting a dog is one of the worst things a person can do."" </p>

<p>One such trigger word here is ""hurting"" which is a vice of the Care foundation. This is something that appeals to the Care foundation and will, statistically speaking, be highly agreed with by the Liberal mindset. Also there will generally be less agreement with this from the Conservative mindset. Now, what if we write the sentence as:</p>

<p>""We must respect dogs.""</p>

<p>Here, ""respect"" is a trigger word for the Conservative mindset. Moreover, consider the sentence:</p>

<p>""Hurting dogs is one of the worst things a person can do. We must respect all animals and those who harm them are evil, wicked and sick."" </p>

<p>I've purposely overloaded the last sentence with Sanctity and Respect trigger words.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: If one overloads sentences as done above, will it trigger more positive reactions from the Conservative mindset?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: When asked to explain the above overloaded sentences, will both Liberal and Conservative mindsets agree on a similar meaning (""don't hurt dogs"")?</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong>: In other words, is there evidence for the ability to trigger low-priority foundations by invoking high-priority ones for a given mindset? I'm am relying here on the notion that words are generally <em>ambiguous</em> and <em>context-dependent</em>. As well, I am assuming reactions and parsing of meaning is instantaneous and the subject is not given time to reflect and analyze, i.e. intuition.</p>

<p>I'm grossly oversimplifying things here but I hope the general theme of these questions will lead to a nice discussion.</p>

I found that, not only did I do the same, but I seemed to do it in synchrony the speaker. I didn't <em>want</em> to do this, why would I?</p>

<p>It's easy to find popular discussions online about contagious yawning but I haven't found any about shrugs.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that there may be other such involuntary imitative movements - raising eyebrows for example.</p>

<p>Is there a technical name for this type of involuntary imitation? I have tried searching online but either I haven't found the right search terms or there is nothing to find.</p>

"Is fear in response to the sight of predators innate or acquired?","<p>Children of very small age have less knowledge. They have very limited knowledge about harm, fear, etc.</p>

<p>The child does not know that the lion is harmful at all. Does the child's brain indicate that something bad is going to happen just by seeing the lion?</p>

"How do hormones influence personality?","<p>I would like to see a specific type of answer to the question, namely, one that answers the following more specific questions: do hormones influence what people terminally value, that is, the things people as an end-in-itself? Or do hormones change people's emotional reactions to events, and since people are influenced by their emotions, this in turn influences their personality? Or do hormones bias people's world views, for example by making them think that being aggressive will be more or less successful at, say, getting someone to do what they want? Or do hormones affect a combination of these? Or do hormones affect something else entirely?</p>

<p>The material I have come across, for example <a href=""http://www.darionardi.com/BulletinArt9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, describe what personality traits hormones influence, but not how they do so.</p>

"How do you analyse visual analogue scales with an ambiguous response?","<p>For example, I might ask participants to complete a visual analogue scale for pain. They would be given a line that is 100mm long, and one end says 0 (No pain) and the other end says 100 (worst possible pain). The participant is asked to make a mark on the line with a pencil or pen to rate their level of pain. I would then use a ruler to measure the distance from the origin. E.g. how many millimeters away it is from the start of the line (i.e. zero).<br>
The problem is that many times, people do not place a mark such as an x on the line, but they might circle a part of the line, or put a tick (check mark) there instead. I attach a picture of the standard response (participant 1) followed by 5 possible scenarios where the answer is ambiguous (participants 2 to 7), so I have left it as missing data/blank. Should these be excluded from the dataset (coded as missing data) or are some of them salvageable?

<p>By way of explanation: In number 2) the line is very large so there isn’t one place that it intersects the horizontal line (usually it has to be accurate to the nearest mm).<br>
Participant 3) has placed a circle on the line so it is difficult to say where on the line they meant. 
Participant number 4) has circled one of the numbers at the end. Can I be sure that they meant 0? Participant 7 is a variation on this.<br>
Participant 5) has placed a tick (check) mark underneath the line (or sometimes they place a tick on the line itself). Which part of the tick do I measure from?<br>
Participant 6) has placed a tick (check) mark on one of the numbers at the end of the scale. Can I be sure that they meant 100?<br>
What is the best way to minimize bias while maximizing the use of the available data? Any thoughts would be appreciated. </p>

"How big is the psychological impact of having no friends?","<p>I've been a loner all my life. I've found that I'm scared of ""hanging out"" with people I don't know or making new friends. I don't want this question to be personalised as such, but I didn't know how else to ask it. I've been hurt as a very small child from other kids my age, bullied and never saw other resembling the teens close to my then age the same ever again.</p>

<p>Could a person that has had no friends ever hope to be a person worth being around? I really do not care if your answers do not apply to my situation, or if it is answers I interpret wrongly or apply incorrectly - I understand I've asked this on the internet and not seeked a professional for this. I just want opinions on this, as I do not have anyone to talk to and paying for it is financially overwhelming for my family at this stage.</p>

<p>I feel that people that has had no friends and have been sheltered in other ways as well has little chance of getting to know other people or becoming someone that other people would perceive as interesting. If ever someone would approach them to ask if they wouldn't want to hang out, they would not be sure whether it is pity or whether they would have ANYTHING in common - thus uncertainty and avoidance are what are usually chosen. I find it hard to believe that people that has had friends all their lives, have fit in all their lives, would ever be able to enjoy the same conversations they are used to having-( with other popular people, kids with money and hobbies, over mutual interests and bold, vibrant personalities) with someone that's never had friends, for whom that is like another planet.</p>

<p>We all know friends influence the person you are, and shape you into who you are. But what of the person that has never had that? Without any input from anyone near their age? Sheltered among the sheltered...</p>

<p>Could a person that has never had friends, make one? Or hope to overcome this psychological barrier that causes them to believe other people are other people, and they are them? Even if they did, that wouldn't erase the lack of social development, thus people wouldn't want them to be friends with themselves.</p>

<p>Also- what is the psychological impact of having no friends? I probably experienced it, but cannot see what it really is because I've never known what ""socially psychologically healthy"" to compare it to. </p>

"Word for naming your negative self-talk to overcome it","<p>I'm trying to find some research - or at least a professional analysis - on the concept of naming your negative self-talk so that you can ""take away its power"" - that is, separate it from yourself and dismiss it.

<p>For example, an actor might name his negative self-talk ""the critic"" so that he can dismiss those thoughts as being ""just the critic running his mouth.""  </p>

<p>Another example (and the one that I'm specifically curious about) is in software engineering, where there's a lot of talk about ""imposture syndrome,"" which in this context is just a fancy way of describing the common experience of feeling like you're underqualified for the job you're doing.  Giving it such a formal name has the added benefit of being ""proof"" that it's an irrational fear - that is, ""Even qualified people are afraid that they're underqualified, so me thinking that I'm  underqualified doesn't mean that it's true.""</p>

"Rat between two walls viewed as a product in a category","<p>I'm reading the book ""A New Foundation for Representation in Cognitive Brain Science -  Category Theory and the Hippocampus"" by Jaime Gómez-Ramirez (a terrible book, if you ask me).</p>

<p>On p. 164 the author introduces the product of two objects in a category. I.e. the product of two objects $A$ and $B$ in a category $\mathcal C$ is another object $P$ equipped with two morphisms $p_1: P\rightarrow A$ and $p_2: P\rightarrow B$ such that for any pair of morphisms $x_1: X\rightarrow A$ and $x_2: X\rightarrow B$ there is a unique morphism $h$ making the figure commute.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lXpS.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2lXpS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The author goes on to say that the main characteristic of a product is that the constituents are retrievable via the projections. The following example is given: Let $W_A$ and $W_B$ be two walls that the delimit the maze a rat is moving in. After reaching both walls, the rat would develop the concept of a middle point $P$. This middle point $P$ corresponds to the categorial product $P=W_A \times W_B$.</p>

<p>I struggle to make sense of this. If the walls, or more generally, any location in the maze, are objects in a category, then what are the arrows (morphisms)? My first guess is: paths. Translated into the maze-world: There is a ""concept"" $W_A \times W_B$ that gives me paths from each wall to the middle $P$. And given any point $X$ in the maze there is a unique path $X\rightarrow P$ from $X$ to $P$.
This interpretation doesn't make sense at all.</p>

<p>The second guess is that the walls $W_A, W_B$ are not actual locations in space, but the rat's concepts of these walls. But it is still unclear, what the arrows between concepts are supposed to be.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to make sense of this? Specifically, what exactly is this ""maze-category""?</strong> Because to me, so far, this is just half-baked, abstract nonsense jibber jabber.</p>

<p>Example: I am being given a choice between two apples. I will usually think to myself, ""I think I have tasted this apple recently and it was horrible,"" and choose the other one. Or, I might take a moment to decide which one tastes better, but without talking to myself. </p>

<p>I am fairly confident that I have been told from some people that they never think in words. Is this possible?</p>

<p>What other ways are there to think? Do some people think in images? (With the apple example, they would maybe visualize a couple images of them biting into the apple, of a similar apple they have seen, etc.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, do some people think in scents? I do not imagine how this would work, because when I attempt to recall a scent or taste, I cannot recall it exactly; rather I think about whether it is good or bad, about when I enjoy it and with what, etc. </p>

<p>How would all this work on the neurological level? I am no professional in this area, but a suggestion is that thought in words happens in the section of the brain responsible for speech, and thought without words happens in the subconscious. </p>

"Testing earworms without ethical problems","<p>Earworms (or sometimes referred as sticky tunes, involuntary musical imagery, stuck songs) is a phenomenon that many people experience in their daily lives.</p>

<p>Although several studies suggest that they do not last more than several days, there is a case where the song was stuck in a man's head for over 33 years.</p>

<p>It seems to be ethically problematic to test which songs create earworms, because the melodies may be stuck in participants' heads, even if they knew about the aim and possible consequences of the study.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to test which songs create earworms without any ethical troubles?</strong> I can only think of doing a descriptive research, asking ""Do you know this song? How sticky is this song?"" but making conclusions from this data would be quite difficult.</p>

<p>Or maybe I should add this question: Since mostly earworms last for a few days, it is not probable that the participant will have an earworm that negatively affects his/her life. <strong>So, can I do an experiment about earworms since an ethical problem is highly unlikely?</strong></p>

"Difference between reverse inference and decoding (e.g. MVPA) in fMRI","<p><em>Reverse inference</em>, i.e. the use of brain activation (fMRI) data to infer the engagement of a certain mental function, is heavily criticised (e.g., Poldrack 2011, Neuron). </p>

<p>At the same time, <em>decoding</em>, the process of applying machine learning algorithms to such brain activation patterns in order to infer something about the mental function that elicited this response (e.g. to distinguish between two different conditions in an fMRI experiment), is extensively used and actively developed - multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) being just the most widespread of these techniques. </p>

<p>The two concepts appear, however, to be one and the same; or rather, that the second (decoding) is a special case of the first (reverse inference). Is there an additional nuance to their difference? Also, why is decoding not criticised in the same way as reverse inference?</p>

"What makes people like other people?","<p>Humans have this strange behavior:
Some people like other people which are disliked by a third party of people.
But there are also people that are generally disliked by most ofthe others.</p>

Person B, C and D like Person F, but A hates F
Person A, C and D like Person G, but B hates G
Person F and G get along well with C
...</p>

<p>How can you explane this strange behavior?</p>

<p>Some people can't get along with each other, but both have common friends, that get along with both of them. So it can't be like that they are so different from a cultural standpoint, because they have common friends that get along with both.</p>

"What is the point of living a life if we're all going to eventually die?","<p>So I've had this question over the past week since New Years. I am currently 21 years old and yea, time flies so fast. New years just feels like one year closer to death. Can you believe it? The internet was founded around the years when I was born. Can you believe where we are today? Can you believe that it's 70% through the decade already? Yet 7 years ago, I was barely in high school and iPads were invented?</p>

<p>So at the start of New Years, I've started to get this feeling ""what is the point of living life if eventually we'll all die""? And furthermore, I got another question. If we die, doesn't everything come to an end? Don't you lose memory of absolutely everything you've done in life? So in other words, what's the point of doing things in life if we're all going to eventually die and never even remember what we've done? Maybe other people might but would you personally have remembered this upon your death? I'm talking in a non-religious point of view. From a scientific logical point of view, everything you've done in life comes to an end and you cannot even backtrack anything to trace your memories or whatnot. I don't believe that scientifically there is a such thing as ""afterlife"" or whatnot. </p>

<p>So really, I got extremely depressed over the past few days thinking about this question. I mean you can be the richest person in the world right now but in probably ~80 years, you'll completely forget about that. Or otherwise you can live in total misery and poverty but you'll forget about it maybe 50 years later. </p>

<p>Ideally it would also be short and quick to administer (for reference, I would consider both versions of the IPAQ too long)</p>

<p>I ask because I'm interested in people's recent levels of exercise and I've tried administering a short questionnaire where I ask things like ""how many minutes of aerobic exercise did you do yesterday?"" but when I looked at the the data it turns out that >70% of people report 0, so I end up with a zero-inflated variable.</p>

<p>This could be due to a poorly worded question, poor response format, or any number of reasons. Ideally, I would conduct a full survey design study and use factor analysis to create/validate a short form questionnaire, but at this point it might be easier to just use one that currently exists, if there is one</p>

<p>Does anything like this already exist?</p>

<p>Let's suppose the treatment is electric shock therapy. Which has the following effect on the 3 cases:</p>

"Can new emotions be created or discovered?","<p>Related: <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/q/961/13656"">Are there emotions that only some people can feel?</a></p>

<p>Is there any known observed or theoretical process by which new emotions could be observed or discovered?</p>

<p>Although one may argue over the exact number of emotions that exist today or the exact criteria that differentiate one from another, there is broad agreement on the general types of emotions that exist (e.g. most psychologists would agree that happiness, sadness, envy, anxiety, excitement, anger, disgust, lust, pride, etc. are emotions while pecan, horseradish, choke, stupid, chair, delta, redshirt, appoiapgpadvap, asdf, and yooe caph garharheq are not emotions). Those minor disagreements/edge cases are <em>not</em> what I am talking about, but a brand new emotion. Hypothetically, I can imagine that one might result from novel stimuli (or patterns of stimuli) never before experienced by humans (and thus resulting in a never-before seen affect on the brain), but I am not aware of any actual cases of this occurring or any known (outside of science fiction) theory of what sort of stimuli patterns might accomplish this or what such an emotion might be like.</p>

<p>If it has been shown that one of the ""standard"" emotions today arose <em>after</em> the advent of anatomically-modern humans (e.g. Cro-Magnon), I would consider that an answer.</p>

<p>In response to a comment by Bryan Krause, I am aware that there is a linguistic argument here. I'm imagining this as similar to the linguistic/neurological divide in color taxonomy. Famously, Russian does not have a single word for ""blue"" (instead, dividing it up into two separate colors), while Japanese historically did not distinguish between what English speakers call blue and green, but I believe it is fairly well understood that these distinctions happen at a fairly high level in the brain, rather than representing truly distinct forms of cognitive evolution. The color equivalent to my question could be whether it is possible for the brain to evolve, or for novel stimuli to generate, an <em>entirely new color that no one has ever seen before</em> and that cannot be reasonably described as a variant or subtype of an existing color. Some science fiction authors, famously H. P. Lovecraft, have tried to imagine a ""new"" color, so the idea that new cognitive experiences could be found is certainly not new.</p>

<p>Another way to ask this is whether the process of coming up with new words to describe emotions represents enhancements in the <em>understanding</em> of current emotions or whether it represents truly new emotions never before experienced or observed.</p>

As shown in time-course, the classifying values (thick black lines) between red line (first condition) and blue line (second condition) are variable along the time, so that the values in the early time do not easily apply to the late time leading to the normal map of the temporal generalization. </p>

<p>However, using higher frequency band (12-30 Hz) we encountered a strange result
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHg1q.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHg1q.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> 
In this case, the classifying values between red line (first condition) and blue line (second condition) are somewhat constant along the time, so that the values in the early time easily apply to the late time leading to the high decoding accuracy all over the map. The point is that two parallel curves are easily divided by a simple mean (black thick line) between two curves as the classifier. If two curves are not parallel but mixed with each other, the decoding accuracies over the map of the temporal generalization should be low, and we can conclude that the high frequency do not contain decodable information. </p>

<p>Questions, 
1.  Have you ever seen this type of time-courses of the high frequencies in our result and this strange map the temporal generalization and?
2.  We use the matlab function ‘filtfilt.m’ for bandpass filter, could you recommend other function for bandpass filter?</p>

"How could you define this variable?","<p>The procedure of one experiment includes the next sequence:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The anagram is presented for several seconds;</p></li>

However, it's often hard to tell from these studies what number corresponds a neutral point, where someone is neither unhappy or happy (or equally so), or is feeling an valence/affect equivalent to a nonconscious state. For instance <em><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=05e5d_KBYY0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP13&amp;dq=experience+sampling&amp;ots=rtKOM3tmc0&amp;sig=GJp6aaU09aJXINg_91LAHeC_s7c#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Experience Sampling Method: Measuring the Quality of Everyday Life</a></em> (2007) shows its results in terms of z-scores, which are defined relative to some average, but it's unclear whether that average would be higher or lower than a neutral point. As such, while we can say that these people are happier in this situation than another, it's hard to see whether they're overall happy or unhappy in that situation.</p>

<p>I'm not particularly interested in what activities or age or gender correlates with happiness, but just how happy people are relative to some clearly defined neutral point. Ideally, the study wouldn't just show some average among all study participants across all their experiences, but also what percentile corresponds to what happiness ratings, and the range of happiness scores and the frequency of different happiness ratings for each person. Is there a study that addresses this topic?</p>

Our brain and everything in our body has developed to ensure our survival. At the prospect of a threat to our life, our brain does everything to save us with all those reflexes. In spite of this, some people are capable of committing suicide, how is this possible? 
Lets consider a scenario, </p>

Again, if one has the will power to commit suicide, one should be able to endure any other difficulty in life, this is also contradictory. Please explain.</p>

It's repeated a lot, particularly by design folks, but I couldn't find psychological research to support (or refute) it.</p>

<p>In terms of actual contrast ratio, inverting a black on white scheme won't change the contrast at all; the colors themselves are just as distant. Yet I see many claims that ""inverted colors"" is high contrast.

"How does Classical Conditioning and Operant Conditioning really differ?","<p>I was taking a practice ap psychology test and was curious how operant and classical conditioning are different.</p>

<p>My test claims that the difference comes from the fact that Classical conditioning is based on an involuntary action and Operant Conditioning is based on voluntary action but obviously this is false since what may be involuntary/reflexive for some may not be the same for others.</p>

<p>An example they gave is how someone may move their hand away from an iron because of 'reflex' whereas they will attempt to do well on a test because they are aware of a reward, but what about someone that has a lot of experience with the given subject and simply does well on the test because they reflexively feel the need to do well. I know for me personally when given a math problem that I can't immediately solve or outline a heuristic for solving I tend to drop all external thoughts and work on it, often with a the same determination with which my dog chases after a squirrel. </p>

<p>This is of course because over time I have gained enough experience, practice, and interest in the field to do so. Thus for others attempting to solve problems will be a voluntary action, but for me personally I have an involuntary need to work on them.</p>

<p>But then again, when someone throws a ball at me, being that I don't have much experience with sports, I tend to first think ""theres a ball!"" before the reflex for catching initiates while for others that tends to fire off immediately.</p>

"Why is working memory so small?","<p>I know that the concept of working memory may be subject to discussion. Still, there is a storage capacity limit. This is a real mystery to me. Working memory is known to be positively correlated to various tests (<a href=""http://www.genepi.qimr.edu.au/contents/p/staff/CV317.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">IQ for example</a>). Why did natural selection not grant us a better storage capacity?</p>

<p>Before asking this question, I read some hypotheses by Cowan: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/#S2title"" rel=""nofollow"">The Magical Mystery Four: How is Working Memory Capacity Limited, and Why?</a>
Two camps are presented: capacity-limit-as-weakness and capacity-limit-as-strength.
Basically the first camp explains this weakness from a neuronal point of view, claiming that keeping many items active is greedy and can cause interference. The second camp pretends that the lesser the number of items accessible is the quicker the cognitive processes are (chunking, searching, etc.). Honestly I don't know what to think. More than that, I don't feel its very convincing. If our neural system has evolved toward some incredibly powerful processing modules and can't even keep 10 items active at the same time, there must be a reason. I am more inclined to think that the capacity limit is a kind of strength somewhere, but I don't feel very convinced by the examples provided in the short passage I mentioned.   </p>

<p><strong>Do you have any extra arguments for/against any of these theoretical positions?</strong><br>
My preconception is that this limit constrains us to encode the real in the most powerful fashion. In short, we are always forced to learn more complex patterns. Is it relevant or not? Do you have any source which could challenge or back up this view?</p>

  <p>At this point in our scientific knowledge we are on the verge of being
  able to estimate how much information the central nervous system is
  capable of processing. It seems we can manage at most seven bits of
  information - such as differentiated sounds, or visual stimuli, or
  recognizable nuances of emotion of thought - at any one time, and that
  the shortest time it takes to discriminate between one set of bits and
  another is about 1/18 of a second.</p>

<p>So far I know, it is observed that the uninformed are not giving them the treatment they need. Specifically, why are the uninformed not giving them the treatment they need?</p>

<p>Is it accurate and precise to say that mental illness is regarded as modern-day leprosy since:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/42947/what-evidence-is-there-that-the-jews-thought-leprosy-was-due-to-sin"">In ancient times (or Jesus's time), uninformed people believed people who had leprosy had leprosy because they committed a grave sin or sins</a></p></li>
<li><p>In modern times, uninformed people believe people who have mental illnesses have mental illnesses because they committed gravely immoral actions (see how I avoid the non-secular word ""sin"") ?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Take for example a drug or gambling addict. Drug and gambling addictions are mental illnesses, but an uninformed person would look at a drug or gambling addict and say that the reason that they have these sicknesses is that they started taking drugs or gambling, the immoral action.</p>

<p>However maybe an informed person would say that the reverse is the case: the immoral actions of starting to take drugs or gamble is caused in part by the illness that the person had or the biological, psychological or environmental predispositions that the person had.</p>

<p>Other examples would include procrastination, overeating or hyperactivity.</p>

"Is depression caused by life events?","<p>If we look at physical illnesses we could put them on a spectrum of 'Happened spontaneously/no choice in the matter' to 'Was clearly created by something that happened in their life'. </p>

<p>From less causal, to more causal I'd suggest a list like this. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Genetic disorders.   (Entirely genetic, from birth)</p></li>
<li><p>Down syndrome. (Genetic, but age of parents plays a part)</p></li>
<li><p>Cancers that happen 'randomly' (eg. breast cancer).  (Random, but some people have genetic disposition)</p></li>
<li><p>Common cold. (Not sure where to put this on the spectrum, but caused by a cold, but some people are more susceptible than others). </p></li>
<li><p>Obesity. (Some people have a higher disposition to obesity)</p></li>
<li><p>Smoking related illnesses. (Caused by smoking, but some people more susceptible than others). </p></li>
<li><p>HIV.  (Caused by a virus transferred by contaminated blood/unprotected sex)</p></li>
<li><p>A broken leg. (Caused by physical trauma)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is - the illnesses at the top of the spectrum have some kind of genetic cause, or we don't know enough about them to say how/why they occur, whereas the illnesses at the bottom of the spectrum are clearly caused by some life event. </p>

<p>With a mental illness like schizophrenia - it seems clear that this would fit at the top end of the spectrum - the schizophrenic was schizophrenic from birth, and there was nothing that 'caused it'. </p>

<p>However, it seems that depression is often the result of life events - stress, addiction, pregnancy, grief etc. </p>

<p>Is this a valid way of looking at depression? What terminology and research is there about it? </p>

"Predictive Experiments on Neuroscience of Free Will","<p>It seems to be very interesting that we can use modern neuroscience and cognitive science research to inform us about the ages-old question of free-will vs. determinism. The standard experiment was done by Benjamin Libet in 1983 that demonstrated that electrode activity showed that in terms of using our left or right hands - electric signals showed a significant change in activity before the reported decision to make the movement was made. This is one of the founding experiments of the neuroscience of free-will.</p>

<p>However, it seems that this experiment informs us in a very limited temporal duration. Since I could not find any conclusive results myself, I wanted to ask if they were any neuroscience experiments that demonstrated long-term predictive behavior. An example would be if a person with a particular imaged localized area could be said pre-hand to have a certain behavioral reactions in response to stimuli. This would defend give a strong defense to the determinist philosophical position. Of course, I'm talking about conscious reactions (such as decision-making in social situations, since the idea is that people consciously think they make their own decisions). An experiment involving unconscious processes such as memory would not be very informative. </p>

<p>If so:</p>

<p><strong>Which experiment(s) comments on this?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is the degree of validity of the experiment?</strong> (Summary of Methods and Results)</p>

<p><strong>Are the results controversial? Does it truly make a comment on the philosophy of free will?</strong></p>

<p>If not, is it that Neuroscience is still not mature enough have predictive power like hard sciences such as biology, chemistry and physics. After all, the brain is a incredibly complex organ, and responding to complex multimodal stimuli (e.g. social situations) it would further complicate the possibility of any such study.</p>

"Is thinking with language efficient?","<p>I wondered, whether it is efficient to <strong>think</strong> with language (of course it's efficient for communication). When I'm thinking with long words, it takes longer than thinking with short words. Maybe thinking without words would be even faster?</p>

<p>So, do babies, who didn't learn think faster because they don't immediately try to find words for their thoughts to tell someone about them? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, when we see <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>, we think of every symbol as a
  word <code>one plus one equals two</code>. I assume, someone, who lacks language(Babies for example), would think of this without these words, but instead with emotions(maybe). See the note at the end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In our everyday life, we almost always need to talk to others about our thoughts. This leads to us thinking with these words instead of just thinking and then finding words for it. It's like writing a manuscript just from front to end instead of first brainstorming and collecting ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Main question:</strong> Is it possible to think in a two-step process(and would it be more efficient)? First, thinking with <code>emotions</code>(or whatever you want to call it) and then finding <code>words</code> for that to spread your idea?</p>

"Where does action based on thought originate within the human brain?","<p>A rather basic question, but I don't see answer in Google, so here it goes: Humans have thoughts, sometimes these thoughts carry with them motivations to act, urges, cravings, etc. All these can make a person start moving to accomplish something. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example: ""I'm rather bored, I think I will go get a snack"". What
  happens the moment I cross the threshold from thinking to actually
  getting up to get a snack?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What happens the moment the person starts to act based on a thought? <strong>Where in the human brain does a thought trigger action?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In response to an answer suggesting that in many cases action comes first and rationalization for action comes second:</p>

<p>The kind of action that I'm talking about comes after a longer period deliberation, where the current state is being weighted against the benefit of the action to take.</p>

<p>For example in the situations below, a person can deliberate for minutes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A person is in bed and is very close to sleep, being comfortable and relaxed. Loud noises from the outside disturb the person's attempt to fall asleep. In this case the person can experience conflict between staying in bed (comfortable but disturbed) or going to find earplugs / shut the windows (uncomfortable, but potentially lessening the disturbance)</li>
<li>A person is trying to meditate, thus relaxing the body and unfocusing the mind. An itch on the foot is disturbing the meditation. Such person can either continue the current state while ignoring the discomfort or scratch the itch and potentially lose the meditative state.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the examples above, two conflicting courses of action are evaluated by the brain. Due to the ongoing discomfort, it is possible to stay in this state of ""almost making a decision"" for quite some time.  At a certain point the scale can tip into taking action to resolve the discomfort. <strong>What is it that causes the person to take action as opposed to inaction?</strong></p>

<p>This appears to be true for a wide variety of different types of stimuli and sensations. A table that is often presented to illustrate this generality is from <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Psychophysics_introduction_to_its_percep.html?id=e_VqAAAAMAAJ"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stevens, 1975</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XJfjB.png"" alt=""power law exponents table""></p>

<p>However, it is not obvious from perusing this table what kinds of stimuli tend to be associated with what kinds of power exponents -- in particular, what kinds of stimuli tend to be associated with <em>positively accelerated</em> psychophysical functions of intensity vs. <em>negatively accelerated</em> psychophysical functions of intensity. Indeed, the exponents in the table above appear to be distributed rather haphazardly to me, and I have not seen any mention of work suggesting it is otherwise in my admittedly limited literature search.</p>

<p><strong>So my question is:</strong> Is anyone aware of research that attempts to characterize what kinds of stimuli tend to be associated with what kinds of psychophysical functions of stimulus intensity? If so, what is the basic summary from this research, and what are some suggested readings? As hinted above, I am particularly interested in stimulus features that predict positively vs. negatively accelerated psychophysical functions of stimulus intensity, but references to and descriptions of more specific research questions are also quite welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I thought it might help to say just a little bit more about exactly what I'm interested in finding out here, in as clear and concise a way as I know how. What I am looking for are any references to review papers and/or research articles that are about (or even that just mention) predicting the form of the psychophysical power law across a range of different stimuli, using stimulus-level predictors. It is hard to extract any general conclusions about this from Stevens's table above, given that the power law exponent appears to vary widely, sometimes being >1 and sometimes &lt;1, <em>even for stimuli on the same psychological continuum</em>, as in the cases of ""Taste"" and ""Warmth."" The point of the table (and indeed the body of research that it is based on) is just to show that these functions follow power laws of some kind or other -- while this is mildly interesting, what I really want to know is how well we can predict what <em>kinds</em> of power laws different stimuli will follow.

"Differences in willingness to correct errors made between human and computer interactions","<p>I have a design where I present participants with a series of decisions, and then ask them about some of these decisions later.

Participants mentioned errors made in my study much more - they didn't carry on justifying an error.  </p>

"Is there any ""predictive"" component to positive/negative affect in Seasonal Affective Disorder and Bipolar Disorder?","<p>I'm wondering if the human brain ""predicts"" how certain weeks of the year should feel? </p>

<p>For example, a child who is going to school may have a more positive affect in anticipation of summer holidays, and may feel more negatively towards the end of the summer, as he/she knows that freedom and fun are about to end. </p>

<p>Another example may be siblings' or parents' birthdays, where the anticipation of the birthday increases positive affect.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if year after year of such patterns (in childhood, the teenage years and maybe young adolescence) can create an association in the brain between positive/negative affect and the specific time of the year, or specific photoperiod duration (day length). What I'm trying to understand is, if a pattern of such ups and downs that may have been established in the childhood persists throughout adulthood?</p>

<p><strong>Have there been any studies that looked at the previous life history and incidence of mania/depression episodes in bipolar disorder, or the onset of depression in Seasonal Affective Disorder(SAD), and correlated them with holidays, birthdays, etc?</strong> I've read that SAD may manifest a depression in any season, not just winter, which got me thinking of the possible causes. </p>

"How long can a person stay happy, excited and motivated about something new?","<p>I'm interested in learning more about studies or experiments that determine how long a typical person can stay excited about something new:</p>

<pre><code>New job
new project
new relationship
new idea
new purchase/toy
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any evidence to support the hypothesis that humans are excited by new things/prospects, but only for a short time? If so, how short? Is it days, weeks or a ""honey moon""? </p>

<p>A while ago I've heard a talk on TED.com that happy people are up to 30% more productive (<a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/does-happiness-affect-productivity"">Does happiness affect productivity?</a>), and I'm wondering if this is applicable to ""being excited about something new"" - <strong>i.e: are people more effective/smart when they are taking on new project, new job or a new relationship?</strong> Are people more excited, energized and engaged <strong>when they conceive new ideas?</strong> </p>

<p>It would also help if I get to learn what the search term for ""being excited about something new"" is. </p>

<p>Update:
Looking into happiness and productivity produced two terms: ""Happiness economics"" and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill"">Hedonic Adaptation</a>. The article on hedonic adaptation says that happiness is homeostatic in nature </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a system that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain
  a stable, relatively constant condition of [its] properties</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading that happiness regulates itself (as in negative feedback) sounds very reasonable to me, and I recall reading about antidepressants and Serotonin, which also mentioned that Serotonin production uses negative feedback, where more Serotonin released now inhibits release of more Serotonin, thus antidepressants dont work immediately and require a couple weeks to take effect[looking for a link]. </p>

<p><strong>I'm wondering if the process of being excited about something new is also homeostatic in nature?</strong></p>

"The effect of lifestyle photography on sales conversion rates","<p>I work for a large UK-based clothing retailer. After some initial customer testing with our product details page (on our website) there has been some debate on the following question:</p>

<p><strong>Do customers react better to lifestyle-based product photography or shots of clothing on a mannequin?</strong></p>

<p>My personal guess is that the majority of users will favour the lifestyle type images and distance themselves from the rather bland mannequin style. The mannequin style strikes me as somewhat cold in an business that tried to instill a sense of fashion (which by definition is creative). </p>

<p>However I like to think I'm a practical fellow and so I'm seeking any established research that would support - or discredit - my theory. <strong>Can sales conversion rates be improved (increased) with the use of lifestyle imagery (showing live models interacting/wearing) the products, as opposed to person-less mannequin based photographs?</strong></p>

"How can I test whether Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) activity at night is related to variations in mood?","<p>I'm reading this paper, which discusses Serotonin activity in the Dorsal Ralphe Nucleus(DRN), and even includes some mathematical models of how serotonin is released and reabsorbed. The paper states that depressed patients show significant decreases in serotonin both in DRN and outside. The thing that impressed me about this paper is that it gives examples of the <strong>serotonin concentration in DRN in normal person, compared to depressed patient, and the difference is about 80%</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://metabolism.math.duke.edu/docs/SSRIsJ7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bursts and the Efficacy of Selective Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitors</a></p>

<p>The paper above referenced this excellent paper on how DRN is involved in the regulation of motor activity, and even includes some references to how <strong>DRN is involved in the sleep/wake cycle</strong>. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~sswang/awake_cerebellar_ms_refs/jacobs_fornal93_TINS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5-HT and motor control: a hypothesis</a></p>

<p>Here's an example of a graph from the article above. It shows how the firing rate of the DRN increases in response to cat's grooming, compared to quiet wakefulness. DRN firing pattern changes in response to movement. Can I reverse this statement to say that <strong>movement indicates DRN activity?</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/s0wWs.png"" alt=""Cat DRN activation during waking and grooming""></p>

<p><strong>The hypothesis that I have is that if less Serotonin is available in the DRN as a result of depression, the activity of the DRN as related to motion at night would be different from the normal person.</strong> I hypothesize that by observing the motion of human in bed at night, it may be possible to quantify the activity of DRN, potentially using this information to predict mood fluctuations. </p>

<p>Here's my train of thought - DRN fires differently in response to motion, and motion is accompanied by DRN firing, while muscle atonia is accompanied by total lack of firing. An actigraph has shown that a person (myself and others) moves over the course of the night, in bursts with episodes of total stillness and episodes of burst activity. People move differently in different sleep stages. In cats without atonia (see figure below), DRN gets activated when Rapid Eye Movement(REM) sleep is detected, in response to the cat's actions within the dream, similar to the waking state.. Normally, DRN shows absolutely no firing pattern during REM sleep. <strong>I would like to examine the pattern of movement over night and compare it to the feeling of well being in subsequent days</strong>, where depression can be linked to decreased levels of Serotonin in DRN cells.  </p>

<p>If I understand the <a href=""http://metabolism.math.duke.edu/docs/SSRIsJ7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bursts and the Efficacy of Selective Serotonin Reuptake
Inhibitors</a> paper correctly, bursts of electrical activity within the DRN alter Serotonin concentrations for some time after the burst. As such, it seems to me that bursts of electrical activity associated with motion (a typical motion at night is 3-10 seconds) with a large motion observed every 2-3 minutes over the 20 or so minute period that preceedes awakening would have an impact on the Serotonin concentration in the DRN.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/n0RBP.png"" alt=""Cat without atonia""></p>

<p>I'm trying to understand if activation of Dorsal Raphe Nucleus during Rapid Eye Movement sleep can be detected with an <strong>iPhone actigraph</strong>, and if this activation can be quantified, measured and correlated to behavior in the preceeding and subsequent few days. I'm looking to correlate activation of DRN or lack of thereof with the normal, elevated or depressed moods and activity patterns. </p>

<p>An iPhone actigraph measures gross motor activity, which I guess would roughly compare to the EMG from the images above. In this case, the plot is logarithmic, with taller redder bars being orders of magnitude bigger than the baseline ""noise"" observed by the device. 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QlJKN.png"" alt=""iPhone actigraph""></p>

<p>Over the past year I've been working on an iPhone actigraph - an app that analyzes user's motion and can be used for sleep studies. On that actigraph, I'm seeing spikes in motion (my sleep) at different sleep phases. The device allows marking of events over night - midnight awakenings, and dream awakenings. </p>

<p>Here's an example of a sleep cycle graph that is drawn based on the observed motion at night. In this case, the deeper the graph, the more still the person is. Red circles indicate insomnia, green circles indicate subsequent dream awakenings. 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIifN.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The device also allows the user to track moods over the course of the day with a very cool Pick A Mood scale and add different events, such as meals, exercise and over 80 other types of events. </p>

<p>Since I'm only an amateur at science and sleep studies, <strong>what are your thoughts on the train of thought above? Is there any merit to the hypothesis?</strong> How would I go about testing it with the technology I outlined?</p>

<p>Thank you for your input!</p>

"Analysis of parameter estimates from Ratcliff diffusion model","<p>I would like to analyze a dataset in which subjects' reaction time and error rate have been recorded.

However I was confused by their approach: it seems they select the best fitting model for every subject and in this way are fitting models with different parameters for the subjects. My understanding was that it is not a valid approach to put together estimates from models with different parameters?</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would it be a valid approach to first fit the diffusion model
separately for every subject and then take the estimated parameters
to a group-level analysis (e.g. repeated-measures ANOVA)?</li>
<li>Prior to ANOVA of parameter estimates: is it - in the above context -
better to fit the same model to all subjects or to select the best
fitting model for every subject?</li>

"Why is Asperger Syndrome poorly recognised in France?","<p>Asperger Syndrome is quite well-known in psychiatric circles, as well as (to a lesser degree) the general public, in many countries the western world. However, in France, Asperger Syndrome is virtually unknown to the general public. From what I have read in various sources, French psychiatry denies the existence of Asperger Syndrome, instead using alternative diagnoses and alternative treatments, some of which can be very harmful. This is not the case in other Francophone areas; the situation in Belgium, Quebec and Switzerland is better. </p>

<p>Below I quote <a href=""https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger#Tendances_par_pays_francophone"">the French Wikipedia article on Asperger Syndrome</a> and I attempt to provide a translation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Le syndrome eut du mal à être reconnu et ne l'est pas encore totalement. Il peut être ignoré par les professionnels, parfois réticents à annoncer le diagnostic à cause d'orientations théoriques personnelles ; le syndrome d'Asperger n'existe pas en tant qu'entité distincte dans les précédentes versions de la CFTMEA et n'y a été individualisé que dans la dernière version (année 2000). Notons que les termes « disharmonie de développement », « disharmonie d'évolution », « disharmonie évolutive », « disharmonie psychotique », « Trouble Complexe et Multiple du Développement (MCDD Multiple-complex Developpemental Disorder) » sont souvent utilisés en France pour décrire les troubles autistiques. Ces termes ne figurent pas dans la nomenclature internationale CIM1014 et ne devraient plus être utilisés, selon les recommandations. De fait, depuis quelques années, certaines associations dénoncent des diagnostics de « dépression infantile » qui sont de plus en plus souvent prononcés à tort, en lieu et place des anciennes « disharmonies »15[réf. insuffisante].</p>
  
  <p>L'approche française se défait néanmoins progressivement d'une imprégnation psychanalytique qui propose une prise en charge singulière du diagnostic et de la prise en charge de ce syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My rough translation attempt (a native speaker is encouraged to improve):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The syndrome was difficult to be recognized and is still not fully. It can be ignored by professionals who may be reluctant to perform an Asperger diagnosis diagnosis because of personal theoretical opinions; Asperger syndrome does not exist as a separate entity in previous versions of the CFTMEA and was taken up as a separate entity only in the latest version (2000). Note that the terms ""disharmonic development,"" ""disharmony of evolution"", ""progressive disharmony"", ""psychotic disharmony"", ""Disorder and Multiple Complex Development (TSLS Multiple-complex Developmental Disorder)"" are often used in France to describe autistic disorder. These terms are not included in the international nomenclature CIM1014 and should not be used as recommended. In fact, in recent years, some associations decry diagnostics of ""childhood depression"" that is increasingly often given erroneously, instead of the former ""disharmony"".</p>
  
  <p>The French approach however defeats slowly a psychoanalytic penetration that proposes to take a unique diagnosis approach to take care of the syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Why</em> is Asperger Syndrome so poorly recognised in France? Are there political reasons behind this (<em>we don't want this ""American"" thing</em>), does it reflect a wider culture in French psychiatry, or is there no clear cause for this?</p>

"Abstract idealized mental visualization improves motor task performance","<p>I practice martial arts (Aikido), which involves a lot of rotation.</p>

<p>When practicing, I find that <em>holding an abstract image in my head, instead of thinking about the actual technique, improves my performance of the technique.</em></p>

<p>For example, when rotation is required, my mental image is essentially a vertical spiral pulled tight in the middle (as if constrained by a belt), in that one comes in to the axis of rotation and must stay on it before moving off into the rest of the technique.</p>

"Criteria for evaluating cognitive systems","<p>In the first chapter of the book ""How to Build a Brain"", Chris Eliasmith quickly establishes some criteria which he will use to evaluate Spaun, the cognitive system described in the book. He describes them in great detail in Chapter 8, but below is my attempt at summarizing them.</p>

<hr>

<h1>1. Representational Structure</h1>

<h2>Systematicity</h2>

<p>The system should connect concepts in an inter-connected way and understand there are classes of concepts, since human thought is systematic. For example, given <code>blue ball</code> and <code>red square</code>, it should be possible for the system to reason about the concept of <code>blue square</code>.</p>

<h2>Compositionality</h2>

<p>Concepts should be created off of the combination of concepts to the degree supported by real cognitive systems. For example, given the concepts of <code>pet</code> and <code>fish</code>, it should be possible to reason about the novel concept <code>pet fish</code>.</p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>The system should be able to create many representation based off of a few basic representations to the degree supported by real cognitive systems.</p>

<h2><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Massive Binding Problem</a></h2>

<p>The system should identify a binding operation that scales well.</p>

<h1>2. Performance Concerns</h1>

<h2>Syntactic generalization</h2>

<p>Ability to exploit the structure of language regardless of content.</p>

<h2>Robustness</h2>

<p>Losing a few neurons or being exposed to noise shouldn't break the system.</p>

<h2>Adaptability</h2>

<p>You should be able to use a single system for multiple task.</p>

<h2>Memory</h2>

<p>The system should be able to show the relation to the various types of memory (working, long-term).</p>

<h2>Scalability</h2>

<p>Large portions of the brain should be modeled and able to complete a wide variety of tasks.</p>

<h1>3. Scientific merit</h1>

<h2>Triangulation</h2>

<p>Contact with the most sources of experimental data as possible.</p>

<h2>Compactness</h2>

<p>Good theories can be stated compactly and without ad-hoc additions.</p>

<hr>

<p>He explains in the chapter that this is actually a synthesis of various other criteria proposed by various authors. Although the scientific merit seems rather straightforward to me and has been elaborated upon on great length, the other criteria I am less certain about in terms of completeness and acceptance. Have attempts at unified criteria been made before? Are there more complete criteria? Are these criteria at odds with any other ideas about what a cognitive system should embody?</p>

"Can anxiety cause a heart attack, black-out or insanity?","<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Burns"" rel=""noreferrer"">David Burns</a> in his self-help book about overcoming depression, anxiety and interpersonal problems called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Feeling_Good_Handbook"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The Feeling Good Handbook</em></a>¹ states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...neurotic anxiety results from distorted thoughts that have little to no basis in reality. If you are having a panic attack, you may believe that something terrible will happen if you let your anxiety get out of hand. You might think you'll pass out from a stroke or have a heart attack or go crazy. Although these fears seem legitimate, they're quite unrealistic because: (1) Anxiety <em>never</em> causes strokes or heart attacks. (2) Most people who are afraid of passing out during a panic attack have never once passed out when in a state of panic. In fact, you <em>cannot</em> pass out during a panic attack because your heart is beating rapidly and pumping extra blood to the brain. (3) Panic attacks never lead to insanity or loss of control. You are worrying about something that's blatantly unrealistic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a revelation to me. Is it true that it is impossible for a panic attack to cause heart attacks? black-outs? insanity? If there are exceptions, how are they explained? Does this extend to all forms of anxiety, fears and phobias, not only panic attacks?</p>

"How to read a neuron tuning curve graph?","<p>I'm working through the tutorial of section 2.4 of ""How to Build a Brain"" and I've encountered this graph of a neuron tuning curve.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ebbUy.png"" alt=""neuron_tuning_curves""></p>

<p>I understand the Y axis is the firing rate of the neuron, that each curve is the response of a single neuron (there are 100 neurons represented here) and that this plot shows a variety of ""on"" and ""off"" neurons, but what does the X axis represent? Is it the action potential input? Is X the value that the neuron represents by firing at that rate?</p>

<p>Please allow me to give some context around the tutorial. You first create a population of 100 neurons to represent an input that will vary from -1 to 1. You notice that this works well, but that the representation degrades when you exceed this range falls apart and you cannot represent anything the range past -2 to 2.</p>

<p>You then use a new population of neurons to build upon this newly acquired knowledge of how neurons can represent functions, to make them represent a 2-dimensional vector similar to the monkey-arm motor experiment performed by Georgopolous.</p>

<p>I could take the leap of faith here and just take for granted that neurons can represent functions and that the more neurons you have, the better approximation of the function you can get, but I feel like understanding these fundamental concepts are important.</p>

"What exactly is the neurobiological mechanism behind the functioning of the human muscle?","<p>From what I have read, its been given that muscle functioning and coordination involves two processes: frequency summation and muscle recruitment.

As in, both frequency summation and muscle recruitment contributes to modulating the amount of force which makes me wonder why two processes are required to satisfy the same purpose?</p>

<p>The conclusion I could come to was that, frequency summation applies to only a single muscle fiber and when the fiber saturates and no more force can be recruited more muscles are recruited to increase the amount of force applied. An example scenario of this occurring would be a person is lifting a very heavy object. I want to know whether my inference is right or wrong? If wrong I would like someone to explain to me the exact mechanism. </p>

<p>The method uses 12 steps to free individuals from drugs, but it doesn't use any deep approach to their personalities and its duration is also too short to do it (""The primary care program was intended to last up to 60 days in a residential setting"", "" ""insurance companies then set 28 days as a reimbursement guideline in order to ensure sufficient coverage""(1).
There is even little evidence that this model is effective, and it received criticisms.  </p>

<p>Hence my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it really producing changes, or only temporary changes which can collapse every time that personality is challenged?</li>
<li>Can it be realistically expected that the individuals treated by this method have their personalities really transformed and would never feel the necessity of consuming drugs, or have other type of addictive behaviours?</li>

<p>(<strong>1</strong>) Might someone with Apraxia of speech who does not seek treatment have psychological problems? They just don't care about not talking with people who don't want to wait and listen to their thoughts. Is that arrogance? low self-esteem? severely anti-social?</p>

"Kahneman's add one / three exercise","<p>In his book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman describes a mental exercise which he calls <em>Add One</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To start, make up several strings of 4 digits, all different, and write each string on an index card. Place a blank card on top of the deck. The task you will perform is called Add-1. Here is how it goes: </p>
  
  <p>Start beating a steady rhythm. Remove the blank card and read the four digits aloud. Wait for two beats, then report a string in which each of the original digits is incremented by 1. If the digits on the card are 5294, the correct response is 6305. Keeping the rhythm is important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This description is a bit vague and I'm wondering how the exercise is supposed to work exactly. He does not mention to cover up the card before reporting the modified digits. This would allow to perform the transformations on-the-fly digit by digit. This does not sound challenging at all and does not fit to Kahneman's following statements of loading the working memory, in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Few people can cope with more than four digits in the Add-1 task.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>My assumption was that he means something like that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Beat 1: Uncover card</li>
<li>Beat 2: Read aloud first digit</li>
<li>Beat 3: Read aloud second digit</li>
<li>Beat 4: Read aloud third digit</li>
<li>Beat 5: Read aloud fourth digit</li>
<li>Beat 6: Wait + cover card</li>
<li>Beat 7: Wait</li>
<li>Beat 8: Say first digit + 1</li>
<li>Beat 9: Say second digit + 1</li>
<li>Beat 10: Say third digit + 1</li>
<li>Beat 11: Say fourth digit + 1</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>However, a quick Google search reveals a few implementations, for instance:</p>

<ul>
<li>This <a href=""http://healthresearchblog.blogspot.de/2011/11/working-memory-with-r-code.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog post</a> resulting in a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMy_6Pgiokk"" rel=""noreferrer"">YouTube video of the exercise</a>.</li>

"Do the results of psychological studies change our behaviour?","<p>This is a question that has been bugging me for a very long time.</p>

"Can humans keep track of two unrelated rhythms?","<p>Let's do an experiment. With your left hand start tapping out a regular (evenly-spaced) beat - say, 2 beats per second. With your right hand attempt to tap our a different regular beat, but tap at a rate that is ""as unrelated as possible"" to the first beat - something like 3.14159 beats per second. (Here ""as unrelated as possible"" is weakly defined. Basically, I mean to keep two rhythms that are both regular but will never be in sync.)</p>

<p>My question is this: <strong>Is it possible for a human to actually keep accurate track of both rhythms? Or will they interfere with one another so that the rhythm of one or both hands is lost?</strong></p>

<p>My own (admittedly unjustified) model of neuronal behavior is that rhythmic action of the left hand must correspond to rhythmic patterns of neural activity in the brain with the same frequency. And similarly, rhythmic action of the right hand must correspond to rhythmic patterns with that frequency. Since, I suspect, the task of tapping out a rhythm requires coordination across several areas of the brain, then it seems that the a-periodic neuronal firing would likely interefere and cause one rhythm or the other to become dominant - or both rhythms to be lost entirely.</p>

"Why do some people react verbally to intrusive thoughts and/or embarrassing memories?","<p>It seems to me that there are two kinds of intrusive thoughts. The first consists of those thoughts that didn't actually occur in real life, but are nonetheless intrusive and embarrassing and disturbing to the individual (i.e. thoughts of harming someone else, or unwanted sexual thoughts directed towards individuals). The seconds consists of past memories of embarrassing moments, particularly from childhood.</p>

<p>I've noticed that many people will respond to these thoughts in some way.

<p>I have heard these statements that all memories are stored in the brain and that the reason why we forget is because those memories are simply not accessible anymore. This would metaphorically be like the workings of a hard drive, where deletion of a file removes the flag, but the information is physically still stored, it is just invisible to the user and difficult to access. Following this reasoning, everyone would have HSAM in a way, barred that normally the memories can't readily be accessed. </p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are all conscious<sup>1</sup> memories stored, but access is permitted only when its regularly accessed, or enhanced through hypnosis or other means?

"What is the mechanism behind recurring or looping thoughts?","<p>I'm interested in what is the mechanism that explains the recurrence or looping of thoughts within a person's mind. Unless very strongly distracted, such thoughts can creep up back or mutate slightly while maintaining the same overall theme - action is required. </p>

<p>From my understanding both positive and negative thoughts can loop, although thoughts with the themes of fear, anxiety, compulsion or desire can be more disturbing when looping. </p>

<p><strong>What is the mechanism behind looping or recurring thoughts?</strong> In particular I'm interested if such thoughts are chemically induced through a release of some kind of neuromodulator (like fight or flight response is based on Adrenaline).</p>

<p>A few examples, where rational thought is used to counter irrational fear or anxiety thought:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did I forget to do X? </li>
<li>I really have to go to Y, but what if I did not do X?</li>
<li>[Imagination a horrible scenario when X is not done]</li>
<li>I better go check on X.</li>
<li>Check on X reassures the person, resulting in no new thoughts creeping in.</li>
</ul>

<p>What interests me is what happens when the person either cannot go and check or will incur significant cost for doing so (ex: being late to work) or will try to resist the urge to check. In this case recurring thoughts can eventually reemerge and start to invade one's awareness:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did I forget to turn the stove off?</li>
<li>I really have to go to work.</li>
<li>But the house can burn down </li>
<li>I believe that nothing bad will come out of it</li>
<li>You can't know that</li>
<li>The stove has a pilot light - gas will just keep burning</li>
<li>But the cat can jump on a stove and get burnt</li>
<li>Cat is smarter than that</li>
<li>But the house can burn down</li>
<li>You can become homeless</li>
<li>Do you have fire insurance?</li>
<li>[Repeat/mutate]</li>

"Can adhd and ocd coexist? Is it in the same way mania and depression can coexist (in bipolar disorder)?","<p>Is it really possible for someone to have both ADHD and OCD?</p>

<p>I was thinking that ADHD is the opposite of OCD: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1eeid9/how_do_adhd_and_ocd_coexist/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a> <a href=""http://psychcentral.com/lib/ocd-and-adhd-is-there-a-connection/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a></p>

<p>from 1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>alexThePotato:</p>
  
  <p>With ADHD you may be forgetful, distracted, make careless mistakes,
  daydream, etc. With OCD, my impression is that you'd be very focused
  on details, a bit perfectionist, and generally meticulous. So how do
  they coexist, and what kind of behaviors do you attribute to each?</p>
  
  <p>kukienboks:</p>
  
  <p>Seems to me that OCD is about putting a lot of focus and energy into
  unimportant things, something which Adhd-ers also can tend to do. The
  main difference is probably that OCD-ers are driven by anxiety rather
  than suffering from inability to prioritize tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are also those who believe that OCD and ADHD often occur
  together. This site on ADHD states, “It is not uncommon for someone to
  have both ADHD and OCD.” I find this statement baffling, as the basic
  symptoms of ADHD (listed below), in my opinion, seem to be in direct
  contrast to those of OCD:</p>
  
  <p>Inattention: Having a short attention span and easily distracted.
  (Most people with OCD would love to be able to not pay attention to
  their thoughts.)</p>
  
  <p>Impulsivity: Causes a person to do dangerous or
  unwise things without thinking about the consequences. (Those with OCD
  do the exact opposite. They play it safe and obsess about the
  consequences.)</p>
  
  <p>Hyperactivity: Inappropriate or excessive activity.
  (Those with OCD often go out of their way to do what they feel is
  appropriate. Also, in Dan’s case, he often had very low energy as he
  was “wiped out” from struggling with his OCD.)</p>

<p>However I read <a href=""https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/expert-opinion-ocd-and-adhd-dual-diagnosis-misdiagnosis-and-the-cognitive-cost-of-obsessions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some research has suggested that OCD and Obsessive Compulsive Spectrum
  Disorders fall upon a compulsive-impulsive continuum. In other words
  there exists a gradient of disorders ranging from behavioral
  impulsivity to compulsivity. OCD appears to lie at one end of this
  spectrum, while ADHD exists at the other.</p>

<p>Does this then mean that ADHD and OCD together is like mania and depression together? Is there a term for the former just like the latter has bipolar disorder?</p>

<hr>

<p>There's someone in 1 who says</p>

<p>""ADHD makes my mind wander but then my OCD latches onto things I get so focused that nothing else exists.""</p>

<p>and someone else who says</p>

<p>""The OCD part of is killing me on the inside on how messy my room is. I hate messy rooms."",</p>

<p>but there seem to be contesting comments such as</p>

<p>""Actual clinical OCD is so very far from the perfectionism you're describing.""</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>""You are confusing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder...I don't know if OCPD and be comorbid with ADHD, but I agree that intuitively they don't seem compatible. OCD on the other hand is sometimes misdiagnosed as ADHD (and vice versa) as they both involve problems with impulse control.""</p>

<p>There's another comment which might explain how ADHD and OCD are not opposites, but I'm not quite sure I understand (assuming it is right):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>they aren't opposites. OCD is when you have strong anxious compulsions
  that you can't resist. ADHD is when you are unable to resist even weak
  impulses. They harm the patient in a devilishly sinergistic manner -
  let's take someone who already has difficulty resisting impulses, and

Yesterday i was watching a youtube video , more precisely a lecture from MIT. Looking through the comments i found out that the professor from that lecture studied computer science at the University of Waterloo. I have never heard about the University of Waterloo before (until yesterday). 
Today, while checking my emails i was surprised to see that i got a suggestion to read an answer to a question : ""How valuable is the University of Waterloo's computer science program? ""
I know that with computers may not be so mysterious since they know what content we see on the internet and may use it for making suggestions.
The thing is that these kind of situations occur really often even without technological ""help"".</p>

<p>For example:
Some time ago my sister told me about neutron stars. It was fascinating.
The next day, during a lecture, my physics professor used neutron stars as an example for a problem.</p>

<p>I had never heard about neutron stars before my sister told me about them and i was shocked to hear my professor that day. I haven't heard about those stars since then.</p>

<p>I have two questions regarding the g-factor.  What confuses me is for one, he does not go into technical detail about how the g-factor is calculated.</p>

<p>He does include this illustration:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WMtaE.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WMtaE.png"" alt=""g-factor""></a></p>

<p>Here we see that 15 mental tests are taken in groups of 3, where each group is correlated to a certain factor. So tests 1-3 are for reasoning, 4-6 for spatial ability, and so on.  These factors then correlate to the g-factor.</p>

<p>I am wondering what is the methodology used to find the correlations between the tests and factors/factors and the g-factor? For example, I don't quite understand how they measure the correlation between the test and the factor given that the factor is abstract (ie. reasoning). I hope what I am asking makes sense. I am not asking how to perform linear regression or calculate Pearson's r. </p>

<p>My second question is about the statement in the book: </p>

<p><em>""Different mental abilities are not independent. They are all related to each other and the correlations among mental tests are always positive.... It strongly implies that all the factors derived from individual tests have something in common, and this common factor is called the general factor of intelligence.""</em></p>

"William James ""Principles of Psychology"" and Brain Plasticity","<p>I am reading William James' ""Principles of Psychology"".  It is clear in his research that he was acutely aware of brain plasticity and the limited capacity for a precise ""schema"" (ie. static brain map) to represent brain function.  Seeing that this text is well over 100 years old and cites much research even older, how is it that I see so much information (primarily in the press and lay neurology texts) that brain plasticity is a new perspective recently discovered by academics and researchers?  Without question the earliest modern neuroscientists knew about brain plasticity.  It was an undeniable characteristic of their research.  (As a side note, it is interesting that creatures with less intelligence have greater plasticity, with the level of intelligence being inversely proportional to plasticity.  A fact I've never seen discussed.)</p>

"What does this writer mean?","<p>I hope I am asking this question in the right place. In her reading of Duras's <em>Hiroshima mon amour</em>, Julia Kristeva, the analyst and philosopher, refers to Duras as a melancholic. Anne Juranville, also an analyst and a professor of literature, however, believes, in Kelly Oliver's words, that ""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Duras is too depressed to be melancholic <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=vvcit1tEOSMC&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;ots=gic6uj2sQW&amp;dq=%22Duras%20is%20too%20depressed%20to%20be%20melancholic%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Duras%20is%20too%20depressed%20to%20be%20melancholic%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Oliver, 2001, 152</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can anyone explain what she means by this? Isn't the melancholic, in the last analysis, the same as the depressed? </p>

<p>What does she mean by saying that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the melancholic “subject,” and in particular the feminine one,
  maintains an immediate, traumatic relation to the real qua maternal
  Thing. <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=vvcit1tEOSMC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;dq=%22Duras%20is%20too%20depressed%20to%20be%20melancholic%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gic6uj2sQW&amp;sig=ACfU3U2GNatMICHD0UjbGLfd89JUYaaEKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiDsrT94N_jAhVEy6QKHTYMCyAQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Duras%20is%20too%20depressed%20to%20be%20melancholic%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ibid</a></p>

<p>Here's part of the paragraph cited from Kelly Oliver's <em>Psychoanalysis, Aesthetics, and Politics in the Work of Kristeva</em> (2009):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anne Juranville, also an analyst and professor of literature,
  disagrees with Kristeva’s clinical diagnosis, arguing that Duras is
  too depressed to be melancholic, but does agree that the melancholic
  “subject,” and in particular the feminine one, maintains an
  immediate, traumatic relation to the real qua maternal Thing. This
  nostalgic denial of individuation, as for Kristeva, positions the
  melancholic beyond the pale of symbolic intervention, unable to access
  in any way the historical reality of the social: “Stupefied,
  horrified, [the melancholic] fixes himself in an inhuman zone beyond
  death where, lacking the least symbolic recourse, he is condemned to
  remain eternally and passively concentrated on this gaping wound that
  he himself is” (1993, 54). <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=vvcit1tEOSMC&amp;lpg=PA152&amp;ots=gic6uj2sQW&amp;dq=%22Duras%20is%20too%20depressed%20to%20be%20melancholic%22&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Duras%20is%20too%20depressed%20to%20be%20melancholic%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ibid</a></p>

"Does selfishness increase in periods of extreme anxiety","<p>Does an individual going through a period of extreme anxiety, show increased levels of selfishness during that period ? </p>

<p>When this period ends, does the individual returns back to normal levels of selfishness ?</p>

<p>The following extract is from this  <a href=""https://medium.com/invisible-illness/anxiety-makes-you-selfish-f0488589bfd0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a>, which describes the personal experience of a person with anxiety/depression.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we’re anxious, we become lost in our own thoughts, waging a
  battle so distracting in its intensity that it makes it nearly
  impossible to notice the outside world. It’s not that we don’t care,
  but rather that we’re so distracted by our discomfort that it is only
  with great effort that we’re able to look out and truly see others.</p>

"The same neuron sometimes released different neurotransmitters, so how does this affect our interpretation of computational models?","<p>Most studies I see compare firing rate with some observed variable (stimuli or behavior). However, they treat all spikes the same. But neurons sometimes release different neurotransmitters depending on the situation, meaning not all spikes are the same. Does this affect our interpretation of these studies? Are there models that account for this? Do spikes vary in any other way? </p>

<p>For example, knowing when a neuron is acting as excitatory versus inhibitory may vastly change our interpretation of it's role. </p>

<p>Additionally this may become even more of an issue when we attempt to model or predict from multiple channels as we are potentially missing out on a crucial piece of information. Without that, do we even have the ability to fully understand the area?</p>

<p>I found a couple of references to research that links ""thinking fast"" to mood lift:
<a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200711/mind-your-body-quick-fix"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Speed of thinking and mood lift</a> From what I've read so far on how the body/brain works, there are several examples of ""negative feedback"" to maintain homeostasis. This is the first example of something that can be considered ""positive feedback"", and it intrigues me.  </p>

<p><strong>I'm wondering what are the parts of a brain or neurotransmitters that are involved in ""thinking fast""?</strong> </p>

<p>-EDIT-</p>

<p><strong>To clarify the question</strong> - by thinking fast I mean engaging in a train of thought that is self-reinforcing, self sustained and directed. For example, thinking of a project at work, then of all the people who you can involve, then of all the improvements that can be made, of the outcome that can take place, of success, what you can do next, etc. </p>

<p>This kind of thinking pattern introduces numerous related targets for attention, and <strong>attention can quickly switch between trains of thought</strong>. At the same time, the majority of attention is occupied by a single idea or project that has multiple branching trains of thought associated with it. In poetic terms, the brain is weaving a pattern or a web of thought.</p>

<p>This creates a state where the brain cannot process the entire idea/project/concept at the same time, forcing it to ""think faster"", and do more switching between related branched trains of thought.</p>

"Is happiness a result of cognitive or a side effect of neurobiological processes?","<p>This morning I've heard this talk on Ted.com:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_killingsworth_want_to_be_happier_stay_in_the_moment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Matt Killingsworth: Want to be happier? Stay in the moment</a></p>

<p>The presenter is discussing an iPhone app used to track happiness, and <strong>seems to draw a conclusion that ""mind wandering"" is a related to much unhappiness</strong>, and that mind wandering is pervasive in 47% of his respondents. He also suggests that ""being in the present"" is tied to feeling happier.</p>

<p>His methods and graphs aside, I'm interested in this question:</p>

<p>Is ""mind wandering"" a thought pattern that arises naturally as a cognitive process, regardless of the brain biology? Or is it a biological marker, indicating the change of state of the persons biological homeostatic state? By Biological homeostatic state I mean neurotransmitter levels/binding, endocrine system state, etc.</p>

<p>For example, if a person is intoxicated with alcohol, then the person cannot help, but feel different, because of the foreign substance. <strong>I'm interested if there's any research indicating if different mental states, for example mind wandering, are caused by something that changes within the brain?</strong> </p>

<p>Because mind wandering is a rather vague subject, here's another thought process that has a very definitive effect on happiness: <strong>suicidal ideation</strong>. If a person is thinking of suicide, there's at least a chance that the person will follow through with the ideation, and from the quotes below, it seems that at least some victims were studied</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_receptor"" rel=""nofollow"">Serotonin receptors on wikipedia</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deceased <strong>suicidal</strong> and otherwise <strong>depressed</strong> patients have had more
  <strong>5-HT2A</strong> receptors than normal patients. These findings suggest that
  post-synaptic 5-HT2A overdensity is involved in the pathogenesis of
  depression.[4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another one: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many human polymorphisms have been identified influencing the
  expression of <strong>5-HT2C</strong>. <strong>Significant correlations</strong> are suggested,
  specifically in relation to psychiatric disorders such as <strong>depression</strong>,
  OCD, and anxiety-related conditions. Polymorphisms also correlate with
  susceptibility to a number of conditions including drug abuse and
  obesity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading this, it seems plausible that suicidal ideation, as a thought process, is at least partially related to the Serotonin(5HT) receptors 2A and 2C. As such, is it plausible to say that suicidal ideation is a biological marker of depression, just as mind wandering may be a biological marker of unhappiness?</p>

"Does introducing an element of play, hunt, or competition make feeding more rewarding?","<p>I have limited experience feeding wildlife, and while it's fun to watch and I'm sure fun for the wildlife too, I'm interested in just how much fun.  Is there's any noticeable difference in the following scenarios?</p>

<ul>
<li>Scenario A: a bird <strong>is given a ""pile"" of food</strong>, and can eat it at any pace.</li>
<li>Scenario B: an element of play or competition is introduced. The bird
has to seek out seeds that are <strong>scattered on the ground</strong>, or has to compete with other birds. Alternatively, a challenging bird feeder is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result is that there's <strong>enough food to satiate the bird in either case</strong>. It seems that in scenario B, it would take longer for the bird to get full. In scenario B, the bird has to hop from one cluster of seeds to the next, picking out the ones that the bird wants. There may be additional birds, also competing for the tastiest seeds. Alternatively, the bird has to balance on the birdfeeder, and coordinate precise movements to retrieve a seed from the feeder.</p>

<p>If the bird is observed over the next X minutes or hours following the feeding, <strong>is there any noticeable difference in the overall demeanor, activity pattern, etc., between the two scenarios?</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE: I originally thought that this question does not apply to humans - we all sit at a table and eat meals from dishes, etc. I couldn't ask a question about kids throwing pie, which is what I thought of when I think ""play with food"". But this evening, as I was deseeding a pomegranate, I realized that <strong>humans may like ""Playing"" with difficult fruit too</strong> </p>

<li>Citrus (oranges/grapefruit)</li>
<li>Pineapple</li>
</ul>

<p>Getting to the best parts of these fruit can be turned into a game too. For example, deseeding pomegranate can be done with the minimum amount of juice splashing, while an orange peel can be removed in many ways as well.</p>

<p>The scenarios above can be modified to be easily applicable to humans too:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Given unlimited supply of whole pomegranates to deseed</li>
<li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> Given an unlimited supply of pomegranate seeds on a plate</li>

"How does the mind build a model of reality?","<p>I'm interested if there has been any research or experiments that deal with <strong>how the human mind creates and perpetuates the idea of knowing something</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm struggling to concisely express the question, so a roundabout explanation is in order. I'm thinking of the succession of frameworks that explained how the world works to a layman:</p>

<ul>
<li>ancient pagan religions, which explained the reality in terms of the complicated interaction of spirits and forces of nature.</li>
<li>Then came monotheistic religions which once again have attempted to explain the world. </li>
<li>Somewhere in between there have been many forms of philosophy</li>
<li>Then came a myriad of scientific models which are erected in all
domains of science:from biology to psychology, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each one of these frameworks attempts to explain the world. Each one has been at the cutting edge of thought at the time.  Yet it seems to me that even the most accomplished physicist(the pinnacle of modern knowledge?) may still live with a patchwork of a world model, because said physicist may not be as well versed in neurobiology or some other ""arcane"" domain of science.</p>

<p>It seems to me that in this chain of succession, because knowledge is preserved, most of the successive models incorporate at least bits and pieces of the previous models. <strong>Do individuals build their own models of reality from whatever knowledge is available to their minds?</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ROgpW.png"" alt=""Ptolemaic system""></p>

<p>In the example above (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noesis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from Nous on wikipedia</a>), the model is neatly created from the understanding that was available to the medieval mind. I'm interested if this kind of tendency to ""fill in the holes"" and <strong>present a finite understanding of a infinitely(?) complex reality as complete</strong> is a natural part of how the human mind works.</p>

<p>For example, would the contemporary physicist's model of reality be primarily shaped by the knowledge of physics, with other knowledge ""filling in the holes""?  I know that there are such things as cognitive biases and follies of thought, are these the mechanisms by which the model of the world is shaped?</p>

"How does language change the understanding of a complex concept?","<p>For example, does breaking down a complex concept, initially described with scientific and uncommon terms, into less complex language degrade the understanding of the concept or can it maintain all it's relations and objects?

<p>Another way to look at the question is can certain thoughts exist without specific words to wrap them in, or are some thoughts dependent on the vocabulary/language? </p>

<p>If so, does this imply that new words can lead to new concepts that have never been produced and shared by others? For example, in George Orwell's novel ""<strong><em>1984</em></strong>"" the government introduces a new language called ""Newspeak"" that must be spoken by all citizens.

<p>For example:
Have you ever seen a <strong>businessman</strong> or an office worker walk? <strong>They walk with a purpose</strong>, quite energetically with the body slightly inclined forward. Is it feasible to say that when such walk is observed, the person is going somewhere, and may be tense?</p>

<p>A <strong>child</strong> may be running around with arms in the air, along an irregular path. Can it be said that such child is energetic and excited at that moment?</p>

<p>Two <strong>elderly</strong> people may walk very differently. One couple walks at a regular pace of 3-4mph, while another couple may push one foot in front of the other at 0.5 mph. Can this tell us anything about the differences in the mental activity that takes place within these people?</p>

<p>A person may be <strong>strolling slowly</strong> at &lt;1mph, observing the environment. Can it be said that such person is calm?</p>

I am interested in more systematic studies of this in modern human society under more extended time-frames than reactions to disaster.</p>

<p><a href=""http://evoanth.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/humans-apes-and-monkeys-share-food-for-the-same-reasons/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In monkeys, apes, and primitive human societies</a>, a typical measure of cooperation and mutual aid is food sharing (Jaeggi &amp; Gurven, 2013). I am interested in seeing studies like this that use naturalistic measures like this, instead of <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/q/1548/29"">artificial games</a> like dictator or ultimatum (even though these do provide interesting economic and anthropological results at times; Henrich et al., 2001).</p>

<p>One of the few truly austere environments remaining in Western society is the plight of the homeless. For example, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (1999) has found that 28% of homeless people nationwide sometimes or often do not get enough to eat (compared with 12% for the poor), 20% eat one meal a day or less, and 40% reported that they went one or more days in the last 30 days without anything to eat (compared to 3% for the poor). </p>

<p>Yet, consistent with the Kropotkin's views, anecdotal evidence (i.e. what I hear from friends that have been run aways, and from the occasional homeless that I have a chance to talk to) suggests that food sharing is common among the homeless. As a highlight, here is an <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/cogsci/comments/24cwnn/what_tasks_does_bayesian_decisionmaking_model/ch6qdq5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anecdote I encountered recently of reddit</a> (empasis added by me):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is why I, as a homeless person, gets <strong>offered more food from other homeless people than from wealthier people I come in contact with</strong>. This holds even though there is no pity parties among the homeless, and many food sharers will stab your back in a heartbeat if they perceive longer term gains. Or, in some cases, when more primal needs are at stake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This brings me to my questions: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How common is food sharing among the homeless?</strong></li>
<li>Is it primarily driven by empathy/egalitarianism, reciprocity, tolerated theft, or other mechanisms?</li>
<li>How does it compare to rates of food sharing in modern hunter-gatherer societies? </li>
</ul>

<p>I am more interested in anthropological studies done in western populations and developed countries, especially big urban centers, but comparisons to homeless populations in developing countries is of interest as well. I also prefer academic studies instead of governmental/activist ones, since the latter tend to have a policy bias; but I'll take what I can get!</p>

"Can a person's susceptibility to hypnosis be altered?","<p>It is commonly quoted in popular literature that 10% of people are ""highly hypnotizable"". Given a set of 10 suggestions, such people would have 7 or more suggestions become active. On the other end of the spectrum, there are people who are very hard to hypnotize and will have 0 out of 10 suggestions become active. Everyone else falls somewhere in between.</p>

<p><strong>I'm interested if the person's susceptibility to hypnosis can be altered?</strong> Can a person who would previously respond to 7/10 suggestions be made to respond to 1/10, thus becoming hard to hypnotize (or vice versa)?</p>

<p>If so, what is the mechanism behind such change - is it localized to some brain area? </p>

"How to design an experiment to measure coffee preferences?","<p>Imagine a population of people in an office environment.  There is a small war going on about whether <em>this</em> brand of coffee machine is better than <em>that</em> one.</p>

<p>How would you go about testing which coffee maker is truly most preferred?</p>

<p>My current plan is to take 10 people out of that population and make them each drink two cups of coffee, one made by each machine.  People will be given the choice of preparation styles for their individual trial, black, milk, sugar, or both.  Both cups will be made in the exact same way for that individual trial.  Whether a given cup will have coffee from machine ""A"" or ""B"" will be randomized to avoid people's preference for their first taste being taken into account.  Neither the participants, nor the administrator of the test will know which cup was made with which machine, to avoid unconscious biases.  Lastly, each participant will be independent of each other to avoid a bias forming from everyone else choosing a particular cup.  (Though the randomized nature of the study should make this a moot issue, but still.)</p>

<p>Is there anything I'm forgetting to make this a more perfect study?  I would love to have a larger sample than 10, but alas, that's not an option.  Also, I'm worried that allowing people to choose how their coffee will be prepared will skew the results, but as long as both cups within a trial are made the same way, it shouldn't be a problem, right?</p>

"Alternatives to ""Honest Signals"" theory of non-semantic communication","<h1>Intro</h1>

<p>In ""<a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/honest-signals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Honest Signals: How They Shape Our World</a>"" and the related publications ""<a href=""http://hd.media.mit.edu/Sloan%20Management%20Review%20Honest%20Signals.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Understanding 'Honest Signals' in Business</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9305/efad1aff133fd5b279ae1de7b39bfbd5618d.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Social Dynamics: Signals and Behavior</a>"", Alex Petland puts forth the idea that non-semantic communication (communication we do without explicitly representing thoughts using words/drawings, such as our gestures or aspects of our voice) falls into the following four types.</p>

<h1>Types of Non-Semantic Communication</h1>

<h2>1. Consistency/Variance/Stress/Emphasis</h2>

<p>Jerky, uneven motions indicate many different thoughts indicating openness to influence. Consistent emphasis and timing indicates mental focus.</p>

<h2>2. Mimicry/Mirroring/Imitation</h2>

<p>How much the social patterns of each participant match. Correlates with trust. Verbally this is measured by sub-second utterances (""Uh-huh"") and exchanges built on these utterances (""OK?"", ""OK!"", ""Done?"", ""Yup."").</p>

<h2>3. Engagement/Influence</h2>

<p>The amount one forces or cedes their social patterns to another. Could also be considered as who's driving the conversation.</p>

<h2>4. Activity level</h2>

<p>Describes how much energy in general is being expended in the interaction. Verbally, this can be considered by the ratio of silence to exclamations.</p>

<p>He then applies these four concepts to analyse various scenarios (speed dating, negotiation) and demonstrates their predictive power.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>Do other theories or frameworks exist with an alternative interpretation of non-semantic communication while still having the same predictive power? </p>

"What experiment in a simple decision task should we run to obtain one million trials?","<p><strong>Context</strong>: Models of cognitive processes require very large datasets to be fitted. Sadly, it is difficult for a single laboratory to achieve this alone. I propose that we work collectively and collaboratively in realizing a 1 million RT experiment. This initiative is described on my ResearchGate page, <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/project/The-1-Million-RT-initiative"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Cousineau</a>. </p>

<p>Beyond model fitting, such a dataset will be beneficial for other purposes. Examples: Are parameters describing performances normally distributed across subjects? Does training effect --resulting in faster RT-- imply that the parameters are all evolving in one direction? Does Bayesian estimation more apt than Maximum Likelihood at characterizing the parameters? How can we estimate non-decision times? What is the shape of the RT distributions and how training effect alter its shape? In Bayes again, after how many trials does priors have no longer an impact on the estimates? etc.</p>

<p><strong>Task Requirements:</strong>
The task must be behavioral only (response times and response choices) as it is not possible to move EEG or fMRI material all around the world. The precise task used is not a critical constraint because the current models of cognition (sampling models such as LBA or Diffusion) are very flexible; they aim at predicting performance in a wide variety of situations.  </p>

<p>The tasks proposed will be evaluated based on the following criteria criteria: </p>

<ul>
<li>small number of response alternatives</li>
<li>few conditions</li>
<li>low error rates</li>
<li>stimuli that can be characterized for modeling purposes</li>
<li>possibility of extended training on that task. </li>
</ul>

<p>Possible candidate tasks could include: A redundant target detection task (Miller, 1982) or a same-different task (e.g., Bamber, 1969). These tasks are simple and accuracy is typically high (above 90% correct); they are possibly performed using some form of parallel processing; response times are generally well below 700 ms.</p>

<p>So in summary:</p>

<p><strong>What task and experimental design would be most suitable given the above constraints?</strong></p>

"Syncing up CPT device with EEG recording","<p>I'm working on setting up an EEG experiment that will be going through a battery of various cognitive tasks. One of the tests is a Continuous Performance Task and to conduct that we'll be using a dedicated device(QikTest) that runs the test while disconnected from the stimulus computer, then is connected to get results. From there the program does an automatic analysis based on the performance and EEG results.</p>

<p>Since there is no means of automatically marking the task onset in our EEG recording at the time of the trial, the current plan is to use a video recording that contains the beginning of both EEG recording and CPT task to align the proper start time based on audio/visual cues of both for analysis. Our camera operates at 60fps so frame-to-frame is about 17ms, is this going to be a sufficiently small window to sync the data properly to capture the relevant ERP data in the EEG recording? If not would an audio recording at a higher sampling rate be sufficient(both starts have well identifiable audio cues)?</p>

<p>Edit(In response to Robin's comment below): Based on previous research we'll likely be looking for ERPs in the 200-500ms window for this and the other tasks.</p>

"Labeling and discrimination","<p>I recently saw a video (unfortunately can't remember where), where someone claimed that the use of labels to identify social groups produced or increased prejudice. So the labels of nationality, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc. influence the perception of such groups by others, and result in segregation and discrimination rather than a desired effect of acceptance or unification. </p>

<p>I believe the context is described as ""identity politics"", where social groups label themselves, or are labeled, in an attempt to promote awareness of their social status / plight / cause, etc.  My impression was that the labels promote an ""us vs. them"" mindset, potentially by reinforcing differences rather than shared traits. (Tribalism?)</p>

<p>Does this theory regarding the 'negative' consequences of the use of labels have a name? </p>

<p>Are there studies demonstrating such behavior?  </p>

<p>I found the term ""labels"" used in the context of symbolic interactionism, but the articles I've found so far seem to describe that as the tendency of a person to act in a way that conforms to the label (e.g. a person labeled as ""deviant"" will adopt behavior to meet the definition of the term).  I'm interested in how the self-adoption of a label by a group may produce a negative perception or separation / isolation of the group, such as producing discrimination that might not otherwise occur.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I saw this discussion of ingroup / outgroup behavior, which sounds relevant. Are labels one mechanism by which ingroup / outgroup associations developed?  Is the discrimination a reliable / consistent result of identifying people as outgroup?</p>

"Can we truly random choose which finger to raise by counting to 10 in your mind?","<p>If a test person is asked to raise one of his 10 fingers at a given signal, is the choice truly random if he counts in his mind from 1 to 10 and associates with each number one of his fingers? The 1 he associates with the left pink, the 2 with his left ring finger, 3 with his left middle finger, etc. So the test person starts to count, the experimenter gives him a signal, after which the test person raises the finger associated with the number he arrived at while counting. Let's suppose the signal is given at a random moment. Is the choice ""in sync"" with the random signal given?</p>

<p>In other words, if the experimenter records which finger is raised after each of a 1000 signals are given to a single person, will the experimenter see that each finger is raised the same number of times (more or less, because the number of signals given is finite; the more signals, the better you're getting at the real distribution)?

"Bias of finding others guilty of own shortcomings","<p>I haven't been in cognitive sciences for long, but in my work I have noticed a curious pattern: Individuals who overwhelmingly attribute the responsibility of their own actions to external causes, accuse others of behavioral patterns that represent the same patterns that they themselves do not accept to be guilty of.</p>

<p>Or maybe it's the other causal direction; they see others being guilty of certain behavioral patterns and subconsciously start behaving in the same ways.</p>

<p>For example: A patient who sees sexual predators in most men, sometimes in very subtle behavioral traits, accuses her partners of not respecting her decisions, of reversal of guilt, etc. However in the process of the accusation, she is unable to accept her partners' decisions (""He doesn't want to continue the relationship, but he doesn't care that I want to""), is uncompromising (Does not accept to establish a basis of communication) and blames them for her lack of communication (""I should not have to always be able to show you what I don't want, it is your responsibility to know.""). </p>

"Establishing personality from shape AND color preferences","<p>There are many resources on the web that discuss <strong>correlations between the personality of an individual and their preferred shapes or colors</strong>.  To give just one example of each</p>

</ol>

<p>My questions here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The second of the two links above is from an academic source.  Are there extended experimental, peer-reviewed, studies that establish the validity of such correlations?</li>
<li>From my own empirical observations I know that such correlations do indeed work though they are not not quite as clear cut as these articles make them out to be.  Are there any studies that look at both color and shape preferences at the same time?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I have found that one very good use to combine shape + color preferences is to weed out deliberately misleading responses.  Take the following example</p>

<ul>
<li>We have the shapes - square, circle, triangle and squiggle</li>
<li>we have the colors - red, yellow, orange, green, blue, white and black</li>
</ul>

<p>Interpolating between the ideas proposed in the two links I have quoted above a ""Triangle"" personality is far more likely to be a ""Red"", ""Orange"" or ""Yellow"" personality than say a ""Blue"" one.  This could be used to assign a weighting to user responses in order to reduce the likelihood of invalid conclusions being drawn from deliberately misleading responses to the ""my favorite shape"" question.</p>

<p>Sounds plausible but once again I would like to know if there is any published research on the subject.</p>

"How many items in a list can a human create without repetition?","<p>Consider the question ""Name as many animals as you can.""</p>

<p>The theory would suggest that as soon as we got to animal 10 we would start repeating the same animals without realising it. Whereas of this is plainly not what a person does. We sort of know ""I've already said that one"". Even though we wouldn't be able to repeat the whole list back.</p>

"How do Terence Tao's ""three stages of rigorousness"" relate to cognitive science?","<p>This is an excerpt from <a href=""https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">There’s more to mathematics than rigour and proofs</a> of Terrence Tao:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>The “pre-rigorous” stage, in which mathematics is taught in an informal, intuitive manner, based on examples, fuzzy notions, and hand-waving. The emphasis is more on computation than on theory. This stage generally lasts until the early undergraduate years.</p></li>
  <li><p>The “rigorous” stage, in which one is now taught that in order to do maths “properly”, one needs to work and think in a much more precise and formal manner. The emphasis is now primarily on theory; and one is expected to be able to comfortably manipulate abstract mathematical objects without focusing too much on what such objects actually “mean”. This stage usually occupies the later undergraduate and early graduate years.</p></li>
  <li><p>The “post-rigorous” stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all the rigorous foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit and refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous theory. The emphasis is now on applications, intuition, and the “big picture”. This stage usually occupies the late graduate years and beyond.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this have any stance in the context of cognitive science? <a href=""https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/questions/13955/why-do-the-stages-of-rigorousness-have-specific-timestamps/13958?noredirect=1#comment34721_13958"">A comment</a> in Mathematics Education says that this idea can't be broaden in other fields/jobs in any level of academic, since:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tao is using the word rigor in a way that's fairly narrow and specific to math. Namely, rigor means proving every statement one makes or uses, in full detail, from some list of axioms. One cannot rigorously work on cars, any more than one can rigorously eat one's dinner. It also does not make sense to talk about ""post-rigorous"" in the context of solving geometry exercises, because ""rigorous"" doesn't mean being good at something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I still don't understand this. Sure, it does not make sense to say ""eat dinner rigorously"", but it is possible for a good cook to know the hidden ingredients, the recipe or the taste of it by just looking and smelling the food, and I think this is equivalent to ""proving every statement one makes or uses, in full detail, from some list of axioms"".</p>

<li>Non practise elements. Are there things that can be done outside of practising that help, e.g. visualisation? other exercises?</li>

Why from outside brain is full neurons , but when it's inside you , it starts to create mind, visions, hearing etc etc.How neurons also know that a fire is hot and an ice is cold? How it process information?
We know about how our sensory organs , muscles, stomach , heart work .What is their physical structure etc. But when they are inside our body, we don't even know they exist. For example, we know objectively how sound travels from outer ear to our brain and brain interprets ,which results into our sound perception .But as a subject, we don't even know about their existence let alone their functions .Why same thing which is perceived from outside is so different from when that very thing is inside you ? These are two different worlds ,one is objective (from outside) another is subjective (from inside or first hand experience) .
Between these two which is true? 
Scientists can say you are hearing because of all that neurons firing and all. But a common person who never heard about neurons , will not trust those words of the scientists . Because from their point of view , they will say , they are having a sound perception through ear and mind .
So in this case, he is also right that only mind exists but no neurons exist .Please clear this confusion .
I think this should be the base of biological sciences .But they never mentioned this anywhere in the books .</p>

"Could human decision making have evolved from food finding?","<p>One of the things human's do (and possibly other animals) is consider various options, imagine what they would be like, and then make a choice. This is called a ""tree search"". For example, ""should I take the job offer A or B""?</p>

<p>Now, I wonder if this abstract decision making, may have evolved from food finding. And what is the smallest animal that does this sort of thing?</p>

<p>For example, imagine a small monkey or squirrel climbing a tree. When it gets to a branch it has a choice of taking the left branch or the right branch. It has to guess which branch is likely to lead to the best crop of fruit.</p>

<p>Once it has got fruit from one branch it may have to retrace its steps to get to the next branch. </p>

<p>So I would suggest that this sort of ""tree search"" would probably have evolved in mammals brain before humans repurposed these brain pathways to do more abstract decision making involving language.</p>

<p>I am trying to think of other animals that this would apply to. For example a rabbit may have a choice between branching tunnels.</p>

<p>A bear might have a choice of paths up a mountain and so on. </p>

<p>Rats are good maze finder so they must have this ability to make choices.</p>

<p>I wonder what other animals do this sort of thing? Rather than making a choice at random? It would have to be an animal at least as advanced enough to have a memory.</p>

"Understanding the 'Wiring Catastrophe'","<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>In 'Wiring optimization in the brain'(2000), Dmitri Chklovskii and Charles Stevens
analyse the dependence of the complexity of cortical circuits on the number of synapses per neuron using virtual perturbations. The authors clarify what they mean by a perturbation in their introduction: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To calculate the optimal wire fraction, we start with a real cortical region containing a fixed
  number of neurons, a mm cube, for example, and imagine perturbing it by adding or subtracting synapses and the axons and dendrites needed to support them. The rules for perturbing the cortical cube require that the existing circuit connections and function remain
  intact (except for what may have been removed in the perturbation), that no holes are created, and that all added (or subtracted) synapses are typical of those present; as wire volume
  is added, the volume of the cube of course increases.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting from a reasonable set of physiological relationships approximated as algebraic equations they derive a formula for <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span>, the ratio of the number of synapses per neuron in the perturbed cortex to that of the real cortex as a function of <span class=""math-container"">$\phi$</span>, the volume fraction of the perturbed cortical region made up of wires(synapses + dendrites), and <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span>, a constant that multiplies the length of wire associated with each synapse: </p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">\begin{equation}
\theta(\phi) = \frac{1}{\lambda^5} \cdot \Big(\frac{1-\phi}{1-\phi_0}\Big)^{\frac{2}{3}} \cdot \frac{\phi}{\phi_0} \tag{1}
\end{equation}</span></p>

<p>In the paper, <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda$</span> is assumed to be equal to <span class=""math-container"">$1.0$</span> and I must say that the authors explain the derivation clearly. It doesn't require more than highschool algebra and each assumption is carefully justified. By calculating <span class=""math-container"">$\frac{d\theta}{d\phi}$</span> you may then find that ,if <span class=""math-container"">$\lambda =1$</span>, <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> is maximal when <span class=""math-container"">$\phi = 0.6$</span>. This much makes sense to me but the authors then try to rationalise this value in a manner that appears to lack careful justification: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why does complexity reach a maximum value at a particular wire fraction? When wire and
  synapses are added, a series of consequences can lead to a runaway situation we call the
  wiring catastrophe...At this point(phi=0.6), adding wire becomes impossible without decreasing complexity or making
  other changes - like decreasing axon diameters - that alter cortical function. The physical
  cause of the catastrophe is a slow growth of conduction velocity and dendritic cable length
  with diameter combined with the requirement that the conduction times between synapses
  (and dendrite cable lengths) be unchanged in the perturbed cortex. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>The kind of justification that appears necessary to me concerns data on brain development. I understand that significant synaptic pruning occurs during adolescence so <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> should vary and I think this poses a significant challenge to the account given by Chklovskii and Stevens. More precisely, this variation isn't accounted for by variations in <span class=""math-container"">$\phi$</span> in their model so I have doubts concerning the temporal and causal validity of their model.  </p>

<p>To quantify the variation in <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> we may use numbers from <a href=""https://www.cs.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/deborah_sandoval.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">'Synaptic Pruning Mechanisms in Learning'</a> by Deborah Sandoval:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At infancy, each neuron averages around 2,500 synapses and at the peak
  of exuberant synaptogenesis (around 2-3 years of age) the number
  increases to around 15,000 (The University of Maine, 2001).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must add that I have spent some time googling 'Wiring Catastrophe' but this doesn't return anything besides the original paper by D. Chklovskii and C. Stevens. </p>

<p>These observations lead me to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>If equation (1) is not an exact relationship, how can the extremization(i.e. differentiation) procedure be justified within the context of applied mathematics? </li>
<li>Is there any biological evidence of runaway wiring catastrophes occurring in real brains? </li>
</ol>

<h2>Discussion:</h2>

<p>To clarify how synaptic pruning fits into the discussion we may associate a perturbation with a temporal variation in the number of synapses per neuron in the brain as follows:</p>

<p><span class=""math-container"">\begin{equation}
\theta(i \rightarrow f) = \frac{\langle \text{synapses}_{t=f}/\text{neuron}_{t=f} \rangle}{\langle \text{synapses}_{t=i}/\text{neuron}_{t=i} \rangle} \approx \frac{\sum \text{synapses}_{t=f}}{\sum \text{synapses}_{t=i}} \tag{2}
\end{equation}</span></p>

<p>since the number of neurons in the brain is approximately constant. My argument is essentially that significant variations in <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> aren't explained by the variations in <span class=""math-container"">$\phi$</span> which stands in contrast to the authors' assertion in their introduction that <em>the relation between relative complexity <span class=""math-container"">$\theta$</span> and wire volume fraction <span class=""math-container"">$\phi$</span></em> is given by equation (1).</p>

<h2>Addendum:</h2>

<p>I just received a pretty comprehensive reply from Charles Stevens via email. In particular, he advised me to read the final version of their paper: <em>Chklovskii, D.M., Schikorski, T., and Stevens, C.F. (2002) Wiring optimization in cortical circuits. Neuron 34:341-
347.</em> This is on my reading list for the day. </p>

<h2>Attribution of Nobleness</h2>

<p>Jake, a young man, is an athletic but wayward soul.  He encounters a decorated army veteran named Gabe who says ""I've been watching you for several days now lad, and I can tell you that in you is a greatness that is meant to be released.""  The subsequent conversation inspires Jake to join the military and, indeed, Jake subsequently has a stellar military career that proves Gabe was right!</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>I realize that not every dynamic has a specific name in psychology, but it troubles me that the overall phenomena I'm outlining isn't represented in public dialogue, particularly when it comes to politics.  I believe the nation is becoming increasingly polarized and hostile because ""attribution of despicability"" is counter-productively generating the wrong kind of zealotry and thus ever-deepening unproductive contrasts. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>""You leftists just want to destroy democracy""</strong>.  Well, the ""leftist"" did not have an opinion about democracy before the accusation, but due to the judgmental accusation...the leftist began to study and embrace arguments of why democracy is evil.</li>
<li><strong>""You rightists just want to subjugate minorities""</strong>.  Well the ""rightest"" who had no particular sentiment before now adopts a passive-aggressive attitude about those who claim to support minorities and perhaps against minorities as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, both positive and negative accusation(s) have a catalytic or causal power.  Seen this way, in the case of negative accusations which we use to judge and condemn, the reality is that ""we have met the enemy, and it is ourselves.""  </p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised if psychology has two names which treat both the ""attribution of nobleness"" and the ""attribution of despicability"" as two different things, even though I see them as flip-sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

"Is it possible for a ""false positive"" medical diagnosis to be voided or expunged later?","<p>In general, if a diagnosing clinician makes a grave error in diagnosis, is it possible to later invalidate the diagnosis on the basis of insufficiency, lack of evidence, poor judgment, or other similar reason?</p>

<p>For example, if someone accidentally ended up in a situation where he/she was diagnosed with a mental disorder according to the DSM, but the symptoms according to the DSM do not correspond at all to reality (For example, at least the main symptoms are missing, the study admission was less then the official time needed to diagnose someone with a specific disorder, or a similar reason), can the diagnosis be fully expunged from their medical record upon a sufficient showing of such insufficiency?</p>

<p>I'm not asking about getting a second opinion, refusing treatment, or getting a discharge from treatment - I'm asking about fully eradicating or expunging a diagnosis to the point where it never really ""existed"" <em>at all</em> in a medical or medicolegal sense. In the practice of law, a legal judgment, order, or document can often be ""voided"", ""vacated"", ""quashed"", ""overturned"" or ""invalidated"" by a court if it is shown to have been issued in error. Is there any similar thing in the practice of medicine?</p>

<p>This sort of question is, perhaps, not very interesting or relevant for the majority of patients, but it can be <em>very</em> relevant for persons who must undergo formal ""fitness for duty"" evaluations or must ""pass"" medical background checks. For example, someone aspiring to become a pilot who has a history of treatment for schizophrenia, but is currently ""ok"", must normally undergo a grueling, time consuming, and expensive evaluation process. If such a person could get some sort of medical evaluation stating that they never really ""had"" schizophrenia to begin with, that could allow them to answer ""no"" on the applicable medical background check forms and obtain licensure that much more easily. This question may also be relevant to victims of gaslighting - if a person was given a clinical ""label"" as a result of abuse inflicted upon them, removing the ""stigma"" of having the ""label"" may be a valuable form of healing even if the person doesn't have any pressing <em>legal</em> need to have the diagnosis <em>formally</em> removed.</p>

Now, supervised deep learning methods usually require large amounts of data to succeed. (I know this based on experience in industry as well as the deep learning literature.)

"What regulates the strength of motor signals?","<p>I've seen cognitive and robot models where the input signals from the sensors are directly used as the signal for outgoing motor control. </p>

<p>This doesn't make much sense, because obviously we're able to do heavy work with our muscles quite independently from the strength of incoming signals from our sensor systems. However when I consulted several books on general cognition, I wasn't able to discover the source of these arbitrarily strong signals - I'd suspect the thalamus. </p>

<p>I wonder how you could perform a task, <em>e.g.</em> playing a piano, by applying weak or strong force. Both the plan (how to move the fingers) and the feedback (how it sounds) signal would remain the same.</p>

<p>So <strong>where does the signal for motor behavior originate, and more importantly what (or who) regulates its strength? Where does the extra energy come from?</strong></p>

"How repeatable are cognitive science findings within the same individual?","<p>Thanks to this website, I've seen a number of papers and scholarly articles that deal with cognition. I'm interested in how repeatable the findings are that are discovered as a result of experiments.</p>

<p>For example, <strong>when a mechanical system is tested</strong>, it is tested to work the same way every single time:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lock opens and closes when a key is turned.</li>
<li>A car door opens up to the maximum degree allowed by design.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How much is a cognitive system like a mechanical system?</strong> Will it work the same way every time?</p>

<p>For example, I'm thinking about the design of an experiment I've been reading about: <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/download.aspx?name=11-091.pdf"">The Ikea Effect Experiment</a>. Volunteers are asked to assemble Ikea boxes and bid on the box after assembly. The experiment shows that people value things they built themselves more than things that are just offered to them.</p>

<p>Now if the machine-like definition of repeatability is applied to this experiment: Would test subjects value boxes they built themselves next time they do an experiment? How about next month? What about in 3 years? Would people in the 1940's have the same response?</p>

<p>Have there been any studies that deal with this ""repeatability"" question? For example, <strong>studies that used the same test subjects doing the same experiment multiple times?</strong></p>
"
"Are there professional cognitive science test subjects?","<p>I'm interested in how cognitive science experiments are designed and executed. Up until now, all of the papers I've seen dealing with cognition use <strong>availability of test subjects</strong> as one of the major factors of recruitment for experiments. For example, students are recruited for an experiment, and because the group is so <strong>diverse, they are tested on general skills</strong> that the entire group would possess, like reading or math. </p>

<p>For example, consider this experiment: <a href=""http://www.voxeu.org/article/does-happiness-affect-productivity"">""Happiness economics"" in reverse: Does happiness affect productivity?</a> There were 276 university students and faculty involved. The students are tested with a math task.</p>

<p>Math and reading comprehension are general skills, and I can think of few people who earn their living with those skills, aside from SAT tutors.</p>

<p>I'm interested if there have been other types of cognitive experiments tried, where the <strong>skills used to evaluate experiment are at a ""professional"" level.</strong> For example professional athletes, soldiers or pilots come to mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>Experiments that use scoring percentage as a metric for basketball players</li>
<li>Experiments that use marksmanship grouping as a metric</li>
<li>Professional video game players</li>

<p>So, you compare them both to your favorite painting (C), which you know you really like to look at (adjusting for novelty). </p>

<p>In order to do this, you vary the size of your favorite painting C on a computer screen (or its distance from you in real life), and find the point at which C is so much smaller that you'd rather look at A. You do the same for painting B. </p>

<p>You then attempt to quantify how much you prefer A to B by asking: for which painting (A or B) was C larger when you first preferred to look at that painting rather than C? This is the one that you prefer more, and the distance between the C ""breakpoints"" gives some measure of your relative preference. </p>

"Why people choose ""boring"" colors for new cars?","<p>I've been interested in this question for a few years, sorry if this is not the right place to ask it.</p>

<p>As I've been driving around the US for the last few years, I noticed that some community parking lots ""lack color"" - the vehicles can be defined as colorless - they are white, black, various shades of gray or beige. Yet I've seen several new car catalogs and see that most cars come in several colors.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see this ""lack of color"" again and again, so I googled it, and found that the trend is not just in America, but worldwide: </p>

<p>This is interesting, because <strong>I've never ever heard of white, silver or black being called people's favorite color</strong>. Most search results point to ""blue"" being the favorite color (at least in the United States) for English search results.</p>

<p>This begs the question: <strong>Why do people go for boring/conservate exterior car colors, like white or silver when buying a new car, instead of choosing their favorite color?</strong></p>

<p>Here are my wild guesses, and it would be great to debunk them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this due to conformity, resale value, or an attempt to stand out
less on a highway?</li>
<li>Is this because a car is big enough to be seen with rods in the eye?</li>
<li>Or do people see their cars as just another ""appliance"", like a
toaster, microwave or a fridge, and pick a color similar to what they
see in their kitchen?</li>

"Does adopting personal routines accelerate cognitive decline?","<p>Many people tend to automate many mundane daily tasks by adhering to a proven routine that works and that can be equivalent to a computer script with the person implementing it being equivalent to a computer.  There are many benefits for that in that, just like there are benefits to computing automation, most notably it allows us to live efficiently and spare our mental energies for tasks that cannot be or have not yet been automated yet.</p>

<p>But I am curious if there are cognitive studies that associate adherence to routine to cognitive decline.  I can imaging that, if you were doing a lot of daily tasks in the same way over and over again, you may lose your cognitive processing edge.  This is just an unconfirmed observation so I am reaching out to the community of experts (of whom I am not one) to see if there are studies about it.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, I can also see how personal routines and daily automation are an earmark of highly intelligent people who are capable of seeing patterns between two separate instances of a similar task.  But can a side effect (automation) of that initial favorable cognitive state (IQ) lead to lowered cognition as a matter of lessened daily mental workout?  In other words, can you become dull if you do things more routinely?</p>

"Neurophysiological mappings of empathy","<p>What biologically plausible models are there of empathy?</p>

<p>I know there has been a significant amount of work in defining emotion on a neurophysiological basis using models (I'm currently reading ""<a href=""http://cogsci.uwaterloo.ca/Articles/thagard-schroeder.emotions-pointers.2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Emotions as semantic pointers: Constructive neural mechanisms</a>"" by Thaghard et al. about using the Semantic Pointer Architecture as a basis for emotions). However, I'm having a hard time finding models that define emotions on a neurophysiological basis in relation to other social agents. Do they exist?</p>

<p>When I'm discussing empathy, I'm referring to the phenomena's of affective empathy, cognitive empathy and emotional contagion.</p>

"How are real life events translated into dream symbolism?","<p>I'm interested in <strong>how significant events from daily life get encoded or translated into dream content</strong>. A personal observation can help clarify my question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've observed that for me, ""significant, futile mental effort""
  translates into dreams of me being in a classroom in my old middle
  school. The kind of mental effort dictated which classroom I will see
  - history, language or math.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took me years to make the connection, as the frequency of the dream was rather high while attending school and college. It is only after I started working that I noticed dreams of classrooms were gone and only reappeared following intense, but perceived as pointless mental effort to learn or grasp or produce something. </p>

<p>I'm familiar with the Freud's theories on how wish fulfillment and repressed sexual desires show up in dreams. On the other hand I'm aware of the much discredited concept of ""dream interpretation"" with dictionaries of dream symbols.</p>

<p>Have there been studies that lay in between the two extremes listed above and <strong>attempted to elicit connections between daily events and how they appear in dreams?</strong> Maybe attempts to create personal dream dictionaries, like the one I described in the example?</p>

"Where to publish a short (mathematical) neuroscience article?","<p>I am writing an article about a computational method, which is relatively widely used in a small subfield of neuroscience (it is easy to identify ~20 recent articles that used it in 2013-2015).</p>

<p>The results I have are a set of small improvements but interesting anyway (at least in my opinion), so the paper will be a short one, perhaps around 2000 words (+ 1 or 2 figures and about 30 references). The results are purely mathematical; no data was collected.</p>

<p>Where could I publish my findings? I feel the upper-tier journals (with impact factors > 5 or so) might not be interested since the paper is so short (their typical paper lengths are 10+ pages).

"Why do many people play Candy Crush without ever buying anything while some spend all their money on it?","<p>I'm trying to understand how free-to-play games like Candy Crush Saga use existing knowledge of the human brain to keep people engaged and how they convince players to pay money for in-game goods. Some of their game mechanics remind me of the Skinner box. Interestingly, some sources <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/26/only-0-15-of-mobile-gamers-account-for-50-percent-of-all-in-game-revenue-exclusive/"">claim</a> that a very small percentage of players contribute 50% of their revenue. I'm assuming this is because not everyone is as susceptible to their monetization tricks. Some <a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/195806/chasing_the_whale_examining_the_.php?print=1"">addicted players</a> dump all their money into the game, which puts pressure on game developers to protect vulnerable customers from themselves.</p>

<p>Research on big spenders in free-to-play games seems to be scarce, but are there any parallels with existing research (e.g. on gambling) that explain why many people will never spend a dime on these games while others are struggling not to spend their life savings on it? For example, is there a significant difference in how individuals respond to conditioning?</p>

"Grit — is it distinct from correlates of success?","<p>There's been quite a splash in the field of psychology around the  concept of <strong>grit</strong> introduced around 2007 (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article</a>). For example, <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the associated TED talk has been viewed more than 10 million times</a>.</p>

<p>Intuitively, the ideas make a lot of sense based on my own experience. While, based on the <a href=""https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?q=Grit%3A%20Perseverance%20and%20passion%20for%20long-term%20goals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1500+ citations in Google Scholar</a>, it's a new idea in the field of psychology too, not just a phenomenon in the realm of public understanding of science.</p>

<p>However, what I don't quite understand is which one of the following two things this development represents:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either a new shorthand word (""grit"") has been introduced for ""correlates of success"",</p></li>
<li><p>Or, <em>grit</em> is distinct from <em>correlates of success</em>, and represents a new, standalone, awareness.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Having a new word for an old thing can actually be quite important, as it gives a sort of a visual mnemonic to summarise the major components of the correlates of success. (If someone is ""gritty"", that says more to non-psychologists than saying that the person ""demonstrates traits correlated with success"".)</p>

<p>However, it would be even more important if this wasn't just a linguistic advance, but a conceptual one. But for that, it would be necessary to show that grit is a concept <em>distinct</em> to correlates of success. Well, at least it should be possible in principle to conduct a falsifiable experiment to study the distinction. For example, if under certain circumstances grit could in principle be shown to be significantly <em>negatively</em> correlated with success, consistently, whenever such circumstances arise, that would establish it as a distinct concept.</p>

<p>So, what would be a scenario, under which, hypothetically, grit would be anticorrelated with success? (I can't think of any: in my understanding, whatever is not correlated with success cannot be called ""grit"". Is this the accepted understanding of grit?)</p>

<p>If the person giving the question is seen as an authority or someone we want to please (or not displease) then we would decide to comply and answer the question.</p>

<p>Then we would somehow have to convert it into a small program such as the pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>DO:
  $X = FIND Z WHERE Z IS OF_TYPE ""ANIMAL""
  IF CHECK $X IS_TYPE ""ANIMAL"":
     SAY $X
  IF HEAR ""STOP"" THEN STOP
LOOP

<p>It's as if the simple desire to answer the question together with hearing the question (or perhaps saying it to one's self) is enough to trigger the answers to be recalled from long-term memory.</p>

<p>I don't consciously have to convert the question into any kind of ""brain programming language"". So if my brain is doing this, it's doing it automatically. (And perhaps sometimes wrongly, hence why something not an animal might pop into the brain.) </p>

In many fMRI studies like <a href=""http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/jnnp/76/1/11.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This Study</a> a voxel wise comparison is made across subjects and controls . As we know that  dataset in fMRI in the form of 3D matrix like <strong>Subjects  x TimePoints  x Voxels</strong>   that is on each person we have bunch of time points and on each time points we have voxel values as voxel is unit of measurement in bold signal in the brain that is brain is divided into small cubicle voxels.</p>

<p><strong>For Subjects:</strong>   15 x 200 x 5000</p>

<p><strong>For controls:</strong>     20 x 200 x 5000</p>

<p><strong>My specific question No.2</strong> is that how regions are compared between those two group like this has been done on page 2(13). </p>

<p><strong>My Understanding</strong></p>

<p>For question No.1 my understanding is that a single matrix is made for each group by reducing the person(subject/control) dimension that is we will have two 200 x500 matrices average over individuals in each matrix and then the voxel wise comparison will be made using t test in any two voxel as each voxel will have 200 time points.</p>

<p>For question No.2 my understanding is that for a typical brain area like ""Right thalamus"" A group of voxel called cluster like 147 as used in the paper is organized and then voxel vectors are formed for both groups averaged over individuals like out of 147 voxel vector a typical voxel vector will have 200 values and that will be compared.</p>

<p>But I'm confused about one thing. The whole point of reuptake is that after serotonin (or any other neurotransmitter) binds to the postsynaptic receptors, it has to vacate the receptor so that other signals can be conveyed.

"What does double dissociation really tell us?","<p>In psychological research, a single dissociation is when a manipulation leaves one cognitive function (say, A) intact whilst severing another (say, B). This indicates the functions A and B are at least partially independent. A double dissociation is when there exists, in addition, a manipulation that does the reverse (i.e. leave B intact whilst severing A). On the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(neuropsychology)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia page</a> for dissociation in neuropsychology/cognitive neuroscience (I'm assuming the ""manipulation"" is a brain lesion now) it says that ""establishing a single dissociation between two functions provides limited and potentially misleading information, whereas a double dissociation can conclusively demonstrate that the two functions are localized in different areas of the brain."" This can't really be true, can it? Consider the following Venn diagram, where the (necessary) neural substrate of A and B are represented, including their intersection: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ebs7v.gif"" alt=""Neural substrates of A and B""></p>

<p>A double dissociation could consist of a manipulation in A \ B and another in B \ A. The functions would still be partially dependent, however, and not localized in completely different areas of the brain. So, in effect, the only thing a single dissociation proves is that the circles for A and B are not identical, and the only thing a double dissociation proves (in addition to the fact that they're not identical) is that one is not a subset of the other. Is that about right? </p>

<p>On the other hand, studies by <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1231"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vockey and Read (1985)</a> challenged the effect of subliminal messages in songs and a meta-analysis carried out by Charles <a href=""https://ir.nctu.edu.tw/bitstream/11536/14246/1/A1996UZ40600005.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trappey (1996)</a> showed a negligible effect on consumer behavior. Also, what I get from most psychology textbooks is that the general consensus is that subliminal messaging has a poor and temporary effect <a href=""https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Psychology.html?id=-9x8dngFRe0C&amp;redir_esc=y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Schacter, Gilbert and Wegner, 2009)</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, one has to consider if subliminal perception is qualitatively and quantitatively different depending on the modality of the stimuli but then again I am unconvinced of a considerable effect of subliminal messaging on behaviour.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on that?</p>

<p><strong>Is there a default list of accepted answers to particular types of questions which are used by survey designers?</strong> e.g. ""Level of effect"", ""Amount you agree with"",  ""Make you act"" ""Level of Awareness"" type questions.</p>

<p>I accept that there is a huge range of types of questions but if there was some sort of semi standardised list of 5, 6 and 7 point answers it would be very handy. In many cases I have difficulty thinking of just one of the answers or the correct terminology or syntax which should be used to ensure that each of the answers are 'appropriately distributed'... if that makes sense</p>

<p>For many types of questions there are existing examples online e.g.</p>

  <li>Not so strong Republican</li>

"Annoyance in animals","<p>When my dog (an English Cocker Spaniel, for what its worth) is behind some glass (e.g. a glass door or a car window) and someone taps on the glass, even just a little bit, she gets into a fit of rage. She has always been treated quite well, so I can't imagine what causes her to behave like this.</p>

<p>The first thing that came to my mind is that she perceives whoever is tapping the glass as teasing her, and she feels disrespected, or something like that. This sounds far fetched, but could there be any merit to this theory? If not, what else would cause her to do this?</p>

I also feel a huge increase in euphoria in these very moments but I can't really tell whether this happens before or after I get the idea for a certain sound/melody.</p>

<p>Might it be that my creativity is ""blocked"" all day until my brain finally drops all obstacles which then makes way for my creative flow? Or is it that no new input needs to be processed as I lay in total darkness and silence and therefore new ""material"" to process isn't coming in which leads my brain to ""invent"" something?</p>

"Reconciling one-dimensional valence with distinct mechanisms for reward/punishment","<p>It is a widespread notion in psychology that there are two dimensions to emotion: valence (aversiveness or attractiveness of some entity) and intensity. However, recent experimental studies in neuropsychology (e.g. those listed below) have given strong evidence for two distinct pathways which process reward and punishment associated with some input. This in turn compellingly suggests that valence is in fact made up of two independent dimensions, and I'm guessing there are behavioral studies reaching similar conclusions (i.e. that persons are able to have ""mixed feelings""). How do we reconcile these views? Are we forced to reject one-dimensional valence on the basis of the evidence?</p>

"How to interpret a BBC news article on the effect of race on intelligence?","<blockquote>
  <p>In spring 1998, Robert Plomin claimed to have discovered a gene linked with intelligence. <strong>More recently, the Human Genome Project was cautious when approaching areas implying racial differences since research actually shows greater genetic differences within races than between races.</strong> However, not all individuals are endowed with the same intelligence and many believe this must have something to do with our genes and the way they interact with the environment. Identical twins are more likely to obtain the same score in an IQ test than twins from two separate eggs that have a different genetic make- up.</p>
  
  <p>It is important to remember that genes work by interacting with the environment, so social factors will also infl uence intelligence. Intelligence tests may be more of an assessment of social factors, such as your educational background. <strong>Black children adopted into white middle-class families score signifi cantly higher on average than those in working-class families – implying a cultural slant to tests.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My classmate thinks that this article suggests that race is suggested as determining intelligence, because race is mentioned several times in the article as being linked to intelligence, whether genetically or through social factors. 
 I want to check this before confronting her, but I think not. Who's right? </p>

<p>In my view, the first bolded sentence dismisses race as a determinant, because there are 'greater  genetic differences within' each race than between different races. </p>

<p>The second bolded sentence also rejects race, because it only shows a cultural slant to tests and the first sentence of the last para states 'social factors will also infl uence intelligence.' </p>

"Evolutionary motivation for the existence of pleasure?","<p>It seems like pleasure goes beyond needs. What is its purpose? Is it supposed to make you not do anything, because of how good you feel?
Are there animals that don't feel pleasure, but only have needs to satisfy, and how would their CNS differ from human/primate CNS?</p>

<p>My main question: What is the motivation for there being some sort of pleasure, as opposed to simply the absence of a certain need? In the case of an orgasm, why exactly does a person feel very good for a while - why doesn't he just go directly into a state of neutrality, with there no longer being a need for sex? If a person defecates, why is there a momentary pleasant feeling - why doesn't the person simply go into a 'no longer have the need to defecate' state?</p>

<p>It really seems that there is an unnecessarily large amount of pleasure, as opposed to a mere lack of need.</p>

<p>It seems like there are 2 mechanisms that motivate action - the need to satisfy an unfulfilled need, and the need to achieve a reward. Is this the case? If yes, what is useful about this? It seems like a the 'need to satisfy an unfulfilled need' by itself should be good enough.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>For example, we have an instinctive need to not feel like starving, or to not feel extremely tired - we simply don't want to feel that way. However with some things, it seems like there's more than just a need - with sex, there is a 'need' to have sex - a male who hasn't had sex for long enough, will simply want to have sex, so that he gets rid of the feeling of wanting sex - but there is also the motivation of expected pleasure from the orgasm. Similarly, I'd say that there is some sort of pleasure from food.</p>

<p>I think this is true (that there are 2 motivating factors, not just one), and I think that it's quite weird in some sense. Why isn't there just a need - why doesn't a male after sex simply stop having the need to have sex? I think I've read something about the pleasure having something to do with encouraging certain types of behavior, but I really don't know.</p>

<li>Or is it just some addiction to the hormones released via copulation?</li>

<p>If someone hits you over the head, knocking you unconsciousness (though still alive), then you're said to be unconscious. But are you also considered to be unconscious when you're sleeping?</p>

<p>One of the key differences (for me) is that a sleeping person can typically react to an alarm clock, whereas a person who has been rendered unconscious through an injury is effectively dead to the world.</p>

<p>If sleep is NOT a form of unconsciousness, what is it? Is a sleeping person still conscious, or is there another term to describe it?</p>

"Do eyes accommodate to color?","<p>I've heard that our eyes accommodate between colors too far from each other in the visible spectrum. I imagine it's not a true focal point accommodation, but rather linked with how brain processes the information. Is this true?</p>

<p>What I'm trying to find out is, whether using color for emphasis, for example both blue and yellow (which are fairly far from each other in the spectrum), for text underlining, doesn't make the brain focus only at one color at once. </p>

<p>Like when you're looking for some object on your messy table, thinking it's of blue color and not noticing it's right in front of your eyes, because it was red.</p>

<p>Another example would be a document with some emphasized words in blue, some in yellow - and let's say the author wanted to make sure both colors are regarded as important (just in different context). Now question is, can the eye/brain focus on both colors at once? I don't mean if we can do it deliberately by trying hard, but rather if it's more likely for the brain to focus only at one color at a time, unconsciously.</p>

<p>By what I've heard, if I understand it correctly. If we want to use two different colors for emphasis, we should use colors that are close to each other in the EM spectrum (while still making sure, they are high contrast in regard to the background)</p>

<p>Refer to the two paragraphs taken from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia</a> I stylized.</p>

<p>I'd summarize the question like this. Is there <strong>difference</strong> in how we regard those two paragraphs? Are we more likely to skip some words when they are highlighted with colors too far away from each other in the EM spectrum, therefore, is it better to use colors closer to each other?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I changed the luminance of the colors to be the same for all of them (70%, used <a href=""http://www.workwithcolor.com/hsl-color-picker-01.htm?cp=B08FFE&amp;ch=258-99-78&amp;cb=C8BB03,00DD59,B08FFE,FFFFFF,AC91FF,999DFE,76ABFF,FFFFFF,FFFFFF,FFFFFF"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HSL Color Picker</a>).

"Universal Mind? Nature or Nurture?","<p>I have been reading a book entitled ""The Geography of Thought"" by Richard Nisbett. He talks about how easterners and westerners think differently. I am not all the way through it, but I agree with a lot of his points, because he stresses no true biological differences between the two groups but instead suggests that the difference in cognitive processes takes place over time as a result of cultural factors or ""nurture"" rather than ""nature."" I am reading this book as a part of a class I am taking entitled ""perspectives on knowledge"". </p>

<p>To accompany this book, we are watching a video series entitled ""Brain Sex"" which talks about the effects of hormones on the developing brain and supports the hypotheses that Males and Females have different cognitive processes. (More specifically male and female BRAINS, as you can have a male brain in a female body or have a brain that is actually more like a hybrid between the two due to hormonal abnormalities) This would be a difference of nature that is accentuated through out life through nurture.</p>

<p>The problem is that this video series is a VHS and is over 20 years old. </p>

<p>I am wondering what science's view is on the universality of mind is today. My question can actually be summed up by a question my professor asked us to think about in class:  </p>

<p>""Do different people think differently, or is the mind universal. If people think differently, is this difference due primarily to nature or nurture?""</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> 
I have been developing my argument and I am going to defend my long term belief that people think differently, but after much thought I am torn as to where the <strong>primary</strong> cause for this difference could lie. </p>

<p>Here is the first half of my argument which sets up the first major premise, which is that people think differently:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The physiology of our brain can be mapped directly to our
psychological “mind” regardless of the absence of a proven causal
relationship. </p></li>
<li><p>Our brains undergo a large amount of physiological change throughout
life due to  their plastic nature</p></li>
<li><p><strong>People think differently as a result.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Premise 4 is where I am torn. 
Both cultural factors and physical ones have a huge effect on our brains. non-physical cultural factors and physical ones, like hormones, both effect the way our brains are wired. </p>

<p>The <strong>amount</strong> of cultural priming throughout our life heavily outweighs our physical priming, but our physical priming takes place <strong>earlier</strong> in life, even pre-birth. presumably to me, this would make it a primary factor, because of a compound effect, making these developments more significant.</p>

<p>but I have no evidence to support either view point, so i'm looking for actual references that I can look at that address the significance of these factors as well as critiques of my argument in case I am operating off of some fallacy I am unaware of because of my limited perspective here. </p>

<p>I understand this question is subjective. I am honestly just looking for references related to my argument because it can be hard me to find good scientific references.... but the opinions of others would be awesome as well!
Thank you in advance!</p>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>I just stumbled across this again, and I actually wrote a paper on the matter which specifically answers the question. You can read it <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/163g_-dKqWBfDSizGPwAVD5KqXwsDpo7otI4QwKhjRHM/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

<p>My conclusion is that the mind is not universal and nature is the primary cause. My explanation is somewhat nuanced, but very strictly logical in nature and I trace out the premises in the first page. </p>

"What is the source and real meaning of ""provisional living "" concept and is there an equivalent term?","<p>I found in <a href=""http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.ro/2014/07/the-gray-light-of-morning.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this blog post the following definition</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Psychologists have a concept they call “<em>provisional living</em>.” That’s
  the insistence, so often heard from people whose lives are stuck on a
  dysfunctional merry-go-round of self-inflicted crisis, that everything
  they don’t like about their lives will change just as soon as
  something else happens: as soon as they lose twenty pounds, get a
  divorce, quit their lousy job, or what have you. Of course the weight
  never goes away, the divorce papers never get filed, and so on,
  because the point of the exercise is to allow daydreams of an
  imaginary life in which they get everything they think they want take
  the place of the hard work and hard choices inseparable from personal
  change in the real world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Searching on the web or in Google Books I didn't find a definition of <em>provisional living</em>.</p>

<p>I found on a blog a similar definition as the above <a href=""http://www.philipcarr-gomm.com/essays/eye-storm-stay-sane-insane-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">in this blog post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Psychologists sometimes call this ‘provisional living’, whereby you
  tell yourself that you’ll truly come alive, truly be fulfilled and
  optimally creative when you’ve moved, married, divorced, retired or
  whatever. So much of our culture is based on it, it’s hard to resist.
  When the mortgage is paid then you’ll really be free, when you move to
  the country, when you no longer have to earn a living, when, when,
  when…and then of course you die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found a reference of <em>provisional living</em> linking it with the passage ritual also in the book <strong>Close Relationships : Family, Friendship, Marriage Studies in
Jungian Psychology By Jungian Analysts</strong> by <em>Bertine, Eleanor</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To overcome the father and the mother is to take up the
  responsibilities of adulthood, to sacrifice provisional living. Then
  life will surely become harder and more problematic, but potentially
  more meaningful. It is a momentous step, so much so that primitive
  peoples, who are close to the unconscious and its eternal laws,
  celebrate the transition by the always serious and sometimes rather
  grim rites of initiation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was not able to find a definition in a psychology dictionary or anywhere. </p>

<p>What is the source of this concept? Is it used in psychology and is there a equivalent term that is more used? </p>

"What is the concept that schema is opposed to","<p>From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In psychology and cognitive science, a schema (plural schemata or
  schemas) describes an organized pattern of thought or behavior that
  organizes categories of information and the relationships among
  them.[1] It can also be described as a mental structure of
  preconceived ideas, a framework representing some aspect of the world,
  or a system of organizing and perceiving new information.[2] Schemata
  influence attention and the absorption of new knowledge: people are
  more likely to notice things that fit into their schema, while
  re-interpreting contradictions to the schema as exceptions or
  distorting them to fit. Schemata have a tendency to remain unchanged,
  even in the face of contradictory information. Schemata can help in
  understanding the world and the rapidly changing environment.[3]
  People can organize new perceptions into schemata quickly as most
  situations do not require complex thought when using schema, since
  automatic thought is all that is required. [3]</p>
  
  <p>People use schemata to organize current knowledge and provide a
  framework for future understanding. Examples of schemata include
  academic rubrics, social schemas, stereotypes, social roles, scripts,
  worldviews, and archetypes. In Piaget's theory of development,
  children adopt a series of schemata to understand the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder what the opposite concept to schema?</p>

<p>Btw, I guess the schema in database theory is related to the one in psychology. How is it related, if any?</p>

"About the Turing test and a Robot's psychology","<p>If an A.I. system ( 'housed' in a Robotic exterior) actually passed the Turing test and was therefore 'functionally similar to the human 'mind-brain' would it also have the potential for information processing instability analogous to 'mental' problems in the mind-brain. ( Where the instabilities are not just because of information or important-definitions mismanagement but are also from info.-processing mismanagement.) Could one A.I system test another with the Turing Test and regard the other as an 'unstable', human , if the responses were sufficiently 'unstable' sounding? Could an A.I. system pretend through the Turing Test to be 'stupid' to another A.I. system?</p>

"Is the mind's adaptation to increased traveling speeds, physical or psychological?","<p>When a motor vehicle increases in speed, we soon adjust to the faster pace of movement; seemingly by processing incoming information faster.</p>

<p>Is this purely psychological, with the brain ""dropping"" peripheral information to catch up with the flow of new information? Or does the brain actually put more physical energy (kilojoules) into the task, like muscles using more energy during exercise?</p>

<p>Or put another away - do we simply think we are processing more information or are we actually doing so?</p>

<p>It's very intuitive that the word choice matters when we want to be persuasive, capture the listener's attention or simply avoid to hurt him. The importance of the presentation is clear to the human kind since thousand of years, but only with the psychological studies we have clearer some influences of a speech which are counterintuitive.</p>

<p>To better clarify the topic: trying to help someone may hurt his self-esteem if he interpret our attempt like a statement of superiority. </p>

"Why do people try to make themselves feel better by treating others poorly?","<p>I'm looking for an explanation for why people will try to make themselves feel better by treating others poorly.</p>

<p>For example, imagine a group of girls are sitting in a cafe. Within that group are two girls in particular, Sally and Anne. Sally is beautiful, intelligent, and popular. Sally knows she's blessed, but she doesn't like to highlight that fact. She shies from attention and deflects most compliments. Anne on the other hand, is normal, at least she thinks of herself as normal. Anne doesn't often receive compliments like Sally does. As the group of girls sit in the cafe sipping latte's and chatting, the conversation makes its way to Sally's recent success at school. Sally scored top of the class in the last bout of exams. This angers Anne, she herself didn't do so well on her exams. She feels ashamed. Suddenly she blurts ""Oh Sally its great that you did well on your exams, I'm surprised you had so much time to study, I thought you'd be too busy with Jack?"". Jack was Sally's fiance, they recently split up when Sally caught Jack with another woman. At this, Sally cowers like a wounded animal. She quickly mumbles something and excuses herself from the table. The conversation falls flat. Everyone at the table knew what happened between Sally and Jack. The other girls stare awkwardly at their mugs, shooting furtive looks at Anne. Anne knows what she did was wrong, evil even. But hurting Sally felt good, real good.</p>

<p>To rephrase the question in the context of the scene: Is there a name for Anne's behaviour at the cafe?</p>

<p>I'm not just looking for a word that would describe Anne's behaviour. Depending on how you interpret the story, Anne's behaviour can be described with many words (bullying, jealousy, spitefulness etc.). What I'm looking for is an explanation of Anne's behaviour in terms of psychoanalytic theory.</p>

"What happens inside our body, when we experience betrayal and infidelity?","<p>I guess many of us have experienced it. The moment that you understand that ""the person you love, in whom you've trusted, is now with someone else, enjoying every moment with him/her"".</p>

<p>It's so widespread that it might not be inaccurate that if we say that more than half of the people on Earth would experience it, and it's a universal feeling which is not dependent on race, culture and education.</p>

<p>However, apart from those presumptions, what I've felt during those moments was:</p>

<ol>
<li>Great pain (maybe not even pain, an instability) in the stomach, below the diaphragm</li>
<li>The feeling of insecurity, as if everything is frightening</li>
<li>No interest in anything, and I mean ANYTHING at all. No interest in food, in entertainments, music, even sex, nothing.</li>
<li>Coldness in my extremities</li>
</ol>

<p>I wonder if cognitive sciences have ever conducted a research on this subject or not. For example, which neurotransmitters are active in creating this feeling? What hormones are in action? Which part of the brain is responsible for the feelings related to infidelity? How can we treat it using medications, or other scientific methods, not fatherly advices.</p>

I use my internal speech in mostly the same way I do that when speaking out loud in real life in similar situations.</li>

"Interpretation of results on the studies of ""Moral Hypocrisy""","<p>Hello right now I am dealing with the studies of C.Daniel Batson, who provided several studies and experiments to reveal moral hypocrisy. I think that I understand the basic idea of his theory, however I am not really able to interpret his statistic outcomes. </p>

<p>I do not know if some of you have access to the full text, but the study is listed under the title: </p>

<p><strong>In a very different voice: Unmasking moral hypocrisy</strong>.
Batson, C. Daniel; Kobrynowicz, Diane; Dinnerstein, Jessica L.; Kampf, Hannah C.; Wilson, Angela D.
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, <strong>Vol 72(6)</strong>, <strong>Jun 1997</strong>, 1335-1348</p>

<p>However, I will provide some relevant excerpts in the form of pictures for better comprehension towards my question. </p>

<p>First excerpts:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2a169.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2a169.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>In this part Batson et. al. presents his results and compare them through the previously measured responsibility measures indexes. The confusing part starts from the yellow lined part. I do not really understand what does he mean by coding?</p>

<p>Furthermore, he mentions that only one of this applied measures correlated with the results and provides the result <strong>r(18)=0,39, p&lt; 0,05</strong> (blue lined). This is the core of my real problem. First of all I do not really understand what does the r(18) mean? I think it has something to do with a normal distribution right? Moreover, I have no idea how to read the 0,39 in a clear way. Does it mean that 39% of the results actually are coherent with the previously applied measurement indexes of moral responsibility? In the end I also struggle to interpret the p-vale of 0,05. Does it mean that the value (0,39) would be theoretically rejected, if it would be below 0,05?</p>

<p>To demonstrate the full results I also provide you the second excerpt:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aleD3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aleD3.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I really struggling to understand this notations. The worst thing is that it is not explained in the whole text, how these numbers have to be interpret. I also read several other psychological texts, which have very similar expressions. </p>

<p>I hope that my question is somehow understandable, because it is very difficult to ask this question, if nobody has an access to the full text. I would be extremely grateful, if someone could help me.</p>

"Can hate to same gender parent cause homosexualism?","<p>I know a girl who is (or claims to be) lesbian.
I also know that big part of her childhood (12-now years) she hated her mother.
Her father left family when she was infant (1-2 years). I dont know what she thinks about her father.
She is 17 now.</p>

<p>I wonder, is it possible that by not-accepting her mother, she does not accept her own gender? Or is it more likely that not having a father, influenced her sexual orientation?
Was any documented research conducted, that would confirm/reject that?
Any other thoughts on that?</p>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>I should have mention about it earlier but somehow I forgot about that.
I know that she had experiance when she got home earlier one day, and saw her mother with her lover having sex. She told it my sister. More or less after that, she started to dress like a man and (I think) she lost this 'little girl/child' identity. She become more serious and her marks at school rised very high. She is the best in class now but before that experience she was one of the worst.</p>

<p>I dont know if this is relevant, but she consider herself as a loner and watches a lot of anime now. I think this is all what I know about her.</p>

<p>I feel confused. I always thought that only small percent of people are really homosexual (because of chromosome mutation), and the rest just believes (because many possible reasons) that they are.</p>

"Increasing pitch perception of the same auditory stimuli","<p>I was trying to work up a small clip of repeating <em>beep</em> sounds I recorded from a mobile game. This series of sounds, when played, gave an unmistakable perception of increasing pitch with every rendition of the <em>beep</em>. I recorded the sound and plotted a spectrogram of the sound, and also a frequency spectra of the first and the last rendition in a series of 10 repetitions (which should apparently have the largest difference in the pitch perception). What was surprising, is that, visibly, on the spectrogram, and also on the frequency spectra, they were exactly the same. Using an enhanced autocorrelation function too, the two repetitions hardly had any gross differences.  </p>

<p>Since this is primarily based on visual differences in the plots, there could be subtle shifts which would not be visibly apparent. But in listening, there is a very noticeable rise in pitch, which seems less probable to be a consequence of subtle shifts of the autocorrelation-maxima. <strong>Why then does this seem to be the case? Is it only a subtle shift that I am unable to appreciate or is it something more higher-order than that?</strong>   </p>

<p>The pictures contain the spectrogram of the sound in question, the autocorrelation plots (which I understand to be more neurally relevant then the freq spectra) for the highlighted window (the plot with the blue heading) and a similarly placed window around the last repetition (the plot with the white heading). Do let me know if any further information is required. I don't know how can I get the sound uploaded in here.

Recently, I posed a question that I'm sure many people find tough already: <strong><em>""Do I really need to sleep?""</em></strong>, and so I tested myself, I spent two days without sleeping. 
<strong>The result was</strong>: </p>

<ol>

<li>Eyes and hand trembling; </li>
<li>Random muscle contraction;  </li>
<li>High blood pressure; </li>
<li>Headaches; </li>
<li>Head overheat; </li>
<li>Pain, pain everywhere;</li>
</ol>

What if we are too used to sleeping since we were born, and in the reality we don't need to ?  What is the reason for sleeping?- If the main reason is the brain heating, wouldn't a brain cooler or some refreshment system do the job? It is known that sleeping state is different from simply lying down, still that does not prove that sleep isn't an addiction, am I right?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is sleep truly necessary?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are the effects of sleep deprivation analagous to withdrawal symptoms following drug addiction?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can we learn to function without sleep?</strong> (i.e., after the withdrawal symptoms disappear)</li>

<p>(For example, some people are addicted to marijuana or cocaine but are still functional, however, it is still an addiction.)</p>

"So why might people post seemingly excessive concerns regarding the danger in their neighbourhood?","<p><strong>Background:</strong> The reason for this post is that I have noticed that many people have a desire to make that which is pretty safe seem dangerous.  It is very perplexing to me.</p>

<p>Despite holding a master's degree my psychology education is limited to 101, yet I am still curious about a trend I am seeing.  </p>

<p>My neighborhood facebook page, which can be very helpful, is also scattered with posts from a subset of people who want to make the neighborhood seem dangerous.  It is a bit large, 1300, homes and really very safe.  There was some vehicle ""break-ins"", which was really change and loose items being taken from cars that were unlocked.  My family locked our three cars and never had a problem.  That is really the extend of the crime.</p>

<p>One person recently posted:  ""Large box truck pulling a trailer on Xxx Pkwy. No company name. Anyone expecting home builder maintenance?"".  The street in question services all the homes an an elementary school.  About 5% of residents are actually on the facebook page.  It is a public street, not gated.  How would one reasonably expect this to get any ""traction"".  Turns out it was a crew painting fire hydrants.  </p>

<p>Another example:  Guy posts a picture of a car stopped in front of his house.  ""What are you doing in front of my house at 1:12 pm.  Be warned I will not be robbed.""  Again this was just after lunch on a side street, but still public.  One person points out that the house across from him is for sale.  They were probably checking it out.  To my knowledge there have been no reported break ins, other then abandoned houses, in the last 8 years.</p>

"Name for compulsive need to mimic another's symptoms of illness?","<p>I'm trying to research a particular issue that arises as a side effect of anxiety and depression. I'm finding it tricky to get information, mostly because I'm not sure what it's technically called (if it has a term, or if it is documented at all).</p>

<p>The subject has a compulsive need to appear to be experiencing the same symptoms of illness of an important loved one, in particular symptoms that are difficult to disprove (e.g. pain, soreness). For example if the subject's partner has a cold and complains of a sore throat, the subject will immediately claim to also have a sore throat. The subject will also have a compulsive need to take the same medication or treatments as the loved one. The subject will claim all of this fiercely, and will take great to offence to mistrust.</p>

<p>It seems strikes a similar chord with Münchausen syndrome, but the subject does not specifically want care from medical professionals and it only occurs to mirror a key loved one's symptoms. I'm not entirely sure if it is issue of attention seeking, due to attention being cast on their loved one instead; or if it's fear of severe illness and death of another, and by both being ill makes it easier to cope somehow?</p>

"Measurement of phase difference between two signals using cross correlation vs. fourier transform","<p>I am studying eeg signals with the aim of distinguishing between preictal and interictal epilepsy states based on the eeg signal. I have read some papers and one of the metrics used to distinguish between the states has to do with measuring the phase synchronization between eeg samples from multiple electrodes. In this regard, I thought the most straightforward way to measure phase difference between two signals would be to compute the cross correlation function, and find the time $\tau$ at which the cross correlation function reaches a maximum - call this <strong>Method 1</strong>. However, in practice what is usually done is to fourier transform the signals and measure phase difference of the complex fourier transform (and possibly average it over a frequency band of interest). Details are explained e.g., <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Measures_of_neuronal_signal_synchrony"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> - see the section on phase synchronization.

Consider two signals $x(t)$ and a time shifted version of it $x(t+T)$. The Fourier Transforms will be $X(\omega)$ and $X(\omega)e^{j\omega T}$ respectively. Using <strong>Method 1</strong> one would get $T$ as measure of phase difference. Using <strong>Method 2</strong>:
$\Delta \phi$ = $\omega T$ and this averaged over $[\omega_1,\omega_2]$ will give phase difference as $T\frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}$. </p>

<p><strong>But what would Method 3 give? Is there a difference between phase difference and phase synchronization of two signals?</strong> </p>

"aftereffects of auditory adaptation","<p>Adaptation is a very robust feature of sensory processing: when a stimulus is displayed for a prolonged period, or repeatedly, the neural response to it will diminish. This process creates a local change in cortical sensitivity, which is behaviorally evident through worse sensory discrimination of subsequent stimuli which are similar to the adaptor stimulus, but better discrimination of dissimilar ones.</p>

<p>In the visual domain, there is also the concept of an <strong>afterimage</strong>. If one looks at a green patch for a long time, then a white wall will appear red. If one looks at a curved line for a long time, a straight line will appear to curve the other way. The landscape next to a waterfall will look like its traveling upwards, etc.</p>

<p>Does anything similar exist in the auditory domain? Can adaptation lead to illusory percepts in audition? And if not, why do you think this would be? </p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in the neural level of explanation, and would be very happy to hear all speculations, however far out they are. </p>

"Is there an explanation of why some colors seem to move forward/backward on a 2D plane?","<p>I am a painter and digital artist working with color and colorimetry.

We sometimes see similar so-called ""optical illusions"" occuring between fields of colours. If I remember well, dark-blue often seems ""further away"" than yellow for example.    </p>

"Does exercise substantially affect bloodflow to brain","<p>The benefits of exercise on the psyche are well documented, encompassing catharsis, endorphin release, mental health improvements and self esteem. 
There is also evidence that it increases cognitive function short and long term. </p>

<p>It would seem that these benefits are from more BDNF, blood with higher oxygen content, and more bloodflow to the brain. I would think the blood effects would cause the short term benefits, while aiding in the increased neurogenesis long term. </p>

<p>I just went for a run. 
I assumed the immediate(within the hour of exercise) clarity I felt to be attributable to the mood-altering affects(catharsis, stress relief, endorphins, etc).
Quick searches show websites like ScientificAmerican and brainblogger et al confirm that more bloodflow to the brain contributes to state and structural changes in the brain. </p>

<p>However, in The Brain; A Very Short Introduction by Michael O'Shea, it mentions; [On the topic of areas of the brain requiring more glucose and oxygen] ""A simple solution to this problem would be to pump more blood into the active region, much in the same way that a muscle is supplied with more blood when exercised vigorously. However unlike a muscle, which becomes engorged with blood and swells when exercised, the brain is confined by the skull and cannot be allowed to swell significantly. The solution to this tricky problem is to maintain a constant overall blood volume in the brain and to arrange for blood to be diverted preferentially to active regions."".</p>

<p>I'm skeptical of the bloodflow explanation, since there is the counter evidence from the book I cited. 
This raises a related question concerning blood though.

<p>Call volume varies, but tends to be constant during many busy periods. As soon as you're done with one call, sometimes there's a lull, but usually another call is waiting.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/11276/what-in-neurons-and-their-connections-changes-during-the-process-of-learning"">this question</a>, learning is about connecting distant neural networks; in forming these synapses resources are recruited such as calcium and glucose.</p>

"What is it about Ken Reid's style of drawing lumps on surfaces [shown here] that makes our visual system so easily interpret it?","<p>Ken Reid was an artist who drew for the <em>Beano</em> and other comics, and was known for strips such as <em>Frankie Stein</em> and <em>Queen of the Seas</em>. And for <em>The Nervs</em>, about the little men who run our brains, but that's not why I'm asking this. He had a rather grotesque way of drawing faces, which made protrusions such as chins and Adam's apples stand out using very few lines. There are examples of his work on <a href=""http://lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/ken-reid-genius.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lew Stringer's blog</a> and <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_448y6kVhntg/RhIjT_1lF0I/AAAAAAAAA3I/KtvcxEIE3F8/s1600-h/nervs_pg1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this copy of <em>The Nervs</em> strip</a>. What interests me is why the lines he drew are so effective. What is the visual system interpreting them as?</p>

<p>To demonstrate, here are three images from the above-linked strip. I've marked the parts of interest with an arrow:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/52uJj.png"" alt=""Frame 1, row 1""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tNWEb.png"" alt=""Frame 2, row 2""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqtPh.png"" alt=""Frame 1, row 3""></p>

<p>In the second image, the back of the knee, there's an upward-curving line above a short vertical above two downward-curving lines. The higher downward-curving line is presumably the contour of the lower leg. But it's less obvious what the downward-curving line below it is. Nevertheless, it certainly helps in giving a sense of three-dimensional form. </p>

<p>Similarly, in the third image, some of the three upward-curving lines could be folds where the chin presses back against itself. But is the visual system interpreting them all as folds? I don't know, but again, they readily give a sense of form. If there's anyone here who is working on perception of shape, I'd like to know how you think these lines are being interpreted. </p>

<p>By the way, I and other readers have noticed that Reid's drawings seem very ""intense"". As one reader commented in a blog, ""they seem to enter the subconscious and stick there for the rest of your life"". I'd be interested in any ideas on why, and how this relates to what I've asked above.</p>

"Could one use priming (from realistic images to drawings thereof) to help teach the conventions of line drawing?","<p>Line drawing is a very stylised form of art. There are no lines in nature, and artists have to learn the conventions to be used when drawing in line. I am interested in whether one could help them learn by repeated priming of associations from realistic images to line drawings of those images.</p>

<p>First, here is an example, a drawing of a boy from the children's annual <em>Sunshine Stories</em>, published probably in the 1930s. The top of the chin has been omitted, because it catches the light. The upper lip is shown dark, and the lower lip is omitted, being indicated only by a shadow under it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zSRh.gif"" alt=""Drawing of boy from 1930s children&#39;s annual, showing conventions used in drawing the face""></p>

<p>This is a <a href=""http://www.j-paine.org/lds/not_exist_2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very common convention</a>. The link points at an excerpt from an instructional book that was very popular in its time, <em>Simple Sketching in Line</em> by L. A. Doust. For some reason, the visual system seems to pay too much attention to bottom lips that are outlined or dark, so artists have discovered that it's often best only to draw the shadow under them.</p>

<p>Faces are not the only subject that gets conventionalised. For example, at <a href=""http://www.j-paine.org/lds/texture.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a> and subsequent pages, I show some of the conventions used in indicating texture. These slides, by the way, are from a talk I gave on the semantics of line in drawing, showing the different purposes for which artists use line.</p>

<p>So, imagine that we ask a skilled illustrator to take 500 (say) photos and make a drawing of each, using a common and consistent style. We then use the photos paired with their drawings as priming stimuli. Is there any evidence for or against my hypothesis that this would help novices learn the mapping from realistic images to drawings thereof? In a sense, it's analogous to teaching musicians to sight-read.</p>

<p>A hi-tech alternative to photos and drawings would be mediated-reality glasses. In Oxford, Stephen Hicks is developing <a href=""http://www.va-st.com/smart-specs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Smart Spex</a>, which help people with poor vision to see. The third image on that page shows a scene, labelled ""a"", and the specs' renderings of it. Rendering ""c"" is similar to a line drawing. If a subject were to wear these glasses in ""line drawing"" mode continuously, would they absorb its rendering conventions? If so, it could be a very useful way to teach drawing.</p>

"What is known about the information that's passed upwards within the neocortex?","<p>The neocortex is likely to process sparse representations in a hierarchy with information close to the raw sensor input appearing in lower levels and abstract concepts being appearing in higher levels. However, I'm interested in the exact nature of information being passed upwards.</p>

<ol>
<li>There are some gating mechanisms in the neocortex. I could imagine that they prevent obvious information from being passed up. For example, since it was already reported and didn't changed. Much like workers within corporate hierarchies only report the same status once.</li>
<li>Similarly, it would make sense to pass up information that a lower layer doesn't understand and can't handle itself. This would also be comparable to workers at a company who ask their managers for decision they can't make.</li>
<li>If planning happens within the hierarchy of the neocortex, higher layers might hand down high levels options for the lower levels to unroll and simulate. In that case, the result might be passed up afterwards.</li>
<li>Encoding continuous input streams, attractor patterns are likely to emerge within levels of the hierarchy. I could imagine that the type of information send upwards changes when a level settles in a stable pattern.</li>

"Possibility of using the effects of sleep to induce a virtual environment?","<p>I'm not sure what <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/1962/possibility-of-perfect-virtual-reality"">this guy</a> is trying to say, or why his question got closed, but I think I can build upon it and form a solid question. When the brain enters REM Sleep, all sensory input to reality is eliminated or dulled. The person will begin dreaming as the brain creates random impulses and sends them through the brain. Through the techniques of Lucid Dreaming, the subject can learn to control the false dream reality completely. These conditions provide everything necessary for a virtual environment except they are isolated to the individual's brain.</p>

<p>If we were able to induce the physiological conditions of sleep (which should be a simple injection of hormones), and generate these impulses artificially(connecting the brain to a high-end computer program), then we should be able to immerse the person in a virtual environment. Lucidity could be achieved easily by programming the system to leave clues for the subject. The ramifications of this are enormous. For example, a man in China and a man in Russia could go bowling together, without leaving their own homes.</p>

<p>(I'm not sure if this theory already exists, but I definitely reached these conclusions myself.)  </p>

<p>My main questions are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are the hormones necessary to induce sleep in this way?</p></li>
<li><p>Is this a safe and reliable way to immerse a subject in a virtual environment? </p></li>

"Why prefer ""99% fat free"" to ""1% fat""?","<p>In my experience I tend to find low-fat products labelled as ""<strong>99% fat free</strong>"" much more often than the equivalent ""<strong>1% fat</strong>"".*</p>

<p>Why is this so? To me it seems counter-intuitive, because it reminds me of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_pricing"" rel=""noreferrer"">psychological pricing</a>, where retailers price things slightly less than round numbers, partly so that consumers under-perceive the price. If that same effect is happening with the ""99% fat free"" labeling, consumers would over-perceive the amount of fat.</p>

<p>Is it because the psychological pricing phenomenon doesn't apply in this case for whatever reason? Perhaps other phenomena are at play? Or perhaps it's something that doesn't have to do with the numbers?</p>

<p>*<em>: I can't find a source for this unfortunately, and I'm aware that in some circumstances the ""1% fat"" form is the norm, for example with low-fat milk.</em></p>

"As for future mind control/reading technology, can humans fight it?","<p>As of recent times, rats have communicated through wireless brain implants, from across the globe. Also, recent fMRI technologies have allowed prediction of movements (or intention), and the visualization of brain waves (or 'seeing' your thoughts, images, etc.)</p>

<p>Rats have been used for testing, and some advances allowed scientists to predict intention, induce and/or subdue emotions and thoughts.</p>

<p>Reading or controlling the mind requires modifying/reading neural oscillations on neurons, and doing so on certain parts of the brain. Since the neural oscillations are the base of thought and cognition itself, how can we fight our own oscillations? This question stems from the possibility of mind control/reading in humans.</p>

<p>If the technology directly modifies our thoughts.. how can we fight that very structure? In science fiction, people ""fight"" against implants and control, but in reality, is that even possible? Can we fight our own oscillations?</p>

<p>For example, your mind is being read for a thought that you consciously know, like a password, and can you fight this attack?
Another example, your mind is being controlled, you are being coerced, and since neural oscillations are thought itself, you can't have objections.</p>

Can we fight our neural oscillations if they are hijacked?</p>

"Is it possible to think in a second language?","<p>Those who have learned a second language are <em>guaranteed</em> to consciously think of words and their corresponding meaning in your native language or vice versa.</p>

<p>This is common with more ""complex"" sentences, like ""My favorite color is green."", rather than ""Hi"" or ""Hello, how are you?"" (The latter being a common phrase, so it needs no thinking in most languages.). </p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to stop the conscious act of translating your native language to your second language or vice versa?</li>
<li>Is it possible to fully ""think"" in your second language?</li>
</ul>

<p>Clarification: When you speak your native language you rarely think about the grammar and structure and it comes right out, I'm asking if that's possible with people who learned multiple languages.. can you think as if that language was native to you?</p>

<p>Further clarification: You know how a beginner of a foreign language usually cannot speak rapid-fire and has to think through every word and it's syntax, instead of making a flow of words automatically, you have to 'think' and fill in each word accordingly.</p>

<p>Example: When a person who natively speaks English  talks, they can talk without having to think of word meanings as it is already implicitly processed by your sub-conscious.. but this flow usually stops when you.. </p>

<p>Another example: Person A doesn't use the word ""condescending"" a lot, and has to return to the definition in her memory. She usually doesn't meet condescending people. She has met a person who has this attribute. In an argument she says ""You're so --pause--, umm, hmm.."", and in her mind she goes through a list of words (Mean, (I had to pause here to find a word for the example..) Defiant, Rude, etc.) until she reaches condescending.</p>

<p>That is the feeling of ""thinking"" I'm describing. A new learner of a second language has to ""think"" through everything, and my question is: Can you ""think"" in a second language without having to find and link words in your native language? Excluding young people exposed to both, but people who took classes and moved to a country to learn.</p>

"To what degree does environment govern the severity of symptoms in schizophrenia?","<p>From what I understand about the physiology of schizophrenia it is thought to be caused by chemical imbalances resulting from genetic factors, fueled by environmental factors. I've garnered that environmental factors can play a large role in how a person reacts to the disease.</p>

<p>As an example: a person with a genetic predisposition towards schizophrenia is raised in an abusive household with his parents yelling everyday, they will definitely become angry and more stressed out, which one might assume would lead to their eventual psychotic break. Is this 100% correct? Another person who might be less stressed out, probably raised in a normal family, could potentially experience troubling symptoms before a complete psychotic break. Is this a valid assumption or observed pattern in those who suffer from the disease?</p>

<p>So, if environmental factors can contribute to the onset of schizophrenia, could the removal of these factors lessen the symptoms? Take for example Jared Loughner, he will be spending life in prison. With time away from society, with the stresses of life removed, and (given the correct medication), could incarcerated schizophrenia patients' symptoms be ameliorated by this change in social situation?  </p>

<p>But are there any theories proposing 'translations' from a personality described according to one theory, to the same personality described according to one of the others? </p>

<p>I would expect that this translation would be mediated through latent variables. 
However i have not found any research that does this, while there are papers on the relatioships between test-results. That is, there is empirical research that describes the correlations between the scores on questionnaires that are designed to measure personality according to different theories.</p>

<p>For example: From BIS/BAS to the big five - Smits and Boeck - European Journal of Personality Vol 20, no 4, 255–270</p>

<p>The reason i ask, is because i have a dataset of some 460 subjects who took several personality questionnaires (big 5 as well as BIS/BAS), in addition they completed the Adjective Check List (ACL). Test subjects also did tests which measure impulsiveness: a Response Inhibition task, a Reversal Learning task and the Balloon Analogue Risk Task.</p>

<p>I think it would be interesting to compare a model based on literature to the correlations found in this dataset. 
Specifically i would try to predict certain approach/avoidance measurements (test-subjects also completed an approach-avoidance task) from the rest of the test data and the theoretical connections between the different factors that are supposed to underlie the measurements.</p>

"Do Kahneman–Tversky results hold for longer periods and aggregate behavior?","<p>Kahneman and Tversky (1979) show findings that can be summarized in this plot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0OJcX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>They show that humans dislike losses ""more"" than they like comparable nominal gains. The results come from a series of brief experiments.</p>

<p>Can these results be valid in the following situations?</p>

<ol>
<li>A loss or gain is a one-time event, but the impact (negative or positive disutility) persists and affects decisions over days, weeks?</li>
<li>Losses or gains across multiple individuals lead to a decrease or increase in (hypothetical) aggregate utility, without cancelling each other.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is, if workers become unemployed in a recession, can we apply the Kahneman–Tversky framework to explain, say, their likely protests (and it's not enough to restore their incomes because the loss is overweighted)?</p>

<p>Or from the point of psychology, a wage loss looks differently? To clarify the latter, a wage loss leads to a series of negative events, each of which has a negative impact. But does this chain still yield the effect similar to the depicted one, as we sum up the impacts?</p>

<p>Alternatively, how often does the reference point tend to refresh itself, so that we could treat the next event as happening at (0, 0) in the plot and not just as an add on to the previous event?</p>

"Why has behaviourism fallen out of favour?","<p>The reasons for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">behaviourism</a> as a philosophy and school of psychology to have fallen out of favour are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">well known and documented</a>.  However, when Newton's view of gravity was replaced by general relativity, his entire works were not then tossed aside as if discredited.  But this is, practically speaking, what has happened to behaviourism.</p>

<p>Beahviourism has always focused on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">learning-based mechanisms</a> (eg, conditioning, role modelling, enculturation) that are highly evidence-based, repeatable, and generalizable.  Today, cognitive / computational-model theories dominate many fields, but their explanatory approach rarely considers learning-based theories traditionally associated with behaviourism.  Why is that?  More specifically, my question is:</p>

<p><strong>Have there been any surveys or studies asking cognitive psychology researchers whether or not they incorporate learning mechanisms in their theories, and why or why not?</strong></p>

<p>A nice <a href=""http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/uncategorized/what-happened-to-behaviorism.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article I ran across</a> suggests some reasons why cognitive research may not consider learning mechanisms, but it is purely speculative, with no data to back anything up.</p>

<p>Today, behaviourism continues to thrive in the form of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism#21st-century_behavior_analysis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">behaviour analysis</a>, and its history is regularly taught as part of introductory psychology courses.  However, while other branches of cognitive science often collaborate (as for example cognitive psychology and neuroscience forming <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_neuroscience"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cognitive neuroscience</a>), behaviourism's learning models are rarely incorporated into other works.  The founding ideologies of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_behaviorism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">radical</a> version of this school of psychology have long been discredited, but ignoring over a century of highly productive research into an influential branch of cognitive science seems to me like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p>

<p>Note: Questions like this tend to attract opinion-based answers, that are discouraged on this forum.  Despite the catchy title, I am interested in evidence-based answers, and the bolded question suggests the kind of evidence that could be pertinent.</p>

"Do hormonal factors cause a trend of lower IQ in women?","<p>This is a hard question to ask without coming off as a sexist, merely via the title, so I'd like to make one thing clear right away: I understand that men and women have an identical capability of developing intelligence on perfectly equal levels. I'm not expressing that I think any one woman is any less capable of equal or greater intelligence compared to any man. </p>

<p>With that said, I understand that the human mind is a very dynamic tool that can be excersised and developed. Just like after never lifting a weight in my life, I wouldn't be capable of walking in and bench press 350, I can't expect to have an IQ of 130 all in a sudden after never once putting my mind to solving a tough problem. </p>

<p>In my life experience, I've met highly intelligent people, both men and women. However I've noticed a strong trend of women having far less interest in the very problem solving that defines one's IQ. I have put some thought into this, and after learning that men and women have identical brains for the most part, I assumed the trend must be due to hormonal differences, causing women to spend far more time on emotional thought processes rather than on problem solving. </p>

<p>Am I completely wrong? Partially wrong? I'm not an expert in cognitive sciences, so I ask this question with an open mind. Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit: This question hasn't been received well. See my comment on an answer below for a brief explanation of my thinking. Basically I'm either asking the wrong things, or in the wrong place. I'm not trying to be sexist though. I genuinely want to study the topic in order to understand, in the best interest of women, whom I find aren't engaging as much as men are in intellectual topics. </p>

"Research on ""probabilistic thinking"" in non-human animals?","<p>We all seem to have a ""probabilistic sense"", which manifests itself in certain types of expectations (e.g. even if one has never used a bow to shoot an arrow, one expects that hitting a small target will be more difficult than hitting a large target, all other things being equal), and also in certain characteristic responses when events do not match those expectations (these responses consist primarily of surprise, but also include suspicion, and in extreme cases maybe even awe or fear).</p>

<p>For me at least, this probabilistic sense feels subjectively very fundamental, in the same way that physical pain, hunger, thirst, etc., ""feel fundamental"".  In other words, I could not describe them to someone in simpler terms.  (I may be able to explain to someone the mechanics of shooting an arrow with a bow, but I would not know how to explain to someone how to feel the immediate intuition that hitting a small target would be harder than hitting a large one.)</p>

<p><strong>Motivated by the kind of questions that follow, I'm looking for a review of research on ""probabilistic thinking"" by non-human animals.</strong></p>

<p>How analogous is this ""probabilistic sense"" to the more traditional
   (""classical"") senses like vision and touch?<br>
In particular, how much does it depends on human culture?</p>

<p>I've searched for these keywords online, but I have not come up with anything.  Maybe I'm not using the right keywords.  Also, since probabilistic methods as standard tools in research (and hence, the research literature is awash in terms like ""probability"", ""expectation"", ""Bayesian"", ""statistical"", etc.), it is very difficult to craft searches that are selective for the research I'm looking for.  Some <em>specific</em> pointers (i.e., to specific papers, or books, or at least specific researchers) would be appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p>FWIW, the clearest example I can come up with to illustrate what I mean by ""probabilistic thinking"" is this thought experiment.  Imagine presenting a human subject the opportunity to participate in a raffle for some prize that the subject finds desirable, and suppose the subject is just told that he/she has the choice of having (A) one, or (B) two tickets for the raffle (at no cost in either case).  We would expect, of course, that every ""normal"" subject would prefer (B) over (A).  (In fact we would question the sanity (or at least the seriousness and sincerity) of any subject who fully understood the situation, and still preferred (A) over (B).)</p>

<p>What makes the universal preference for (B) an example of ""probabilistic thinking"" is the simultaneous recognition on the subject's part that choice (B) is <em>unequivocally</em> better, and that still it could fail to lead to the prize, even if the raffle had only three tickets.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how one would go about setting such an experiment with non-human animals, but I've been impressed before by the ingenuity of the experiments that researchers devise to test animal cognition, so I remain hopeful that something like the ""probabilistic thinking"" I illustrate above has been investigated.</p>

<p>That said, I realize that it would be rather difficulty is to distinguish between pure ""probabilistic thinking"" (as a distinct, independent faculty) and conditioning.  In fact, it can be (and has been) argued that what I'm calling ""probabilistic thinking"" is nothing more than a special case of conditioning.  (After all, conditioning may be thought of as the nurturing of certain expectations, and preferring two tickets over one could be simply a manifestation of one such expectation.)  Ironically enough, when it comes to humans, I can't think of any ethical experiment that would be able to establish ""probabilistic thinking"" as a faculty that would be present even in the absence of any conditioning.  With animal subjects, however, it may be possible to set up experiments that minimize the possible confounding by conditioning.</p>

That is, I know some people who tend to get very excited about a goal and take large amounts of action but fail to plan efficiently, so a large chunk of their work is wasted. Conversely I know a lot of people who can plan and take action efficiently but tend to do comparatively less work (and I tend to fall into this category.)</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is motivation and efficiency inversely correlated?</strong></li>
<li><strong>If so, is there a biological/neuroscientific reason for this?</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, perhaps willpower is a finite resource, so that planning literally uses up the energy you have to do other work.</p>

"How to restore and maintain a healthy sleep pattern?","<p><strong>Background:</strong> Some people over holiday periods or weekends get into sleep patterns that involve waking up very late in the day (e.g., 1pm), and then going to bed quite late (e.g.,, 4am). Such people can find it very difficult to bring back their sleep pattern to be in line with more regular day time rhythms (i.e., waking up between 6am and 10am). When earlier wake-up is attempted, this can result in feelings of fatigue and low mood.  Such attempts can even fail, when the person sleeps through the alarm clock.</p>

<li>How can a sleep pattern be effectively re-aligned with normal day time rhythms?</li>
<li>What are effective strategies for maintaining a regular sleep pattern?</li>

"Can bipolar disorder be considered a malfunction of the ""love circuit"" in the human brain?","<p>I've not so long ago read a book on depression by a <a href=""http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8,_%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80_%D0%9B%D1%8C%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87"">Russian psychiatrist Vladimir Levi</a>. The book's title can be roughly translated as ""Not only depression, but a pursuit of mood"". I have not been able to find an english translation, so I cannot quote it directly.</p>

<p>In that book, the author lists several examples of love-related depression, where a person who drops out of a love relationship experiences symptoms of moderate to severe depression. </p>

<p>This got me thinking - love is often portrayed as the ""ultimate goal"" in religion, popular culture, movies, etc. The psychiatrist above provides examples that losing love can result in depression. Another condition that is characterized by dramatic uplift in mood and outlook on life is the hypomania stage of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder"">Bipolar Disorder</a>. Bipolar disorder is characterized by multiple episodes of hypomania/mania and depression over the course of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Putting both phenomena together, it appears to me that there are similarities, and I'd like to ask these questions:</p>

<p>-<strong>Does bipolar disorder use the same mechanisms/pathways in the brain that ""love"" does?</strong></p>

<p>-If so, <strong>can bipolar disorder be considered a malfunction of the ""love circuit"" in the human brain?</strong></p>

<p>UPDATE: I found this article on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_basis_of_love#Neurochemistry"">neurochemistry of loVe on Wikipedia</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chemically, the serotonin effects of being infatuated <strong>have a similar
  chemical appearance to obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong>; which could
  explain why people experiencing infatuation cannot think of anyone
  else.[12] For this reason some, such as anthropologist Helen Fisher,
  assert that taking SSRIs and other antidepressants impede one's
  ability to fall in love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the article on love:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Studies in neuroscience have involved chemicals that are present in
  the brain and might be involved when people experience love. These
  chemicals include: nerve <strong>growth factor</strong>,[8] testosterone, estrogen,
  <strong>dopamine</strong>, norepinephrine, <strong>serotonin</strong>, oxytocin, and vasopressin.[9</p>

  <p>A review seeking to identify the more consistent findings suggested
  several genes related to <strong>serotonin</strong> (SLC6A4 and TPH2), <strong>dopamine</strong>
  (DRD4 and SLC6A3), glutamate (DAOA and DTNBP1), and <strong>cell growth

"Neural Mechanisms of Accumulation and Triggering","<p>What is the mechanism by which the brain/mind 'accumulates' a felt-sense to a point of 'triggering' an action?</p>

<p>For example, if unable to complete a task (e.g. opening packaging), a person can feel increased frustration for each attempt at the task.  Eventually, the level of frustration will reach a 'trigger-point' and a compensatory action ('will you open it for me?') can occur.</p>

<p>I see this in many areas of human life (though frustration is the most common/obvious example), so I would suspect that it's a general principle of neural action than a specific mechanism of tracking sensory perceptions.</p>

<p>Also, apologies for any unclear language or concepts.  I will happily rewrite if necessary.</p>

<p>[EDIT]:<br>
For clarity, I'm more curious about the 'accumulation' and less about the 'triggering'.  Also, with regards to accumulation, I'm particularly curious about accumulation over longer time periods.  So, not just task-specific frustration (as an example), but also things such as life skills.  </p>

<p>So, another example: talking to a specific person, you notice that they have some behavioral quirk that irks you.  Over time, you feel more and more irked by this quirk.  (Hrmm.. irk, quirk, maybe I need different words...), to the point where you avoid interacting with this person due to their irksome quirk.</p>

<p>I am semi-assuming that the mechanism involves an increase in conscious or subliminal attention to the offending perception, thus creating a sensation of increased salience of the stimulus.  But...I don't want to assume too far, and I'm curious if the subject has been formally explored.</p>

"What is the neurobiological basis of the ""inner voice"" used for thought or reading?","<p>I've recently experienced a number of hypnogogic near sleep states characterized by change in thinking (stage 1-2 sleep). I noticed that if I let go and get absorbed in the state, I can follow it.</p>

<p>I can describe the hypnogogic sensation as a feeling of empty space without a definite boundary. Typically the state arises at 17-23 minutes after bedtime (I'm using a timer to check). However, as soon as I activate ""inner voice"" or think a thought spoken in that voice, those other near sleep states get completely suppressed. Literally, a single word disrupts these states.</p>

<p>This makes me interested <strong>what happens in the brain when a person thinks using a single threaded, spoken train of thought?</strong> (""I'm typing a question on cogsci right now"" or ""I'm reading a question right now"") Is there some part of the brain that gets activated while others get suppressed?

"Writing system, its future and social importance","<p>I work on a rather specific subject, namely developement and inventing of writing systems (simply - alphabets). For some years it was just a hobby and creative exercise, but with time this hobby developed in a serious work of mine, with a series of very interesting discoveries which could lead in serious improvement of reading performance. First thing which motivated my work was the clear understanding of the fact that the Latin alphabet (Roman 'minuscule') is the most readable system of all existing in the world. So at least one has something to start with. At the same time it is clear that the one and the only objective criteria for the developement is the readability of the system, and that all imposes the task very clearly - the more readable the system is, the better the system is, so we have a strictly definite and objective scale of ""goodness"" of the system. 
On the other hand this task is (IMHO) of a great social and knowledge importance. BUT, strangely enough this subject is so little examined and almost does not develop, if at all. So it seems like I am pioneering this knowledge area, since I have never found any serios works or even examination attempts on the subject, well aside one hobbyist site <a href=""http://www.omniglot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.omniglot.com</a>, however I find most of the works presented there childish and none of them are even close to the Latin regarding readability.

"Is meaning-seeking behavior a biological optimization problem?","<p>In short, I'm interested in cognitive, neuroscientific, biological and/or computational perspectives on what we vaguely refer to as meaning seeking. Of course, this is a large topic, but any information would be highly appreciated.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Humans tend to desire meaning in their lives. While it would be hard to agree on a precise definition of <em>meaning</em>, it often refers to positioning oneself in a way that is compatible with one's beliefs, ambitions and values, allowing the individual to make sense of the world and of himself, and to pursue whatever (often transcendental) goals he considers worthy (i.e. meaningful). In simpler words, meaning could refer to making peace with the perceived reality of the world and with oneself. At first glance, it seems to me that a meaningful existence requires <strong>the absence of cognitive dissonances</strong>, but I wonder what science would have to say about this, and if there is any empirical basis for claiming this. Or perhaps the questions is misformulated and such behavior should not be put into the domain of meaning?</p>

<h2>Possible explanations</h2>

<p>A simple evolutionary argument could be that meaning-seeking behavior originates from our impulse to belong (isolation means death), but how do we then explain hermits or dissidents or all other individuals who have effectively made themselves suffer/die in order to uphold meaning in their lives (i.e. dying for one's beliefs)? So the argument that meaning-seeking behavior is a purely evolutionary phenomenon that serves only to maximize one's potential for reproduction doesn't appear sufficient.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Can meaning seeking be thought of as an <strong>optimization problem of some
biological parameters</strong> on an individual level, e.g. in terms of
energy required for various cellular processes, homeostatic gene
expression dynamics etc.? For example, depression (which can have an
existential origin) is damaging to health and has been linked to
epigenetic modifications (<a href=""http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v38/n1/full/npp201273a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sun et al. 2012</a>), so having a mechanism that would seek
to minimize such damage would seem to be beneficial for an organism.</li>
<li>Can we construct a more formal definition of meaning that would be
less anthropocentric? In other words, how far would we need to curb
the definition so that humans would no longer qualify as the only
meaning-seeking organisms? Or are we indeed the only species with the required neural capacity to express such behavior?</li>

"When is it defendable to use manifest instead of latent variables in psychological research?","<p>In psychology, most of the concepts, theories, ideas etc. of interest refer to <em>latent variables</em>, where a latent variable is one that can't be observed directly. Instead, one has to find a <em>manifest variable</em>, which can be observed directly and which can be used as an indicator for the latent variable. Unless there is a perfect indicator (which usually there is not), the measurement of the latent variable contains an error. To estimate the error, latent variable modelling techniques like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmatory_factor_analysis"" rel=""noreferrer"">CFA</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory"" rel=""noreferrer"">Item Response Theory</a> (among others) have been developed. </p>

<p><strong>Latent Variable Theory</strong></p>

<p>Now, it is generally agreed upon that variables like age and gender are manifest. But what is it that makes the difference between a latent and a manifest variable? Borsboom (2008) explicates this difference. In his <em>latent variable theory</em>, the distinction depends on the certainty, with which an inference can be made from the observed data to the variable in question. In this sense, a variable like gender is manifest, because one can infer with certainty if a subject is male or female from his or her answer on a questionnaire. Note that this is possible, even though one has not actually <em>observed</em> the gender of that subject. Borsboom's account of latent variable theory also implies that the status of a variable as latent vs. manifest can change over time, if for example more information becomes accessible. But as long as a variable has proven to be manifest, it remains latent.</p>

<p>It seems to me, then, that pretty much every researcher in psychology should use latent variable modelling techniques, since most of the time it is not at all possible to infer something with certainty. However, this is clearly not the case. There are numerous published articles that use manifest variables and analyze the relationships between them without accounting for measurement error, thereby implicitly making the latent variable in question a manifest variable. (If anyone wants citations for this claim, I will happily provide them.) </p>

<p><strong>Question: Under what circumstances is it defendable to use manifest instead of latent variables in psychological research, even if it is clear that the variables can only be measured with error?</strong></p>

"What do id, ego and super-ego exactly mean?","<p>I don't know much about psychology, but I've heard about Sigmund Freud's structural model of the psyche, with the three part of the psychic apparatus. However, I couldn't really understand the parts. </p>

<p>As far as I could understand it: the ego is the ""everyday part"" of self: our behaviour, personality and style we use in everyday events and interaction between other people. 
With this logic, the super-ego is just an ""ideal""; a human model that we follow either if we want it or don't - and it often, since it depends on our wants, experiences, aims and fears. 
But id is something constant, that never changes, and contains our deepest feelings: fear, love, and instincts. Maybe even some hidden knowledges.</p>

"Have humans always had problems with motivation and laziness?","<p>I originally wanted to ask a question ""Is there a drug for motivation or laziness"", but google search revealed that people have been asking this question for years and there's no drug that is currently prescribed to fix those issues.</p>

<p>This makes me interested in the the following question: <strong>Did ""motivation issues"" or laziness always exist for humans, or is it something that became a much bigger problem because of the modern lifestyle or cuture?</strong> </p>

<p>For example, I'm thinking of peasants of ""ye olde days"", who had to work really hard to get by, or early factory workers, who apparently did 12+ hour shifts from a very early age. Those people had no drugs or cognitive-behavior therapy to correct their issues. </p>

<p>Maybe there's some ""laziness scale"" that could be used to look at historic trends in laziness and motivation?</p>

<p>UPDATE: it would be very interesting to examine if a correlation exists between laziness and workforce moving from working physically/outdoors(ex: farmers) towards working mentally indoors(office workers) over the years.</p>

<p>I would define laziness or motivational issues as <strong>""I will do this tomorrow""</strong> attitude (procrastination) or promising to do something, but delivering excuses as to why the task wasn't done. The task never gets started.</p>

The task required participants to answer a number of questions about a set of CVs (e.g., is this a good job applicant, rate various features of the applicant).

"Do highly creative people dream more and/or differently than ordinary people?","<p>Everybody dreams, and I'm trying to understand if there is a cause and effect relationship between ability to dream and recall dreams and creativity as an adult. </p>

<p>I would <strong>define the kind of creativity</strong> I'm talking about as creating art, designing products, inventing and making original stuff. These people are at the upper end of a bell curve of creativity or are outside the curve completely (extraordinary creative genius). This is in contrast to ordinary people who would be somewhere towards the middle of the creativity bell curve.</p>

<p><strong>The kind of dreaming I'm talking about is long, clear or multi episode dreams lasting over 5 minutes</strong> as opposed to fragments and vague impressions of activity. Let's say 2+ dreams per night.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do highly creative people dream more and recall more than average or analytical people?</li>
<li>Does active interest in dreams as a child or teenager(like keeping a dream journal) influences creativity as an adult?</li>
</ul>

<p>I found some evidence to support that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubation_%28psychology%29#The_Cases_For_and_Against_Dreams_Being_Useful_In_Problem-Solving"">dreams and creativity are related, particularly in visual fields, like graphic design</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Barrett also interviewed modern artists and scientists about their use
  of their dreams, documenting dramatic anecdotes including Nobel Prizes
  and MacArthur 'genius grants' whose ideas originated in dreams.[6] Her
  research concludes that while anything—math, musical composition,
  business dilemmas—may get solved during dreaming, the <strong>two areas dreams
  are especially likely to help</strong> are 1) anything where vivid
  visualization contributes to the solution, whether in artistic design
  or invention of 3-D technological devices and 2) any problem where the
  solution lies in thinking outside the box—i.e. where the person is
  stuck because the conventional wisdom on how to approach the problem
  is wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another <a href=""http://www2.ucsc.edu/dreams/Library/domhoff_2000d.html"">example from an overview of the modern theory of dream content</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Second, dreams cannot be the guardians of sleep if there are people who can sleep even though they do not dream, and we now have reason to believe there are such people, including young children (Foulkes, 1999), leucotomized schizophrenics (Jus et al., 1973), neurology patients suffering from parietal lobe injuries (Solms, 1997), and <strong>perhaps normal adults with weak visuospatial skills (Butler &amp; Watson, 1985)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example comes from <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0452287812"">Nancy Andersen's book ""the Creative Brain""</a>, in which she suggests that highly creative people, like Issac Newton, Albert Einstein, Virgina Wolf, etc may be capable of thinking in a very different ways from ordinary people. She suggests this may be due to increased or different communication between their centers of the brain responsible for combining information and sensory input. It appears to me that dreaming is very related to this kind of information assimilation. </p>

<p>Another example from <a href=""http://www2.ucsc.edu/dreams/Library/domhoff_2001a.html"">Domhoff's neurocognitive theory of dreaming</a>. Spatial construction is required for ""traditional"" creative venues, like painting, sculpture and architecture. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the complete loss of dreaming in adults due to injuries
  to either inferior parietal lobe, when placed alongside the finding
  that <strong>increased dream reporting in young children correlates with
  visuospatial skills</strong>, suggests that the ability to dream in children
  depends in part upon the development of the neural network for spatial
  construction centered in the parietal lobes.</p>

"Is all learning a subconscious activity?","<p>As a non-native English speaker I recently tried to understand difference in phrases ""to study"" and ""to learn"". I found some explanations here on <em>English language and usage SE</em>, stating that learning is a subconscious activity. Then in some articles I've found, authors stated that language learning is subconscious and that acquiring knowledge and skill isn't the same  [ also that learning language is actually learning a skill, while learning history is acquiring knowledge.] .</p>

<p>So I got confused : <strong>is all learning subconscious or not?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Is there a difference in learning language and learning anatomy, laws of physics or programming?</strong> </p>

<p>Additionally some articles got me confused, especially  those that want to sell you hypnosis  DVDs and instruction manuals to ""boost"" your subconscious mind. Aren't we already equipped with proper subconscious mind? </p>

"What are the key features of dreams that trigger dream recall in the waking state?","<p>There are various ways of writing down dreams upon awakening in one's dream journal. I've seen long, detailed descriptions that read like novels and take a page or two. Then there are terse notes of place, action and characters. </p>

<p>In both cases, it is possible that the dream is forgotten, and upon reading the description, no recall happens, instead the mind starts to visualize the writing anew.</p>

<p>This makes me ask - <strong>Is there a key feature of a dream that prompts recall upon reading/thinking it?</strong> Is it a place, a feeling or something else? Is it recalling a known dream, then reading the description? </p>

<p>For example, in my current dream journal, i note the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record the location, note indoors/outdoors</li>
<li>Record the main action, focusing on feelings</li>
<li>Record light level (ex: dark/light)</li>
<li>Mention dream characters</li>
<li>Record the topic of conversation</li>
<li>Record any remembered phrases or response</li>

"Have there been any scientific experiments attempting to communicate with one's unconscious mind?","<p>For the purposes of this question, I will define unconscious/subconscious as the parts of the human mind that are not normally available for introspection or control, but which are still involved in cognition. These parts of the mind might be involved in memory recall or assimilation of information. While I would define communication as receiving a recognizable response to input.</p>

<p><strong>Have there been experiments attempting to establish communication with the researchers own unconscious mind?</strong> If so, what were their results? I'm not looking for ""new age"" kind of articles, but genuine scientific research findings.</p>

<p>The most <strong>direct</strong> way of communication that comes to mind would be talking to dream characters in a lucid dream and evaluating their responses upon awakening. Such characters are capable of semi-intelligent speech, and their responses at least casually appear to be related to the question at hand.  A consistent pattern of responses over several dreams might be considered a form of communication. </p>

<p>Another experiment I can think of, which uses <strong>non-verbal</strong> communication would be using some daily activity to consistently triggers a recurring dream setting at night. For example, intense study causing dreams of classrooms or exams. In this case, the setting can be considered a response of unconscious system. </p>

<p>Another example I can think of is exposing a person to a stimuli which consistently causes  some song to surface and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earworm"" rel=""nofollow"">""get stuck in one's head"" - earworms</a> during waking cognition. Alternatively, some saying or <strong>thought</strong> might arise unbidden in response to the stimuli. In this case, this can be considered another form of response. </p>

<p>Have there been scientific experiments along the lines described above? What would be the term I would use to search for ""communicating with unconscious"" in a scientific setting?</p>

"Which personality trait(s) characterize high need for external validation?","<p>Some background to explain my question:
I recently overheard a conversation, between two men working in the same firm.
One of them (A) is thinking about finding a new job, as he is not happy where he is. The other (B) says ""A, you have very valuable skills in this, nobody else knows as much as you do about this! You will have no problem at all finding a better job!""</p>

<p>I can see and hear that A is very hesitant to find a new job, he looks uncertain and not convinced that he will indeed find a better job.
A says he feels a need for external validation. A does not seem to have low self-esteem, so the need for external validation seems to be unrelated to self-esteem. </p>

<p><strong>In the Big 5, which personality trait(s) would explain such a need for external validation?</strong>
Neuroticism and agreeableness might be able to answer the question, but that depends on the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would a high-neuroticism low-agreeableness person crave for external validation?</li>
<li>Is high agreeableness alone enough to make someone crave for external validation?</li>
<li>Is high neuroticism alone enough to make someone crave for external validation?</li>

"Any research on a concept of 'empathetic preferences' used in economics?","<p>Some economists/political scientists/philosophers (it's sometimes hard to classify them) have used in their theories a concept of ""empathetic preferences"", also known as ""extended sympathy preferences"" - by which they they understand a preference of being a person <em>X</em> under a circumstance <em>p</em> than a person <em>Y</em> under a circumstance <em>q</em>, i.e. a counterfactual comparison of two different persons under two different situations. One needs to both empathise with two different persons to take into account their different preferences and create his own preference, hence the name empathetic preferences. A problematic concept to say at least, but nothing really important for those who used it (Kenneth Arrow, Patrick Suppes). But <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Binmore"" rel=""nofollow"">Ken Binmore</a>, quite a known chap in math, game theory and economics, devised a whole theory explaining humans' natural sense of fairness in which empathetic preferences play a crucial role, grounding interpersonal comparisons of utility (technical exposition in ""Game Theory and the Social Contract"" from 1994, more readable in ""<a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0199791481"" rel=""nofollow"">Natural Justice</a> from 2005"").</p>

<p>Has anything remotely relevant been studied by psychologists/cognitive scientists? Binmore is claiming that empathetic preferences are very similiar to empathy and basically ""every properly socialized human being has them"". He also claims that there are tons of research on empathy that support his view, without citing anything relevant. The problem is that he is not ""philosophising"" them, conjuring them out of nothing like some political philosophers - he claims that this is how human beings work. </p>

<p>Binmore's example of empathetic preference - if we know that Eve likes apples and Adam does not mind being naked, we might think ""I would rather be Eve eating an apple than Adam wearing a fig leaf"". </p>

<p>For me this seems utterly implausible, and making such comparison is just impossible. Also, as we are never different persons, why would we be capable of doing that? But it's not like he was some guy on a University of Woolamaloo writing things that only his PhD students read, he's a world-class economist, claiming empirical support of his work, and I'm curious if there is any.  </p>

"How to filter noise in EEG data","<p>I am a computer science student and I'm doing something for a psychology professor.</p>

<p>We have EEG data from an experiment where a person was shown 140 images for 2 seconds each. We placed 64 electrodes on the scalp so we have 64 channels of continuous data. </p>

<p>We want to correlate each node with every other node so that we can graph it using a <a href=""http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062006"" rel=""nofollow"">chord diagram</a>. </p>

<p>Since my professor is abroad, I am having trouble with the directions he gave me to manipulate the data to get the correlations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Once you are able to read the matrix of channels I suggest subtracting the mean signal from each, filtering to remove noise above 30 Hz.""</p>

<p>My question is how to remove the noise above 30 Hz? For example, data for 1 electrode for 10 milliseconds looks like this (measured in uV):</p>

<pre><code>[ 31172.50, 31173.53, 31174.80, 31177.34, 31173.73,

time: 0.0 s to 1883.15 s

"If people did not have to work, what would motivate them to work?","<p>In industrialized countries around the world, ""work"" appears to be something that most people try to avoid as much as they can, dreaming of winning a lottery so they will never have to work again -- and be free to do nothing or do what they like. Money serves as a motivator for work, because in these cultures you need money to stay alive, or at least to live well.</p>

<p>Many social welfare states pay a basic income to people unable to find work. Despite the fact that usually this basic income is not unconditional but a transitional payment only and bound to the receiver's attempts to find a job, there is quite a lot of hostility from those who force themselves to their jobs each morning, towards those who appear to be happy with having little and prefer not to work.</p>

<p>Around the world there are proponents of an unconditional basic income that would free individuals from the necessity to take up work. I don't want to go into the whys and wherefores of such a freedom, or into how such an income could be financed, but want to ask you:</p>

<p><strong>If everybody received an <em>unconditional</em> basic income that was high enough to make their lives reasonably comfortable, what would incite people to do the work (like baking bread) that needs to get done?</strong></p>

<p>I am not lookig for opinions or theories here, those already abound on the net, but for empirical evidence for:</p>

<ul>
<li>which percentage of a populace can be expected to busy themselves without need, and</li>
<li>how those that like to laze around can be motivated to work without need.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>B.F. Skinner in his utopian novel <em>Walden Two</em> attempts to design a society where no-one is required to work more than four hours a day and unwanted jobs result in more credit points than desirable jobs, so that some people clean the toilet and then have more free time than those working at their dream jobs, but this concept relies on a virtual currency of points that you have to earn, so there is a need to work to earn your living, even if it does not have a payment of traditional ""money"".</p>

<p>In my question, the motivator for work must not be anything that <em>has to be</em> fulfilled, but something that does not take away the freedom not to work. Something that makes even the least desirable job attractive. In the case of the toilet it might be something simple like this being your toilet, and if you don't clean it, you'll have to use it anyway. But there are public toilets. What would work there?</p>

"What, if anything, sets humans apart from other species?","<p>As I grew up, I was taught that the difference between humans and animals was that human beings have free will and animals do not. The basis is that animals will act accordingly to the nature of their species. I never fully understood this statement and still wonder whether it is a valid claim.</p>

<p>From an evolutionary  perspective, we would be regarded as a species at the top of the food chain. The main advantage in our development is our brains.</p>

<p>If we put aside the differences in what human beings are capable of, e.g. making clothes, machinery, etc., is there a real distinction between human beings and other animals? Do we really have free will, or an illusion of free will? Or are we behaving, as other animals, in accordance with the nature of our species?</p>

<p>I know this is a big question and could result in a range of debates over my definitions. So for the sake of clarity, <strong>let's keep this question limited to what defines a human brain as opposed to an animal brain and any evidence that supports any significant difference</strong>, allowing for the fact that the human brain is well-developed (as opposed to, e.g. to our canines).</p>

"What is the effect of displayed online personal identifiers on online communication?","<p>Online interaction provides an interesting avenue for experiment and experience.  People are able to hide or fabricate their personal details including age, sex, and appearance.
For the purposes of this question I am using the term ""personal identifiers"" as any indication of a person's age, sex, name, race, place of residence, etc*</p>

<p>As a user here, I have experimented with showing my real name, changing my user name; having a photo of myself as a kangaroo, and whether or not to display my age, provide my real age, or at one point used an age of 93 years. I have also played with whether or not to show my country (the kangaroo reveals I am at ease with this).</p>

<p>I am most active on Stack Overflow, which is a programming site, and my belief is that programming is a male dominated field. So when I address a user, with no personal identifiers, I find myself assuming that they are male. I have noticed that when people assume I am of the opposite sex (to what I am, not what they are!), I respond differently.</p>

<p>This has led me to think about the value of maintaining a certain anonymity and which aspects of one's identity are best revealed in various online settings.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>What information is there about perceived personal identifiers and how this affects  people's online behaviour?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What information is there regarding a person's reaction when they know they are being treated as if they are a person with different identifiers?</strong></li>
</ul>

"What evidence is there that the adult brain can produce new neurons?","<p>At school I was taught that the adult brain did not produce new neurons. That we had the maximum number of neurons and this would only diminish over time due to events, like head injuries, drinking excessive quantities of alcohol, various other processes, not to mention the general atrophy the body experiences through the process of aging.</p>

<p>I remember sitting through a Neuroscience lecture (about 15 years ago), and learning, that studies had shown that whilst exercising enabled the brain to <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S37/28/70Q72/index.xml?section=topstories"">produce new neurons</a>.</p>

"Does dopamine signal become stronger when goal distance is defined using time?","<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12475.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Howe et al (2013)</a> found that a dopamine signal becomes stronger as a goal is approached. The experiment involved rats running in a maze. If the rats were close to solving the maze, the dopamine signal became strong. The intensity of this signal did not depend on how fast the rats completed the maze. </p>

<p>Goal distance was defined in terms of space and distance (i.e. how far a rat was from the end of the maze). <strong>Would this dopamine signal also become stronger if the goal distance was defined using time instead?</strong> <em><strong>More specifically, if the rats were under some type of time pressure, would their dopamine signals become stronger?</em></strong> </p>

"What is the psychological basis for people coming together during a disaster or major event?","<p>Something I have witnessed several times, and got me wondering, what is the psychological basis for people coming together in response to a disaster or a major event?  Be it large scale or local.</p>

<p>An example is one that I was right in the middle of (and at one stage was in very serious danger) - the Queensland floods of 2011, which is encapsulated nicely in this video-editorial <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr6cvHEnyo"" rel=""nofollow"">""Hope Lives Here""</a>. Now, a couple of points from the editorial - the narrator states that as the city of Brisbane has grown, people have become more distant and are not likely to even know their neighbours' names.</p>

<p>This is obviously not just pertinent to the example above, but is repeated in many places.</p>

<p>However, when push comes to shove, and when a community of strangers are faced with a catastrophe, destruction, loss and are basically 'forced into a corner' - this is when the community comes together. Following the example, a 'Mud Army' started up of people helping strangers get back on their feet (I was involved in that, despite just coming out of surgery a few weeks before).</p>

<p>When the danger passes, life goes back to normal (generally) and we all seem to go our separate ways.</p>

<p>What is the psychological basis (more in depth than the linked editorial) for why we come together in a disaster or major event?</p>

<li>All hearing disappears when it happens.</li>

"Can one alter their auditory perception?","<p>I'm coming from the idea that the way we perceive sound is a reaction to a certain signal, sent to our brain by ears. Of course this feeling intensifies as volume of the sound increases and our ears send us a stronger signal. </p>

<p>Now here I am wondering if we can augment that signal in our brain, so when the volume stays the same - we will be able to perceive it louder. Can that be done without any kind of chemical or surgical intrusion, just by sheer force of will? Do such perception ""controllers"" even exist and we just haven't learned to control them?
This question is about auditory system, but since it touches the brain signal interpretation you could explain this from a different perspective (visual or even tactile).</p>

<p>This isn't part of the question, but I also wonder, if previous is possible, than can the same be done to mentally create sounds in your head and hear them as if they were real..?</p>

"Can ""7 deadly sins/virtues"" be explained in terms of brain hormone level or receptor mutations?","<p>I'm thinking about this question on biology.se: <a href=""https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/9737/do-hormones-make-men-think-of-sex"">do hormones make men think of sex?</a></p>

<p>From the interview linked in the answer, I get two takeaways: a man who lost most testosterone for 4 months mentioned more humility, while a lgbt person on testosterone therapy reported more intense sexual thoughts or urges.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I'm thinking of the Christian concept of "" deadly sins"" and their opposite virtues. From a purely historic perceptive, I take recurring accounts of these phenomena in writing to say that these traits have existed for the last couple thousand years or more in the western world.</p>

<p><strong>Is modern science any closer to explaining the phenomena like wrath, sloth, gluttony or humility in terms of neurotransmitter, hormone, receptor mutations or other genetic mutations?</strong> </p>

<p>Here's the kind of answer I'm looking for:</p>

"Is reading from the screen more difficult than reading from paper and how can screen reading be made easier?","<p>I've noticed that as a student when reading material, there is a choice between reading from the screen or reading from paper.
When reading from paper I find that I concentrate more and that  comprehension is  much better. I can partially memorize the material rather than reading from screen. In addition, I find reading from screen is more tiring. When I feel tired reading from the screen I often print to paper, and it provides relief.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does research support this observation that reading from paper results in less strain and greater comprehension?</li>
<li>Are there any techniques to improve reading from screen?</li>

"Current directions in emulation theory","<p>Over the decades there have been several theories from various aspects of cognitive science that have appealed to a link between perception and action as a way of understanding information processing in the brain. The example that I'm most familiar with is Liberman and Mattingly's Motor Theory of Speech Perception (<a href=""http://www.pitt.edu/~perfetti/PDF/Liberman%20%26%20Mattingly.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Liberman &amp; Mattingly, 1985</a>), which, starting almost 50 years ago, made the following claims — reviewed in <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746041"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Galantucci, et al. (2011)</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>""speech is special"" -- there are specialized pathways in auditory cortex for processing speech</li>
<li>perceiving speech is perceiving the speech gestures of the talker, not necessarily the acoustic patterns of the speech waveform</li>
<li>the motor system is recruited for processing speech</li>
</ol>

<p>Although more recent work in neuroscience has discredited many of these claims, particularly the first one, there do seem to be several recent results (e.g., <a href=""http://www-cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/papers/ListenSpeech04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wilson, et al. 2006</a>; Fadiga, et al. 2002; <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/103/20/7865.full"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pulvermueller, et al., 2006</a>; <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209005569"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">D'Ausilio et al. 2009</a>) that establish a very interesting link between speech perception and motor cortex activity.</p>

<p>At a higher level, this sort of theory fits into the general ""emulation"" framework proposed by <a href=""https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa07/cse87-b/papers/grush-em.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grush (2006)</a>, and also agrees well with insights from the mirror-neurons branch of neuroscience research.</p>

<p>My question is, now that all of this ""newer"" research is five to ten years old, have there been even more recent results -- especially from non-speech areas of cognitive science -- that might help form a unified theory of action and perception ? How might we go about building up such a unified theory based on what's currently known ? What further studies or models do we need to evaluate emulation as a fundamental building block of cognition ?</p>

"Consistency Theory - Why do we go back on promises","<p>I'm fairly new to the field of social psychology so forgive me if this sounds like a naive question.</p>

<p>I just read about the consistency principle - ""Once we make a choice or take a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our earlier decision.""</p>

<p>I have the question - exactly what kind of decision/commitment are we talking about? As in, how do we reliably identify a situation in which a person has made a decision/commitment such that he will now behave as per the consistency principle?</p>

<p>If the consistency principle is really so pervasive, then why do people often back out of promises? There are tons of situations when people don't honor their ""commitment"" towards other people (for example not showing up for some social event, or not showing up for a date, etc.)</p>

"How is the biological accuracy of ANNs typically measured?","<p>I am referring to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience"">computational neuroscience</a> side of neural network research that focuses on biological accuracy.

<p>For example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_neuronal_network"">cultured neuronal networks</a> (such as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurochip"">neurochip</a>) could be used as a benchmark: Create an ANN and a BNN with the same number and arrangement of neurons, give them the same inputs, and compare the results...

"How is the signal-to-noise ratio of an event-related-potential measured?","<p>I often encounter publications where the authors try to ""increase the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals"". Some define a numeric value of SNR of EEG signals, but I am confused as to the exact <strong>definition of the SNR</strong> and <strong>how it can be measured</strong> for ERPs?</p>

<p>Previously, I have calculated the SNR using a model of noise, for example a Gaussian model. I have also encountered SNR calculations based on a ratio between the mean and the standard deviation of a signal, but both of these approaches seem to be impractical. When I process the EEG signal, I would like to emphasize how the ERP changes in the EEG signal. All of this is strongly related with variance. If the variance approaches to zero, then theory tells me that SNR goes to infinity (a really good signal), but the signal that I will have is useless.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to measure the SNR then I have mentioned?</p>

"Is there a relation between speed of executing a task and ones intelligence?","<p>I recently came across a code refactoring problem.

"Isolating the desired event in EEG signals","<p>When we took an EEG data from subjects, does the subject have to be in  ""neutral state"" i.e there is no anger, no sadness,   no happiness ...etc. and they also in situation that they  neither do any logical operations nor any concerns in their life events?</p>

<p>Often when I read in the literature, they assume that the subject is in this situation above! For example if someone want to elicit the emotion state on the subject from an EEG signal , it's feature extraction process depends on the variance of the signal, and it's assumed that all variance in the EEG is for only the emotions. The brain process a lot of processes, and the signal will contains Emotion , logical operation ,  the usually processes to organize human functions ... etc . </p>

<p>So what is the rational judgment on this experiment? Assuming that the subject so clever and operated with experimenter, how much will he really control on his mind behavior?</p>

<p>In short : <strong>how can we depend on parameters (i.e variance) for evidence when this parameter does not only depend on the behavior that we want to make a decision with?</strong></p>

<p>I know that when we deal with event related potentials (ERPs) , we  make the parameters  highly dependent on that event , but this is does not apply on inner-voice research.</p>

"Does a condition exist that resembles autism, but featuring much instead of little empathy?","<p>I recently read a book by an autistic author who relates his experiences in professional life in IT. (He was diagnosed only in mid adulthood.) Colleagues see him as highly intelligent but also stubborn and egocentric. He explains that he cannot read people's faces  and therefore misses out on the non-verbal part of human communication, which is 80%. Because he cannot remember faces, he often cannot greet acquaintances, which obviously causes consternations. One also gets the sense that neither would be inclined to do so because he abhors all situations with idle small talk. </p>

<p>Many outer markers of his biography reminded me of a friend of mine: also high IQ, also in IT, with his private life (perennial single) and professional life now somewhat in shambles. That friend also often irritates people and avoids small talk. But while he seems similar to an autist on the surface he may be very different on a deeper level. </p>

<p>Whereas the autistic author (at least by his own account) has very little empathy, this friend may have too much. He can (or ""can"") read the faces of other humans, but somehow he does not seem to be able to trust much of what he sees. Some of his intelligence seems to stem from being constantly on the guard, as if to form models in his head about what really is going on and where he can fit in, but never arriving at safe conclusions. I know that there were unspoken tensions between his parents when he grew up. He is not obviously constrained in public and dear to some who know him well, but struggles with the scale of human relationships in between at a severe price.</p>

"Can information theory be applied to human interactions and communication?","<p>I am not sure if this question is better suited for the computational science SE. </p>

<p>I learned a bit of Shannon's information theory in a course I took last year. In the class it was defined as the quantitative relaying of information between a signal and a receiver across a medium that introduces noise. In all the examples we explored it was typically defined in terms bits of information that can be quantified and conveyed across the communication channel. Some examples we discussed were data compression, the transfer of DNA from parent cells to daughter cells, and aspects of speech/written words.</p>

<p>Let's say two individuals are in conversation. One speaks a phrase communicating his current state of mind. He then speaks the phrase out loud. The second individual hears this phrase. She then processes it based on her own brain and the way it functions and produces a response. </p>

<p>Here the signal would be the person speaking the phrase and the receiver would be the person interpreting the phrase. Could we argue that the ""noise"" in this communication is the subjectivity of the two people? The first person is attempting to convey information that is derived from his particular subjective state and whatever patterns were generated by his brain from his experiences. The second person would have to weight this information against her subjective state and past experiences with the first person. This might introduce ""noise"" that would affect the intended interpretation of the phrase.</p>

<p>Essentially, my question is with regards to social communication - sometimes you must know the appropriate way to phrase something so that the correct information is conveyed and is not subject to misinterpretation.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Would this be a proper application of information theory?</strong></p>

<p>Note here that I am not talking about the actual information content of the sentences themselves (which may be noisy if imprecise language is used) but the interpretation on the part of the two people in communication.</p>

"What motivates individuals to engage in cyberbullying?","<p>With the advent and proliferation of social media, forums and q&amp;a sites, there has been a matching increase in the incidents of online-bullying, or 'cyber-bullying, that goes beyond <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/78/what-is-the-psychology-behind-trolling"">trolling</a>. All too many times, the consequences of this kind of bullying (like any type of bullying) can be tragic.</p>

<p>What is the psychological motivation behind the cyber-bully?  Is it a consequence of them feeling empowered by their apparent anonymity?</p>

<p>I have read the post <a href=""https://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/4076/why-do-teenagers-take-the-internet-and-cyberbullying-so-seriously"">""Why do teenagers take the internet and cyberbullying so seriously?""</a>, but my question is focused on the psychological motivations that the perpetrator of cyberbulling has, not why it is so damaging to the victims.</p>

"Why is the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard so intolerable?","<p>I am curious as to what current research shows regarding why scraping noises such as fingernails on a chalkboard, a knife/fork scraping against a plate, metal grinding against metal or stone etc are so intolerable to humans. In doing some initial research for this I read <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_of_fingernails_scraping_chalkboard"">the wikipedia article on Sound of fingernails scraping chalkboard</a> (there's a wikipedia article on everything!) but I am looking for more references or updated research.</p>

<p>From the reading I have done, there seems to be two competing theories:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sound is reminiscent of the warning calls of primates and triggers an evolutionary response left over from an earlier age designed to protect us from predators</li>
<li>The sound hits a resonante frequency of the inner ear which causes it to be particularly intolerable</li>
</ul>

<p>To me personally the first theory makes very little sense. Hearing the warning calls of primates does not personally trigger anywhere near the same feelings of extreme frustration and irritability that I feel when I accidentally scrape my knife on my plate. Furthermore the feelings caused by the ""nails on a chalkboard"" sound do not at all trigger a fight-or-flight response or put me on edge as a loud noise or something that startles me does. If anything it is almost paralyzing, which seems counter to the evolutionary theory.</p>

<p>How accurate is the wikipedia article? Is there any newer / more widely accepted research available on what causes the sound of ""fingernails on a chalkboard"" to be so intensely awful to human beings?</p>

"How can people better express subjective conscious experience with words?","<p>I'm interested in how the human mind works, and over the years have experienced and took notice of a number of peculiar states of consciousness, thought patterns, dreams, etc.</p>

<p>While a lot of these states of mind are replicable, I do not know the correct English terminology for them, which makes it difficult to describe or explore them.</p>

<p>For example, if a person does not know the term <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deja-vu"" rel=""nofollow"">deja-vu</a>, two people can give very different accounts of ""experienced something that just happened again"" and use completely different words, while if they speak of common deja-vu experiences, everything is much clearer.</p>

<p>It is even harder with more complex concepts, like <em>spontaneous, intuitive and non-verbal comprehension of a concept</em>, for which the word <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noesis"" rel=""nofollow"">noesis</a> fits. Without knowing that word, it's really hard to convey or compare experiences. </p>

<p><strong>Is there a way to learn to better express what's going on in one's head in such a way that the experience can be compared with another persons?</strong> </p>

<p>Maybe there's a comprehensive list of words that describe subjective states of mind, developed to help people better express themselves?</p>

"What explains the relative importance of physical versus mental features in human mate selection?","<p>I assume that it is the brain that has put human beings at the top of the food chain (Biped and  opposable thumbs aside).</p>

<p>Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest suggest that the best specimens of a species are those that have the greatest mating privileges. I assume that well developed characteristics, required by that species to ensure survival will will be sought after, not just of one particular group, but the species as a whole. So for lions it strength will be desired, and for elephants size will matter.</p>

<p>For humans, it is the  brain that is our evolutionary marvel. It sets us apart from all other species.  I think human physical prowess is somewhat redundant when it comes to our survival and progress. </p>

<p>Many highly intelligent people are still regarded as social misfits, nerds and geeks. The high school football team and cheer leaders are still very popular.
Sports stadiums are filled and televised, and the regular chess clubs are not.
This seems a bit like a limiting mechanism, where we are not smart enough to overcome our base natures and so the truly, evolutionary, superior specimens are downgraded, whilst the redundant brawny types that appeals to the apes, are still highly sought after.</p>

"Steady State Topography and Advertising/Preference: Weaknesses? Criticism?","<p>Steady-state topography is a derivation of EEG/ERPs using an evoked potential to an ongoing oscillating stimuli called the steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP). Variations in the phase difference between the SSVEP and the stimulus are interpreted to measure ""summed changes in synaptic transmission time"", where a latency reduction indexes an increase in synaptic excitation and a latency increase indicates a reduction in synaptic excitation (Silberstein &amp; Nield, 2008).  This kind of change at lateral prefrontal sites, particularly left lateral prefrontal sites, has been interpreted to show increased long-term memory activation to specific stimuli (Smith &amp; Gevins, 2004).  Some studies have also shown that this increased LTM activation is a predictor of future buying behavior (Silberstein &amp; Nield, 2008).</p>

<p>What are the criticisms of this method?  Weaknesses?  Other possible interpretations?</p>

"Would the Milgram Experiment results be replicated in Eastern cultures?","<p>When the Milgram Experiment was performed in the 1960s and replicated multiple times up until the 1980s, it was performed in Western cultures. When it was replicated in 2006, it was again performed in the USA. One of the interesting observations that was made, was that the subjects in most cases, agreed to continue the shock treatments if they were reassured that they cannot be held  responsible for anything that happens and cannot be sued*. </p>

<p>This to me, sounds to be an individualistic reaction to the experimenter's command as opposed to a collectivistic response where subjects would not only try to protect their self interests but would also act to protect the confederate being shocked from ill treatment**.

"Sadistic personality disorder, psychopathy and correlation with violence","<p>Going through some article, it seems the differences between the descriptions for sadistic personality disorder and psychopathy is minimal, if at all existent.  In the first article it appears  the only difference is a propensity for physical violence. In the second article, the high correlation between psychopathy and physical violence is debunked as a myth.  </p>

<p>Given the similarities between the two conditions;<br>
<strong>What is the real difference between an individual with Sadistic Personality Disorder and Psychopathy?</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>What are the real facts correlating violence in psychopathy?</strong></p>

<p>The excerpts are provided below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Sadistic Personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of gratuitous cruelty, aggression, and demeaning behaviors which indicate the existence of deep-seated contempt for other people and an utter lack of empathy. Some sadists are ""utilitarian"": they leverage their explosive violence to establish a position of unchallenged dominance within a relationship. Unlike psychopaths, they rarely use physical force in the commission of crimes. Rather, their aggressiveness is embedded in an interpersonal context and is expressed in social settings, such as the family or the workplace.</p>
  
  <p>This narcissistic need for an audience manifests itself in other circumstances. Sadists strive to humiliate people in front of witnesses. This makes them feel omnipotent. Power plays are important to them and they are likely to treat people under their control or entrusted to their care harshly: a subordinate, a child, a student, a prisoner, a patient, or a spouse are all liable to suffer the consequences of the sadist's ""control freakery"" and exacting ""disciplinary"" measures.</p>
  
  <p>Sadists like to inflict pain because they find suffering, both corporeal and psychological, amusing. They torture animals and people because, to them, the sights and sounds of a creature writhing in agony are hilarious and pleasurable. Sadists go to great lengths to hurt others: they lie, deceive, commit crimes, and even make personal sacrifices merely so as to enjoy the cathartic moment of witnessing someone else's misery.</p>
  
  <p>Sadists are masters of abuse by proxy and ambient abuse. They terrorize and intimidate even their nearest and dearest into doing their bidding. They create an aura and atmosphere of unmitigated yet diffuse dread and consternation. This they achieve by promulgating complex ""rules of the house"" that restrict the autonomy of their dependants (spouses, children, employees, patients, clients, etc.). They have the final word and are the ultimate law. They must be obeyed, no matter how arbitrary and senseless are their rulings and decisions.</p>
  
  <p>Most sadists are fascinated by gore and violence. They are vicarious serial killers: they channel their homicidal urges in socially acceptable ways by ""studying"" and admiring historical figures such as Hitler, for instance. They love guns and other weapons, are fascinated by death, torture, and martial arts in all their forms. <sub>1</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In another discussion the idea of a  psychopath being typically violent is dispelled as a myth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All psychopaths are violent. Research by psychologists such as Randall T. Salekin, now at the University of Alabama, indicates that psychopathy is a risk factor for future physical and sexual violence. Moreover, at least some serial killers—for example, Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy and Dennis Rader, the infamous “BTK” (Bind, Torture, Kill) murderer—have manifested numerous psychopathic traits, including superficial charm and a profound absence of guilt and empathy.
  Nevertheless, most psychopaths are not violent, and most violent people are not psychopaths. In the days following the horrific Virginia Tech shootings of April 16, 2007, many newspaper commentators described the killer, Seung-Hui Cho, as “psychopathic.” Yet Cho exhibited few traits of psychopathy: those who knew him described him as markedly shy, withdrawn and peculiar. <sub>2</sub></p>

  <p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia"" rel=""nofollow"">Paraphilia</a></strong> (from Greek para = beside and -philia = friendship, meaning love) describes the experience of intense sexual
  arousal to highly atypical objects, situations, or individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which practices that have been defined as paraphilia has changed over the course of time and with changes in ""religious"" control over modern society and so a freedom of moral conscience. A striking example being homosexuality, which was considered a mental illness. The educated and enlightened thinkers of many communities now find such an idea as abhorrent. </p>

<p>What is acceptable sexual practice varies across cultures. This in part is reflected by the <a href=""http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">age of consent</a> across nationalities; which range from 12 to 21.<br>
Striking disparages showing in the Phillipines where female to male age of consent is 12 and 18 for female to male respectively; but for any   male to male or female to female sex is 18. And in Burkina Faso  where the age for female to male sex is 13 for both sexes, but for male to male or female to female is 21 for both. Not to mention the places where homosexuality is illegal.</p>

<p>Given this great variation is what is legally acceptable (thereby one would conclude socially acceptable within that culture) and what one place would deem as acceptable another would deem as aberrant. </p>

the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthography"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">orthography</a>, in particular, the types of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapheme"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">graphemes</a>.</p>

<p>Syllabary graphemes are shallow orthographies, where each <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">kana</a> represents and maintains a consistent sound throughout that language (with some exceptions).
The well recognised scripts of some Asian cultures (Chinese, Japanese, Korean,...) use syllabary systems.</p>

<p>Alphabetic graphemes are more complex. 
English, and a good deal of European languages use alphabetic graphemes, where each letter and its usage represents a sound. The great variation in how one symbol (letter) can sound, depending on the context of the letter within a word or sentence, is referred to as a deep orthography. </p>

<p>Given the level of complication with alphabetical languages;   I am interested if they
can  lead to increased incidence of faulty cognition, for instance, thought disorders, dyslexia, circumstantiality, clang association, phonemic paraphasia, blocking, neologisms,.. to name a few.</p>

<p>Have there been any studies on this, and if so, what are there findings?</p>
