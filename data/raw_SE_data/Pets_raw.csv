"House gecko for sustainable basement insect control?","<p>I'm playing with the idea of getting a house gecko and letting it live in my basement to feed on any insects it may come across.</p>

<p>I'd like to keep a small controlled habitat for it but leave it open so it can come and go as it needs.</p>

<p>In the winter however, the basement isn't fully heated. Some but not all and not to as high temperatures as the gecko would prefer.</p>

<p>Would the gecko know to seek out the warm habitat or might it just wander off, get lost &amp; potentially die?</p>

<p>Same question applies for food &amp; water. If I keep a small supply of water &amp; mealworms (or other non-traveling bugs), will the gecko know to rely on that area for sustenance?</p>

<p>It would have access to miscellaneous spiders, beetles and other random household insects (some flying - moths, etc) - Nothing all that large gets in unless let in.</p>

<p>It would have sunlight through windows as well as many dark hiding places. The basement also gets regular visitation.</p>

"Inactive and scared inside, rambunctious playful outside","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4U9z.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">
We just got a new puppy 2 days ago. Since we got her she has barely moved. Inside she lays around scared but outside she is a completely different dog. She plays she runs but she is still very shy. She was outside in a pen since she was born so I know this is a new experience for her. She won’t walk around the house I have to carry her everywhere and even carry her outside. We have an older dog that she loves but won’t follow her around like I was hoping she would. Is there anything that I could possibly do to help the transition from dirty pen to loving home??? </p>

"Dog continually licking thighs","<p>My oldest pet dog (male, 2.5y/o, shih tzu/bichon mix) has had a little bit of a problem lately, he will not stop licking his thighs.</p>

<p>We've done this:</p>

<ul>
<li>given him small doses of dog benadryl (we thought it might be allergies)</li>
<li>given him pain medication (we were told from an emergency clinic that his knees might be graded, but the chiropractor and his vet seem to think he's healthy)</li>
<li>tried to rub his thighs for him and stretch out his leg a bit</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/QCVwacQ.gifv"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a video of how ""extreme"" it is</a> (he will do this for upwards of 5 minutes at a time), and here's a picture of the aftermath:</p>

<p>Things we think that it may be:</p>

<ul>
<li>this summer was his first time getting a summer cut that trimmed off almost all of his fur (normally we leave him a little bit, but this summer was warm). Maybe it's itchy? We have a second dog, one year younger, exhibiting no such issues though.</li>
<li>he's bored (he used to lick his paws, so we started letting him take a bone to bed, etc), but this seems to be going on a bit long for boredom</li>
<li>he's allergic to something</li>
<li>he's actually in pain (he does not express pain with yelping like our other dog does)</li>
<li>or, the worst case, his knee <em>is</em> actually in a bad situation and needs to get surgery or some such.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, we're genuinely at a loss of what could be wrong with him, since we're getting conflicting information from the professionals that take care of him. Is there anything I'm overlooking that <em>could</em> be wrong?</p>

"When can I remove my dog's bandage?","<p>My dog recently had surgery to correct his luxating patella. Poor boy's only a year old...</p>

<p>The surgery was only 3 days ago and his bandage has already started to slide down his leg, exposing part of the incision and two staples.  The top edge of the tape now appears to be putting a lot of pressure right in the center of his incision and he's begun to avoid moving more than usual; I am assuming it is pretty painful. :(</p>

<p>Is it too soon to cut off the bandage for him? Should I wait until Monday to bring him to our vet and have them examine him then? I don't like thinking he could be in such pain for 2 days...</p>

"Green water after refilling dry tank with no fish","<p>Several months ago, I moved to new city and had to drain my 20-gallon tank and give away my fish. The tank sat empty (aside from the gravel) for several months. Last week, I decided to fill it back up, add some bacteria (Tetra brand, I think), and let it run for a couple days before adding fish. The day after I filled it, everything looked fine when I went to work. But when I got back, the water was like pea soup. I changed about 50% of the water and waited a few more days...it's still green, though not as much. Today, I changed about 25% of the water. </p>

<p>What I can't figure out is, why did this happen and what do I do about it? From what I've read, free floating algae is caused by a) too much light, and b) too many nutrients. But, the tank is in a dark room and the light wasn't even on that day. I've also kept the light off since this happened. I don't know where any nutrients could be coming from since there are no fish in there. My only guess is that maybe algae that had dried on the gravel is decomposing. Could that be it? And if so, do I just need to keep changing the water until it goes away? Also, is it safe to add fish, or should I wait until this is resolved?</p>

"Fleas in washing machine water exhaust hose and fleas in pipes","<p>[Edit with what actually worked] I found out that the fleas were in the slop sink. Once I scrubbed that daily, my issue was soon a thing of the past. The key for me was to scrub all areas thoroughly where they may be. I used a rough thin green sponge and threw it away after each scrubbing. I got 5 for a buck at the dollar store and they worked great. I didn't have to deal with carpet, so I can't speak to that, except that a beater bar seems to work for others as long as you clean the canister/or throw away the bag after each vacuuming. </p>

<p>[Original post - Spoiler alert: It was not the accordion exhaust tube for the washing machine, it was fleas in the actual slop sink that the tube emptied into.] The water exhaust hose from my washing machine is the accordion type and is harboring fleas. (I only figured this out three days ago.) </p>

<p>I thought I was getting to this end of my flea ordeal, but they kept popping up. It dawned on me that the washing machine exhaust hose had a build in trap (u shaped loop) and so I put some flea killing shampoo,diatomaceous earth, and water in there and got a bunch (30 or so) when I did the next wash. </p>

<p>This is the last place I have them (I think), so I am looking for a way to eliminate them from this hose. For the past 3 days, I've filled it with my flea killing shampoo,diatomaceous earth, and water concoction and closed off the end of the tube with some saran wrap and a rubber band, but I still get a few when I do a wash. </p>

<p>Has anyone else faced this? Any ideas on how to put the final kibosh on these last few remaining fleas? I also one or two creeping up from my slop sink and they keep coming back despite my concoction and best efforts (but only in the ""slop sink"" that I use as an exhaust for my washing machine).

I have 70 aqua clear that I baffled with a soap dish and some bigger rocks from Petco. He has an area with some sand I also clean every month. I use a net to stir it up and get some plant matter out of it. He also has some big dry leaves. I do clean the filter. I have different media I interchange when I should. I do small water changes and every so often a little less than half of a water change like 40%. I also use water conditioner. My PH is usually at a 7. Sometimes 8. I have a heater. Tank stays steady in temp 77-78. I really don't think the tank or water are the problem. He came from Petco.  So he looks better than he did when I got him. He is active and eats. I switch his food up. He has a mirror toy he uses every so often. And a clear plastic ball we put different things in. So he can poke it around. And look at what is inside. I also move the tank decor around every larger change of water. He has a leaf bed. And a log. Some floating plants. We also put pictures on the back of his tank. To give him new stuff to look at. But I'm noticing his fins don't look as great. Especially the top one. The one fin kind of curls now too. Unless he is moving. All his fins have a light white edge. No blood or black or red.

"questions about leveling and positioning a 4 foot fish tank","<p>We are beginners but have ended up buying a fairly large (4 foot) fish tank and have some questions about setting it up.</p>

<p>we are worried about making sure it is level, as a lot of videos say this is very critical and we could get leaks if we don't get it right. the tank has built-in foam on the bottom but seems very thin, and also you can see the gaps between the foam and the cabinet. </p>

<p>Is this normal/will solve itself once there is water in the (200 liter) tank? Or do we need extra foam to be safe? We also noticed that the water doesn't seem completely level when we put about 2cm of water in the tank, so we used a kit from aldi underneath the cabinet that we believe makes it more level. Is doing it like shown in the photo acceptable or is there more to making sure our cabinet is stable? </p>

<p>The other concern is position as we've heard again and again that you don't want direct sunlight on your tank or could end up with algae problems. We're limited in where we can place this size of tank, and have a lot of windows and light in our house. We thought that in the corner although next to a window that has shutters and a glass door that has curtains would be OK, but really want to get it right before filling the tank and making it hard to move anywhere else. will this position be meeting the requirement of ""no direct sunlight"" enough, or are we likely to have problems? <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQ79H.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQ79H.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

"Cat suddenly became paralyzed","<p>I brought my 18 year-old cat to the vet because she was getting a little thin.  She was otherwise just as affectionate, playful and voracious as she had always been. The vet diagnosed her with hyperthyroidism and prescribed 2.5mg of felimazole twice a day.</p>

<p>Approximately a month after starting this treatment, my cat's lower body suddenly became paralyzed and she now completely refuses to eat. I immediately went back to the vet. She said it had nothing to do with the treatment and recommended I euthanize or, if I refused, that I should continue the treatment supplemented with pain-killers.</p>

<p>The official sources I found for this treatment don't list paralysis as a side-effect although I did find pet-owners who had the same experience on related forums.</p>

<p>I first got my cat when I was only 10 and I care very deeply for her. I know she doesn't want to live in pain but I also know she doesn't <em>want</em> to die. She wants to play, chase after strings and climb on my shoulders. I want nothing more than for her to be healthy again.</p>

"How can I improve my relationship with my Husky, and it's living situations","<p>I just got a Husky puppy just over week ago, she is now nine weeks old (her name is Nova). She has several bad puppy habits I am attempting to train, and her living situation could be improved but I can't decide on the best plan of action.</p>

<p><strong>Some Background</strong></p>

<p>I have own a few dogs before, but they were all shepherds, easy to train, and easy going dogs. I knew Huskies were independent and energetic before I got one, I just had no idea <em>how</em> independent and energetic they were until experiencing it first hand. I live in the city, but I have an extremely large backyard (roughly .8 acre lot) for the pup, and I take her to the park almost everyday after work. I have done a lot of research on training and handling huskies, and spend 2-3 hours a day on training and playing with her. On top of that I just have her around me while I do things around the house for the remainder of my day.</p>

<p><strong>Her Behavior</strong></p>

<p>note: the positive negatives I chose to teach her first are ""good (girl)"" and ""no"" </p>

<p>She is extremely energetic, despite running her at the park, walking, and playing with her she often is not ready to lie around at the house when I get home, or even go to bed. She takes a short nap and is back at it. She bites everything, I have been training her not to bite since the day I got her, but it seems to be having little affect on her. She will stop biting my shoes about 70% of the time when I say ""no"". She has several toys/bones/chewy-bone-snacks but will often only play with them for short bursts before chewing on the leg of the chair or the rug unless I give her direct play attention.</p>

<p>She often bites my hands (and has bitten my nose once to the point of blood) in a playful way when I go to pet her. But I know this is a bad habit, and she can't control how hard she bites when she gets to excited, so I have tried several methods to get her to stop and only lick/nuzzle. this includes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>saying ""no"" firmly and stopping play with her until she pauses to think about it, then resuming when she has quit.</p></li>
<li><p>whimpering/yelping to make her think I'm hurt.</p></li>
<li><p>walking away if she plays to rough.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As I expected, for a puppy, she needs pretty much 24 hour supervision accept for when she falls asleep.</p>

<p>Also, I have been trying to off-leash train her, I know it is extremely difficult for huskies so I'm starting early, but she only comes to me during backyard practice on command %30 of the time. She gets quite distracted, and usually won't come unless she is sure I have a treat. This is mostly to help her stay close when she is on-leash when I am walking her and teaching her how to walk next to me.</p>

<p><strong>Her living quarters</strong></p>

<p>Before I start, please don't hit me with negative comments about my ability to take care of this dog as far as living quarters, I'm looking for feasible solutions for a good environment. I work full time, as does my wife, so the dog is in the crate during the day and let out during lunchtime by family. I <em>know</em> this isn't good and contributes to her energy, but she is 9 weeks and I can't just let her roam. all my previous dogs potty trained quickly and used a doggy door, so they were autonomous until I got home to take them for a walk and play.</p>

<p><strong>Like I said we have a large backyard, but each idea I have has setbacks:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Let the dog live in the backyard during the day</strong>: I would puppy-proof the yard, replace a couple broken fence pieces, and put chicken wire in the ground along the fence to prevent her from digging out. Also, buy a dog house for shelter from rain, and put a blanket in there for comfort.</p>

<p><strong>negatives:</strong> she scratches at our back glass door if I just let her out without going out with her. I feel this also doesn't contribute to her learning how to behave indoor/outdoor and knowing the differences.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get the dog a play-pen indoor</strong> they have metal play pens that connect to her cage, I could make room for it on the hardwood floor.</p>

<p><strong>negatives:</strong> she will probably go to the bathroom inside, she will probably whine when put in the pen, and may be able to push it around/escape. Also, does not re-enforce or teach good behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build a dog run outside</strong> same idea as 1, except I build a fenced in area so she doesn't have the whole yard, and won't scratch the door.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Put in a doggie door</strong> Install a doggie door through my wall and let her be independent. This is my ultimate goal, I just think it will take a really long time to get there along with training. This would allow her to get a lot of energy out during the day.</p>

<p><strong>negatives:</strong> she will chew up my house because bite and chew training are 
going poorly, and sometimes tracking mud into the house.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I know she is a puppy, so some of this stuff just takes time. But what could I be doing better to speed things up, or help our relationship as a whole? Based on my post:</p>

<p><strong>Q: How can I improve my relationship with my puppy husky? How can I improve her reckless behavior? How can I give her a better and more sustainable living environment?</strong></p>

"Chronic low-level cyanide poisoning in dogs","<p>We're trying to diagnose a recurring limp in my 6mo puppy. Been to the vet a few times, x-rays, etc.</p>

<li>Nitrite 5 ppm (this is the highest lvl my color chart has)</li>
<li>Nitrate 0</li>

<p>I have 6 tetras and a bristlenose pleco in a 60 litre tank.</p>

<p>Has nitrite toxicity to fish been overstated? Why are my fish still alive?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Its been two weeks now, Nitrites are still at 5 ppm, I have upped the water changes to 50% every day, with no effects on the Nitrite readings. I still haven't lost any fish. My guess is that the nitrites are actually well over 5 ppm so the 50% water changes are not enough to bring it below 5 ppm. I'm starting to see Nitrates in the tank so the cycle is progressing.</p>

Its been three weeks and the nitrites have now gone to zero. I havn't had lost any fish, or seen any signs of nitrite poisoning. </p>

<p>When searching the internet the only things I can find are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.natural-wonder-pets.com/how-harmful-is-alcohol-to-dogs-and-cats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Websites that tell me alcohol is bad for dogs/cats</a>, well thank you but it is clear that alcohol is a toxin  </li>
<li><a href=""http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/neurological/c_dg_ethanol_toxicosis"" rel=""nofollow"">Websites that tell me how to diagnose alcohol poisoning in dogs</a>, very useful but not quite what I am looking to find  </li>
<li><a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100225153334AAwudbG"" rel=""nofollow"">A yahoo answers question dating back to 2009</a> giving some figures and pseudonumbers but nothing to back these things up</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the things mentioned above do have the same problem: They give great advice, etc. But all the amounts, numbers and mentions of alcohol are in <em>relative</em> sizes (e.g. much, little, high, low). The problem of these relative sizes is that they are not of any use without any contextual information they relate to.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is there any hard-data on how much alcohol affects a dog in what way?</p>

<p>Googling for <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=most%20common%20dog&amp;ie=&amp;oe="" rel=""nofollow"">most common dog</a> results in the Labrador Retriever, thus we will assume this specific breed for this question<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p><sub><sup>1</sup>Because I feel it necessary to make this fact clear</sub><br>
<sub><sup>2</sup>It makes sense that these numbers will be subsequently different for a Chihuahua or a Bernese Mountain Dog</sub></p>

"How do I encourage my cat to jump over a baby fence","<p>You'd think it would be simple but my Norwegian Forest Cat is loothe to jump over the 60 cm high fence from carpet to carpet.   Currently he will jump out from a covered cat toilet but I think he still reticent about the other way.   How do I encourage his jumping? We just put it up. It surrounds his food area, toilet and favourite window. We don't want him to use an alternate route through the baby bed which  has a rail to jump over- he has jumped in there at least once. Now he will have an extra area of his own use that is not disturbed by my one year old. How do they encourage movie cats?  </p>

"General Care of a Dog's Pads?","<p>Peanut and I returned from our afternoon long walk, and she's passed out on my lap. She is a 2 and a half year old medium standard female Dachshund. As she was sleeping, I checked her paws, nails, pads, etc. to see if she needed any nail trimming (she didn't.)</p>

<p>As I was doing this, I noticed her pads have a few, well, rough patches. Now normally her pads are smooth in one direction (back to front) and slightly rough, or grippy in the other (front to back) and I'm not really sure why that is, but that's normal.</p>

<p>Today, however, one of her pads, left front main (or center) pad, has a patch of roughness, that I can feel in any direction. Need I be concerned? If so, what would I do (other than a vet trip, which I will if needed, but would rather home remedy it)?</p>

<p>How should a dog's pads be cared for, generally speaking, or do we simply leave them alone?</p>

"Assimilating new puppy to cats","<p>My husband and I adopted a 4 month old puppy into our home with two 4 yr old cats 4 days ago. She's very mellow for a puppy and not very vocal, generally. At this point our puppy, Maya, and our cats occasionally get within 5-6 feet from each other but everyone is still on edge and only out of necessity. Maya is curious but we don't want to push our cats past their comfort zones. I understand time is the biggest factor here but I want to be sure we're instilling Maya with the right impression of the cats. </p>

<p>We're encouraging Maya to leave them alone by calling her away from the cats when she starts wondering toward them and using ""no"" on the occasion that she does bark at or chase them. I want to give our cats the time they each need to feel safe with her but am worried this will teach Maya she's not supposed to be near them. Is this the best approach? Any other ideas? This is my first experience introducing a puppy to cats and would love some advice. </p>

"4 month old puppy RAN from crate to her bed in the living to pee on it after peeing outside just an hour ago. Always likes to pee on her bed. Why?","<p>I have a 4 month old puppy mongrel who is well train, very, VERY well exercised (but not over the top), command trained, space confinement / crate trained, taken out about 4 or 5 times a day to pee / poo.</p>

<p>She has a crate and 2 very comfy beds (exact same model) which I bought for her.</p>

<p>She LOVES to pee on her bed (and she really loves her bed as well it's super comfy), has happened many times before. I can't understand why and I'm thinking maybe she wants to ""claim"" the bed as hers but in that case shouldn't she just mark it with a little pee not the whole flow? And this also goes against the principle that dogs like to keep their sleeping area clean.</p>

<p>As such I have taken away the beds and only put it out beside me (so that I can supervise) for her to lie on it only after she has peed outside.</p>

<p>However just 15min ago she RAN from crate to her bed just outside the crate to pee on it after peeing outside just an hour ago. Always likes to pee on her bed. Why?</p>

<p>Can someone help me understand her psychology / what's going on in her mind? thanks so Much! I love my Puppy!</p>

<p>P.S. when she sleeps for the night in her crate and needs to pee, she diligently goes to the pee tray in her cage to pee in it which is great, I just don't understand why she wants to pee on her comfy bed</p>

"Dog destroys everything I plant in flower pots","<p>My 2 year old dog, whenever I plant anything in some flower pots that I have in the garden, likes to dig and get it out of the flower pot.

"Any research on whether we should adopt a companion for the cat?","<p>I have a four-year-old female cat. She had a male companion until she was 6 months old, when she lost him to an accident. Ever since, she has been alone. My fiancée and myself have a very busy life. I only spend 2-3 hours a day at home in the weekdays. My fiancée, although she works from home, she travels quite often. The cat ends up spending the whole day on her own. </p>

<p>My only concern is my cat's well being. I wonder, if there is any scientifically-backed reasons to adopt another kitten, to be a companion for my cat. Does my cat feel lonely, sad, or depressed because she does not have anyone to play or fight with? Will another cat contribute positively to her well being. Is there any research on the topic?</p>

"My cat won't stop licking himself?","<p>My cat recently got neutered and must wear the e-collar as he's already ripped open the incision once. Most of the time he's licking the collar trying to get at his wound. </p>

<p>That's not the problem. I remove the collar every once in a while (closely supervised) so he can have some time to relax. When I take off the collar he won't stop licking and gnawing at his upper chest, upper front arms, and scratching the back of his head. He's not even going for the incision. </p>

"Medically, what does it mean when a dog smacks her lips repeatedly?","<p>My Dachshund, a spayed female, 16 months old, is exhibiting a behavior that I wonder at. Our previous dog, a Labrador/Doberman mix, never did it, as far as we can recall (we had him his whole life, 17years.)</p>

<p>Most of the time, she keeps her mouth shut (barring tasting, biting, eating, etc.) But every once and a while, it's like she gets a dry mouth. She'll start smacking her lips, and licking them. It's not too much saliva, as she doesn't drool at all. We try to put her next to her water dishes, but most of the time she doesn't drink. She did this behavior again last night, and promptly up-chucked a nice pile.</p>

<p>We just had her at the vet, for an all day comprehensive check up and vaccination update. They didn't notice anything, so she either didn't do it, or they didn't think it was worth mentioning. (My wife dropped her off and picked her up, and I forgot to ask her to ask them.)</p>

"Is okay for my dog to not eat or excrete waste while receiving Buprenex for pain relief?","<p>My dog has an inflamed knee and her veterinarian recommended she undergo surgery to fix the cause of the inflammation. For now the doctor gave me a supply of Buprenex for pain management.</p>

<p>While she's on the drug she doesn't eat or do her business. I can't tell if she's drinking either. She is almost always sleeping or half-asleep, with a very stoned look, having sluggish movements and even aborted maneuvers.</p>

<p>When I ask for her attention she peps up and is her attentive self again, but only for a moment. She is quickly subdued back into her medicated state.</p>

<p>She is a 5 lb chihuahua, orally receiving 0.1 ml of Buprenex every 8-12 hours, with the goal of managing pain during healing or until having surgery.</p>

<p>I've decided to do the surgery after understanding what this treatment option is like.  But I won't be able to get advice or schedule the surgery until the animal hospital opens again tomorrow.</p>

<p>So, I'm asking about Buprenex here because it is now day two where she hasn't taken in or expelled anything, and I'm not sure if this is normal or enough of a concern to stop treating her pain. I have worries such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this normal, considering she is so inactive?</li>
<li>How long can she go without eating or using the bathroom?</li>
<li>I haven't seen her drink, what should I be thinking in regards to that?</li>
<li>If she moves as if in pain (limping or hopping gingerly, walking awkwardly, bottoming out instead of supporting her weight on the bad knee) but has a normal appetite and digestive cycle, is that better than how she is now?</li>

"Mouse is acting strangely, what should I do?","<p>I was coming home last night and the street light in front of my house was out again so I was driving slowly down the hill. I see this mouse in the middle of the road going around in a counterclockwise circle following it's tail.</p>

<p>I stopped otherwise I would have ran it over.  Then I park the car and get out and try and shoe the mice away into some bushes but it won't leave so I go around and park my car at the house.  If it stayed there it would get run over for sure. When I looked at this mouse's face it looked really sad. I come back with a foam tray to push it a bit because I don't want to touch it, but it isn't budging.</p>

<p>Then I go get a broom to try and sweep it a bit but it runs around in a much bigger counterclockwise circle with small circles and then goes and sits in the middle of the road again. Then I'm trying to get it to move with the broom and it just sits there without minding being poked by the broom and it makes some sad squeaks and a sad face.</p>

<p>It was really late almost 1 a.m. but eventually I get it into a box and keep it in my back yard.  I put in a bowl of water, a banana and some walnuts in the box and another box with holes on top so the birds don't get at the mouse.</p>

<p>Today I went to look and it had escaped the box somehow, eaten a bit of banana and left a few strands of hair in the water bowl so I thought the problem solved itself and the mouse went away.  But then I saw the mouse 5 feet away half under a hedge in the yard and ants were crawling on the poor thing :(</p>

<p>I got a better box and then I got a kitchen mitten and wrapped it in plastic wrap so I could pick up the mouse and put it in the box.  The mouse was really docile and it made these really sad squeaks. I think it started to play dead a little bit when I put it in the box.</p>

<p>How do I fix this mouse so it can go back into the wild and do mouse things?</p>

<p>tl;dr :
I found a mouse that I think is either depressed, hurt it's foot, or is pregnant. I don't know if the mouse is exhibiting regular mouse behavior or if something is wrong with it. Also I don't know how to tell mouse gender so I can't rule out pregnant. But this mouse seems really unlucky or prone to dying, what should I do?</p>

However, after reading the previously linked article I starting thinking (A rather dangerous pastime). The article states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it’s best to avoid adding neons to a tank with a betta who is known to be overly aggressive. As you probably know, individual male and female betta personalities can range from the timid to the outright belligerent. If your betta has a bad reputation you may want to concede to his desire to go solo. </p>

<p>But how do you know if your betta is overly aggressive? Is it just a trial and error thing, like ""Lets put an apple snail in my tank and see what happens!"" And then you come home and the snail is toast. So you say ""Oh, I guess my betta is aggressive! better not put any more fish in there!""</p>

"Alligator as a pet","<p>I don't have any experience taking care of reptiles so obviously I wouldn't want a gator as a pet. But I might have children in the future and what if they find alligators so fascinating and even see baby alligators that are being sold? (I am using an example of 2 children)</p>

<p>There are 2 main questions that I would need to ask them. One of them is the obvious ""Do you really want an alligator as a pet?"" The other is the not so obvious ""Do you have any experience with reptiles?""</p>

<p>There are so many possibilities here. The children could say ""No we don't want a gator as a pet but we have handled gators at the zoo after school."" or ""Yes we want a gator and we have had experience with gators."" or ""No we don't want a gator and we haven't had any experience with reptiles."" or ""Yes we want a gator but we haven't had any experience with reptiles."" It gets even more complicated if the children are of different ages and thus 1 has handled reptiles and the other hasn't and/or if 1 wants a gator and the other doesn't. This leads to at least 16 possibilities. </p>

<p>The other bad thing is that I haven't found anything really comprehensive about raising alligators. I search on google for ""How to raise an alligator"" and what do I get? I get very few that actually go into how to raise gators. Most talk about raising caimans or reptiles in general(and only go into minor detail about the alligator) and of the ones that do talk about raising gators, most are not comprehensive enough for someone who really wants to raise gators.</p>

<p>A third bad thing is that I am in Ohio. I don't know of anybody who raises gators in this cold state.</p>

<p>So what should I tell my children if they really do want an alligator and have had experience with reptiles? Should I tell them that I can't get a gator for them since there isn't much I can find about raising gators? Or should I tell them that they can have a gator but they have to be very careful since even young gators can give someone a deadly bite?</p>

"Recommendations for introducing adult cats to newly adopted adult cats","<p><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/83/57"">Recommendations for introducing kittens to adult cats</a> covers a lot of good information about introducing new kittens to a cat household.</p>

<p>However, we've just adopted 2 older cats (11 and 13) into our household of cats ranging from 2 to 8 years of age.</p>

<p>Is there anything different that should be done for new adult cats?</p>

<p><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/a/4363/57"">This answer on a different question</a> mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's usually recommended to confine new cats to a small room (like a bathroom) for the first couple of days anyway</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to admit I'd never heard that before; we'd done it in the past when introducing kittens, but that was almost incidental, since the small rooms were the most convenient (and a single kitten fit fairly well in there).</p>

<p>We've given the new cats free access to the whole basement (the bathroom seemed too small, particularly if we were going to put in two sets of bedding, food, water, and a litter pan).  Was this a mistake?</p>

<p>They seem to be adjusting very well so far, and have explored the basement thoroughly, as well as the door at the top of the stairs (sniffing at our other cats through the crack).  Both of the new cats seem comfortable in the new environment, with one of them seeming 100% at home, and the other showing some minor skittishness (but he still can easily be coaxed into a lap for some petting and purring).</p>

"How do you make sure a guard Llama stays protective but is also used to your own dogs?","<p>I have a small hobby flock of sheep that I use for training my herding dogs. These sheep are pets and are pretty used to dogs. I recently added a guard Llama because the lambs were being prayed on by Coyotes and the occasional loose/stray dog was harassing them.</p>

<p>My Llama is a male who is very friendly and is great with the lambs and Ewes. He's calm and comfortable with people and in general has been a joy to be around. So far when he is on the big open field with lots of lush food he isn't interested enough in the grain bucket to come over when I'm trying to collect him and keep him separate while I can work the sheep. So I've been using an experienced dog to bring him in with the whole flock then separate him while I work the flock. He seems to have figured out that this dog doesn't mean harm and he isn't acting stressed or trying to protect the flock from the dog.</p>

<p>If I keep doing this will he get to used to dogs and not be as protective of the sheep? Will he know the difference between my dog and a dog that means harm? I'm assuming he'll know the difference between my dog and a Coyote but I'm not sure. Since he has been on the field I have only had one Coyote incident, a bite on a sheep's neck, but normally that would have meant the loss of a sheep. So I know he's being protective and since that incident the sheep seem to make sure they stay with him whenever they are worried. How else can I get him in if I shouldn't use my dog? </p>

<p>*8:50AM Yesterday's rabbit vet is not available for several more hours. Found another one who is available for an emergency visit.  This vet has never seen a rabbit present with these symptoms. He searches the Exotic Veterinary forum (<em>I can't remember the name of it</em>).  Ruby lifts her head a couple times.  Seems like she might be getting better already, must be the head down syndrome.  Just to be proactive he gives her a shot of long acting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzylpenicillin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Penicillin G</a> one of the few types that is safe for rabbits.</p>

<p>We head home feeling much better. </p>

<li><p>Noon; back home. we stopped by the feed store and picked up a couple more bales of hay &amp; and some bags of wood pellet liter.  One of the three downstairs bunnies is dead.  Everything was fine this morning.  His bond mate is fine. Something significant is going on, I post the Videos online and we start calling, the primary rabbit vet in the area is contacted at the conference. </p></li>
<li><p>1:00 we are back at the office of the vet from Thursday, with the dead rabbit for a full autopsy, and Ruby for a second opinion, as ""<em>Head-down syndrome - All affected rabbit recovered within a week</em>"" seems unlikely. He also has never seen a bunny present like this. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalitozoon_cuniculi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">E. cuniculi (EC)</a> and ear infections are ruled out.  Progress is too fast for either of them. He reaches out to several nationally recognized rabbit vets, but response is not immediate.  After sometime, he recalls similar symptoms in geese, does some research; We have a new probable Dx <strong>Botulism</strong> from the hay.

<p>*10:00PM everything seems stable.  We are dosing everyone with Vitamin B .25ml per the vet from the conference.  Ruby will be seeing him on Monday, for a follow up.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday Morning</strong></p>

<p>Ruby is about the same as last night; 90% paralyzed from the middle of her back forward.  She is maintaining her good bowel and bladder habits.  I slept on the floor with her all night, she woke me up every hour or two to take to the litter box.  If someone is not laying with her she gets scared and tries to move to much and seems like she could hurt herself </p>

<p><strong>Sunday Morning</strong></p>

<p>Ruby was stable most of yesterday, with a veracious appetite (<em>eating moistened critical care &amp; pellets out a bowl</em>), with her appetite dropping off at bed time.  </p>

<p>She woke me up just before 2AM this morning to take her to the litter box. I left her for a while so she could poop.  When I brought her back to bed her paralysis had increased significantly. Her rear legs have gone from 100% function to maybe 10-20%.  She snuggled with me throughout the night giving lots of teeth chitters (bun purs), other than her mouth she has lost most of the remaining head and upper body control.  Continuing Sub-Q fluids, She took a couple of bites of breakfast, unsure if this is lack of appetite, or if trying to eat is to much work.</p>

<p><strong>Monday Morning</strong>(<em>This should be the final update describing the symptoms, we seem to be stable and entering the recovery phase of the illness</em>)</p>

<p>Stable for 24 hours now, no new deterioration last night.  Yesterday gave 1cc of Reglan (Metoclopramide) her appetite returned. She continues to enjoy snuggling, body paralysis seems be equal, with about 10% function at all limbs and head. Maintaining super litter box habits. We both slept much better last night, but up every couple of hours for potty breaks. </p>

<p>Her breakfast is:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 table spoon critical care</li>
<li>1 table spoon Oxbow adult rabbit food (basic T)</li>
<li>5 Table spoons water</li>
<li>Mix and allow to sit for a couple minutes to form a mushy paste</li>
</ul>

<p>She eats sitting in my lap (<em>cross legged on floor</em>) with her head draped over my thigh. I hold the bowl so she can stretch just a bit to eat and relax to get her nose out of the food or water.  Wash her face with a damp wash cloth for clean up.</p>

"Why are my fish dying?","<p>Since moving house 8 weeks ago iv'e inherited a fish pond containing around 20 fish which is 270cm in length, 130cm wide, and 35cm deep in the middle. It uses a Hozelock Cyprio Ecopower Plus 5000 Filter which has a maximum flow rate of 2250 LPH.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kIeS7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have never owned fish before, so reading the instructions on the back of the fish food the previous owners left behind it said to feed them 3 times a day, as much as they can eat in a few minutes.  I felt this was a lot, because they only manage one cup in a few minutes and talking to others it would seem to be.  So i have been feeding them once a day, usually around 6pm.  They have one cup full of this(the cup is in the picture)...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3oNHw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This morning 5 of the fish are dead and i am concerned that there is something wrong with the pond water, pond itself, or the feeding pattern.</p>

<p>At least one of the fish in this picture looks swollen, or is that normal?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k9pvF.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I looked in the filter and can see lots of insects that look like black maggots inside moving around (those black things on the foam)....</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/70vq9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Could there be a problem with the filter? should there be insects/life inside?</p>

<p>The fish that are alive don't appear to be interested in the food today (you can see it floating on top of the water in the first picture).</p>

<p>Also is the pond too busy? there are quite a lot of lilly pads, and the plant towards the bottom end on the right has grown significantly recently.  Could the fish be getting trapped or stuck in one area of the pond?</p>

<p>Behaviour wise, they seem to congregate by the water inlet, gulping at it.  And often come to the surface and just gulp, ignoring the food.  One of them is constantly swimming on its side in a shallow area, which is unusual.</p>

<p>Any advice greatly appreciated, as i am concerned that more will die if there is a problem with environment they are living in.</p>

<p>To summarize the key concerns...</p>

<p>Do one or more of the dead fish look swollen?
What kind of fish are they?
Should the filter have life/insects in it? and is it dirty looking?
Is the pond overstocked?
Should they be gulping at the surface?
Is the feeding pattern ok?</p>

<ol>
<li>Pet ingests the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">botulinum toxin</a></li>
<li>In 6 - 36 hours the pet starts showing signs but can be as late as 10 - 30 days</li>
<li>Symptoms in the pet are generally a descending paralysis, first the head or neck, then fore limbs, etc.  Nerves are damaged by the toxin.</li>
<li>Treatment involves antitoxins (<em>problematic</em>) and/or palliative care, as the nerves will regenerate given time.</li>
<li>Recovery...</li>
<li>Weeks to months later the pet has full or nearly full recover.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not finding anything solid about step 5, <em>""Recovery...""</em>  </p>

<ul>
<li>Is the recovery descending (<em>head gets better first</em>), reversed, or general? </li>
<li>Are there milestones in the recovery process (<em>i.e. when 'this' happens things only get better</em>)?</li>
<li>What are common difficulties that must be overcome?</li>
</ul>

<p>A peer-reviewed case study of multiple recoveries in humans and other animals would be great, but I cannot locate one and don't think one exists. The best answer will be from experience, preferable with more than one case.  </p>

In both cases I added them overnight and over the past two days I've had it hang out in a breeder box right where in the spot they ""host""; trying to force them to get acquainted.  The perculas fared better but they still haven't let up.  Do I need to get a pair of smaller clowns?  A pair of larger clowns that aren't as vulnerable or even a few more clownfish all at once?  Maybe be patient for a <strong>week</strong> or two with the breeder net?  Or do I have to give up and get rid of these clowns and start over??  I'm running out of ideas.</p>

"What causes a dog to lunge at an unknown child and how should the owner respond?","<p>I have a 2.5 year old pitbull/boxer mix.  He is a rescue dog, and is extremely aggressive towards other dogs (and I will probably be asking many questions about that).  However, he has always been very good with people, especially women and children.  He gets along great with my nephews and my sisters.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, however, he was diagnosed with heartworm.  He has not yet received his first immiticide injection, but he is being kept relatively ""quiet"" under vet's orders.  </p>

<p>This seems to have made him more aggressive.  He is now - seemingly randomly - lunging at people and bikes when we're out on walks.  Just today, a young girl (roughly 10 years of age) was walking by us on the sidewalk, and he lunged at her. I kept him on a short leash, and when he tried to jump again, I pushed him (rather forcefully, I admit) in the chest, knocking him over.</p>

<p>I don't condone violence against animals, but I was angry he would be so aggressive towards a young child. So my question is two-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this newly aggressive behavior towards people a result of his lack of exercise, etc., or is it him becoming more protective towards me?</li>
<li>How should I have reacted in this situation? Should I try to calm him with pets and praise? Should I ""rain treats""? Or should I be firm and forceful about not doing that again?</li>

She'll still yowl about going outside, and she doesn't believe me when I tell her that she really doesn't want to go out. So, I open the door, she sticks her head out, and <em>nopes</em> right back inside (occasionally she actually will head out for a while, in 20 degree F (~ -7°C) weather, no less).</p>

<p>Anyway, a few weeks of this and she starts to go stir-crazy. Climbing the walls, jumping on and off of shelves, mauling carpets and the like. So, what can I do to keep her from getting bored? As far as toys go, her tastes are...rather interesting. I've never been able to get her to pay attention to a laser pointer for more than 10 seconds, and she ignores the vast majority of the toys that we bring her. Every so often she'll get a hankering for catnip, but that's highly inconsistent. we've had limited success with a few toy mice. Really, the only thing that will get her attention most of the time is string/yarn, but after a few weeks of winter, she decides that my fur-lined leather gloves absolutely must die - seriously, I have to hide them, or the next thing I know she'll be prancing off with one of them.</p>

<p>What else can I try? </p>

"Should my cat follow daylight savings?","<p>I feed my cat twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening. He is of the type that is always willing to eat, so I try and maintain a strict feeding schedule by feeding him exactly at 7am and then again at 6:30pm. As a result, he will usually be very vocal around these times.</p>

<p>As it gets darker in the fall, I've noticed that he thinks it is time to eat much earlier than usual. Since he can't tell time, I don't think he really cares about daylight savings time. Since the sunset presumably forces him to think that it is later than it really is, should I change his eating schedule when the clocks change? Does the sunrise/sunset have any effect on when I should feed my cat? </p>

"Cats and string: will a toy make this better or worse?","<p>My current cats are both fascinated by shoelaces.  (I've never had this problem before.)

For shoes being worn, they will sometimes dive after the laces.</p>

<p>I have string toys that we regularly play with.  Now I'm wondering if that's the problem: can my cats understand the difference between the toy and the shoes?

"What can I do if my puppy is hyperactive?","<p>About a month a go I got a 8 week male dachshund and ever since the first days he seemed overexcited. Jumping up, chasing my cat around, excessive licking when someone pets him and so on. </p>

<p>At the beginning I assumed that it was because he wasn't getting enough exercise. (He didn't have all his shots so I couldn't walk him and we live in a flat) A month later, he got his shots and for the last week I've been walking him twice daily for 30-60 minutes each time and his behaviour hasn't changed. </p>

<p>For example, last night we came back from a 60+ minute walk and as soon as we came back he started running around like crazy and tearing apart one of his toys.</p>

<p>The ""problem"" seems to be around humans. When we're around or we have guests he goes crazy jumping on everyone. I honestly think I have never seen him lying down in his bed when another person is in the room. When we leave him alone in another part of the flat (because of his overexcitement), he's calm, doesn't make a sound and probably sleeps most of the time which I think only makes things worse as I would think that builds up even more energy.</p>

"My kitten won't stop biting","<p>He is about 3 to 4 months old. I read that kittens can start biting when they start getting their permanent teeth but he bites all the time. We play with toys and I let him bite them but he keeps biting me and other people. Even when I'm sitting still and don't look like ""prey"" he'll jump at me and start biting down and sometimes it really hurts. </p>

<p>I've done a lot of things I've read online like clapping my hands, transferring his attention to a toy, and becoming still so you become boring for your cat to play with but I think being still when you're cat has attacked while you were still is just telling your cat it's ok to keep biting. Nothing is working. He'll bite hands, elbows, clothes, feet, toes, everything. I'll try to keep them out of his reach but he will jump and get it. He knows he shouldn't though because sometimes when he starts biting softly, I make a slight hissing noise and he immediately starts to lick instead. Then goes back to biting. </p>

<p>Also he sometimes starts to bite himself when I tell to stop like he's throwing a tantrum. Like ""No! I'm going to bite and if I can't bite you, I'm going to bite myself!"". </p>

"My cat uses the litter box wrong!","<p>My cat (a three year old female) is great at going into her litter box when she needs to go.  No problems with missing it, deliberately or accidentally.  However, she seems to do it <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.spca.org/Doent.Doc?id=53"" rel=""noreferrer"">This summary</a> of how a cat uses a litter box says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When cats enter the litter box they first sniff the litter. They then
  dig for a short time, <strong>turn and squat near the area of digging,</strong> turn
  (perhaps also smelling their waste) and dig once again. While many
  cats will cover their urine or feces, others appear to ""miss"" every
  time, or may even dig briefly on the floor or walls near the litter
  box, leaving the urine or feces uncovered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This matches pretty well with how I remember the cats I grew up with handling it.  My cat, however, skips the bolded step.  She will dig herself a depression, and then <em>without turning around</em> squat down over the pile of litter she just made.  Afterwards, she'll try to cover it up, but since it's typically higher than the rest of the litter, it doesn't work so well.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can teach her that missing step?  Or is this just the way she is?  If we had another cat (along with a second litter box), might she learn the ""usual"" way?</p>

"Cats and lactose intolerance","<p>Lactose intolerance is a common issue among cats. Mostly in new born kittens, lactase (the enzyme required to digest lactose present in milk) is released in digestive tract. But as they grow older less and less lactase is released and the cats eventually become lactose intolerant. Moreover, even many kittens find it difficult to digest cow milk which has a higher proportion of lactose.</p>

<p>Now it not the same in all cats. In facts there are some cats, who even after becoming adults, love cow's milk, and will happily drink it if given.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some cats who leave even mother's milk at a young age.</p>

<li>Is the cat's geographical location got something to do with it?</li>
<li>Is it that some evolution has taken place after cats started to live with humans and 10,000 years backs none of the cats were able to digest lactose at an adult age?</li>

We know he doesn't mean to, but clearly he wants something. I usually go and put some biscuits down in his bowl and then he's happy. He's purring very loudly too.</p>

<p>We were putting him outside at night, but he has had some health problems recently, namely diabetes, constipation, and weakened back legs (this has got better). He has also been fighting with a neighbourhood cat, which left him with puncture wounds and he had to have antibiotics. This was probably because he was unable to defend himself due to his weakened state. For the time being, putting him outside is not an option. We have also tried shutting him in the kitchen but he will sit and scratch for hours, also waking us up.

"My dog can't stop licking his paws","<p>My dog recently developed this mania where he won't stop licking his front paws, not the thick skin under it, but rather the fur as in the ""back of his hands"" and along the legs.</p>

<p>He's always licking the fur, and the noise of him licking it is making the entire family crazy, like the sound of a kid chewing gun right next to your ears. It's like he's bored and that's his favorite entertainment.</p>

<p>The noise is not the only thing, the real problem this causes is that he is becoming increasingly bad-smelly because of the dry saliva that stays on the hairs. We recently took him to a hairdresser for washing and brushing, and only one week after it, he already smells as bad as before the washing.</p>

<p>My wife suggested it could be the food we're giving him, so we changed, but he still does that. We also got a ""perfume"" spray for animals from the pet store, and we are spraying him to get rid of the smell, especially around the area he keeps licking (maybe the taste will discourage him), but he can't stop doing it.</p>

<p>The vet couldn't decide a reason why he does that, so he gave us a full set of vitamins, some of which I've never heard of before (vitamin K, anyone?), and of course no help (otherwise I wouldn't be posting here).</p>

"Why does my dog become unmanageable midway through a long walk?","<p>Our puppy (8 months old, Husky/Shepherd mix) is getting to be good enough on the leash that I can take him for a nice run. I live near a park with a 5K loop road, which I used to run regularly. </p>

<p>When I first started taking him out around the loop road, he'd jump at me and bite and try to get me to play right away, or at least at fairly arbitrary intervals. I got a good lesson in dominant walking, and a better slip lead that actually loosens again after I tug it so I can keep it high on his neck, give it a quick tug and re-orient him to following me and we can keep going. That had a huge impact--he's way, way more manageable. My pace is pretty slow, he seems to handle it very comfortably, and we stop for water. </p>

<p>But since the walking lesson I've noticed that about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through, he still gets really unmanageable. He tries to jump on me and bite playfully, but he forgets his bite inhibition entirely. The other day he did this really manic digging for a few minutes. Just scraping at the soil with dirt flying and shaking his head and jumping around. In general, it seems like he just gets manic and bonkers, jumping around and barking at me.</p>

"Dog suddenly lunges at other dogs after brief introduction","<p>My boyfriend and I recently adopted a dog with some issues. We know that she was exposed to domestic violence in her previous home. One side note before I explain the issues: We are scheduled to see a highly regarded trainer who specifically works with difficult dogs, and most likely will see her for several sessions. I came across this site after searching for this particular issue and couldn't find an answer so I figured I'd ask. My point by saying this is that I am not looking for some magical answer to ""fix"" my dog on this forum. Just looking for more info on what might be happening. </p>

<p>So the dog is extremely sweet with most people. She gets upset and barks/snarls/lunges when someone unexpectedly comes to our house, but as soon as we greet them and let her sniff their hand, she stops barking and does the tail/body wag. If she is unable to sniff them, she will continue to get more and more aggravated, barking and snarling at them. The other day we went to a full-service gas station and she acted like she wanted to tear the attendant apart because he was standing right next to the car and talking to me. </p>

<p>The other issue she has is with other dogs. So far we haven't purposefully introduced her to any dogs because we know she is reactive and wanted to wait for the training session to find out how to properly train her. However, we had an unexpected run-in with a family member's dog. We were at someone else's house and this family member came over with their dog, without us knowing. The dog came running in and saw our dog, and came over to meet her. Our dog at first was friendly, they sniffed each other's faces for a second, then sniffed each other's back sides. But after a few seconds of this, our dog suddenly became very still and rigid, growled for a second, and then started attacking. She didn't actually bite the other dog, but they were going around in circles until the other dog had a chance to run away and we grabbed our dog. </p>

<p>Is this a common thing? I've only been finding stories about dogs who are aggressive towards other dogs immediately upon seeing them. In this case, our dog is not aggressive at first, she seems very interested and friendly. It's only after the initial introduction that she seems to freak out and snap at them. What might be going on? I can try to provide any other info that might be helpful. </p>

"How long can a cat live?","<p>I have heard that the average life expectancy of a domestic cat in the United states is 6.1 years. I've also heard that there have been cats that have lived for over thirty years. Is there a way to put an educated guess on how much longer my 13 year old cat will live?</p>

<p>She is a small (7 1/2 lb.) domestic shorthair. She showed up at our door as a kitten of less than 6 months. She had 5 litters of kittens, and then was spayed at three years of age. She has never been allowed indoors, but has free access to our large barn. She has never had any health issues, and her eyes and teeth are in very good condition. She eats whatever cat food is on sale, plus meat scraps from the kitchen and a variety of rodents. She is a very easygoing patient cat and very good with small children. She is not (has never been) extremely active, but likes to hunt, follow people around the yard, and play with toys and string.</p>

"Bark collars and ""shock therapy""","<p>We're at our wits end with our dog's barking – he barks aggressively (meaning that if I didn't know him I would feel like he might be a threat if he got out) at pretty much anyone who goes by. He really goes crazy if they are walking a dog.</p>

<p>So far we've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consulting with a dog behavioralist who suggested a positive reinforcement regime (see @Mario's answer below for a good description of the strategy). After months of trying we haven't seen any appreciable change in his behavior. I'd really like for this to work, it seems like the ""right"" approach – but we've had almost no success with this approach.</li>
<li>Using ultra-sonic ""birdhouses"" that are supposed to make an unpleasant sound in the area around a barking dog (the fence line in our case). It was really hard to tell, but the change, if any was very minor.</li>
<li>Using a collar with a citronella spray. He smelled lovely but it had zero impact, we could see it spraying as he went charging at the fence in full voice.</li>
<li>Using a Garmin Bark Limiter Deluxe shock collar (this model was recommended by a friend who found that it worked very well with her dogs). This works – he has stopped barking ""cold turkey.""</li>
</ul>

<p>However, we've noticed other changes in our dog's behavior that make me think that the message he's getting from the collar isn't ""stop barking"" but something more like ""stop getting excited about life."" That's not what we want – he's a funny dog with a huge range of expressive vocalizations (a moan for when he sees something he wants but can't reach, whines, a very soft ""just so you know"" bark, growling when he plays, etc.), he used to get <em>very</em> excited when his people came home, he also seems less engaged and energetic when playing with dog friends.</p>

<p>This leads me to think that his barking at passers by was motivated by something in common with the other behaviors (e.g., not by defending his territory) and that he's suppressing all excitement (and thus not barking) rather than learning that extended barking is not a ""socially acceptable"" way to express his excitement.</p>

<p>So, I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone know of a bark collar that allows ""fine grained"" control of when it shocks? For example, I'd like to be able to:

<ul>
<li>Adjust triggering based on bark volume/attack.</li>
<li>Adjust triggering based on bark frequency.</li>
<li>Set a audible or tactile warning.</li>
<li>Be able to select the type/intensity of correction.</li>
<li>Have a correction ""ramp"" (increasing intensity of correction with frequency or volume of barking – decaying during silent intervals).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does anybody have ideas about how to help the dog understand that the behavior we are trying to correct is the barking (as opposed to suppressing excitement)?</li>
</ol>

Most of the time if we give something new, she eats from it, but two days later she doesn't like it anymore. You'd think she would eat if she was hungry enough but she went from 4 kilos to 3 kilos so she is losing a lot of weight.</p>

<p>It is now for a long period very warm for Belgium, normally we don't have such warm weather for such a long time, could that be a cause?

"Goldfish swim bladder disease? Please help","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CiF6z.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Hi all. Apologies in advance for the long post. Looking for any help I can get please. I cleaned my goldfish tank last night and went to bed early, this morning when I went to feed him I found he is just floating as in the picture. He’s definitely still alive (gills moving) and when I go to the tank he starts smacking his lips (always has for me and often bangs into the tank in a way that seems like excitement), but he’s not moving around or swimming, just lying limp, he will occasionally flick his body to get away from the edge of the tank and he is only using the fin that is still submerged. From what I’ve seen online he’s probably suffering from swim bladder? Although I didn’t notice any changes in his behaviour the last week. I’ve tried to feed him peas but he’s just spat them straight out, he’s always let me feed him by hand and even likes to be petted gently on the head (I say he likes it as he never swims away and comes up to my finger and bops it with his head), he loves his food and hasn’t pooped or eaten since I cleaned him out last night. He usually instantly poops in his new water. I always just use water to clean the tanks as I’m terrified of chemicals sticking on the tank, and I check the water in his tank, always making sure the ph level is right as he’s old now, everything was normal last night, I also do water changes daily.
So far today I have panicked a lot then followed steps I found online to create his hospital tank, increasing the water temp and adding the salts, I’ve also put some of his disease medicine. It’s early days but I’m just wanting to make sure I’m doing everything right.
A little history of him: I’ve had him for 5 years now but he’s about 8-9 years old, he was my ex’s and I took him in. He lived in a bowl for the first 3/4 years of his life 😞🤦🏼‍♀️ (with the ex) and when I took him in I got him a proper tank, I didn’t know much about goldfish then but I immediately started noting problems that he never had in the bowl, I was never sure if the move is what has caused this all. He started to get that cotton wool skin and red blotches every time I cleaned his tank, he always reacts well to treatment and has always made a full recovery and since monitoring the water for nitrate and ph levels he hasn’t had it as much, but still every now and then. He has suffered with some sort of imbalance before, I saw him slightly veering off to one side and so I immeditaly put him in fresh water and I was given a “disease safe” solution to treat him with, this helped and he recovered pretty quick, within a day. He’s normally a very lively fish, he started banging on the tank and smacking his lips as soon as I walk into the room and he darts all around his tank as though he’s excited, I really do love him so much. I guess people will say he’s just a fish but I never knew fish could have so much personality and Mr.Fish really does ❤️</p>

<p>I’ve been out for most of the weekend just popping home to feed him, he’s usually fine when this happens, but shamefully because I’ve not been in very much I don’t know if he’s been having symptoms for the last few days, I didn’t notice anything wrong last night or when I’ve popped back though.
I’m just so worried about him now and I don’t know what to do? I’ve seen so much conflicting advice on the internet, advising to just euthanise, so I’m not sure at all. Also worried that it looks like he’s got a bruise on the side that is exposed? I’ve been gently encouraging water over it to make sure he doesn’t dry up on that side. He looks so bloated and stuffed up, he’s obviously not pooped all night as there’s none in his tank. If this were a cat or dog I’d massage the stomach but I obviously can’t do that for him. So I’m not sure if this is constipation either. Which leads me to not knowing whether I should fast him for two days?</p>

<p>Any help much appreciated, and if I’m doing anything wrong please tell me. Thank you for taking the time to read my post x</p>

<p>Edited to add: Mr Fish comes up to the surface of his water whenever I come near him, and he does what I call a bark (smacking his mouth and flapping about, very noisily) till I give him some attention, he usually does it wanting food and then swims off and stops if I don’t give him any. I wasn’t sure if he’s been swallowing air when doing this? And I’ve always fed him flakes as my ex did and the vet told me not to change the diet as he was already 4/5 when I asked. So confused please help.</p>

"Cooling a goldfish tank during summer","<p>During the peak of last summer we had several goldfish that died after several days of hot weather and I suspect it was related.
According to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfish"">Goldfish</a> article on Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extremely high temperatures (over 30°C (86°F) can also harm goldfish</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ambient temperature sat over over 40°C (104°F) during the day and only dropped to a little under 30°C (86°F) overnight so it's almost certain the tank temperature would have exceeded that amount. </p>

<p>Doing some research I see there are some commercial tank cooling products available although they are relatively large / expensive and this is only a once or twice a year event in my area. A few thoughts I'd considered are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Setup a fan pointing across the tank as a form of evaporative cooling. I assume though that would cool the top layer of water more than the bottom and I wasn't sure if the differential in temperature may make things even worse?</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce a large amount of tap water that I measured as a bit under 20°C (68°F) because it comes from a cooler mountain range. Considering that would need to be treated quickly chemically I could see that also having potential downsides.</p></li>
<li><p>Add ice cubes that have already been treated, but I imagine that could result in them floating on top and mainly cooling the top portion of the tank.</p></li>

Stick to names having two syllables; This will allow it to differentiate between its name and those one syllable commands you may choose to teach it. You can further set its name apart from potential commands or reprimands by adding a vowel sound to the end of it.</p>

<p>I want to know if cats should given names ending with a vowel, and if giving them names of two syllables would help.</p>

"How to clean/wash litter box that had clay litter?","<p>We recently switched from a corn based litter to a clay based one bc of recommendations for clumping and odor control. </p>

<p>However I read that the litter should not be flushed because they may expand in the pipes. </p>

<p>So, now I'm paranoid about doing a full cleaning the litter box...I.e dumping the litter and washing the box. </p>

<p>When I dump the contents there are still some damp smudgy stuff on the walls. I would scrape off as much as I can. </p>

<p>Then I take it outdoors to rinse and dump the water bc I don't want to introduce a speck of clay litter into my pipes. </p>

<p>Is this the way people clean their litter boxes?  What about the 'bacteria' that may be left on the ground, etc. ?</p>

"Alternatives to Renal Dog Food?","<p>I have a 9 year old dog that has been on a renal dog food for over 8 years (Royal Canin), as she has some minor kidney issues. I was recently reviewing our budget, and was reminded how much this type of dog food costs.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what are some affordable renal dog food alternatives? I understand of course that my vet should be involved in any choices I make, but I'd like to be informed about alternatives when we discuss this.</p>

<p>I'm willing to prepare food myself from other sources (e.g. raw foods, cook things, etc), and am open to any suggestions. Thanks!</p>

"Can you use Monistat on a dogs paw for yeast infection?","<p>My mom's dog was seen by an ""in n out vet"", a shot clinic basically. When the vet asked her "" besides shots do you have any health concerns?"" She replied by letting him know he (Henri, her 8 yr old Coton du Tulear) chewed on his feet, and his back feet were red in color and she'd suspected a grass allergy. The vet gave her a spray (Allercain, with Bittran) for topical allergies and a bitter taste to eliminate chewing), he asked her about her food (already feeding a limited ingredient diet- so no change necessary), and suggested adding salmon oil to his food daily, and giving him a half of a Zyrtec daily hidden in a pill pocket or treat.</p>

<p>He's been on this recommended combination for a month with no change, and she said it actually appears worse. His foot is now balding in some places, still red, inflamed and chewing has not stopped. It's especially darker red in between his toes, which suggests to me he has yeast on his feet.</p>

<p>I have experience with AND know you can use Monistat on yeast infections in dogs' ears BUT dogs can't chew on their ears. Maybe that's why it's safe??</p>

<p>Does anyone know if it is safe to put Monistat on a place that may end up being licked??  There's a high and very probable chance of him continuing to chew until it clears up. If he can't be treated with Monistat or an athlete foot cream, she knows he will have to return to the vet (non clinic), but was hoping to try something more affordable, without being charged for ""extras"". She also mentioned using lemon juice, that it's a natural antifungal and would be sour in taste to keep him from chewing, but I fear it would sting pretty bad any areas he's chewed raw.</p>

<p>If anyone has experience with this, stories of experience included with answers are appreciated. </p>

<p>If it helps, I'll have her send me pics of his feet to share with the PetsEx. Community. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I should also add the vet did not perform a physical and my mom said he didn't thoroughly examine the foot (guess it wasn't part of the package- not sure), and he has no fleas, or hair loss or redness anywhere else, just back feet and one is worse than the other. </p>

"Replacing bottom of a bird cage","<p>I inherited an old parrot cage and its base needs to be replaced. The cage is pretty much a steel box, ~2 feet long and wide and ~3 feet high. The metal part of the cage doesn't have a bottom grate - it is only 5 sided, not 6. The base of the cage is made of plastic, designed to fit the steel cage and a simple plastic tray that can be lined with paper and removed for cleaning. It's a lot like this: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QQEyg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QQEyg.jpg"" alt=""similar looking bird cage""></a></p>

<p>The plastic base is very brittle and is falling apart. As more pieces break every time I try to move it or clean it, it's increasingly flimsy and held together with duct tape.</p>

<p>Here are some pics of the cage's plastic base which I want to replace. The tray that slides out has already broken into pieces. There's no identification on the base, just a place where a sticker once was on the inner side and a half-ripped, faded and illegible bar code sticker on the bottom.</p>

Is there a DIY option - I thought of building a simple open-topped wooden box for the steel cage to fit on top of, but I'm not sure if a wooden base is OK for the bird and for cleaning? If all else fails and I get a new cage entirely (maybe this is for a separate question) - what's the best way to recycle this old bird cage? Throw out the broken brittle plastic and scrap the steel cage, or is there a better way to recycle/upcycle this thing?</p>

"Help with Fishless Cycling with Live Plants","<p>I have some questions regarding fishless cycling of a 65L tank I have set up 2 days ago. Please bear with me.</p>

<p>I set up the tank with tap water, and added an appropriate amount of Seachem Prime to dechloronate. The tank has a HOB filter and a set of LED lights (for full details of tank set, see <a href=""http://www.aquaone.com.au/2015-04-16-04-47-04/2015-04-16-06-00-17/aquariums/item/3157-56168"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The tank has some amazon frogbit and hornwort floating around, as well as tiny amounts of duckweed. I accidentally also added in a tiny dash of liquid fertiliser NOT designed for an aquarium (see <a href=""http://www.digit-eyes.com/upcCode/9300633451196.html?l=en#.WdSGv8gjH6Q"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). Will this fertiliser harm any fish I put in there in the future? Will it affect cycling? Also, will the ingredient ""biuret"" harm the fish? I tried looking this up to little success; all I know is biuret is a condensation of urea or something.</p>

<p>I live in Australia, and cannot add ammonia into the tank. Instead I popped in some goldfish pellets and cichlid pellets which I had lying around from years ago. The idea is for this to decompose and produce ammonia, to start the nitrogen cycle.</p>

<p>Today I went to the pet store and was advised that I need to add Seachem Stability for my cycle to go well. I have not done this. Can anyone advise me if Stability is required or beneficial for cycling?</p>

<p>Also, I did a quick ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate test today with an API 5 in 1 kit. All showed values of zero (I even re-tested the nitrate in case I didn't shake the bottle enough, and still zero).</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me why all my values are zero? I thought that nitrates should not be zero after a cycled tank. Is my tank cycled? It's only been 2 days. If my tank isn't cycled, why is my ammonia and nitrite reading zero? Are my plants sucking up all the ammonia?</p>

<p>One last thing is that the water of my aquarium is cloudy. Is this bacterial bloom? Algae? I've also noticed on the fish pellets a white halo of something growing on it. Is this fungus?</p>

<p>I've never cycled a fish tank before, and I really hope to get it right this time. I also have NOT conducted any water changes since setting up the tank. Please advise if this is appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>To sum up:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Will a urea-based fertiliser not made for aquatic use harm fish? Will the tank cycling properly with this? Will biuret harm fish?</li>
<li>Do I need Seachem Stability to cycle a tank or not?</li>
<li>Why is my tank showing ammonia 0, nitrite 0, nitrate 0? Does this have to do with my plants? Is my tank cycled?'</li>
<li>Does my tank have bacterial bloom or something else?</li>
<li>Do I need to worry about white fuzz around my decomposing fish food?</li>
<li>Do I need to do water changes for this fishless but slightly planted cycle?</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't add images at this time for some reason and Stack Exchange isn't letting me add more links which is frustrating. I do have photos to show though if anyone will find them useful!</p>

<p>P.S. I'm planning on putting a betta in there and possibly some tank mates once things are established.</p>

"Is it normal for a dog's coat to change color?","<p>We recently adopted a 7-yr-old Chesapeake Bay Retriever/Great Pyrenees mix with a dark coat, and after about 2 weeks, my wife and I swear the fur is getting lighter, especially around his ears and neck. He eats well and seems pretty laid back, and although he sheds a lot and we've been brushing him regularly, he isn't developing any bald spots (e.g., from anxiety issues or malnourishment).</p>

<p>Is it normal for a dog's coat to change color, for example, with the seasons? Or is it possible for the coat to get sun bleached from only a few hours outdoors each week? It also occurred to us that maybe he was just a bit dirty before, but we gave him a bath when we first brought him home and his coat only started to seem lighter as of a few days ago.</p>

<p>Update: we have now had him for more than a year, and his coat has stayed about the same since that first color change a few weeks after we got him. We've fed him everything from the cheap $20 for 50 lbs food, to the fancy $70 for 24 lbs food (but we buy it when it is on a clearance super-sale), and his coat stays the same. I think in those first 2 weeks we had him, we were feeding him the same food that the shelter had been feeding him.  So, strangely, his drastic coat color change doesn't seem to have been related to the seasons, and it seems unlikely it was related to diet or age since it was so fast.</p>

"Did my recently-adopted adult dog suddenly decide it's his duty to guard the house?","<p>We recently adopted a lab mix who is estimated at around 7 years old. He was first found as a stray, then was adopted for about 2 years before he was displaced from his seemingly loving family and put up for adoption again at the same shelter, where we found him. He's very well-behaved, and for the first couple days we didn't hear a single bark out of him, even when other neighborhood dogs would bark as we walked past their yards. Even at the dog park he didn't bark at the other dogs. We went about 2 weeks with pretty much zero barks, except for the time we think the cat was about to steal some of his food.</p>

<p>Now, on a few occasions in the past few days, he has barked while tied out in the yard. On a couple occasions he has also barked when someone was at the door, including once the other day when I returned home from work and he barked a couple times at me from inside the house.</p>

<p>Did he just realize this is his new home and that it's his duty to guard it? He doesn't seem to bark all the time at people outside or at the door, and he only barks 2 or 3 times, not nonstop like most of the other dogs around the neighborhood. When he barks at the door or when he's tied out in the yard, should we ignore the behavior, praise him, or try to get him to stop?</p>

"Cat is not eating, Fluid build up in abdomen, Ultrasound reveals mass in small intestine","<p>I have a domestic long hair that is about 11 years old and used to be almost 24lbs. </p>

<p>About 6-7 weeks ago, he stopped eating and losing weight (currently around 12lbs). At first, when I put food, he licks it a little bit but doesn't eat/chew. It's like he wants to eat but doesn't. Gradually, he stopped eating altogether. </p>

<p>I thought it might be a tooth problem and took him to the dentist. The dentist found a resorption tooth and removed it (did not have to do a root canal). A couple of days after the surgery, he still didn't eat and was losing weight. At this point, I also noticed fluid build up in his abdomen.</p>

<p>The first vet I took him to did an ultrasound, gave him antibiotics, and said that the ultrasound revealed some kind of inflammation in the intestine.</p>

<p>The second vet also did an ultrasound and found a mass in the small intestine. They withdrew some of the mass using a needle for analysis. They told me that the analysis will reveal if he had lymphoma or not. Unfortunetly, yesterday the test results came back as ""non diagnostic"" (I think it means the test was not conclusive). They also added a feeding tube.</p>

<p>Both vets did extensive blood tests, nothing was found except low levels of albumin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, he became so weak and agitated, I took him to the ER. The doctor there said based on all of the previous history that the other 2 VETs faxed over, there is a 95% chance he has terminal cancer and that it has spreadout throughout the intestine.</p>

<p>They said they know it has spreadout because they can tell by the fluid and the because the rest of the intestine was not absorbing vitamins/food properly.</p>

<p>They said that from the ultrasound the other 2 vets did, they can see that the ""mass"" has covered all around the small intestine.</p>

<p>They scheduled him for surgery today where they will go in and remove the mass from the small intestine and will do exploratory surgery. They will then do analysis on the mast to see what kind of cancer it is.</p>

<p>They said that even with the surgery, he will not eat and will waste away.</p>

<p>Is there any chance that it could just be a non-benign tumor....or even just a foreign object blockage?</p>

<p>How can they be so sure that it has spread throughout the intestine?</p>

<p>From my research, it looks like cats can also have fluid build up if they don't eat. I mentioned this to the VET but they said that in this particular case, it is related to cancer.</p>

I immediately retaliate, hard, just like another cat would, to make her think twice about doing this.

<p>Rabbits also have no or very underdeveloped pain sensing regions in their brains(<a href=""http://www.raising-rabbits.com/rabbit-facts.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even as a predator rends a rabbit limb from limb, the rabbit may not feel much pain at all, at least, not in the manner that we humans sense it. The idea that rabbits experience 'untold pain and agony' during predation, or even during butchering by humans, is not supported by science.</p>
  
  <p>While prey animals are no doubt capable of feeling pain, it is the anxiety and fear that keeps the rabbit alive in dangerous situations. Problem is, beyond a certain threshold of fear, terror can literally paralyze a rabbit, completely incapacitating it. A rabbit’s high-pitched scream is a response to terror (whether logical or not), not pain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comment ""not supported by science"" could either mean, we have never actually done any scientific testing so there for there is no evidence. Or it could mean there have been scientific studies that prove rabbits don't feel pain. Or it could just be some ones opinion.</p>

"Helping dog recover from death of his brother","<p>Two dogs. Both adopted when they were puppies from a rescue organization roughly 9 years ago. Dogs grew up together, slept together in a large dog bed, pretty much best of friends entire life.</p>

<p>Few nights ago one of my dogs seemed to be in a lot of pain and his stomache was swelling. His brother was crying and howling worried about him which is what caused us to investigate what was going on. Upon rushing our dog to the vet,it turns out his stomach had flipped unexpectedly and he was in extreme pain. Less than 30% chance surgery would resolve this and not leave lasting pain or effects. We made the tough decision to lay him to rest that night to stop his pain and agony.</p>

"Kayaking Cat Conundrum","<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>

<p>If you view my profile and peruse some of my recent questions, you will be able to figure out that a year ago I adopted a kitten that was quite different from what I had ever known before.  He has more character, energy, and rambunctiousness than all cats I've met combined.  The last year has been
a unique learning experience for me.  </p>

<p>I have had to continually seek ways to stimulate his brain and find outlets for him.  My vet and her staff have helped with suggestions, as has pets.se.  Some of his daily food is delivered via puzzles; mostly home-made from cardboard tubes.  I've built caves out of old blankets and boxes and put things inside to explore.  I bought a set of Lincoln Logs just to have safe and sanctioned destruction; my towers used to last mere hours, now it's up to weeks, but they all eventually fall.</p>

<p>Through it all, I believe the trouble-making little fuzz bucket and I have come to love each other.</p>

<p>Here are some other facts about my cat that may or may not be relevant.</p>

<ul>
<li>He is mostly an indoor cat.  I have been hesitant to let him wander due to neighborhood dogs and hawks.  But I have taken him out on a harness and lead.  He completely ignores barking, lawn mowers, and other noise from beyond the chain-link fences as he merrily chases insects and paws at weeds.  He squirms a little when I put the harness on, but as soon as it is on, he goes straight to the back door and paws at it.</li>
<li>He has a thing with water.  If I accidentally leave the toilet seat up, I will soon find water splashed all over the floors and walls of the bathroom.  He likes to go into the bathtub when it is not in use and roll around.  The water in his bowl is as likely to be splashed around as it is    to be lapped up.</li>
<li>He is picky regarding affection.  If I come to him, he will tolerate only a little tickling and does <strong>not</strong> want to be picked up.  If he comes to me, he will cuddle up as tight as he can and totally give himself over to all kinds of tickling and rubbing.  Then five minutes later, he will leave.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>

<p>Now that he is basically an adult, a family member said to me, ""Why don't you teach him to ride in your kayak with you?""  At first I dismissed the idea
as absurd.  Now, as the thought has germinated in my brain for a while, I am starting to consider it.  As autumn is currently setting in, I am packing up and winterizing all my boat gear.  But come April 2017, as the cat nears two years old, I may just see what happens.  (I've seen the moturrsikling kitteh on the interwebs, so why not?)  Officially, I am still undecided.  I am curious
what suggestions this community might provide.</p>

<p>I've had some ideas for experimenting with his reactions and acclimating him that I have considered.</p>

<p>Over winter:    </p>

<ul>
<li>Bringing the kayak into the house for an hour every couple weeks.  Let him sniff at it and explore inside.  Then sit it myself, and get him to sit with me.  Put treats in it for extra motivation</li>
<li>Get a PFD for him (possibly another question) and have him wear it at the same time the kayak is inside the house.</li>
</ul>

<p>When spring arrives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take him for walks on a lead along the shoreline, letting him see and smell the concept of ""Lake.""</li>
<li>Float the kayak in shallow water, put him inside with his PFD and on a lead, and wade along side, able to take him to shore immediately if anything goes wrong.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My questions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Should I even try it at all?</li>
<li>Any feedback or suggested changes or improvements to my own ideas?</li>
<li>What else can/should I do over the winter to prepare?</li>
<li>What else can/should I do come spring before trying a full-blown ride with him?</li>

"Dog restless at night in new crate","<p>We've had our 15 month old Golden mix for over a year now. He's usually crated at night, and he's been sleeping well. He usually wakes up before us but doesn't make a peep till he sees us stirring - he's awesome that way.</p>

<p>We noticed that he tries to stretch while in the crate. As the crate is only 36 inches long and he's around 25 inches long he was not able to stretch to his heart's content. We bought a larger crate a few days ago and donated the old one to a shelter. Now at night though, he seems a little restless. Every night since he's been in the new crate, he gently barks at around 2am and wakes us up. Once we let him onto our bed, he curls up and sleeps peacefully.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the new crate is new big for him, that he liked the cosiness of the old one better? Or could this be a case of him 'breaking in' the new crate? We're trying to not encourage him to sleep on our bed as this could be a painful habit going forward.</p>

<p>Either way - are there any suggestions to help him (and us!) sleep at night?</p>

"What to do with a kitten a week after spay?","<p>My 5 1/2 month old kitten got spayed yesterday! The vet said to leave the e-collar on for 14 days, and to try to keep her from exerting herself too much. They recommended I keep her in a safe place where she won't be able to jump a lot until she is recovered, to allow the incision to heal. I kept her in the bathroom overnight to be safe, but she will jump at the door if she knows I'm in the apartment, so other than that I've let her roam as usual and just kept a close eye on her.</p>

<p>I will be out of town next weekend for three days (days 8-10 after the surgery) so I'm trying to figure out what to do. The other times I've been out of town, I've gotten a sitter to come check on her in my apartment - she seems lonely when I get back, but otherwise fine. The other option is boarding, which I did for one day at the vet's, and she seemed terrified when I got her back and took a while to unwind.</p>

<p>My concern is that leaving her at home with a cone and a not-totally-healed incision is dangerous, even with someone coming by once or twice a day. (Also, leaving her in small bathroom for that long seems cruel.) On the other hand, I am worried that boarding her would cause too much stress. On the <em>other</em> other hand, this is my first cat and I've read elsewhere that kittens are usually fine after a couple days, so maybe it's not a big deal?</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of hiring a cat-sitter vs. boarding in this situation? Are there other options or concerns I should consider?</p>

"Hard to find black kitten, has something changed?","<p>I got 3 kittens 16 years ago. I used the ""Want Advertiser"" which was a paper classifieds magazine for the local area (Massachusetts). There were tons of ads for free kittens, so I picked one and ended up taking all three that the family had, which were 3 all-black male American shorthairs.</p>

<p>Fast forward 16 years. One of my cats has died and the other 2 are getting older, so I am looking to get a new cat. I want to get the same type, which is an all-black American shorthair. Unfortunately, this seems impossible to do.</p>

<p>The Want Advertiser went out of business, so that is no longer an option. I have been checking Craigslist for 3 months and have found only 3 female black kittens, and none of the sellers returned my phone calls. Not only that there are literally 10 ISO (in search of) ads WANTING kittens for every kitten being offered. I tried going to a ""shelter"" named ""Buddy Dog"" but that was useless because they had no black kittens and all their kittens were sexually mutilated, which I do not want.</p>

<p>I am willing to pay any amount of money to get a local all-black kitten, but apparently that does not matter because noone breeds them. They only breed ""exotic"" cats like Bombays and Persians, so I can't buy one from a breeder.</p>

"Rectifying behavioral issues stemmed from hitting my dog as punishment","<p>Okay, now I know opinions are largely divided on whether negative or positive reinforcement is the best way to discipline a dog, <em>that's not my question</em>.</p>

<p>From since she was a puppy (she's a 10 month old Bichon Frise), I've always hit her nose to discipline her, which seemed to work effectively. <strong>However</strong>, she's now exhibiting some behavioral issues that I want to try and get rid of before it's two late.</p>

<p>I've decided I need a better approach at discipline, namely positive reinforcement. In the case of her doing something wrong, I'll simply ignore her or put her in the kitchen for a short period (15 minutes). If she's good, she'll get loads of praise/treats (I already do this after walks/after crying to go out at the door, then going out to do her business).</p>

<p>Basically, there's a few things she now does. Some are probably not directly related to the negative reinforcement, but I'm unsure as to which are a direct result.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>She is scared of strangers</strong> - Whilst out walking, if a stranger reaches out a hand to stroke her, her initial reaction is to run a mile or growl (I've read that this is a side effect of negative reinforcement). She will sniff and try and follow strangers though, strangely.</li>
<li><strong>She is scared of other dogs</strong> - Now, if another dog comes up to here, initially she will run a mile. If another dog doesn't acknowledge her, she'll either growl or run to see them.</li>
<li><strong>All she does is be aggressive towards my mother's Bichon</strong> - Well it's more like aggresive play, she'll basically bite at the other dog's joules constantly and wherever the other dog goes, she has to go first and get in front of (something like little dog syndrome).</li>
<li><strong>She barks all day at anything that makes a sound/goes past the window</strong> - I think nothing can be done about this, it's more a territorial thing. Weirdly though, she's about 10x worse than my Mother's Bichon (who's 4 year old).</li>
</ul>

<p>1) Is it too late in my dog's learning cycle to rectify the behavioral issues?</p>

<p>2) How can I rectify these issues and what discipline strategy should I now employ?</p>

"Why does my cat act hostile towards my other cat after being kenneled for a week?","<p>I have three cats, a male red tabby (Ed) and two black cats, father (Boo) and daughter. All three cats have lived together for the majority of their lives (13-ish years). They get along fine, aside from the normal morning batting at the food bowl between the males. They've been around each other and coexist quite well. </p>

<p>I just got back from a week-long vacation. We had to kennel all three of our cats at the vet. There were no issues reported. </p>

<p>Upon releasing all three cats back at our house, my red-tabby - Ed - started hissing at the black male - Boo. He then ran away and promptly tried to spray on a box. Both Ed and Boo have sprayed before, but it's a habit we have broken. Ed went on to attempt to spray on several other surfaces. </p>

<p>When separate from Boo, Ed acts perfectly normal. He tries to sniff everything - totally expected - but other than that he is responsive to me and purrs just fine. When he sees a black cat though - Boo or his daughter - he tries to get away and spray on something. If he's cornered he'll growl or hiss at them as he rushes by. </p>

<p><strong>Why is this, and what can I do about it?</strong> </p>

<p>Keeping the cats separate is a temporary option, but it doesn't work too well overnight, as the cats will invariably want to roam around the rest of the house at night, and complain loudly if they can't. Not very conducive to sleeping. Is there perhaps a way I can convince Ed that he doesn't need to defend his territory from Boo (I assume that's what's going on)? </p>

<p>Interestingly, neither Boo nor his daughter have the same behavior. They are simply sniffing everything and slowly returning to normal. They exhibit no other strange behavior, and act fine around Ed. </p>

<p>EDIT: As of the morning after, Ed is now meowing incessantly. All night long he meowed non-stop, waited 10-20 minutes, started up again, stopped again - all night. He started doing this soon after we brought him back and he got his bearings. </p>

<p>The meowing has lessened somewhat this morning, though he is still doing it frequently. He is sniffing Boo's daughter and seems fine with her. Boo has been separated all night. </p>

"Is 10 months late to teach a cat to self-feeding? If not, how shall I proceed?","<p>OK some background first...</p>

<p>We got the cat from the streets when he was approximately 1 month old. He was in an animal shelter until he was 2 months then came to our house, December 2016. </p>

<p>The first months, lets say 2, we would fill his bowl and he decided when to eat, a full bowl usually lasted the whole day, even until the next morning some days. When he was about 4-5 months, we started to giving him 3 meals per day, since he seemed bit anxious about eating (this whole time, he was eating kitten food, good quality, always dry).</p>

<p>With 5-6 months we had him neutered, and started eating special food, again, good quality, dry, still with 3 meals per day, but he started meaw-ing a lot, asking for food between hours, can't really tell if he is always that hungry, or just bored and likes to eat, anyway, we never give him more than he should eat. This has been the norm until september.</p>

<p>For the last month approximately, he have been trying to teach him to self feed, giving him all his 3 meals together in the morning (7am, maybe 9-10 the weekends), but he always eats everything before 12am. Then for the rest of the day, he keeps asking for more, yet again, can't tell if he is hungry or just likes food. He eats all of his food really fast, and he is starting to be a little overweighted, >5kg now, 5.5 aprox. </p>

<p>Always high quality dry food, same brand. (Wild Instinct). We want to teach him to self-feed himself, since it is more convenient for us, if we spend a day out for example, and I think it is better for him also (if he really learns it), but he seems a bit anxious. Also, he always tries to steal our food while we are eating or when something is left on the table (specially, bread, he loves it).</p>

<p>He is the only animal in the house, spends lots of time alone (>6h per day)</p>

<p>Am I doing it right? Is self-feeding a good/viable option? I am new to cats, this is my first one. </p>

"does my cat have an infection?","<p>Our neighbor's cat visited. It stayed for about three weeks(still here), and it has black stuff coming out of it's nose, and on the sides of it's eyes. It started with only it's eyes, so we thought it was only eye bugers, sense it's a purely white cat and we've seen that alot in white cats, and sense the neighbors didn't do anything about it. I'm not taking it to the vet yet,because it still doesn't seem like something big now that it's been for three weeks and the cat is acting normal. I may take it though if I discover it needs it. I'm thinking it may have something to do with the lack of sunlight maybe. The picture will be shown below in case I'm not clear enough. </p>

<p>Now the problem here is;
1- We cleaned around it's eyes with cutips, but it keeps coming back. 
2- After around 3 weeks MY cat started getting it at the sides of it's nose. Which is really getting me concerned.</p>

<p>But if it was some kind of sickness and contagious why did my cat only catch it after 3 weeks? Can it somehow be contagious to people? What can it cause to the two cats? If I clean their noses (and eyes) with anti bacterial soap (really carefuly)will it still come back? I'd most defeniately appreciate the help,provided details of coarse. </p>

<p>The vet has been costing us alot for some time and it's getting on our nerves. If there are any home remedies to solve the problem I'd be working on the cats 24/7, I don't mind. I just hope to get the this done without having to pay much although if it's necessary I may have to. I have no Idea what this is and I'm starting to get worried. </p>

<p>For more information, the first cat to have it had it only on it's eyes, (and I'm starting to think it was only on one at first but not really sure) but then got it on the sides of it's nose as well. My sister told me it had a somewhat a fever (she isn't a veterinarian or the sort) every now and then, but she doesn't feel it any more. The two have diarrhea but not major. They are happy and acting normal, playing together like nothings there. And finally the MOST important fact, I suspect my cat is pregnant, she started having this for two days now. Can this affect her?</p>

"How to make neighborhood kitten understand it doesn't live with us","<p><strong>Short version</strong>: A neighborhood kitten has decided it likes our place. How do we teach it that it doesn’t live here?</p>

<p><strong>Longer version</strong>: We have two cats. Neutered females from the same litter, about 3 years old. They are indoor/outdoor cats, but we do not have a cat door – we let them in and out on their request and often a door is just left open. They are fed wet food – again, when they request it – and have dry food available for nights and when we are not home.</p>

<p>Another family on our street used to have three cats, but over the last few years, two of them died. They have now gotten two kittens to replace them. That is, they have two new kittens and one older cat. Their cats are also indoor/outdoor cats, but they have a cat door. Their cats have food available at all times.</p>

<p>One day, one of the kittens (female – don’t know if she is neutered) showed up at our place. Not knowing where it belonged, my husband gave it a bit of food (probably a mistake) to make it keep still while he took a picture for our local facebook page to find out if anybody missed it. The owners responded that it was theirs, but several other people replied that it had also visited them. Turns out this kitten likes to wander – and quite far, too!</p>

<p>She has since made visits to us very regularly, often several times a day. If doors are open, she will enter and go straight to our cats’ food (she will eat remaining wet food first and then the dry food after, if we don’t stop her). Even if there is no food, she will seek us out as she is very social. She will jump up and lie next to us on the couch or on the desk, if we are working.</p>

<p>If all humans involved where adults, this would not be a problem – she could go back and forth, as she pleased. However, the kids in the owner family obviously want their kitten to be at their house, not at ours, so we agreed that we would try to prevent her from getting in to our house and keep her out of our cat food. Surely, she would then go home!? Not so much… she would meow outside the windows for a while and when that didn’t work just lie there. Outside the windows. In the rain. For hours… So next we agreed that I would text the family whenever the kitten showed up and they would come get her. That is what we are doing now, but the kitten still shows up. She is super happy when her people come for her, but still goes to our house instead of going home on her own. The owners try to keep her in for a while to teach her where she belongs, but they cannot completely close of the cat door because of the older cat.</p>

<p>As stated, she has food available at home, and she knows how the cat door works.</p>

<p>Our own cats are not too fond of the kitten: they hiss and meow at her angrily, but they do not swat at her or bite her. If she gets within a couple of feet of them, they will simply walk away.</p>

<p>The owners have suggested a next step would be for us to spray water at her. We have done this with our own cats to keep them from scratching the furniture, but I feel a bit bad about doing it to the kitten – I’m not sure it would understand why it is being sprayed water at.</p>

<p>Including the first time my husband fed her, she has probably eaten here 3-4 times (the other times by simply walking into the house when the door was open). The jumping onto the couch/desk was one day – the day we realized she felt so much at home that we had to talk with the owner family to find out what they wanted us to do. Trying to keep her out of the house and texting the owners has gone on for about a week.</p>

<p>Does anyone have suggestions to what else we can do to make her understand that she does not belong at our house?</p>

<p>Note: please do not make this about allowing cats outside. That will not be changed for any of the cats.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Here, a few months later, this is how things have developed. For a while it seemed like ignoring the kitten helped (from facebook we gathered that she found other neighbours to visit), but then she started returning again. Her constant visits bagan stressing our own cats a great deal, so in the end we resorted to spraying her with water. This was actually pretty efficient, and soon she stopped coming by. We know from the owners that she has a bit less wanderlust now, but still doesn't hold back from entering the houses of other neighbours - but we haven't seen her at our house for well over a month now.</p>

"My cat vomited and pooped in the house?","<p>My cat pooped on my bed last night and a few days ago my sister noticed he vomited on the floor. He's a little over a year and usually goes out in the garden to poop. We haven't changed the kind of food we give him, but up until now there was always someone home to give the cats food. </p>

<p>Now with school starting they get food at around 6 am and then again not until 3 pm; could it just be him reacting badly to the sudden change in the feeding schedule? Or that he ate too much too quickly? Could it point to something more serious? Up until now he hasn't been sick and he's acting pretty much like usual, maybe only a bit strange.</p>

"Why does every single dog seem to hate mine?","<p>I have a 7 year old female Pomeranian.</p>

<p>I take her out for a walk to a nearby park in the neighborhood every now and then. But in various occasions, when leaving home, she appears to be terrified even though there is literally no threat I can observe.</p>

<p>When this happens, I walk her out anyway (sometimes I have to lift her up) - and whenever she is afraid I know it's because there are dogs in the garages of the neighborhood houses. It's interesting because you have to walk quite a distance before you can see the dogs, so it's like she can smell them from far away or something.</p>

<p>Anyway, her fear doesn't seem to be irrational either: <strong>every single dog</strong> will bark and snarl at her from the garages. Small and big, male and female, they all seem to hate my pomeranian for some reason. And my dog knows!</p>

<p>What makes this especially weird is that I've seen people walking their dogs around the neighborhood and they don't get the same treatment.</p>

<p>It's not just garage dogs - dogs that are being walked at the same time also seem to dislike mine.</p>

<p>Funnily, I've found two stray dogs that are not aggressive against mine and surprisingly my dog is not afraid of them either (not even her sixth sense seems to kick in). It's really weird.</p>

<p>For this reason I have always avoided letting her interact with <em>those</em> dogs in fear that they'll attack her or something (they look angry and my dog is clearly afraid).</p>

<hr>

<p>Why does this happen, and am I overreacting? Should I let my dog interact with them and see what happens?</p>

"Is it possible to train a dog to use a litterbox?","<p>Normally this isn't an issue since dogs do their business while going on walks. Recently however, my dog seem to need to do her business more often than I take her on walks. </p>

<p>Recently my dog has been whining and waking me up around midnight to take her out. The closest grassy area that she normally does her business is about 2 blocks away and its quite bothersome to get waken up in the middle of the night to walk two blocks away and back.</p>

"How can I stop my cats from urinating in the pet carrier?","<p>We have two British Shorthairs, George and Martha, 4 years old. Last year, George peed himself in the pet carrier on the way to the vet. Looking back, part of the problem probably was timing, as I had the appointment about 2.5 hours after the cats had breakfast, and he usually pees about 3-3.5 hours after meals. I cleaned the carrier, albeit only with water and normal detergent, threw out the old blanket and put in a new one. </p>

<p>Last week I had another appointment for their annual checkup, which I specifically made in the afternoon, but unfortunately, this time both cats peed in their (separate) pet carriers. Also, I think one of the cats (pretty sure it was George) once peed in the carrier when we brought them to my parents-in-law, but I think that was only once out of the 2-4 trips they made to their house. </p>

<p>So this time I cleaned the pet carriers thoroughly with <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00266V9BA"" rel=""nofollow"">UrineOff</a> and put in a pee pad, just in case (we use normal cat litter in their litter boxes). I also arranged that they'll be fed dinner at my parents-in-law's, so I expected their bladders to be fairly empty. But the very first thing Martha did when I put her into the carrier is pee! </p>

<p>I've read through most of the other questions relating to urinating in inappropiate places, but I feel that most of the suggestions don't apply - I can't shoo them away when I see that they want to pee, travelling is always associated with stress, they're not trained to pee on these pads, or blankets in general, and apart from the pet carriers, they never do; it's highly unlikely that this is related to a health problem, it's quite likely that it's related to George's very first accident a year ago. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I never marked the pet carriers, so it's possible that at some point we put the Martha into the one that was peed into by George. I do know that I used the same pet carrier for Martha last week and tonight, and I'm quite sure it was the one that hadn't been peed into, because we also used it as a crate and Martha actually used it quite regularly as a bed - so that's why I'm really confused why she peed, and why she peed into <em>that</em> carrier.</p>

<p>So I guess my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>What can I do to stop them from peeing into the pet carriers?</li>
<li>Do I need to get them new carriers, and will they stop peeing if I do?</li>
<li>What else can I do to minimize the risk that they'll pee in a carrier?</li>
<li>If I get them new carriers, is it a good idea to use pee pads again, or will they associate that with urinating?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure now that the accidents were indeed fear-related, as several answers suggested. When my husband picked them up again from his parents' place this past weekend, they came home without any accident (surprise, surprise). I think putting them on the toilet in advance is a good idea (though I'll have to find out first which toilet is used by which cat). The cats are actually used to the carriers; as mentioned above, Martha sleeps in one of them quite regularly, so I was very surprised that she, too, peed into it. </p>

<p>I'm also wondering if it might help to organize things differently. I usually bring them to the vet, and my husband usually brings them to his parents' place whenever we're going on a vacation but I'll help him pack their things and put the cats in the carriers. Perhaps we should see what happens if he does that on his own.</p>

"Pet rats companion died and was canibalized, is now alone","<p>About 4 months ago I bought two young-ish female rats, Star and Blaze. The store said they were the same litter but their coloring and size as they grew leads me to believe that may not have been the case.. </p>

<p>Blaze has always wanted to crawl rather than just be held but licks people and I reward her with unsalted sunflower seeds (her favorite) and has never used her teeth on anyone. Star however, while most of her time with me has been sweet despite the lack of kisses has always been very cuddly but bit someone's ear while they were cuddling her against their neck earlier this month. I was shocked because it wasn't an aggressive ""I'm scared bite"" but rather just put her teeth on him and slowly clamped down and wouldn't let go until I pried her mouth open at the jaw. Moments before the incident she was making a chickering noise often associate with happiness and comfort at her surroundings. </p>

<p>Blaze and Star have lived in harmony for the past 4 months for the most part, other than wrestling that doesn't seem to be violent other than a few squeaks. I never even seen missing fur on her like I've seen on one rat that was a bit ""bullied,"" when I had five rats at once several years ago. </p>

<p>At 7am this morning all seemed fine, both just waking up and seemingly energetic and healthy.. but when I came back from work at 5:30pm, Star was dead and Blaze was eating her! I know disposing of a body by eating them is completely normal for rats and other small mammals as it's the only way they know how to get rid of the body, regardless of how traumatizing for me it was to witness. 
One of my concerns is that many times their wrestling was not long after I fed them (a bowl full every other day) and Blaze was definitely bigger in general either because of them being a different litter like I suspect or her dominance over the cage and the food.. I'm worried that Blaze may have killed her either over a food scuffle, by accident or if Star passed for some unrelated reason. With knowing now that she can eat her cage sister, while I don't want her to be lonely, I'm concerned of her taking to a new companion AND that new Rat's safety. </p>

<p>It's hard for me to look at/handle Blaze now knowing that the insides of her sister are currently in her belly despite how affectionate she's been to me and others in the past... And while I want to leave her be to process the death and for me to get over what I saw, I know rats don't do well alone, especially if they have never been alone before. I don't want to harm Blaze's psyche by leaving her alone in her cage, but I'm scared to witness what I saw earlier again if I get her a new mate. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice on:</p>

<ol>
<li>How Star may have died suddenly after having no apparent health issues hours earlier?</li>
<li>Is the wrestling I saw normal, or should I have been concerned at the difference in size and the squeaking?</li>
<li>If I should get Blaze a new companion, and how long should I wait if I wait at all?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd really appreciate any help I can get with this because despite what happened and how hesitant I am with her right now, I love Blaze and I want to do what's right for her as well as myself.. Thanks in advance!!</p>

"Is it acceptable to tie a dog to a leash as a timeout to prevent biting?","<p>My 2 month old puppy is teething and has a natural proclivity for biting things; anything and everything. While I understand that this behavior is natural and might stop after a while, he also bites people and that's becoming a problem as he grows older.</p>

<p>I've tried saying a firm, ""<strong>No</strong>"" and ignoring him for about 10-20 minutes after he starts biting, but he'll still jump and bark and try to bite the flesh. He'll follow me if I distance myself from him and then bite me, so there's really no ignoring him. It's particularly more concerning when he tries to bite people that are sleeping.</p>

<p>I looked through the comments and answers posted <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/1976/5644"">here</a> and <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/a/1628/5644"">here</a> and I like the idea of temporarily confining my puppy (e.g. using baby gates) but I don't have those so I resort to putting a leash on him and tying him to a newel post.</p>

<p>That results in him calming down after a while but not before he barks incessantly and tries to break free of the leash. After a few minutes, he'll whine and guilt-trip me into cutting him loose, which I do. However, the biting behavior will still continue albeit after a little while.</p>

<p>So my question is this: ""Is it okay if I tie him to a post temporarily if I am unable to effectively distance myself from him while he's biting? If not, what's a better alternative?""</p>

"Can we feed our cat with the mix of home-cooked and specialized food?","<p>We have a Siberian cat 6 months old, and currently we feed him as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>dry food: Royal Canin for Kittens</li>
<li>home-cooked food: soup with beef (or turkey or chicken) and some veggies (no salt/anything else but meat, veggies and water)</li>
<li>if we don't have time to cook, we use Gourmet wed food</li>
</ul>

<p>So we feed him dry food a couple of times a day, and wet food (either home-cooked or Gourmet) a couple of times a day. W.r.t. the home-made food he very much likes the soup itself, and eats the meat/veggies usually after finished with the liquid part - so we try to feed him with the home-cooked option, in addition to the dry food. At the same time, I have read that one shall not mix home-cooked and specialized food for cats, since different ferments are required for the two, and disbalancing them by the mix feed can cause distant issues when cat is older. Not stones, but more about their digestion becomes poorer and they don't get enough from the food due to issues with fermentation. </p>

<p>Of course for us it is easier to just feed him with a bought food, so my question is mainly: is there any disadvantage of excluding the home-made food from the ration of our cat? We are going to try Orijen now as the dry option, and apparently it is good on nutrition quality, so with Gourmet wet food in addition, nutrition shall be covered well. Yet, maybe there is some good thing from the home-made soups, which he likes so much? I'm hesitant to consult the vet, since I live in Netherlands and after seeing cats around I am not sure whether vets dietary advice are good here.</p>

<p>One more thing: I've read that since many cats are bred from the species that lived in low-moisture regions (deserts) their sources of hydration are mostly from food. At the same time, afaik Siberian cats are bred from Russian wild cats that lived in forests/river areas, so perhaps that may cause some differences in how they should be fed, compared to other breeds.</p>

"Help! Adopted stray cat peeing on my bed all of a sudden","<p>My female spayed cat Togepi was a stray cat until earlier this year (round about march) when we decided to take her in. As a stray cat she spent most of her time outside and refused to use a litter box since she's used to going in gardens and dirt all her life. </p>

<p>Recently she's become more needy and loving after her sterilization, and I decided to start keeping her inside, with open doors so she could go outside when nature calls. It's never been a problem before, but all of a sudden she started to pee on my bed. This morning for e.g. I took her outside to pee and she didn't, came back to my room, and played for about 20 min, after which she jumped on top of my bed looked me straight in the eye and started peeing.</p>

<p>Now I don't know what to make of this, since last week she was at a vet for a full examination, micro chipping, vaccines etc. In other words - health wise she's as healthy as can get. But she has never used a litter box before and now all of a sudden she keeps peeing on my bed. </p>

<p>Note: She did it again later after I washed all my sheets too.</p>

<p>I have narrowed it down to either stress, or marking territory since shes only recently been allowed to wander about in the house and sleep inside. 
Also, I will be moving overseas soon and my family is moving to another house soon too- can this underline stress be the culprit of this strange behavior?</p>

*I play with her everyday for almost an hour if not more, day and night
*I feed her everyday
*She sleeps mostly in my room
*She follows me around like my shadow 
*I give her plenty of love and affection
*We have a litter box, but she doesn't use it, and I cleaned it as well, she still peed on my bed.</p>

He begs incessantly for food, then once he is fed he will rush up to me and make himself comfortable and practically burp in my face! I got him at 4 years old, and all this time I've kept him on a reasonable diet.  He is super affectionate, loving and great- except for his begging for food.  I was worried it was worms, but it isn't. I make sure he is entertained in between feedings, but is he still bored? Anyone have some advice? </p>

"Can hedgehogs travel frequently?","<p>I am considering buying a hedgehog. My hesitation is that about once a month I travel about four hours away by car to visit my dad. I usually leave late Thursday night and return Sunday late afternoon. Would a hedgehog be ok in a traveling crate for that long? Will the traveling be too stressful for him? Or, alternatively, would he be ok if left alone with food and water for that time?</p>

"How can I train my dog to ring a bell to go outside?","<p>I've been trying to train my 9-year old dog to ring a bell on the door when she needs/wants to go outside.  I've been trying for about a year now with very minimal success.</p>

<p>I use obedience snacks to try to train her to ring the bell.  When she needs to go out, we go to the door, and I have her give me her paw, which I then gently use to swat the bell.  Then I give her one snack and open the door to let her out.</p>

<p>I've tried giving the snack at different times:  before ringing the bell, after ringing the bell but before opening the door, after opening the door, and even after she physically goes outside.</p>

<p>When she needs to go out, she walks to the door, but doesn't have the concept of the ringing it by herself.  When I get over there, she gets in position and starts to put her paw in the air for me to grab, but she hasn't learned to ring by herself.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?  What do I need to do to make the association in her brain?  Or is she simply too old to learn at this point and I should just give up?</p>

"How can I get my cat to stop chasing my other cat?","<p>I have three cats. All neutered and spayed. A tuxedo named Pip, a tabby named Kitty, and a tortie named Faith. Pip isn't really all that important in this question, I'll give more info about him later. Faith is a grumpy cat and she is pretty aggressive, but it's more out of fear. She didn't trust me for most of my life but now she won't stop kneading my face in bed and keeping me up all night because she wants me to pet her. She's about 7-9 years, we aren't really sure. Now enter Kitty. He's a lil devil. We got him in about September or August of 2015, he's, I think, 3 years. We thought he was a kitten when we first found him because he was so small and skinny. Now he's small and fat. He's very territorial, constantly rub-rub-rubbing on every little thing to get his scent there and claim it. Pip, our sweet lil innocent angel that wouldn't hurt a fly. Well, he would, but he's a cat, what do you expect? He used to be more aggressive until my brother traumatized him (more on that in another question) and now he's very skittish.</p>

<p>This all sounds nice, you have 3 happy cats what could possibly go wrong? 
..A lot. Kitty's favorite activity is chasing Faith and battling with her. He's gotten into quite a few 'duels' with Pip (all of which Pip won) and so i think he's trying to show his dominance. He failed with Pip but Faith is weak and old so she's the perfect target for our little bully. I've not been sure on if i should ask this or not but the final straw was when i heard yowling and hissing from outside today. (Note: whenever Faith comes in Kitty tries to chase her so we have to hold him down so he won't chase her.) and Kitty was chasing Faith up the stairs to our deck and Faith was backed into a corner. I opened the door, shook kitty a few times and flicked him on the nose as punishment.</p>

<p>Things get worse when Faith fuels the fire. Whenever she sees Kitty she hisses and tries to scratch at him. Things get <strong><em>even worse</em></strong> when Pip joins in though. Pip doesn't know what he's doing, he chases her very rarely and i think he only does it because Kitty does it. (Kitty is then ultimate bad role model.)</p>

<p>I'm sure one of you will suggest to have them 'make friends' or something but that definitely wouldn't work. They'd murder eachother and if they didn't Faith would collapse under the stress.</p>

<p>Maybe one of you will suggest ""Maybe give one of them up."" However, I could not give up any of my kitties even if i wanted to. Faith, although she'd be freed from the stress of Pip and Kitty will be seperated from me. She gets very attached very easily and it would definitely not be a good idea. My sister (her original owner) left her in september to go to college and got attached to me, somebody she already had a slight bond with. IN a new house, she wouldn't recognize anyone and I think it would be even worse then the stress with Pip and Kitty she is facing now.</p>

<p>Suggestions, please? I am so tired. I've tried everything, clapping, flicking Kitty/Faith (when she starts the fight) on the forehead/nose, nothing works.</p>

"My brother traumatized my cat. Help?","<p>My cat, Pip. We got him in september of 2014. He was lively, playful, brave, and hyper. My brother is a very mean guy. He sees amusement in other's pain and fear, and enjoys teasing me until i break down and cry for his own sick amusement. He does love the cats, but I think he broke one of our cats, Pip. As you can see, he used to be so happy and lively. How did he change?</p>

<p>Somewhere in 2015, my brother thought it would be funny to 'spook' Pip. Randomly jumping out at him, making loud noises, sneaking up on him, just being mean to him and doing everything he can to scare the cat. Quickly, Pip became very skittish, fearful, timid, and overall not at all what he used to be. He's still hyper, but uses it on the wrong things, such as running and jumping at the smallest of sounds, and begging for treats. He's not the same. It's been about a year and he's still this way.</p>

<p>I don't know if we can ever get the old Pip back, or if my brother scared him so bad he's forever broken. Either way, i really want help with this because Pip used to be so fun and happy. Now he's probably afraid of his own shadow.</p>

"What Are The Benefits To Cropping Dog Ears?","<p>Some pet owners crop their dog's ears.  This procedure ends with the ears standing straight up.  I get the impression that this is genearlly tailored towards specific breeds (stronger ones), though I don't truly know.  There are various laws prohibiting these procedures in certain locations (even entire countries) because of animal cruelty.  Here's a before and after photo of what I'm referring to:</p>

<p>I can't help but wonder if there are any upsides to it at all.  Either medically, sensory, or functionally.  As far as I can tell, it looks like some owners do this strictly for appearences.  Upon further research, they apparently have a lot of different styles, too.  Like so:</p>

"Should I keep my cat from playing in her litter box?","<p>I have a stray (cat) I took in a few days ago; a ~2 month old female with a clean bill of health and no unusual behavior. </p>

<p>She immediately used the litter box correctly and has not had any accidents (yet), but I am trying to reinforce her litter habits anyways. I've been giving her a lot of praise when she's in the box, and sometimes a treat when she's done.</p>

<p>But now sometimes when I'm near the litter box, she'll jump in it and roll around or hang out.</p>

<p>So I have two little questions, actually:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do I even need to be doing this? She already seems to have the box down pretty well.</li>
<li>If so, what action should I take when she goes in the box but then seems to be in there for non-bathroom reasons? Should I just do nothing in general then wait until she's finished before praising? Or does it not matter at all (should I even care about this)? I don't really want to take her <em>out</em> of the box, especially if she's actually going to end up using it.</li>
</ol>

<p>I want to make sure she's well-trained so I can begin the process of letting her out of the room unattended, but I also don't want to encourage her to play in the litter box and make a mess.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I had a kitten. My other cat is very well-behaved, but I can't remember how he was trained; it was about 14 years ago.</p>

"How can I stop my cat from dragging things into her litter box and food?","<p>We've had Tiny for four years. She is a pretty typical cat, except possibly for her pouch that swings from her belly when she walks. Pretty sure that's not related to this problem.</p>

<p>Ever since we got her, she has insisted on dragging whatever she can find to her food and litter box. Whether it's a sock, a plastic bag, sometimes as big as a shirt. She will go all around the house to do this too. I have found shirts that were two or three rooms away and up on a cat food bowl.</p>

<p>We try to keep the house clean, but we have two young daughters who tend to give Tiny plenty of targets for this. (And yes, we're sure it's Tiny. Diesel is 10, and none of this behavior occured before we got Tiny, and the behavior predates the children.)</p>

<p>When it's in the food, it isn't so bad. Just toss it in the laundry. But when she drags it to the litter box, it's kind of gross. I have to wear those socks and shirts. Her litter box is relatively close to the laundry room (there's really no other good place for it, and it's pretty out of the way) and when combined with the kids, there's no way to reliably cut off her supply of targets to drag.</p>

<p>So, what can I do to stop her? Is this caused by something I can control? Or do I just have a weird cat and have to deal with it?</p>

I had read somewhere that during play, cats should switch off who is chasing and who is being chased. The younger cat provokes the older cat into chasing her by batting at him when he is close and generally being a provoking younger sibling. </p>

<p>The issue that arises is that after the chase has concluded, the older cat puts the younger cat in the equivalent of a chokehold, which often results in the younger cat resorting to hissing at the older cat, indicating that the older cat has taken it a step too far.</p>

<p>My question is, is this type of behavior normal? Does the older cat normally take the role of the aggressor constantly and always chase the younger cat, or is this some type of dominance play?</p>

"Why does my dog act differently outside the house?","<p>My dog Rex is like two dogs in one.</p>

<p>In the house, he is cuddly, playful, and docile.  My mom describes him as ""a big mush"".  He gets along with my nieces and nephews, and doesn't even bark [save the rare occasion someone walks down my driveway that he doesn't know].</p>

<p>Outside, totally different story.  He walks with almost his entire weight over his front paws; he has his ears up and tail stiff (actually it's hard to tell because his tail is broken); and he will lunge at basically any moving object we come across [I actually don't know what triggers this behavior; I have <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/1/what-causes-a-dog-to-lunge-at-an-unknown-child-and-how-should-the-owner-respond"">another question</a> about something similar].  He pulls on the leash, and essentially refuses to walk anywhere except in front of me. He smells and urinates on everything, often kicking dirt when he's done. He completely ignores me, so badly that even if I grab him by the snout and point his face at me, he keeps his eyes glancing sideways.</p>

<p>It has been suggested to me that Rex is <em>afraid</em>, or simply <em>stressed</em> when outside, and I certainly don't doubt it.  My question is: how do I calm him down? How do I carry some of the amazing inside behavior over to our outside walks?</p>

"Counterbalancing air flow and humidity in a tortoise enclosure","<p>I'm in the process of designing a new enclosure for my Redfoot tortoise.  As a South American breed, she needs a lot of moisture, which at present I am providing via moistening her substrate (sphagnum moss).

"Cat's family of my boyfriend has been scared of everyone for 13 years","<p>I wanted to ask the community about a cat's attitude I have yet never seen before. So a couple of months ago  I got introduced to my  boyfriend's family. I noticed they had two beautiful bengal cats. My boyfriend told me that they are mum and daughter and are 13 and 12 years old. I tried to approach the mum cat and as soon as she saw my feet she escaped. My boyfriend explained to me that she is a very skittish cat.and she doesn't let anyone approaching her. I asked how this was possible. He explained to me that when she was little, she witnessed her brother getting killed by a car and since then she is traumatised and doesn't let any human approaching her. The only time where they managed to catch her after the accident was when she needed to get sterilised.</p>

<p>Since then she has never interacted with a human. The cat never enters the house and stays in the garden. What is strange to me is that I have noticed that she doesn't interact with other cats either . She doesn't play at all, and mostly sit in a corner. I thought it was due to her age but my boyfriend told me that she has always been like that except when she got her babies and was acting normally with them. She feels that everything and everybody is a threat: I tried to play with her by throwing her a ball in a very gentle way and she got scared and hid under a car. </p>

<p>My boyfriend's family seems OK with the situation and gave up on trying to make her more sociable. Basically they just feed her and that is all. He did say that they asked for advice and solutions  from vets but no-one seemed to know how to help this poor cat </p>

"Dog Attacks People he Knows on the Swing","<p>I have a white factor collie mix by the name of Shea, he is approximately 3/4 Collie and 1/4 Australian Shepherd (and 6 years old). These details my prove to be unnecessary however I am including them nonetheless. </p>

<p>He is <em>the most</em> relaxed dog I have ever met. I have two younger brothers, one of which is a baby and he lets both of them crawl all over him--and not once has he complained, at all. </p>

<p>However, he has one <strong>major issue with the swings.</strong></p>

<p>It has happened many many times, that when either myself, younger brothers or anyone else he <em>recognizes</em> decides to get on a swing he becomes a completely different animal, barking and attacking whoever is on the swing. </p>

<p>This has been the case for 6 years. </p>

<p>Important details to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>It seems as if it is the case he <em>only</em> attacks people he knows, which led me to believe that he was concerned for our safety--thinking we were being hurt by the swing. I do not let him get near anyone on the swing however it has happened a couple times that when walking past a random person on the swing, he pays no attention to them whatsoever. <em>After</em> spending some time with a friend of mine, he started attacking him on the swing. </li>
<li>I am able to hold him when people he knows are swinging, he tries to get loose but does not act aggressively towards me when I am holding him.</li>
<li>The actual <em>swinging</em> seems to be what bothers him. If I am merely sitting on the swing he is not as bothered by it. </li>
<li>I have tried holding and consoling him when he's watching someone he knows swing, it calms him down a bit but if I were to let go he would still go after and attack the person on the swing. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My Main Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is there even anything to be done about this, or is this simply just my dog, and changing this behavior is impossible for this specific situation?</p></li>
<li><p>Was my initial thought that he is doing it out of concern accurate?</p></li>
<li><p>Has anyone else dealt with swing-terrified dogs?</p></li>

"Why is my cat attacking my face & what can I do to stop it?","<p>I have a recent issue exacerbated by the fact that I'm allergic to cats. We adopted a cat ~4 years ago, and she took a liking to me. These past couple years I'm her ""favorite"", she ignores the other people in the house, and enjoys spending as much time as she can either curled on me or near me. She is needy, almost too needy for me. She will completely ignore someone else's offer for pets and attention and will spend almost all her 'social' time trying to get my attention or at least lay against me.</p>

<p>She had an old problem where she would randomly attack people. Over time we learned that this was generally overstimulation and we just weren't paying attention to her ""Done"" signals when she wanted out. Usually this would be her attacking the arm or hand of whoever was petting her. However with some (people) training, this isn't a problem we have really had this past year or two.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, she attacked my face. As far as I can remember, I had just laid down in bed ~3am, and she was begging for attention (she loves pets on the bed). She laid down near me, I pet her for a bit, passed out, then woke up to her mauling my face.</p>

<p>Just today she did it for a second time. She was sleeping on my lap, went off to eat, then came back laying on my lap. I'm working, so I didn't really give her much attention beyond when I welcomed her on my lap. She's usually fine with this, and is perfectly normal. Randomly she leaps up and again mauls my face.</p>

<p>The common things I know that lead into this is eye contact (was staring at the screen), and overstimulation (I was not touching her). I'm concerned there's some signal I'm missing out on, and more concerned that it's somehow understimulation (she's mad that I'm not giving her attention) since I frankly cannot give her as much attention as she often wants.</p>

<p>The other coincidence is that both attacks happened the day after my girlfriend took off for a trip, though it's too few times to really know if that's at all a factor. She does give the cat some attention, but the cat usually ignores her.</p>

<p>Any ideas on why this might be happening? Any ideas on what I can do to prevent this issue?</p>

Is it better to decide one way or the other, and then stick with it, or should I use both?</p>

<p>I'm just concerned that the bacteria on the biofilter will somehow be adversely affected by the presence of another filter that's pulling ammonia and waste products, etc out of the water too. I don't know if they work well together, or are mutually exclusive.</p>

"Switching from set times for feeding to free feeding of a cat","<p>My cat Shiloh I believe the amount of food the vet recommended is not enough for him, I picked him up tonight and he is losing weight.

Right now he wakes me up at 1 or 2 in the morning for more food.  So I see 2 options</p>

"How does clicker training stick when a cat or a dog knows there's no treat?","<p>I'm really curious as to how clicker training works. I mainly care and ask for cats but I'm also generally curious for dogs.</p>

<p>So, I've looked into it for both cats and dogs and it's common to both that you basically tell them that if they do something which is the behavior you want, they get a treat! Yay! let's do it more and get the human to give more treats! (and the clicker is just to help communicating and identifying the exact behavior).</p>

<p>So simply put:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your cat quickly learns that <strong>he can get you to give him a treat</strong> by performing a certain behavior.</p>

<p>Well, I've seen cats and dogs following their owner's asking (or ""commands"") even when they know the owner clearly doesn't have any treat. So why do they do it? do they just do it because they now know their human wants them to? if so how come just petting and showing affection isn't just as effective as treats, or even more for being more direct? and if so, does that mean at some point you can clicker train without any treats, just clicker?</p>

"Is it OK to pet cat / let her lick me while she is cleaning herself? (and general cleaning behavior)","<p>I have a healthy kitten ~9 weeks old, long-haired, seems to have good cleaning habits (I found her at 8 weeks).</p>

<p>She likes to jump up on my lap and clean herself, which is fine. Sometimes when she's cleaning herself she'll clean my hand or arm too (if my hand or arm are near where she's cleaning herself sometimes she'll just switch over to me for a while), which is also not causing any harm. Sometimes I'll pet her while she's cleaning herself if she's on my lap; because I want to reinforce good cleaning behavior (I don't want her to end up being Stinky McCrustybutt some day).</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How does a cat know when to stop cleaning herself? Do they stop when they are clean? Or when they have covered a certain amount of their body? Or do they just clean as much as they can in a certain amount of time?</p></li>
<li><p>When does a cat's cleaning behavior fully ""set in""? That is, at 8-10 weeks, for example, can her cleaning behavior still change or is it pretty much done (and therefore nothing I do can make it better or worse)?</p></li>
<li><p>I read somewhere that sometimes cats interpret humans petting them as humans cleaning them. Is it bad to pet my cat while she is cleaning herself -- will she think I am cleaning her and so not clean herself completely because she assumes I'm doing some of the work? If she interprets it as praise is this also bad because she might end up never cleaning herself <em>unless</em> I am also petting her? </p></li>
<li><p>Is it bad to let her lick me while she is cleaning herself? Will this somehow use up her... ""cleaning points"" so that she spends time cleaning my hand when she <em>should</em> be cleaning herself instead? If I shouldn't let her do this, how can I stop her without discouraging her from being affectionate to humans in general? </p></li>
<li><p>Actually, 4b. She only really cleans the parts of me that happen to be near her, and only when she's cleaning herself. Does she actually <em>know</em> she's licking my hand (and not licking herself) or is she just sort of in robot-self-cleaning mode licking everything in range?</p></li>

It was also suggested that as many as three wild species have been combined to create the domestic rabbit.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_rabbit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia article on domestic rabbits</a> implies they all come from the European rabbit or common rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus).

"How to stop dogs from urinating on my entrance?","<p>I don't have any pets, but people in my neighborhood walk their dogs in my street. In doing so, the dogs urinate on the wall just outside our front door. This is very annoying because it stains the (white!) porous wall in a very obvious and ugly way, and there's plenty of grass and wall literally one meter away.

"Can't tell if cats are playing with or hunting each other","<p>We've got 2 cats at home at the moment, both neutered. Our cat is a male ~9-10 months old and my brother brought his for the summer, which is a female ~11-12 months old.</p>

<p>They've met before and during those encounters our male was arching his back and hissing, but she is generally relaxed, not paying him much mind from the looks of things (or she could be distracted by her surroundings). He has displayed territorial behavior since she is placed in my brother's room, with him, which is normally open and vacant when my brother isn't staying here and the male likes to sleep in that room.</p>

<p>Here's the question though: When they notice each other from under the door, they'll both be glued there trying to poke at each other under it. There is no hissing, no aggression (our male gets aggravated if he's disturbed but it isn't hard to distract him, unless the female is meowing). We can't tell if this is playing or hunting and we can't tell if they understand who's on the other side.</p>

"Temperature Range for Fancy Goldfish","<p>I have an aquarium housing moors and an oranda. What is a safe temperature range for these fish? There seems to be conflicting information on this online.</p>

<p>My aquarium is in a conservatory and in the middle of winter the water temperature can get as low as 8c/45f and in the middle of summer (currently) it can get as high as 30c/86f.</p>

<p>Last winter I only had moors and noticed no ill effects of the lower temperature. Some online sources seem to suggest orandas are more sensitive to temperature than other types of fancy goldfish, is this correct? Next winter I will most likely heat the water, but to what temperature?</p>

<p>With the increased water temperature in summer the only difference in behaviour I have noticed is that the fish will occasionally go to the top of the tank to get air, presumably due to the hotter water having lower oxygen levels. The use of an air stone seems to stop this behaviour. Are there any other risks at this temperature? </p>

"Using the room door as a means of introducing cats to each other slowly","<p><strong>tl;dr: is a slightly ajar door a good way to introduce cats that have been playing with each other under it without showing aggression?</strong></p>

<p>We have two cats, neutered - the male is the resident house cat and the female is my brother's, who came home for the summer.</p>

<p>They play a lot under the door and don't show signs of aggression when doing so, although the male has shown signs of feeling threatened by the female in the past (single encounter a week ago and a couple months ago). I already asked a question trying to discern if they're playful with each other or just toying with the door <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/5728/cant-tell-if-cats-are-playing-with-or-hunting-each-other/5729"">here</a> and I feel confident they can get along, if they meet properly and slowly.</p>

<hr>

<p>We've been thinking of using the door, by opening it just enough so they can see each other and get close enough without being able to paw at each other (the door being <strong>slightly ajar</strong> enough for looks but not claws) as a means of taking their introduction to the next step, safely. I'm thinking that's a good idea as we can just shut the door if they get too agitated, they'll both have escape routes, they won't be so afraid of each other and any interference by us (namely, shutting the door) won't get us directly involved, thus making them feel we're getting in the way. In fact, I thought of doing it <em>while</em> they're playing under the door, so that it'll be easier for them to identify what cat they're looking at.</p>

<p>However, we're also worried it might agitate the male because he won't be able to enter. I think it won't be a bigger factor than his fear of the female, but we're unsure.</p>

<p>Is this a good way to further the introduction or is it more detrimental to them getting along than helpful?</p>

"Kitten development / spatial awareness","<p>I have two cats; one is 14 years and I've had him since birth, the other is 9-10 weeks and I found her outside two weeks ago.</p>

<p>I recall with the adult cat at around 6 weeks old he had noticed the shelf that we stored the food on, and very noticeably plotted a path to get up there by jumping on other objects (you could see him observing the path) even though he physically couldn't follow the path. He also never forgot it was there and continued to try very frequently a few days in a row. He was sometimes clumsy with balance but nothing that struck me as unusual. Today, he has good navigation and spatial awareness, he has no problem remembering where toys are while playing, plotting complex paths, you can fake him out by pretending to throw things.</p>

<p>My kitten, on the other hand, at 9-10 weeks doesn't have nearly the same object and navigation skills that my other cat had at 6. She's very sweet and extremely active, and unusually fearless. She's a good learner as far as training goes, and she has no problem remembering where things are in the house (like food, litter boxes, water, play areas). But e.g. she forgets where toys are immediately when they are behind her; when she jumps over a toy she will look for it and sometimes mew and sniff around until I put it in front of her, similar to when I take the toy away completely. This morning she was hunting a moth; but lost track of it every time she trapped it under her paw, and had great trouble following it after she grounded it. She also simply cannot follow objects moving above a certain speed; for example if I move my hand quickly in front of her, she looks to where it <em>was</em> then is startled when she discovers where it <em>is</em>, even though I stayed in her field of view. I have a fort-type thing that I built for her out of milk crates, which she loves, but if I hold a toy inside one rather than attempt to find a path around she will pace and become frustrated trying to get at it from the outside despite having spent significant time playing in and around the structure. Also, when she is sitting on my lap / chest, it is very difficult for her to stay there; she will somehow manage to slide or fall off of me within about a minute even though she is clearly trying to relax or sleep or clean. 100% of the time that she cleans herself, she falls over, even on flat ground. When she sleeps, her head and limbs drift in such mysterious ways that I'm convinced there's a special sideways pointing gravity that only affects her, and she often falls off of things while sleeping or sitting. She seems to have generally good balance when walking on narrow things. She can't jump very high although I don't remember how high my other cat could jump at that age and don't have other kittens to compare her to.</p>

<p>I used to block her from falling off of me with my arm but I've stopped in the hopes that the feedback will encourage her to work on balance and awareness of her surroundings. I've been shaking toys around in places that are complicated to get to and giving her a treat when she gets there (but I almost always have to lead her through the path), and setting up boxes, crates, and platforms in all sorts of complex and interesting ways for her to explore.</p>

<p>My question is: Is she at a normal level of development -- should I be concerned about her ""drifting"", not being able to find ways around things, and losing things the instant she can't see them? If so, what can I do to help her along and build up these skills? </p>

<p>I only have my other cat to compare her to, and I'm not sure if he was ahead, she is behind, or they're both in pretty normal range. I am not sure if my expectations are too high; I may be wrong in comparing my two cats. The out-of-sight out-of-mind thing I can understand (although she seems a bit old for that?) because people are the same, but the strange falling off of things (almost ""melting"" off, which I can't really explain well) and navigation problems seem off.</p>

<p>I've been trying to do some research, and I know cat behavior is well studied, but for some reason I can't seem to find any good information about motor skill and neurological development in cats; all the info I find is about behavior and physical appearance.</p>

"How To Train a Cat 3 Questions?","<ol>
<li>He meows at me, as soon as I get out of bed, for food. I used to feed him in the morning, but then started to feed him at dinner and he meows throughout the day anytime we go into the dinning room or kitchen (which is probably most of the day), which is where we keep his food and food bowl. I thought this might also stop him from trying to get our food while we are eating it, but it doesn't and he continues to meow for food after he has done eating. So how do I stop him from meowing all day and trying to eat our food?</li>
<li>He claws everything. I even got him two scratching posts. He uses them, but still scratches on the couch and bed. I don't know how to stop him.</li>
<li>He eats really fast. I got a rock and put it in his bowl, but this doesn't help. Plus he doesn't even move himself towards food. He paws at it to move it towards him. And he's rough when he eats, so he pushes the food bowl all over the place and spills water everywhere. Is there a way to stop him from eating so fast and pushing the bowl everywhere?</li>

<p>The breeder told us that he is a german spitz small. But when i checked the sizes of that type, if it is above 30 cm height from shoulder then it should be german spitz medium. This bad boy in the picture is 13 weeks old and already 25 cm long from the shoulder. They say dogs usually grow a lot between 4 months-6 months and he is not even 4 months old. Does that mean he is gonna be a larger dog than a spitz small? I mean 5 cm does not seem too much. What do you think guys? Is he a medium size spitz?</p>

"Can small snails bite medium size gold fish?","<p>I have a 10 gallon aquarium and have one medium size goldfish in the tank. About a month ago, I decided to purchase couple of live plants. Once I got it, I simply planted it into the tank without cleaning the plants. About a week later, I saw a small snail. I was surprise to see it but not alarmed. Then, 3 days later 2 more. On a closer inspection, I saw many what looked like snail eggs on the plants and on the glass. Today, I was looking at the tank and found many tiny snails. Plus, it looks like my gold fish was bitten by something. On one side of the fish, it looks like something took a big bite of the fish. So, is my goldfish of 7 years doomed and is going to die? and Will I be able to get rid of the snails out of my tank? I think I have snail infestation...</p>

"Why is my cat gagging?","<p>On a fairly regular basis, my cat will do this thing where it looks like she's going to throw up, but then she only gags and nothing happens. One way to describe the motion would be a person who gags / acts like they're going to throw up but then covers their mouth like you'd see in a sitcom. Obviously my cat doesn't cover her mouth, but everything else is basically the same.</p>

<p>I've mentioned in a previous question that my cat likes to eat non-edible things such as paper, plastic, etc. I've made a conscious effort to hide any and all plastic over the last year, and I am fairly confident that she has not eaten any plastic in the last 8-12 months. She does occasionally manage to bite and chew a small piece of paper, but that seems to happen pretty infrequently and typically with only a very small piece of paper.</p>

<p>Why could she be doing this? Is it because of her past eating habits? Is it because she's a long haired cat and licks herself basically all day (i.e. she swallows a lot of fur)? Is there anything I could do with her diet to potentially help?</p>

"My dog covers food and water bowls with sand","<p>we just built a new home.  We brought our Staffie, Bella, to house last weekend (7 days ago) for a pre-moving in overnight stay so she can get to know the environment. Those 2 days she looked depreseed and developed diahorea and would not eat.  Last night we brought her for her first night.  We put her doghouse right by the back door and her food and water bowls next to it.  I got up at 4am to get her indoors before sunrise.  I saw that she had completely covered her food and water bowls with sand.  When she heard me call, she came out of her doghouse and covered her food with more sand before coming to me.  Very weird.  I believe this can be stress??  What can I do to help her relax and settle in with us?  The boundary walls are not yet done, so we keep her indoors most of the time (she loves running outside) and take for walks.</p>

"What are the most common dietary allergies in cats?","<p>We suspected a food allergy in one of my cats.

<p>My cat's allergy turned out not to be to food, but this got me wondering: many foods, both canned and dry, use a combination of ingredients, so he'd been exposed to all the biggies (chicken, turkey, beef, tuna, other seafood, etc) and possibly even to some of the less-common ones (lamb, duck, a stray mouse...).

<p>If I do not take him out, he will urinate on a bathroom throw rug.  Occasionally, he will try to drink / lick up whatever is caught in the carpet fibers.  He has water and food available to him and he seems to eat well.</p>

<p>We have a dog door, but he conducts this business after the house is shut for the night (we live in an area where many other types of critters could potentially enter said door when it is not monitored).  He uses the door just fine; the problem is that he urinates inside while we're all asleep, and he has to go because we either went to bed earlier than normal, or we just forgot to take him out before bed.</p>

"Why does my dog sing along to Final Jeopardy?","<p>I have had multiple scenarios where dogs I've owned or watched would consistently howl or sing at very specific things, and nothing else.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: Final Jeopardy</strong></p>

<p>Whenever we babysat our friend's black-and-tan dachshund and watched Jeopardy, he would howl at the song used during Final Jeopardy.  Not the intro.  Not any of the outtakes of the song, but only when the song played during the part where everyone writes down their final answer.  He didn't even have to see the television screen to know to howl.  He just did it.  I have no video of this particular dog, and he has since passed, but apparently there are many videos of dogs on YouTube howling to Final Jeopardy.  </p>

<p>Here are several sample videos of various dogs during Final Jeopardy:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeIK2q_xork"">Howling at Final Jeopardy Tune</a></li>

</ul>

<p>At no point in these videos is any of these dogs rewarded for their behavior.  We never rewarded the dog we babysat for howling.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Answering Machine</strong></p>

<p>If our phone rang in the house and the answering machine picked up, once people started speaking to leave a message, both male dachshunds would howl and sing.  They would not do this on playback.  They also would not do this if the call came from inside the house.</p>

<p>While I found it adorable, I did not reward them for this behavior; I do not understand why they reacted like this every single time.  Of note, I think one dog howled and the other joined in, as one has since passed and the other doesn't do it anymore.</p>

<p>I never rewarded our dogs for this behavior.</p>

<p>Quite a while ago I noticed a white mass on one of my neon’s mouths; he's now been given a name since he has been the focus of my studies for the past month - Simon. After a quick research, I concluded it was cotton mouth and immediately popped him into a quarantine tank to prevent my other fish catching it. Tank was cleaned, water change, etc. - all other fish are still fine and dandy. </p>

<p>When I first asked my question; I had already tried increasing the temperature, adding aquarium salts, using anti-bacterial treatments and acriflavine (not all at once). More recently, I've tried an anti-fungal treatment in case my initial diagnosis was incorrect, and since none of my previous methods had appeared to have worked. I think my fish's medicine cabinet is more-well stocked than my own now. </p>

<p>There is a small white circular mass, approximately 3mm in diameter protruding from Simon's mouth. Upon closer inspection, the mass appears to be attached only to the bottom lip, rather than the whole mouth; which I have read is a familiar character of this particular symptom, in multiple sources (<a href=""http://www.fishdeals.com/fish_diseases/cotton_mouth/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.thespruce.com/columnaris-disease-in-aquarium-fish-1378480"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). </p>

<p>Simon has <strong>no</strong> other symptoms. From looking back at those two sources, Simon doesn't have any white spots, his fins are in great shape, there are no 'saddleback' lesions near the dorsal fin, his colours are as bright as ever, and he has a remarkable appetite. I might also mention that over the past four weeks, the white mass hasn't grown in size from what I've noticed. </p>

<p>I'm beginning to doubt that this is cotton mouth, but I also don't want to put Simon back into the main tank until I know for sure. How will I know when a fish has been cured from cotton mouth? Will the white mass disappear, or stay like a scar? Is Simon safe to be re-associated with his scaly brothers and sisters?</p>

<p>Side note. My main tank's water parameters are checked regularly and are within the recommended concentrations, likewise with the QT. The QT is 20l and he has it all to himself, so there is no rush to get him back into the main tank; I'm willing to take my time with this. </p>

<p><strong>Are there any other illnesses/injuries which produce these symptoms?</strong></p>

"Betta fish fin tear or rot?","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rWo7q.jpg"" alt=""Betta Tail""></p>

<p>Does my fish have fin rot or is the tail simply torn?</p>

<p>I got him a few days ago and his fins were a bit like this, I'm unsure if it's gotten worse. He is in a cycled 16L tank with a filter, heater, gravel, live plants, driftwood, and a fake hollow log. His tank is the Blue Plant 16L kit which a quick Google search will give you specs.</p>

<p>He is alone, apart from a few bladder snails that I got with the plants, and I've been picking them out as I see them. Haven't seen any in a little while.</p>

<p>Just did a liquid test and ammonia is around 0-0.25ppm maybe? I have bad lighting, it's hard to tell in the evenings. I've dosed Prime and Stresscoat API and I'll do a water change tomorrow.</p>

<p>He is very active, happy, curious, and eats well. Doesn't act sick at all, but I want to make sure he won't go downhill. His ventral fins are also kind of curled at the ends. </p>

<p>What are your thoughts on what that is?</p>

<p>P.S. The gravel is quite large and not the smoothest, and his hollow fake log does have some rough bits. </p>

"How to tell if Mother cat is lactating?","<p>How can I tell if my cat is producing milk for her newborn kittens? </p>

<p>My cat birthed 2 kittens on October 31st. One of them died yesterday morning. The other one has been crying a lot. I am concerned that the mother is not producing milk. How can I properly and accurately tell if she is producing milk or not?</p>

<p>I tried doing my research on the internet but did not find any truly conclusive answers. Mostly just heresay. I tried massaging and squeezing her nipples but nothing came out. Although I'm not convinced this means she's not producing milk as it might require suction to pull it out.</p>

<p>I also read to weigh the kitten twice a day and look for 5-10 grams of weight gain a day. I'm going to do this. But in the meantime I want to know if there is any direct way to know the mother is producing milk.</p>

<p>I started to go and buy milk replacement. But I would hate to ruin the natural feeding order and invest all that time into feeding the kitten if the mother is indeed making milk and I just cannot tell.</p>

"German shepherd puppy digs holes in our carpet","<p>Can anybody tell me how to get our 7 month old purebred german shepherd female puppy to stop digging holes in our living room carpet?</p>

<p>She actually has dug and shredded in several spots down to the carpet pad. Its going to cost us around 5000.00 to replace the carpet now. She also digs holes outside, but we can live with that. We put poop in the holes outside but she just moves to a new spot.</p>

<p>We love her very much. We have several soft squeaky toys. Give her rawhide chews. Give her chicken jerky treats and dog bones. Lots of hugs and kisses and play time.</p>

<p>They have a huge fenced yard to play in. She has a sister that has never dug at all. They both have big soft beds inside and nice warm dog houses outside. We feed then twice a day plus keep dry avail. Throughout the day.</p>

<p>When they come inside she will be fine for about 30 minutes, but if we don't watch her 100% of the time she will sneak off and we will hear her start to dig and shred the carpet. By the time we jump up and go to her she can have a hole already started. We hate to have to tie her up in the house. Anyone have any suggestions? </p>

"2 month old kitten care","<p>Am caring for kittens that I found last night, that the mother seems to have abandoned, that I thought were one month old. Ideally I wanted her to come back to them. They were likely fathered by one of the outdoor cats belonging to my next door neighbor who says they are two months old. My husband found online that emergency food for four weeks or younger was egg yolks with a bit of vegetable oil. They loved it. Weather forecast predicted thunderstorms last night so after we fed them we put them in a Rubbermaid style tub with small fleece blankets, tall enough that they couldn't climb out, but large enough that the mom could jump in, and set them under our back porch which is just across the driveway from where his cats hang out. Multiple litters come from his cats every year and 90% of them die. One of this group of five did die hours after I found them. These four seem strong, though I am a little concerned about the apparent runt. Neighbor says he never considers them completely out of the woods until they're a year old. Now that I know they're older than four weeks, I see that they are old enough to eat kitten food. Is it best to start with wet food? Will the cans advise how much to feed? And should I feed the ""runt"" a little more than the others? Do they need kitten milk? And what should I feed them until I can get the canned food tomorrow? Stick with the egg yolks? Can I use the whole egg? Should I scramble them?(That would be less messy). And Should I put them back in the same place tonight? Or should I just give up on her. I could tell she didn't come to them last night. I will greatly appreciate any responses. Thank-you. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gdzpr.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Dealing with situational jealousy","<p>I have two 2-year-old cats, one male, one female. They are siblings and both were fixed a long time ago. The male is very affectionate and frequently follows my girlfriend and I around the house hoping for some attention. If we sit down on the sofa, he usually jumps up to lie down next to us. The female is a more stereotypical cat: she enjoys some physical attention every once in a while, but is just as happy lying in a chair by herself.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I try to give the cats equal attention, but I always ended up giving the male more because, well, he was usually at arm's length. My girlfriend has a bit less patience for him (he's really needy = annoying), though, and so gave more attention to the female than I did. </p>

<p>Now, I've actually left the house (doing a one-year MBA abroad), so my girlfriend is now taking care of the cats by herself. The female has now become significantly more affectionate, and the male isn't too happy about that. For the last couple of days, my girlfriend has reported that if she's lying in bed with the male and the female comes in looking for some affection, he bites her (the female). By my girlfriend's tone, the bites don't seem vicious, but are clearly a display of dominance. My girlfriend states that she has not noticed such behavior in other situations; only when the female is ""interrupting his affection-time"".</p>

<p>The reasons for his behavior are pretty clear. He got used to a certain (excessively high) level of attention when I was around, and now that I've left, he's feeling the difference and thinks his sister is taking up his affection-time. I can (and do) blame myself for failing to ween him off me properly before I left.</p>

<p>My question is what to do about this. I've seen a few other questions on this SE about how to deal with jealousy between new and old cats, or just two cats in general, but those all deal with conditions of overall jealousy, with cats attacking or sabotaging each other during the day. This, however, only happens in one specific circumstance.</p>

<p>So, what should my girlfriend do next time this happens? Should she give him a slight tap on the head and scold him? Should she put him in a separate room to cool off? My concern is that this may just worsen the issue, with the male associating his sister's entrance not only to him losing affection, but to even being punished.</p>

"Is it safe to get my cat on x ray machine?","<p>My vet advised having an x-ray taken of my cat's paw after she was stomped upon by my reckless neighbor who I am not speaking with anymore. She is always coming to drink my coffee and take my food but will not even watch for my dearest kitty when walking around. </p>

<p>Anyway, after talking with my vet we concluded that my cat should get an x-ray of her paw. Initially, I said yes and made an appointment to do it but later I started thinking about it and now I am worried if x-ray is safe for cats.</p>

<p>I know that x rays advanced over the course of years and that they are safe for humans but what about cats? I read on various places like here <a href=""https://www.felineliving.net/cat-x-ray-cost/"" rel=""noreferrer"">x ray for cats</a> that it is generally considered safe and that pros far outweigh the cons. </p>

<p>Meaning what? It is safe but there are chances that it could hurt my cat? </p>

<p>If there are chances no matter how small I will be anxious to do this because the cat is walking without any problems. </p>

<p>However, I would like to hear some other opinions before asking my vet further about this as I am afraid that I am just over thinking this and making it worse than it is... Thank you everyone in advance for your replies!</p>

"How long can a kitten be cat-sit before it affects her development / my relationship with her?","<p>I have a kitten; about 10-11 weeks old, who I rescued at around 8 weeks. I also have an adult cat, about 14 years old.</p>

<p>I have two unavoidable trips coming up. Next week I will be away for 6 days. In 6 weeks I will be away for nearly 3 weeks. </p>

<p>I am not worried about the adult cat. The kitten, however; I am extremely anxious about these trips; the long one more than the short. For both I have a cat-sitter who I trust and who has great experience with kittens. </p>

<p>I am also concerned because she'll be about 12 weeks for the first trip, and 16-19 weeks for the second. That's a lot of time to miss, and she's in some pretty critical development stages (and I'm putting a <em>lot</em> of care into raising her as best as I can).</p>

<p>So my question is: What kind of effect will these trips have on the kitten? How can I minimize any damage to her development and to her relationship with me? Am I worrying too much? They're basically my kids.</p>

<p>I socialize her with other humans but I am the only human living in this house. The cat sitter will be at my house, but will only be able to be here 2-3 hours/day (another thing I'm very concerned about). The kitten gets along well enough with the adult (the adult is a particularly patient and tolerant cat, although he does not enjoy play with the kitten so much, and the kitten is very active and unfortunately does not have a cat playmate).</p>

<p>I am trying to find ways to take the cats with me on the longer trip; but it's a significant expense (both money and time; basically it would involve an RV and a road trip instead of hotels and planes - yes... I am a crazy cat person) to set up a comfortable and constant environment for them if I take them with me. And besides, it may be best for the kitten if she stays in her home territory (I think?) -- I don't know if this would do more damage than harm.</p>

"What's wrong with this kitten's eyes and how do I take care of them?","<p>I just found a shivering little stray kitten on the inside of air conditioned building and thought it must be feeling cold so I took out in the sun and then ended up just bringing it home.</p>

<p>Its eyes are weird and seem to be covered up with something. Please take a look at the image below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MUnXZ.jpg"" alt=""cat with covered eyes""></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SMnCA.jpg"" alt=""cat with covered eyes (close-up)""></p>

<p>Is it blind, or infected? I don't have easy access to a vet's place for now! So any cat-expert opinions? If it's an infection, is there any way to help it cure at its own pace, using honey maybe? (The way that honey helps cure cough/cold-type infections with humans too).</p>

<p>What should I do with this kitten? And it's really dirty but I'm afraid to give it a bath because it was shivering back in the building and if it has a cold I don't want it to die of it.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I wasn't able to get to any vet immediately so I tried to heal her at home. And then she started improving. It turned out it really was a lot of dirt and a bad infection. I carefully patted it with a wet cloth and gently rubbed it off. But her eyes kept forming strands of pus and kept filling up quickly with it. </p>

<p>I searched online and found the following to be very effective: </p>

<ul>
<li><em>Warm compress</em>. Hold a warm washcloth against the eyes for 2-3 minutes.</li>
<li><em>Honey-water saline solution</em>. Mix a teaspoon of honey with a tablespoon of water. Then add a pinch of salt. Apparently if honey isn't available, milk can be used as a substitute, although not nearly as good. Anyway I used honey and the kitten's eyes got much better, she had longer periods of time without pus forming in her eyes. Then we found antibacterial eye drops and her eyes really cleaned up after that. Here's a close-up of her eyes after 5-6 days:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1vMY.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Sorry for the bad picture, it was clearer in real life but I'm not much good at taking photos.</p>

<p>So as you can see, she seemed fine! With her eyes alright, and her general physical health seeming to be improved (because she had started eating more and was taking calculated leaps around the house), I was planning to drop her back around the area where I found her, basically a few blocks down from my house.</p>

<p>But then tragedy struck... I don't know what went wrong. She didn't eat much one day, and when we checked on her the next morning, she was so exhausted and panting she couldn't hold her head up straight. We tried to get emergency contacts to the nearest vet. There was one, but office hours hadn't started yet. And she died before we could get there. </p>

<p>It was really sad. I don't know what went wrong. Someone in my family (not knowing that kittens are sensitive) put her in the shower for a couple of minutes the day before she died. But we dried her immediately after that and she seemed alright too, all fluffy and fine and sitting around with us.</p>

<p>Maybe she was already ill and suffering from something... Or can a kitten really die from a shower?</p>

"Positive reinforcement to diminish barking","<p>This is a question for my friend who has a (female) Chihuahua (8 years old) named Maple. She has a tendency to bark at pretty much every person who enters the house, even if it's family and friends.</p>

<p>Now I'm pretty sure I remember from my AP Psychology class in high school that reinforcing <em>negative behavior</em> with <em>positive reinforcement</em> will simply increase the likelihood of the negative behavior [severe lack of source] (and this is, of course, not desirable).</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>We're about to move into a house together with 4 other people (6 total), and we have both agreed that we should try and train her (if possible) to only bark at strangers instead of every person that walks in the door. We don't know if she's barking out of fear of the person, anger that someone disturbed the atmosphere, or just generally because she wants to let us know that someone entered the house (friendly or not). We thought that maybe <em>positive reinforcement</em> would be a good idea, even going against basic psychological principles [still no source].</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Maple is usually right next to the front door when she is barking, usually (but not always) accompanied by my friend (the owner). To get her to stop barking, he usually calls her into his room. She is never aggressive; she simply barks, hops back, barks again, hops back, etc. Sometimes she barks while dancing (not happy dancing) in circles around you. That said, she <em>always</em> barks, whether or not the owner is around (I have gone to his house while he is/isn't home and she always barks).</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>Train Maple not to bark at friends and family.
 - This is technically a <em>punishment</em>, because we want the behavior to disappear.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<ol>
<li>A friend or family member walks in the door;</li>
<li>Maple starts to bark;</li>
<li>We grab a small treat from a treat bowl near the door and give it to Maple (with lots of affection);</li>
<li>Maple runs off happily to eat her treat.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>What we <strong>don't</strong> want to do is punish her for barking. We don't want to use a spray bottle, we don't want to yell at her, etc. We believe that <em>reinforcement</em> is the way to go.</p>

<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>By giving Maple positive reinforcement (a treat), she will learn to like the friends/family and not feel the need to bark because she knows the person, and knows that she gets a treat when she sees them.</p>

<h2>Fears</h2>

<p>We have a sneaking suspicion that Maple will take the positive reinforcement as ""<em>If I bark a lot when someone comes in, I get a treat!</em>"", which would of course <strong>not</strong> be the desired behavior. Because we would be giving her a treat during a negative behavior that we want to correct, the <em>reinforcement</em> (treat) may increase the <em>negative</em> (barking) behavior.</p>

<h2>Other Potential Problems</h2>

<ol>
<li>We all go broke from buying so many treats.</li>
<li>Too many(?) treats may negatively affect Maple's health.
<ul>
<li>We could regulate this, of course. There are 6 people in the house, so treats may not be the best method if there are health repercussions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Are there <strong>risks</strong> to this method of behavior training?</li>
<li>Will Maple's <strong>age</strong> affect her ability to be behaviorally-trained?</li>
<li>Is there a <em>better</em> way to go about correcting her barking behavior?
<ul>
<li>None of us know much about psychology nor animal training, so any help from either perspective would be much appreciated!</li>
</ul></li>

"Does ""redirect instead of correct"" really work for cats","<p>I like ""redirect instead of correct"" because i find it agreeable. But i have a 15 week old kitten who i have had for 7 weeks and i have not had any success with this. </p>

<p>In all cases where i attempt to redirect (gently without scolding), the behavior ends up being repeated sooner or later. In the one case where i attempted to correct (with scolding) the behavior has never been repeated again.</p>

<p>For example there is a certain shelf my kitten cannot go on and is difficult to make safe for a kitten. It is in an odd place that she has to go out of her way to get to, and it took her a while to even discover it existed. Once she discovered it she keeps trying to go there. Every time i see her about to go back there i either a) distract her with a toy on the ground or b) pick her up and put here somewhere else. When i do a, once she is done with the toy she goes back. When i do b she immediately heads back to the spot. The more times this happens the faster she tries to run into the spot as if it is a game. This happens every day, multiple times, for about 4 weeks with zero progress. It has been a complete failure.</p>

<p>The counter example is when she tries to jump on my laptop keyboard while i am using it. The first few times this happened i picked her up and moved her elsewhere. Then she kept doing it with more ""passion"" so i raised my voice at her. Finally i just hissed at her and shoved her away with some force. She has never once repeated the action since and that was 3 weeks ago. It didnt change her behavior towards me otherwise, she didnt begin to fear me or anything, shes as sweet as ever and when she sits on my chest while im laying on the couch with my laptop she is very good, seems happy, and will even resist going after the mouse pointer. It has been a complete success.</p>

<p>In the example above with the shelf it doesn't appear as though she <em>likes</em> the attention; she usually meows in frustration when i pick her up when shes doing this, and if she happens to be on the shelf already when i pick her up she resists.</p>

<p>With redirect its as if <strong>the more i redirect the action, the more passion she puts in to trying to do it, as if im somehow enforcing the bad behavior despite giving her no praise after redirecting</strong>. Its as if redirecting only delays the inevitable bad behavior.</p>

<p>All advice i read recommends redirect instead of correct. My own judgment tells me that is the best way to train a pet as well. And it feels better than harsh scolding. I continue to try it, but i have 0% success with redirect and 100% success with scold / correct (although i have only done that once). </p>

<p>Does this training method actually work or is it a result of people not wanting to yell at their pets? How does a cat actually associate being redirected with ""dont do this any more""? What am i doing wrong?</p>

"Is there any substrate for turtles that avoids the risks of impaction?","<p>I've been reading a lot about impaction in Reptiles. Various articles have suggested alternatives that prevent impaction in Reptiles, but they've all been about land Reptiles. So far all substrate I know of for turtles carry with them the possibility of impaction.</p>

<p>I do not feed my turtle in the aquarium, however I do sometime drop a carrot peel, which eventually sinks after being soaked. Sometimes I see my turtle scavenging for the carrot near the substrate and I fear that one day it swallows some. Even if their is no food in the tank, my turtle will still search for food. </p>

<p>Is their any specific kind of substrate that is fool proof against impaction? If not then what is the most appropriate substrate for a turtle? And if the risks of impaction are unavoidable then how much is the substrate actually important for turtles?</p>

<p>Update: I removed the substrate completely and put some rocks, as I saw my turtle eating one of the small rocks then spitting it out , I still suspect it might have ate some. I kind of feel it's having a harder time floating, I just hope it didn't and if it did it won't affect it and it'll just be excreted.</p>

"How can I encourage a kitten to poop for a stool sample?","<p>I always seem to have this problem.</p>

<p>My kitten has her second doctor's appointment coming up (second round of shots), and I still need to get them a stool sample for a checkup, preferably no older than 3 hours. </p>

<p>Murphy's law states that when a stool sample is required, a cat will not poop the morning of a doctor's appointment; except, of course, the one time the cat poops 10 minutes prior, in which case it states you will forget to grab it.</p>

<p>What can I do to encourage kitty to poop? Is there a type of food I can feed her ahead of time? Is there something I can do to encourage her to do her business in the hours before the appointment?</p>

<p>It's particularly important that I get a stool sample because her stool has not been tested yet (I adopted her a few weeks ago), and we do need to make sure she's off to a good start.</p>

"Can I keep my cat from defecating in the carrier during transport?","<p>About 6 weeks ago, we adopted 2 senior cats.</p>

<p>While bringing them home, one of the cats <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/4362/57"">defecated in her carrier</a>.</p>

<p>Last night, I took them both to our vet for a checkup.  Each cat has their own carrier, and both rode in the front of the car with me.  I drove back roads as much as possible, and did my best to avoid sudden stops and acceleration.  </p>

<p>The ride to the veterinarian's office is much shorter than the ride from the pet food store we rescued them from, and I was pleased to see that we made it without another incident.</p>

<p>However, on the way home after the appointment, she defecated again (I suspect shortly before we arrived at home, as I did not smell it until I went to pick her up).</p>

<p>Clearly both cats were very stressed by the car ride, but so far 2 out of 3 short trips have resulted in the 13 year old female making a mess.</p>

<p>Are there any strategies for minimizing this?  The obvious solution would be to only take her right after she uses the litter, but since we have to schedule our appointments weeks ahead of time, and the time of the appointments largely depends on the doctor's availability and my work schedule, I'm not sure how practical that would be.</p>

<p>Are there other strategies that might help?</p>

"Do the colors of a cat's coat correlate with its personality?","<p>I've heard some people say that a cat's coat color says a lot about its personality.

"How can I train a full-grown untrained dog to stop eating garbage?","<p>He's an 8-year-old beagle. I am his secondary owner of 6 months - his primary owner has owned him since puppyhood. Apparently there have been failed attempts to give him some basic training in the past, most notably enrollment in doggy discipline school. (They gave a refund and expressed that he was not welcome back after the first day of training.)</p>

<p>I have started to read up on books and resources for training dogs as I feel he does need some basic training and I have come to understand that he has been unwittingly trained to lunge at garbage, put it in his mouth and swallow it as quickly as possible. He eats other animals' poop, any and all food he finds on the ground, sticks his snout into garbage and plastic bags at the slightest opportunity. </p>

<p>He has had very little training and little if any understanding of command words. I want to get started right away on correcting the garbage eating behavior as I am concerned he will eventually eat something that does something horrible to him. It is difficult to avoid garbage on the ground as we live in a city area that is extremely littered. (Even the parks have food garbage lying around from picnics.) I don't want to stop taking him on walks while I study basic training principles and canine communication - we are currently living in an apartment building and he has the run of the veranda, but that's not enough space for him is it?</p>

<p>Is it possible to start training him to stop eating everything he can reach in these circumstances? How might I go about it?</p>

"Cat is hitting object when trying to jump on it","<p>So about a month ago our cat managed to fall out of the window onto our balcony. -> 2nd floor to 1st floor.  It was at night so we didn't see exactly what happened, only heard the noise when he landed.  Sounded like he hit our garden chairs which where standing there folded together.</p>

<p>As soon as we opened the door to the balcony he ran in, up the stairs and was hiding under the bed. I then slowly pulled him towards me and we checked if he was in pain somewhere (touched all feet and everything).  But he seemed alright except that he lost the fur on his nose. Looked like he hit some sharp edge and his fur was literally was shaved off. He was also bleeding a bit but nothing dramatic.  It wasn't running freely - just a bit of blood on the wound.</p>

<p>He then calmed down very quickly and was acting quite normal again so we decided not to go to a vet. (It was a Saturday night I believe).</p>

<p>Since the incident I have the impression that he often can't manage to jump up on objects. He tries but instead of jumping on them he jumps against them. Sometimes he nearly makes it and other times he's not even close to getting up. On the other hand there are times he jumps up without a problem. </p>

<p>Can it be that he is just more 'careful' or just has more fear of jumping over the object?  I believe the day he fell out the window that he tried to jump on the windowsill and was just to fast so he didn't manage to stop and then fell down.</p>

<p>So the specific question would be:</p>

<p>Is it just that 'the shock is still in his bones' or are his 'senses' somewhat 'damaged' and in fact of that he can't aim that accurately anymore? </p>

"Older cat doesn't come home since new cat is here","<p>I'm starting by a short flashback about one year.</p>

<p>My girlfriend, me and our 2 tomcats (Elliot(4) and Fridolin(2)) where living in a flat share at an old farmyard (Inside a small ville), together with 4 other people.
There had been a catflap and both of them could get in and out as they want to.</p>

<p>Sadly, Fridolin got overrun by a car, needles to mention the emotional situation. 
Due we had plans moving together in our own flat (no shared flat anymore), we did not got a new cat and Elliot had been alone for some (circa 6) months.</p>

<p>Then, in March, we moved. Elliot adapted really quick to the new environment. We where able to let him out after 2 weeks, and he came back without any issue. 
We have one window open almost all the time, and he can get in and out as inured. (He already learned what to do when it's closed, walking to any other window in hope we see him.).
But as the months passed by, we noticed a change in Elliots behavior we don't like. </p>

<p>He became slack, doing nothing but sleep and cuddling a little. Sometimes he got out, like 20-30 minutes, came back with a mouse (he always ate himself, no presents) and sleeps again.</p>

<p>We thought, it's the time for a new cat and arount 10.August 15, the little female cat Pebbles(12 weeks at that time) came to us.<br>
She is a very active, even for her young age (I've seen plenty young cats, sure they're active in general but Pebbles is of her own kind.)</p>

<p>First contact between Elliot and Pebbles had been through the window. 
He was sitting outsite at the windowsill, while she sat inside, right at the place where his bowl stands.<br>
One easily could notice the consternation in Elliots face.</p>

<p>We let him in, and the little rubberball Pebbles had seemingly annoyed him a lot. </p>

<p>In the first days, Elliot avoidet contact with Pebbles. When she where coming to close, he hissed at her and left. He never attacked her and even if she attacked(play) him, he only pushed her back, without claws.</p>

<p>The next weeks, he came home lesser and less.</p>

<p>Now we know, he spends the whole day sitting at neighbors porch, no matter what weather. He feeds him self by catching mice (he does really well) and is almost unactractable by goodies.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he comes home and seemingly is hungry, like he couldn't catch enough mice that day. He eats the whole bowl at once, which usualy is enough for a whole day, and leafes again.
In the short span he is at home, he growls constantly, even if Pebbles isn't in sight (smell?). He also started hissing at us, if we come to close.
But this aggression doesn't point to us. When outside, he behaves like nothing happens, enyoing beeing stroked. Outside, he is happy as before.
It seems, as he really hates the environment and want to get out asap.</p>

<p>This state is now since about 3 weeks. He didn't lost weight, all neighbors decline to feed him.</p>

<p>We are at the point where Pebbles has to go, we already have a trustworthy person who would take her.
But how can we know, if Elliot will come home again? We are catpeople, ending up with no cat at all would be the end of the world.</p>

<p>Are there any strategies we could try to solve the problem?</p>

"Why did all 45 goldfish (and 2 mosquitos) in my 1600 gallon pond suddenly/overnight begin a 4-day die-off?","<p>Am very frustrated: My 45 or so goldfish and several mosquito fish were so happy. Then literally overnight they stopped eating and within days died off. </p>

<p>The day the trouble started the outside temperature soared to 95 but the water seemed cool enough. Moreover, the center of the pond is 4 feet deep.</p>

<p>In happier days whenever I’d feed them they would snap and race around their pond. The pond is an in-ground hot tub covered with a non-toxic triple liner designed for fish that cost me $300. We live in Pasadena, CA where the weather is generally moderate.</p>

<p>The goldfish were rescue fish destined to be eaten by Pet Smart customers’ carnivores. So they were at least spared whatever terror was in store for them. </p>

<p>After they started to die off, I changed almost all of the water but not all because there were some fry I was attempting to save. In hindsight I wish I had gone 100%.</p>

<p>I repeatedly tested the water with a kit and also at PetSmart. Then I put some new goldfish in—all of which died within days. The water was hard so I added the proper amount of salts. The ph was around 7. 
 The nitrite level was borderline stressful, so I added a bottle of stress coat. Still no luck.. All other readings (ammonia, etc. were normal).</p>

<p>I had made a filter using bio balls and ran a small pump constantly with ok aeration. Admittedly it could have been better, as the balls never really looked that dirty. Moreover, because a raccoon had punctured the liner, only 3 months earlier I had completely drained the pond and did with no lose of fish.</p>

<p>After the disaster struck and following the water exchange, I built a massive filter and added a heavy duty pump that made the water crystal-clear—but it was too late. Another batch of new fish died.</p>

<p>After draining the pond, I realized too late that some of the fish that died had sunk to the bottom and possibly continued to contaminate.</p>

<p>Half the pond’s surface was covered with 2 types of water lettuce. I have now 100% drained the pond and have discarded the lettuce for fear that it is contaminated. Could the lettuce have caused the problem? </p>

<p>Raccoons were always trying to get the fish but didn’t seemed to have any success. Could they have introduced a disease?</p>

<p>Maybe there was a fish-borne disease? But no new fish had been introduced for months.</p>

"My dog will not eat unless handfed, one at a time","<p>I am concerned because my dog will not eat her food unless I handfeed one at a time. I left the food in the bowl and she sniffed it and walked away(she did this a few times over a period of 10 minutes). I tried leaving it on the floor and she did the same thing. I sat down, hoping my presence would change something, but she just sat next to me. So I called her over and started feeding her the kibble one at a time, which worked. Halfway through, I put all the kibble in my hand, hoping she would eat, but she immediately stopped eating, so I resumed handfeeding(with my fingertips). When there were only a few kibble left, I tried putting them all in my hand again, but she stopped eating and walked away after sniffing. I put them all down and (walked to her) gave her one, but she actually spit it out. Then I called her over to me instead and fed her the last few. </p>

<p>I haven't noticed any atypical behavior (e.g. lying in a corner, taking no interest in anything). She did this at her 1st and 2nd meals today(havent given her 3rd) and in between she was running around excitedly and playing with her toys. She isn't napping any more than she usually does. She is also still barking at the door when she hears things.
As for her behavior towards food: she ALWAYS seems to want food and this is the first time I have seen her exhibit nonchalance towards food or any mention of it. However, when I was eating food today, she was still interested in it. I've heard advice from a dog trainer(given to another dog) who said to not be concerned if their dog was not eating because he was a big dog and probably wasn't hungry, but my dog is a small breed. 
I am not sure what to do because this seems very atypical although her other behaviors have not changed.
What should I do to resolve this? Could it be something to do with the food or bowl? I haven't changed anything in the last few days and she always appreciated her food before. Should I take her to the vet? </p>

<p>Edit: she is 10 months old</p>

"Boyfriend's dog peed on me","<p>So my boyfriend has an almost ten-year-old pom/Yorkie dog. Before moving in with him he did tell me that she didn’t really like females but she seemed to like me. </p>

<p>Well, when he lived with another girl the dog was potty trained and has been her whole life. He told me he never really had to train her. She just used to let him know when she needed to go out and she's using a pee pad if no one was there to let her out.</p>

<p>When he started living alone and going to work he’d leave the dog with his mom and then according to him he doesn’t know when she started peeing in the house. She just kind of started and (in his words) “I guess she just thought it was the new normal to soil the house” because no one stopped her or got onto her. </p>

<p>We are about to move into an apartment with carpets and I told him I want her potty trained before we move in. He says he can’t potty train her because he’s at work but he refuses to let me get on to her when she soils the house he wants me to just leave her alone and let her do her thing. </p>

<p>Me and her have never had a problem and I give her pets and love all the time. She just kind of ignores that I exist like if I call her she just ignores me and even when I pet her I feel like she’s just ignoring that I’m there she won’t even play with me. </p>

<p>I decided I was going to potty train her anyways. I started getting onto her this week when she would soil the house and I try to get her to go outside. </p>

<p><strong>Well this morning I wake up about 3 am because I feel wetness under my side I get up and she peed on the bed all the way down from my waist to my feet. The mark she made clearly showed the puddle where she started and then the line going down the blanket (where I was laying) where she was walking while she peed and the small puddle at my feet where the pee line ended.</strong></p>

<p>I was so ticked I woke him up and told him the dog peed on me and he insists that she didn't do it on purpose and that she just must have really needed to pee (yeah I’m not buying that). And then he stated that there’s no way she did it on purpose because she never did anything to the other girl and she hated her. </p>

<p>On top of this, she won’t do her business outside unless my boyfriend is here. If I take her out she tries to leave the property instead of doing her business. When I asked him why she tries to leave he said that she’s trying to go find him and that she will do that if she is taken outside while he’s not there.  </p>

<p>But I noticed she is very sneaky about soiling the house. For example, there have been a few times where the dog will be laying in the same room as me and I will change the babies diaper and I notice she will leave the room. I try to be quick with the baby but by the time I’m done the dog has already come back to the room and sure enough, she’s left a mess in the house. Or when I go to use the bathroom or get something to eat I will come back to a mess. </p>

<p>So I guess my question is <strong>did the dog pee on me out of anger or was it an honest old dog accident or other things that could be wrong with it?</strong> And if it was anger how do I make it stop before it’s another problem? And how can I potty train this dog or is her refusal to go outside just her age?</p>

"Cat euthanasia. Kidneys shut down","<p>My beautiful cat Kisses was with me for 10 years. She was probably 12ish. I found her outside when she was a young adult. </p>

<p>On Monday she was diagnosed with renal disease. She had thrown up 20 times the night before I took her to the vet. They ran lab tests and gave IV fluid for 3 days. Her creatnine levels and bun both went down and she started to eat very small amounts but it was at least something. I gave subcutaneous fluids at home for 2 days along with a plethora of medications. </p>

<p>Yesterday, not even a week after diagnosis, she didn't eat or drink at all. She hid under the bed and didn't move much. I was going to take her to the vet once they opened. I kept checking on her and she seemed okay, still hiding under the bed, but not in distress. Then 30 minutes before I went to take her to the vet I went to check on her again. She had moved to a dark corner in the closet. She was breathing fast. 70-120x a minute. She barely had any strength but would stand if I made her and take a few steps and lay down. </p>

<p>I rushed her to the vet before they even opened. Her body temp was 97.1. The vet (of 36 years) recommended euthanasia. She thinks maybe her heart was failing. I told her I'd do anything to save her. She said I could take her to a 24 hr emergency vet and have mute testing but she thought anything I would do was futile. I made the roughest decision in my life to let her go peacefully. </p>

<p>Has anyone ever had this experience with a cat going so fast? I mean she was healthy and then diagnosed with Chronic Kidney Disease and then less than a week she was in real bad shape. Did I make the right decision? I feel terrible guilt. She is my soulmate.</p>

"Why did my gecko die?","<p>So, about a month ago my gecko of three years died i'm still devasted to this day..It was a heart breaking moment...she was not eating at all nor drinking my dad said she was laying her infertile eggs so I relaxed a bit (my dad talked to a vet) and her stomach started to swell a lot she had dead skin stuck to her hands which made her put her arms a weird way when she slept. She also started to not move at all, all she ever did was sleep and it started concerning me. She had lip and eye infections. Her name was Plinxton. We were going to take her to the vet but sadly the night before we were going to...she passed away I know y'all are going to say ""how do you know she was dead?"" well, for starters she wasn't breathing anymore. She was even limper than what she was. She had no heart beat. Lastly she was pale. She was in so much pain she couldn't lift her lower part of her body. I miss her soo much. Does anyone of you know what my gecko had? please and thank you for reading this..</p>

"Would a small amount of bottled water mixed in with an aquarium harm the fish?","<p>This is kind of urgent - I'm watching someone's dogs currently because that is what I am experienced in but they also have an aquarium. I have little to know experience with fish and I did warn the owners. I don't have 100% of the information, a lot of it is guesswork but I really need help. </p>

<p>In order to feed the fish, I dissolve krill in ice into a cup of water and distribute it. I feel so dumb, but for the first 4 or so meals, I used about 3 cups of Crystal Springs water from a water cooler to feed them. I'd say this tank is a little smaller than 125 gallons and I'm fairly sure it's saltwater because of the breeds of fish. Since then, I've fed them about 4 or 5 times just using the tank water (I feel bad for not realizing that at first, I know virtually nothing about caring for fish).</p>

<p>The owners come back in about 5 days, is there anything I can do to fix this? How harmful will this be to the fish? I've already noticed the gravel is dirtier than before. I also haven't been able to contact the owners because they have no cell connection where they have traveled to. Any advice would be greatly appreciated</p>

"Taking care of a dog in Germany","<p>In early November I'll be moving from Brazil to Stuttgart (Germany) because I've found a job there. All the documentation has already been taken care of and the dog will be allowed to enter the EU in November 2. Also, I'm already aware that it will be kinda hard to find an apartment to rent with a dog, even a small and quiet one as my 1 year old 5.5kg Shih Tzu.</p>

<p>I've been told that Germans tend to be very annoyoed by the smallest amount of barks, and I fully understand that. But I've been told that Germans find it ""almost criminal"" to leave a dog 8 hours a day alone at home. As I'll be working from 9 to 5, that's what will be happening. Is this going to be an issue, considering that the dog is well used to this, because it already happens here in Brazil? I mean, do neighbors really care about how much time my dog spents alone at home as long as he doesn't bark?</p>

"My cat is hiding and won't move","<p>My cat, Max, has been hiding under my grandma's steps since the 27th of september. We had to drop off all of my cats at my grandmas temporarily so we can move into another house. We didn't want them there when we were bringing in our items in case they walked out the door when we weren't watching. </p>

<p>They have never gone to my grandmas house before. Two of my cats were fine, one was very cautious and alert while Max was just petrified. Max has moved before, it shouldn't be new to him. He didn't move out of his carrier, so we had to pick it up and literally dump him out. This wasn't easy because of his size. </p>

<p>We had to leave, so we left the cats in the basement thinking they would come upstairs eventually. We first put them in the basement so we could show them the litter boxes. </p>

<p>The next time we came, which was yesterday, we were ready to take them to the new house. We got three of my cats in their carriers easily, while Max didn't budge from under the stairs. He wedged himself under the very last step. We thought he was stuck, but he wasn't. Eventually, we pushed him out and blocked the bottom steps with shoe boxes so he couldn't get trapped there and we could grab him. </p>

<p>He moved to the side of the steps wedged between the wall and the steps. He sat up so his head was actually between wall and stair. </p>

<p>We gave up after about an hour of trying to get him out and put him in his carrier. </p>

<p>He hasn't been coming out to eat or drink. We are even giving him wet food in his bowl to try to get him out. The only time he MIGHT be coming out is to go to the bathroom because there is no pee or anything by his hiding spot. </p>

<p>Today we found him a little ways away from the stairs under some headboards and other junk. How can we get him to warm up to us again so we can take him to a new home? I know moving can be stressful for a cat, but is this normal? The fact that he isn't eating really worries me. </p>

<p>Max is a male orange tabby and weighs around 20 pounds. We have never seen him like this. He acts like the head of the house usually, we didn't expect him to hide like this. </p>

<p>Ever since we found him by the stairs we've been trying to push him out. I stupidly tried to pull him with my hands and he bit me. Not a warning bite, but a real bite. He is just an animal, and it worries me that he thinks we would put him in danger. </p>

"My 16 year old red eared slider hasn't laid eggs in years","<p>Shes been acting crazy, trying to get out of her tank and being a picky eater. I just started reading about her symptoms and discovered that she could be eggbound. Until now, I had no idea that this was even a possibility.</p>

<p>When I first got her Google wasn't a thing, I just bought books about red eared sliders and felt pretty confident and competent. Shes never even seen a vet before, shes always had a healthy appetite, sleep patterns. Never felt the need to take her. Have I been neglecting her for 16 YEARS?!

"Shivering dog: Anxiety Vest or some other method?","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Are anxiety vests effective for dogs?  What else can I do to make my dogs anxiety go away?</p>

<hr>

<p>I have a nearly 12 year old male Boston Terrier.  The dog is my girlfriend's.  Shes had him for almost 8 years.  According to her, his previous owner had to leave him at an adoption center for personal reasons (twice!), before giving him to my girlfriend.  I believe that because of this, and since she has owned him for 8 years now, he has grown very attached to her.  </p>

<p>Whenever she goes to work and I am home with the dog, he shivers constantly.  He will not play with toys, he usually refuses to eat and drink water (sometimes he will), and just looks unhappy.  I'm fairly confident that he is experiencing some form of separation anxiety.  As soon as my girlfriend comes home, he races to see her and will either grab a toy to play with or scarf down his food and water that have been in his bowl all day.  </p>

<p>The only methods I've found to control his shivering are laying on the couch with him, or putting him in his cage where he usually falls asleep.  I don't like having to put him away in his cage since I am home (we only like to use the cage when we aren't home or are sleeping), and I don't want to sit on the couch all day.  I was wondering, how effective are those <a href=""https://www.petsmart.com/dog/food-and-health/vitamins-and-wellness/stress-and-anxiety-relief/thundershirt-dog-anxiety-shirt-5170692.html?gclid=Cj0KEQiA7K7CBRCrwt26v5uHs98BEiQA0JzsZ4fA7uo6UVoXLKsUAgbJZazzBU0MggvGMZuBfSKz4XgaAmPX8P8HAQ&amp;lsft=utm_source%3Agoogle%2Cutm_term%3A5170692%2Cutm_medium%3APLA%2Cutm_content%3AGSC%20-%20Brand%20-%20Hard%20Goods%20-%20Dog%20%7C%20Food%20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">anxiety vest</a> that they make for dogs?

"New cats: Female intimidating/bullying her brother","<p>My Wife and I recently (two and a half weeks ago) adopted two cats, a brother and sister around 7 years old, from our local shelter. On the first day, the brother was more confident, but then became very timid, and he keeps hiding behind the sofa and under tables. His sister, on the other hand, has been much more outgoing. </p>

<p>At first we thought this was just him being scared of the new environment, but recently we've noticed that she seems to be intimidating him - she'll come and push in if we are giving him attention, and she eats from his food bowl while he just sits and watches. In the last couple of days she's also tried to claim his favourite sleeping position (the back of the sofa), which would give her control of almost all the high-up places - she already has a cat-tree and the lounge window-sill. </p>

<p>What can we do to dissuade this behaviour? We're particularly worried about him eating properly, if she keeps stopping him, and we want him to be able to be more confident around the house and around us, e.g. being comfortable to sit on our laps without her interfering. - ideally we'd like them comfortable enough with each other being close enough that we can have one on each of our laps!</p>

<p>They are not yet allowed outside (it's only been just over two weeks), though we have, in the last few days, given them access to more of the house (hall/landing/stairs as well as the lounge and kitchen), and he's taken to sitting at the top of the stairs (claiming a new high-place?)</p>

<p>They currently have two litter-boxes, which, as far as we can tell, both appear to use. They have separate food bowls, but currently they are in the same corner of the kitchen. We have a three-level cat tree, and a separate scratching post (which he tends to use). We feed them wet food in the evening and dry in the morning, and he tends to eat more of the dry - she'll wolf down her portion of the wet food while he looks on from a few feet away, then move over and eat his...</p>

However, when I take him on a hike or to the pond and he sees another dog, he gets very aggressive.

We went to Tractor Supply on Sunday and lab walked down another aisle (not near us, but within sight) and as soon as Axle saw him, he showed his teeth, growled and lunged towards the dog.

<li><p>My girlfriend studies medicine and will have even worse hrs. at random times. (Nightshift, etc.)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>None of the above offer a solution to my dog's behavior.</p>

<p>I've talked with different vets and spent hours googling the subject. All the advise I receive doesn't seem to address the extreme nature of my problem. It's not something a few days of dog training can stop.</p>

<p>My dog is now 6 months old and his endless chewing, eating and swallowing of anything he finds will not stop. It is not a random behavior, but is a constant never stopping moving from one spot to another looking for something to chew.</p>

<p>He requires by the second monitoring when he's let out of his room. Can not be left alone anywhere in the house. Can not be allowed to walk around freely and can not be trusted.</p>

<p>He is also a nipper, biter and grabber of hands, legs and feet. He especially bites my two daughters constantly. He does not have to be in a hyper state to bite. He will calmly walk up to anyone and just grab you. The biting is worse if he is excited.</p>

<p>But it really is the constant eating of non-food items that is driving me nuts. If he can not find something on the floor he will climb, jump, claw open or rip apart anything until he finds something.</p>

<p>We've spent a lot of money on leashes, dog gates, crates, dog toys, dog treats and gave him unlimited dog food (which resulted in lots more dog poop without a change in behavior). We can close the gate to the front room which has now been taken over as the dog room. If we remove everything from this room, fill it with hundreds of dog toys, dog treats and dog food. He will still chew the dry wall, crown molding and door frames.</p>

<p>I work from home, and share my office space with the dog. He does not have separation anxiety, and he is very well crate train (he will sleep in his crate with the door open on his own).</p>

<p>I take him for walks, take him to the dog park to run off leash and let him play outside for hours. Nothing is working. As soon as he is back inside he starts scanning for something to eat. He does not just chew it. He completely eats it.</p>

<p>Crayons, pencils, paper, tissue, shoes, hats, gloves, beer cans, soda cans, eye glasses, computer keyboards and mouse, wires, extension cords, TV remote, kids toys, soup cans, markers, play doh, glue bottles, books, etc.. etc..</p>

<p>We can not keep moving things out of reach and still live in the same house.</p>

<p>He is a happy, goofy and playful puppy but his large size (80lbs) and tall height (he can reach anything on a high counter, table or shelve) makes this behavior extra destructive and stressful.</p>

<p>He's been to the vet and everything checks out just fine. We've had blood work done, poop/pee tests and have taken him to training classes for puppies. We've tried positive rewards, negative rewards and even gave a remote buzzer a try.</p>

"Possible sign of dog-to-dog aggression in a 3 dog household","<p>I have a friend who recently adopted a boxer from a rescue (they've had the dog full-time for about a month now on a semi-trial basis).  There is little information on his history as he was just found wandering on the side of the highway without a collar or identification.  They estimate he is about 18-months old (in human years), and other than a few minor scars, he seems to be in fairly good shape so we don't think his situation was <em>very</em> traumatic.</p>

<p>The concern is the existing dogs in the house.  They have 2 others.  There is a 5 year old Chesapeake Bay Retriever (and in my opinion he is slightly crazy) and a 8 year old Pug.  All 3 dogs are males and all 3 are fixed.  The Chessie is a pure-bred bought from a breeder as a puppy and my friends have been his only owner.  The Pug was adopted from a shelter when he was about 6-months old.</p>

<p>Prior to the arrival of the Boxer, the Pug and the Chessie were relatively indifferent to each other.  The Pug let the Chessie have his way and never really bothered him much.  The Chessie also happens to be very possessive of toys (or anything that he has near him) so after getting growled at a few times when they were younger, the Pug seems to have decided that avoidance is the best measure.</p>

<p>When the Boxer arrived, he and the Pug became fast friends to the point that when the wrestle and play, the boxer actually the Pug ""win"".</p>

<p>The interaction between the Chessie and the Boxer is the concern.</p>

<ul>
<li>When all 3 dogs are together, the Boxer always seems to make a point to keep himself between the Chessie and the Pug, and seems to be watching the Chessie with unusual interest (almost like he is keeping an eye on the Chessie and protecting the Pug).</li>
<li>When just the Chessie and the Boxer are together one of 2 things happens
<ol>
<li>The Boxer mirrors the pugs indifference and just let's the Chessie go</li>
<li>The Boxer follows the Chessie around.  This is the one that concerns everyone most.  The posture of the Boxer appears to be somewhat aggressive.  His head is lowered but stating right at the Chessie and he is always 2-3 steps right behind him.  This will go on for several minutes and then the Boxer will go off and do something else</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>This 2nd situation is what worries myself and my friend, but his wife doesn't seem to think much of it.  It appears to us that the Boxer is stalking the Chessie.  We're just not sure why and how much we should be concerned.  My friend's wife thinks that the Boxer is just following the lead dog around and thinks it is actually cute when it happens.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this stalking normal in that the boxer is just trying to test his limits with the biggest dog in the house?  The Chessie outweighs the boxer by about 35lbs (which is about 16kg for my metric friends).  The Chessie is close to 100lb and the boxer is almost 65lb, and the Chessie is almost as lean and muscular as the Boxer.</li>
<li>Or is my friend's wife right and there is nothing to be worried about?</li>
<li>Or is the Boxer sizing up the Chessie to challenge him?  This is why we are concerned as neither of us wants to try to separate 165lb of dog going at each other.</li>
</ul>

<p>If it is the latter, is there anything we can do to help keep the piece?  Or is this something that will likely boil over at some point and it is just a matter of when?</p>

"Removing budgerigar eggs","<p>We have several <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigar"">budgerigars</a> and from time to time my partner sees an egg in their cage and disposes of it immediately. They are possibly fertile because we have both male and female budgies however the cage doesn't have a nesting area so it's probably unlikely the female would be able to keep the egg warm enough for it to hatch.</p>

<p>We keep a few small tree branches / leaves and the odd piece of fruit / veg on the bottom for them to nibble on but it doesn't really cover the entire area. Most of the eggs seem to be laid down the bottom directly on the bottom of the cage. While well sheltered it's outdoors so there would be cool air passing under the eggs.</p>

<p>Because budgies are somewhat skittish it's hard to know how long (if at all) they are trying to nest on them. I wondered if removing the eggs quickly may cause some sort of anxiety or if maybe it's better to leave them in place a while until they ""give up"" on them trying to hatch?</p>

<p>We're not especially interested in breeding them but if that seems like the most humane thing we're not certainly not opposed to it and I'm sure we can find them loving homes. If that sounds like a better option I'd also be interested to know at what point eggs that haven't hatched should be removed?</p>

"How can I re-teach my cats to eat insects?","<p>Two of my cats were avid insect hunters in our old apartment.  </p>

<p>We were near a farm, so we had lots of flies hanging outside our front door and our patio, and some would invariably get in during the warmer months.</p>

<p>I taught both of the cats to hunt the flies by making a distinctive noise to alert them, and then assisting in stunning the flies with a newspaper so that they could catch them.  Both of them quickly learned to come running whenever they heard me make that sound, and would immediately start scanning the walls to find the bug, especially if they saw me pointing.</p>

<p>This worked out to be a rather efficient means of eliminating flies and moths that found their way into our apartment, as well as providing entertainment and exercise for the cats.</p>

<p>However, several years ago we moved into a house in a different neighborhood.  We still get the odd insect intruder, but it is far, far rarer.</p>

<p>Even worse, the two most common intruders we find are stink bugs, and ladybugs.  Both exude a noxious chemical defense when disturbed (although ladybugs don't stink nearly as bad as stink bugs do, it is more than enough to dissuade a sensitive feline nose).</p>

<p>While I have not seen either cat have an actual run-in with either type of insect, that doesn't mean it hasn't happened.</p>

<p>However, now none of our cats will eat <strong>any</strong> insects.  Of the original two that I taught to hunt, only one shows more than a passing interest in insects, and while she gets extremely excited to spot a moth, and will relentlessly follow it around the house, meowing pitifully, she won't attack it, and even if I knock it down, she won't eat it.</p>

<p>Is it possible to teach my cats to distinguish between ""good"" insects (e.g. ones that are flying) and ""bad"" (stinky) insects, and rekindle their hunting instincts?</p>

<p>Or have my cats been traumatized by insect stench to the point where I have to swat my own flies?</p>

<p><sup> Note: Same fish. coloration difference due to camera flash </sup></p>

<p>I've had the fish in a 10 gallon tank by itself for about 3 years, and I have not recently changed anything. The only minor change I can think of is adding an old algecide tablet to the water about 6 weeks ago, but this growth is much newer than that.The water is also slightly cooler now that winter temperatures have arrived (the tank is about 68<sup>o</sup>F vs 78<sup>o</sup>F a few months ago -- but this has been a gradual decline and not unusual for this time of year). I last did a 30% water change about 2.5 weeks ago. </p>

<p>Any idea what this might be and what I can do about it?</p>

<p>I don't want to lose my fish :(</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I initially gave my goldfish a salt treatment (~1.5tbsp of aquarium salt / gallon), which caused the white tuft to rescind to being only a white spot (no fluffy outgrowths). I thought my fish was on the way to recovery.</p>

<p>However, about 2 weeks later (~1 month after initial symptoms), my fish's condition worsened. The fish lost almost all control of its air bladder (which I began treating with peas, which helped) and became very lethargic. On a few occasions I've found the fish resting motionless being partially sucked up by my filter. The white tuft had likewise started growing again...</p>

<p>I started treating my tank with <strong>API Fungus Cure</strong> (contains Victoria Green B + Acriflavine). </p>

<p>I'm on day 4 of treatment, but now my fish looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBXWkm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RBXWkm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>The spot has grown lumpy and red/bloody...
(does this suggest a secondary bacterial infection perhaps?)</p>

<p>Now what should I do??....</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong></p>

<p>It's been 6 months, and my poor little goldfish has been a real trooper.
I treated the water on 2 additional occasions with the API Fungus Cure (which  totaled 3 complete treatments in ~3 months). The spot remained red and tufty for more than a month. However, after all treatments (and time), the spot is certainly no longer tufty or red and has not been for at least ~3 months now. Instead, it's just a white looking scab on his head. I ASSUME THIS IS GOOD?</p>

<p>However, his behavior has never been the same :(.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Specifically, his air bladder control seems to be near non-existent now, and I find him stuck upside down about 80% of the time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Though, actually it's better than it was 2-3 mo ago -- he would purposefully wedge himself between plants or rock to keep himself from floating to the top. Now he seems to have a bit better control. </p></li>
<li><p>feeding him peas 1-3x per week momentarily helps him a bit, but not as much as it used to when this ordeal first started. </p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>One other thing to note: the tank randomly turned very cloudy and stayed that way for a month starting about 6 weeks ago. This was more than a month after my last fungus treatment. Water changes did nothing, but finally I came home one day and the water was clear again. The fish never seemed bothered by it. I assumed it was a bacterial bloom, but in a 10 year old tank seemed strange... (I'll have to ask a new question about this one).</p>

<li>20 Nov, re-sprayed both cats and the entire flat with the all-in-one flea spray</li>
</ul>

<p>Along with all this, I'm also vacuuming the entire flat every day or two.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to shift the fleas living on the cat. I found dead fleas everywhere after fumigating, and they seemed to subside on the cat, but never fully went away, and it's getting quite worrying: she's constantly twitching her tail (they seem to be congregating around her genitalia) and is very restless (finding it hard to rest due to the un-comfort), and has scratched and bitten herself loads trying to clear them - her skin under her fur is all scabby and sore. She hates being brushed, but I'm trying the best I can to brush her as often as possible as best I can.</p>

<p>I've just purchased two <a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00HW1GBRG/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flea traps</a> and another three flea bombs, and the cat is booked in at the vets on Friday to see what they say, but I was wondering if there was anything anyone here could recommend? I'm not sure if I'm paranoid, but I feel like every time I use de-flea treatments on her she goes a little bit ""crazy"", with nervous ticks and skittish behaviour - could the treatments be poisoning her and making her ill? I'm not going over the recommended 4-weeks between Broadline treatments, but I am supplementing them with the spray.</p>

<p>It's genuinely distressing and heartbreaking to see her suffer from these.</p>

"Something on my cat is biting me","<p>My cat is just over one year old; she's an ex-feral who we trapped at about nine weeks. Since then she's been 95% indoor cat with no direct contact with other cats, but occasionally she slips out of the back door and sits in the back yard for a little while before coming back inside.</p>

<p>She likes to cuddle, but just in the last few weeks, I find myself coming up with itchy red bumps a couple of hours after cuddling her. They look and feel similar to mosquito bites, and they only appear in the areas where we've been in contact. I don't have any history of allergies, and I haven't had any allergic-type reaction when she's scratched me. My best guess is that she has some sort of parasite that's biting. Obviously I would like to deal with this, for her sake and for mine.</p>

<p>We took her to the vet, who checked her over and swabbed her ears for mites but found nothing. (We do have birds roosting in the roof and I've seen a few mites inside near there.) My wife tried combing her with a flea comb over white paper, but nothing showed up. She is in very good health; I see her scratching occasionally but not for an extended period. She has long hair and it's in excellent condition. If it weren't for the bites I'd have no reason to suspect any kind of parasites. Some possibilities I've considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cat fleas: she had a few when we caught her but she was treated at the time. It's possible that she picked up a few on one of her trips into the garden, and it would explain the bites. But neither the vet nor my wife found any fleas on her. (OTOH she does have long hair, so it might be possible for a flea to hide?)</li>
<li>Mites: the ones I've seen around the house are tiny, so they might evade a flea comb, but I'm not aware of them causing bites like this on humans. Also not sure if bird mites would live on a cat.</li>
<li>Cat lice: a few weeks back I did see a small white arthropod that looked a bit like a cat louse on her head, but didn't manage to catch it. I haven't seen any since, and it was large enough that I'd expect it to show up in combing, so maybe it was just a random passing bug. Also, I don't think cat lice bite humans?</li>

"What can go wrong if people carry 1 week old kittens alot?","<p>My cat gave delivery a week ago and on the first day till now she lets us (6 people ages 6 to 20) touch her kittens and even carry them if we wish. Ofcourse no one touched the kittens on the first three days even though she allows. We have a great relationship with her and she is a family member. The wierd thing is that she's usually rude I'd like to say (best word to describe) and she swats or yells angrily if someone annoys her a lot. She is also nice at times but to tell you the truth, most of the household thought that she'd become even more strict and defensive after she recieves a litter(except me, I expected her to be nice, shes usually nicer to me, I'm special 😎). But the point is, shouldn't she become very defensive and want everyone away? My sister literally touched them on the first day (mistakenly) and the cat only licked her finger. It happened like this, sister put her hand in the box which have the kittens expecting that Joury the cat is alone(didn't know that delivery was here), she wanted to pet her and surprisingly my sister feels a wierd thing (afterwards discovers that it's the belly tube) she feels the cat had licked her, hears a kitten cry,and takes her hand out to have a look. When she looks she discovers babies. I want to experiment my cat's reaction if I pat her after giving a litter, I somewhat expect her to hit, but she's so nice and loving. On the same day afterwards the cat presents a trick, she stands up on two feet to get food or treats and plays afterwards as if nothing had happened. She gave birth very intelligently and had done the job alone. She cares for the babies very good, they are very clean and so is she. But she does not give a damn if we touch them. She's acting as if the babies are everyones. We understand cat signs and I'm pretty sure she doesn't care. Infact I can grab a kitten right now even if it's sleeping or nursing and she'd be okay. I know it's nice and she trusts us, but shouldn't she be more definsive? Is she immature? It's her first litter. We have neighbors spending a couple weeks with us and she hisses at their kids if the kids corner her. So this kindness she gives isn't for everyone. If we pat her feet or hip a couple of times to annoy her she hits, if we give extra love she hits, if we carry kittens she's okay. Why is that? Is this a problem I should consider?They are 1 week old now, they look healthy, but can it be we are cuasing something bad to happen in the long run? Also can their be behaviour problems with them when they grow if carried a lot at such an early age? </p>

<p>Edit: The cat tries to have them back now once they cry. Reliefing. But I'd still love an answer explaining about the kittens side.</p>

"Seriously violent fights between cats that have coexisted peacefully for years","<p>this is my first question on SE, I hope I am doing it right. 
My girlfriend and I have two adult cats, a 6 years old male and a 3 y.o. female, both neutered. We brought the lady home when she was just a few month old. The older cat didn't take it very well at the time, but after a while he accepted her and they have been getting along well ever since, save the odd random skirmish. Until today.</p>

<p>We were watching a video featuring two cats hissing at each other, at the end of which something funny was supposed to happen. We'll never know what it would be because, all of the sudden, our cats turned on each other with a violence we hadn't seen since we first brought home the youngest. We struggled to put off the fight, luckily before anyone got seriously injured, but the tension hasn't died out yet. We have tried to bring them together twice and both time they tried to jump at each other's throat. We are keeping them separate now, but the situation is rather distressing for everyone.</p>

<p>Has anyone experienced something similar? Should we wait until things settle themselves or is there something we should do to bring back peace?</p>

"Is it possible to train dogs to share their toys?","<p>We just adopted a second dog who is a female. We have a male dog which we adopted 3 years ago.  He's used to having free access to all of his toys (he's a spoiled brat). I read that when you introduce a second dog, you should remove all toys and slowly introduce new toys to each dog. So far, we have taken away all toys except today we just introduced each dog to a toy. Each dog is very possessive about their new toy. If one dog shows interest in the other dogs toy, the other other dog will be aggressive.  They both do this to each other.</p>

<p>For now, because the recently adopted dog has only been in our house for a few days, we take all toys away unless we are supervising the dogs. I'm wondering if it's possible for the dogs to learn to share their toys in the future, or is this a behavior that needs to be trained? If so, how should we go about training them to share their toys? We would ultimately like to leave their toys out again as we did with our first dog, so they can have things to chew on when ever they get the urge.</p>

<p>Generally, what are important things to think about when planning such a trip?  My primary concern is the safety of the birds.</p>

<p>Much of the information I can find is about cats and dogs, and travelling with birds seems to be more difficult.  I am also very worried about transporting the birds in the cargo hold.  Cockatiels freak out easily and can seriously injure themselves by flapping in a cage.

"Can Whiskas cause kidney disease?","<p>I heard a local veterinarian to say that Whiskas can cause kidney disease. I tried to research that claim, but so far I haven't been able to find academic articles  dealing with this issue, even though there is a vast amount of anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone knows for certain if this is true or false. Apparently, older cats have propensity to suffer from kidney disease. However, some people say veterinarians have told them that Whiskas was responsible for the death of their cats. I suppose that veterinarians know about the incidence of kidney disease in cats, so it is surprising to read that kind of blanket statements being made by professionals.</p>

<p>Some people say that taurine is to blame. However, taurine is classified as an essential nutrient by the VCA Animal Hospitals. Others say that dry food or fiber is what makes cats sick, but again no evidence is offered to support this view.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:
In response to @DanS: It is hard to answer precisely your question. As far as I know, there are not guidelines on daily recommended intake for cats. I even found some opinions saying that nobody knows (e.g. <a href=""http://www.askthecatdoctor.com/howmuchtofeedcat.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>). However, when it comes to protein there seems to be a magic number: 36%. It almost seems that food companies strive to reach that number. Of course, the question should be: 36% of what? In the package I bought, it says that the recommended amount  is between 45g and 90g depending on age. This is equivalent to 16g and  32g of protein, respectively. Keep in mind that the product I bought is intended for kittens. Now, the only table of values I found was <a href=""http://www.fediaf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/PetNutrition/FEDIAF_Nutritional_Guidelines_-_final_version_6-09-11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">published</a> (pdf) by FEDIAF (page 17.) It says the recommended amount of protein is 25.0g for adults and 28-30g when cats are still growing per 100g of dry food. As you can see, if my package contained 100g, it would have 35.5g of protein, an increase of 15% with respect to the highest recommended daily intake given by FEDIAF. Is this a significant increase? I don't know.</p>

<p>As for salts, I only know that Whiskas contains iodized salt but the product I bought doesn't say the amount. Other ingredients are specified in another paragraph but without percentages or amounts.</p>

"Why do cats behave differently in Japan?","<p>I've been living in Japan for the past year and a half, and I've noticed that cats here generally seem to behave differently from the cats in England, where I'm from. People from other European countries and the USA say the same thing.</p>

<p>In England, most cats are shy and will run away from an unfamiliar human, while a few others are gregarious and will approach strangers and seek affection from them. In Japan one often sees cats just sitting there and more-or-less ignoring people who pass by or approach them, which isn't something I ever really saw before coming here. (The exception would be a few cats I've known that live in a bar or a shop and have learnt to mostly ignore the customers, but in Japan one sees this behaviour all the time, just in the street.)</p>

<p>Similarly, in Britain, cats are very territorial and will generally fight other cats. You wouldn't expect to see two or three cats calmly sitting next to each other unless they were in an enclosed space such as a house. But it's a common sight outdoors in Japan.</p>

<p>Examples of these behaviours can be found on YouTube. For example, the cats in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B9h94NcjK8"" rel=""noreferrer"">this video</a> are probably trained, but the behaviour of average cats found in public places is often not so different.</p>

<p>Does anybody know the reason for this? I can think of a few possibilities. It might be genetic, or it might be because of the very high population density (of both humans and cats), or it might be because Japanese people behave differently towards cats than western people. (Cats are considered lucky in Japanese culture.) I'm interested in which if any of these explanations is correct. Have the reasons for the behavioural differences between Japanese and European cats been studied, and is the answer known?</p>

"Would my work schedule rule out getting a dog?","<p>I have been thinking about getting a dog (a medium or large breed - most likely large), as I have always wanted one, and my daughter wants one. I live in north-central Florida, where we have hot summers, warm springs and autumns, and cold to warm winters, in case anyone is wondering what the outside conditions would be. The issue lies in that I work <strong>12-hour graveyard-shifts on a rotating schedule</strong>, and my daughter is with her mother on days I work. </p>

<p>I work from <strong>7pm to 7am</strong>. If we look at my work-schedule on a bi-weekly basis, the first week I work Monday, Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The second week, I work Wednesday and Tuesday, and I am off the rest of the days that week - Mind you, I would be getting off at 7am on my first ""off-day"", and then probably sleeping until about 2pm.</p>

<p>My idea is that my dog would be both an outside and inside dog, but <strong>while I am at work, she will live outside</strong>, and while I am home, she can come inside. It would be about 12.5 hours by the time I leave the house to go to work and the time I come back, so that's far too long to let her stay inside having to hold in her movements while also seriously increasing the risk of an accident caused by an inability to hold in said movements or from her simply getting bored and tearing up the place.</p>

<p>While she is outside, she would have about half an acre of fenced in yard to frolic in. I would obviously build her some type of kennel with access to plenty of water, and food for the night. The house is located in a rural area.</p>

<p>On days that I am off and home at night, though, I would like her to be able to sleep inside. </p>

<p><strong>So, my questions are:</strong></p>

<p>Is it too long of a period of time to be leaving her alone and outside? </p>

<p><strong>Is this schedule too crazy for her to understand that she can only come inside and/or sleep inside while I'm home, and the opposite while I am away?</strong> (This is the main question I am seeking an answer for.)</p>

<p>What kinds of affects would this have on a dog if my daughter and I take the time to love her while I am home?</p>

"leopard gecko odd behavior-","<p>i got my leo a month ago. i love her to bits, her name's frankie. the vet said she was around 6 months old. maybe i'm just worrying too much, but i figured i should get input anyway.</p>

<p>to begin, i have a hot side and cool side of the tank; the hot side is 87 and the cool side is 70. the hot side is powered by a heat lamp, which also powers the heat mat underneath (otherwise it can't maintain its heat). the substrate is reptile carpet, which i clean at the end of the week with all of her hides and tank. i feed her every day 3 crickets and i switch between calcium spray (i also have powder in a bowl for her to eat whenever she needs it)and multivitamin. i also have a UVB light set up that i put on during the day so she can rest.</p>

<p>she's a weird one; she's constipated and it worries me. i feel like she doesn't poop as much as a leopard gecko should, and when she does (it does have its white and brown component), it looks like a literal bean. it's also a bit wet. unfortunately she always poops whenever i'm not around, so it gets dried out by the heat lamp and therefore can't be tested (and her poops are so rare. i'll try and get a sample this weekend if she does). in addition, she sometimes makes noises out of the blue. i know they're capable of doing so, but with that and the constipation, something seems off. she's also an unstable walker. yes, she can run, but when she walks slowly, it's always very shaky. today she had a head spasm (maybe she was swallowing?? this happened after eating, but the crickets are pretty small) for a few seconds and that worried me even more. </p>

<p>she eats regularly. sometimes i see her drink water. although today when i finished feeding her, she tried lunging for a rock. she bit it too, and when i took them away, she kept looking at them as i moved them back and forth. i did this to test if they were interesting to her. and i was right. so no more rocks in the tank. i then changed her water, and after putting reptisafe in it, she looked at the bottle the same way she looked at the rocks. i think she wanted to eat that too. </p>

<p>i took her to the vet on monday. after an exam (which consisted of looking at her stomach for signs of impaction, her gums, and eyes), she was fine, however her feces couldn't be tested since they'd dried out. the vet said (at least for the constipation issue) to use a UVB light (which i had just started) and to maybe try a bath. i know that frankie will hate it; she doesn't like me holding her. </p>

<p>this was...a lot.</p>

<p><strong>the question: why is she constipated and what can i do? ever since i started the UVB light, i feel like her constipation's gotten worse. it's been a week since she's pooped.</strong></p>

<p>She gets 1 hour intense walk at 6am every morning where I work her and try to make it as engaging (and tiring!) as possible but not too much as she is still young. I do all sorts of things, ring work, bite work, tugging, fetch and obedience, bits of everything really. Which does tire her out for the most part, she may have a play with our other one when we get back but more often than not she settles down and we go to work.</p>

<p>She also goes to a working dog club on a weekend to work on aspects and do fun stuff like obedience and protection work etc. </p>

<p>When we get back from work she wants <em>constant</em> attention which is great to engage with her and keep us the main interest. But she barks when we don't give her immediate attention.

I theorized that wearing the Thunder Shirt for multiple days could have been constricting one of her internal organs, and now that I'd removed it, whatever was constricted suddenly started doing whatever it was supposed to be doing. But my wife said it's just the sound of impending diarrhea and not related to the Thunder Shirt.</p>

<p>Could the Thunder Shirt have caused, or contributed to, my dog getting sick? Or did she just start acting more normal after I took it off because she was already feeling better after throwing up, and the timing was just a coincidence?</p>

"Why do dogs hold specific objects in their mouth?","<p>I found <a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100214154957AAbYji9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Yahoo answer</a>, stating dogs carry specific objects around because of an emotional attachment. I'm curious if they have the ability to form that kind of attachment. </p>

<p>My pug is obsessed with stuffed animals, but usually only plays with one stuffed shark. I haven't been able to pair a few specific situations where she goes to the stuffed shark, it seems random. Sometimes she goes weeks without playing with it, other times it's every day. </p>

<p>Her interest seems to have positive feedback for engagement with it in the near future. That makes me wonder if she's interested in the shark because I'm interested in her when she's playing with it.</p>

<p>Am I looking at...</p>

<ul>
<li>Her attachment to an object, </li>
<li>A sensation, </li>
<li>Or her attachment to me?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it could be useful to know if I am responsible for her habits like this or, if they're intrinsic.</p>

"What causes a Norman's lampeye to lose the ability to move it's tail fin?","<p>I have an aquarium with eight Norman's lampeyes (unfortunately 5 male, 3 female) and some other fish. Last Sunday I discovered that one of the Norman's lampeyes wasn't doing so well. She was nearly moving and floated near the surface of the water, head slightly down and tail slightly up touching the surface.</p>

<p>All other fish where fine.</p>

<p><strong>Observed symptom:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hanging near the surface of the water;</li>
<li>Fast breathing, but not gasping for air;</li>
<li>Not eating;</li>
<li>Not using her tail fin;</li>
<li>Swims head down tail up.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other observations:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Does not roll to the left or right while swimming (not swimming slanted);</li>
<li>Still responsive: reacts on fishnet and tries to escape, which goes pretty well.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Water quality and environment:</strong></p>

<p>All water parameters are fine and did not change in the last weeks. The day before I discovered the sick fish I did a small 20% water change, which I do every 2 weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Temperature: 24.2;</li>
<li>PH: 7.4;</li>
<li>KH: 6;</li>
<li>GH: 3;</li>
<li>Nitrite: 0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plants are growing fine, there is not much waste and I use liquid fertilizer. My tanks filtration is about 5 times an hour and lights are on for 9 hours a day. Algae growth is almost none, the algae that do grow are most of the time eaten by 5 shrimps (soon to be expanded by a pregnant one).</p>

<p>Both the water quality and environment did not change in the past weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Feeding:</strong></p>

<p>I feed two times a day. I try to feed small amounts, but I'm suspecting that I could feed them less. 2 times per week I feed them with frozen food.</p>

<p><strong>Actions taken:</strong></p>

<p>Because I didn't notice any disease that could possibly be cured with medicines I didn't use them. But I did add some salt (0.05 grams per liter 99.8% NaCl) to the water to give the fish a more friendly environment. This helps because the fish spends less energy getting salts out of his body (Osmosis etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Two days later:</strong></p>

<p>Now two days later the fish seems more alive and tries to eat when feeding. Also the breathing is way slower than before (back to normal). But the fish still swim without using the tail fin. Could it be paralyzed for good?</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<p><em>What kind of disease could this be?</em><br>
<em>What causes a tail fin to suddenly stop working?</em></p>

<p>I should notice that one of my other Norman's lampeyes misses an eye (ironically), I discovered this just after I got them from the pet store. But it seems that it doesn't bother the fish, he is doing fine.</p>

<p><em>Could these fish suffer from inbreeding?</em> </p>

"Should I stop younger buddy cat from playing rough with older cat?","<p>We got a younger sweet cat (now 5!) for company for our older cat (almost 12!) because the older cat is very sweet and loving and loves other cat's company.  The younger cat has been the <em>best</em> companion for the older cat.  They've been together almost 4 years.  They've always played 'rough', and when the older cat was younger he engaged in rough play with other housemates.</p>

<p>However, lately, I notice that our older cat is becoming more and more sensitive to the rough play with the younger cat.  When the younger cat chases him and mounts him and bites him on the neck, our older cat starts wailing much more loudly than he used to.  This is also consistent with him being louder in general around feeding time; he used to be very quiet.</p>

<p>My question is: should I restrain the younger cat from this rough play when I am around?  I know older cats become more sensitive in their joints, etc., but I always thought the exercise and play would be good for him nonetheless.  I don't want to be stupid about it though and keep letting the younger cat have his way regardless of the older cat's feelings.  </p>

"kittens are biting everything... literally","<p>SO my cats are excessive biters.  wall corners, the plastic window shades you have in most apartments, my metal towel holder, cardboard boxes, any food in plastic bags or wrappers on the counters such as a loaf of bread, and many of my electronic devices such as headphones and charging cables for my iphone, apple watch, and mac book pro.  </p>

<p>I know when I got the kittens, they were very young at 4 weeks (yea that's a whole other story), and I have been waiting for them to grow out of this destructive phase (they have also destroyed some things like the cap to the side overflow drain in the bathtub) but it seems to be never ending at almost 9 months old now.  Even bit the glass lip off of my beer bottle while I was in another room.  </p>

<p>I have tried everything from coating the wires in that bitter spray to providing them enough toys that it is a mine field to walk around.  They have dry food out 24/7 regulated by 2 small bowls that usually last them a little more than a day before I refill.  I do also feed them their wet food as well so they should be getting a balanced diet.  They don't scare very easily if at all.  Any attempts to clap or do pennies in a can doesn't even pique their interest as they continue the behaviors.  They are also extremely aggressive when I am eating food more so than any other cat I have had.  Usually after a few times of putting them down off the table or away from where ever it is I am eating, the cats will lose interest and walk off.  These 2 guys however, will try to ""outsmart"" me by coming at different angles, or different sides of the table, or come up behind other objects thinking I can't see them and it will turn dinner into a 15 minute game of keep away.</p>

<p>Is there something  more I can do? is this an issue I should talk to the vet about? I have previously brought it up to the vet while getting them their kitten shots but they kind of dismissed the subject or provided solutions I have already tried.  I have put wires I don't use away in a drawer where they cannot access it, but for my phone I charge over night, I have been waking up to them chewing on it in the middle of the night.  I don't want to lock them out of my bedroom but I also cannot have my phone where I won't hear it due to my job.  I would like to stop the behavior rather than just find a temporary solution like hiding the wires.  Would getting something like cat grass help?  dog chew toys? </p>

<p>Also to add... I have been using the spray bottle pretty heavily since they were young.  It is to the point all I have to do is show them it and they stop doing what ever it is they are doing.  They also know what they are doing is wrong because when I hear them up to something and they hear me walking into the room they are in, they instantly scatter.  So my cats are aware that when they are doing certain behaviors that a consequence is coming.  They just, try to get away with it like any other kid I suppose lol  But that is the other odd thing is that they are NOT afraid of water.  They practically shower with me every morning sitting on the side of the bathtub.  As far as what breed they are in case it matters, they were advertised as a maine coon mix that I adopted from a shelter.  However when taken to the vet, they are just short haired domestics and they do not show any physical traits of a maine coon anyways.</p>

<p>They are very loving playful cats.  Some of the most loving cats I have had.  My female loves to be cradled in my arms like a baby for hours while I am working at the computer and my male will often jump up and lay on my arm or curl up on the inner part of my arm if they are extended.  Both are very bonded to me and will follow me every where I go and my female even puts her paws on the side of my leg like dogs do when I come home from work.  Even my mom commented on how attached the cats are to me as well.  They really are great, cute, and friendly cats that everyone loves when ever they visit my place.  It's just this destructive kick they have that I don't know how else to put an end to it.</p>

"Dogs increasingly becoming picky and going to the bathroom in crate","<p>So I have 2 dogs (1 boy 1 girl) that are fixed and are 10 years in age. They are siblings and are miniature doberman pinschers mixed with maltese. My mother died last March and had been taking care of them while I was away at college (I'm 20). I moved into my own apartment with the dogs. The dogs have had separation anxiety since my mother died and are now crated together in a huge crate when I am not home or else they will howl and bark nonstop which is not okay in an apartment. </p>

<p>Since we have moved, they have gotten increasingly picky in their food and are disobedient. The male dog has lost a distressing amount of weight and has been checked out numerous times. There is nothing medically wrong with him. He always finished his food but was losing weight anyway. My vet recommended I switch them to a combination of prescription wet and dry food. After this, he seemed to gain weight for a short amount of time before the food made him nauseous and caused him to throw up and defecate in his crate overnight. </p>

<p>After this began, I switched them to a Beneful wet food and a dry food. He has been gaining weight since I switched them but I noticed that both dogs now refuse to eat their dry food at all. They will eat the wet food and pour out the dry food and proceed to urinate in the bowls and all over the crate. I know this could be seen as not going outside enough, but that is definitely not the case. I take them out when I get up in the morning (8am), when I get home from work or school (4:30pm) and then around dinner time (7pm). The dogs get fed and receive water at dinner time. </p>

<p>They have been urinating multiple times a day every day since I have returned from a 2 week vacation. The dog-sitter did not have this issue with the dogs and followed the exact same schedule as I did. So I guess my main questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Are my dogs doing this (peeing in their food and water bowls) to spite me? They have no medical problems as I have gotten them evaluated multiple times in the last 2 or 3 months.</p></li>
<li><p>How can I decrease their urination inside my home? They don't seem to care that they are peeing in their sleeping place and I can not place a pee pad because they will tear it up.</p></li>
<li><p>Should I switch them to all wet food? They will refuse to eat for well over 24 hours if I just fill their food bowl with dry food and I do not want to starve them. They have not had any stomach problems with the wet food but the current portions I purchased are too small to be meals on their own.</p></li>
<li><p>Am I doing something wrong? They were completely crate trained for the past decade and normally had no </p></li>
</ol>

"Why do some dogs dislike fluorescent clothing?","<p>My dog <strong>really doesn't like</strong> people or animals wearing fluorescent clothing.  I thought it was just my dog, but recently, whilst stuck on a motorway at night in the rain, following a crash, a policeman in full day glow overalls stuck his head next to the car and... well, the policeman remarked that it was common for dogs to dislike fluorescent clothing.</p>

<p>So the question that I would like to know is, why this might be?</p>

<p>I know dogs have different colour vision than humans, as represented in the below image:</p>

<p>Initially I was thinking that the fluorescence might appear particularly bright for them, (looking at the bright yellow 'band') and this was what dogs disliked.</p>

<p>But then I saw this image (below) to do with reflectance of fluorescent ink (fluorescence is occurring either end of the human visible spectrum) and it made me think, is it actually possible that rather than making things seem brighter, fluorescent clothing makes things almost disappear to a dog?  In such a scenario the dog is scared because they just see bits of objects moving not a complete picture.</p>

"Is it possible to gut-load a mouse?","<p>When feeding insects to lizards, it's a common practice to <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/1691/481"">gut-load</a> them in order to deliver nutrients to the lizard.

<p>Is it possible to do the same thing with a mouse? If I want to make sure a snake gets a good dose of calcium with it's food, could I feed the mouse calcium supplements a day or two before feeding it to the snake? Or will it not make any difference?</p>

<p>Is it possible to feed a mouse a special diet to give it the highest possible nutritional value for a snake?</p>

<p>I'm not assuming that the mice aren't sufficient by themselves, but a juvenile snake would benefits from vitamin and calcium supplements while it grows. Especially since juvenile mice have almost half of the calcium content that adult mice do (<a href=""http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/zoo/WholePreyFinal02May29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">See page 12</a>). Frozen mice purchased at the store are commonly injected with vitamins and supplements, so if I'm managing my snakes diet I could be missing out on those added supplements.</p>

<p>I would prefer not to have to try and feed the snake the supplements directly, coax it into eating a dusted mouse, or manage the dosages for supplement injections into the mouse myself. So I was wondering whether or not those supplements could be passed through the mouse's diet, similar to how it's done with insects.</p>

"How can you tell if neck biting between dogs is too rough?","<p>We have two dogs.  One is a 4 year old male and the other is a new dog we adopted over a week ago who is a 2 year old female.  They are both the same breed (Alaskan husky) and roughly the same size.</p>

The doctor discovered some blood in his urine and wants to do an x-ray to see what's going on. He said it is likely to be a bladder stone. The other less common problem is a bladder disease that I cannot remember the name of. The x-ray is scheduled for the end of this week (8/8/2014). </p>

<p>Between now and then, the doctor advised me to provide him with an extra water bowl and change it more frequently. He's an indoor cat in a 2 bedroom apartment. He doesn't have far to go for it.</p>

<p>If it is a bladder stone, what sorts of changes will I need to make for my cat (diet, exercise, etc). He is approximately 5 years old and we got him at a shelter. Should I expect surgery of any kind? Does anyone know the approximate costs associated with this condition? </p>

"How can I make my cat use her house during winter cold?","<p>My cat Catalina is 7~ months old, pretty healthy and playful.</p>

<p>I'm worried because the temperatures are dropping now and the inside of our house isn't really warm during winter at nights (15 degrees celsius, 59 farenheit). She sleeps at the sofa and when I wake up her fur and ears are cold, so I got her a fancy fluffy house about 50x50x50 cm on size and it looks good in relation to her size, she can move inside.</p>

<p>Now the issue is she doesn't sleep in her house, she keeps sleeping at the sofa and sometimes on the table. Should I worry, or are cats smart enough to use shelter if it is too cold for them? Can I do something so that she feels like using her house?</p>

"Freshwater aquarium - many fish batches dead, LFS keeps claiming that water is 'perfect'","<p>Got a new 30 gallon aquarium ~1 month ago.
The seller told me to use tap water (no conditiner), run the pump for a week (to get rid of chlorine), then bring a sample for test.</p>

<p>Did that, didn't use any soap/detergents for cleaning. All the rock/plants are from the same LFS. </p>

<p>One week later, brought the water sample for test, they said 'perfect' (1), gave me 6 tetra pristellas. Dummy me, came home, dumped everything in the aquarium. </p>

<p>One week later, 4 out of 6 still alive, another water sample, another 'perfect' (2) from LFS, a new group of fish (mollies, guppy, 1 gourami, 2 plecos - 9 total). Dumped them all again (really stupid). Mollies were really happy initially, one of them even gave birth.</p>

<p>Another week later, 9 fish dead, coming sad to the LFS, with another water sample, another 'perfect' (3). This time they sold me another 5 tetras (the remaining tetra 'is very sad, let's add compay') as well as 3 otocinclus, to keep raving algae in control. This time I made sure that the bag temperature is same as in aquarium, did partial water changes in the bag, topping it with the aquarium water. About ~45 minutes before releasing them.</p>

<p>Another week later, 4 tetra and 1 oto dead. Come to the same LFS, the water is 'perfect' (4) again, they even tested for P, PB and copper. Nothing. The readings were as previous: 
Nitrate &lt; 5, Nitrite = 0, Total hardness - hard, Total chlorine - 0, KH - 40, pH - ~7.4.</p>

<p>Besides this, I have a liquid test at home, pH is always ~ 7.4, amonia/Nitrate/Nitrite - lowest value on the charts. </p>

<p>So, now I have 2 tetras and 2 oto, still alive but not very happy. Pump is rated for 50 gallons, always running. Temperature measured by 2 different thermometers - 79, maintained by 2 heaters rated for 25 gallons. </p>

<p>Sorry for long preamble - but what should I do now? I finally conditioned full aquarium (using stuff that's sold by LFS), thinking about getting a RODI filter - maybe the tap water has something not showing on the tests? Paying $250 for a full water test is a bit expensive.</p>

<p>P.S. Fish was always fed once a day, but all of them stopped eating after a days or two.</p>

"Why does my cat lick her belly until sore?","<p>Hi I’m wondering if anyone can help me because I’m at a serious loss and I don’t know what to do. It’s really frustrating because I have been to the vets constantly over the past two years, to three different vets and nobody can tell me what’s wrong with her :(. </p>

<p>I believe after researching online that she’s participating in something called mowing. But all the pictures I’ve seen are no where near as bad as hers. She began grooming her back leaving bald patches like the mowing but she’s now moved to her belly and it gets so bad that as you can see in the picture, she will bite and cut herself. I have literally tried everything. She does not have fleas. Mites. Ringworm. Anything like that. The most recent visit to the vets ruled out any infection or parasites. They gave her steroid tablets but it’s done nothing to help her grooming. I’ve changed her food several times from when this started (although someone suggested wet food so I may give this a go). We’ve bought a special brush to help remove dead hair and skin so she doesn’t feel the need to groom as much but that hasn’t helped. Although we get little flakes of skin that look like dandruff come out, has anyone had an experience with this? Maybe it’s like a cat eczema or something? She’s settled, gets on with our other cat and there’s no reason she’d be stressed. We have treated her for this in the past, we were given meidication and it’s still happening. We’ve now had to result in putting a cone on until it scabs over and settles but it’s so horrible to see her like it. </p>

<p>I literally don’t know what else I can do. Every time I go to the vets they either don’t know, don’t find anything or subscribe her medication thats innappropriate and I don’t want to keep medicating her when it’s not an accurate diagnosis. </p>

<p>Any suggestions advise or experience would be HUGELY appreciated   </p>

"One of my dogs harass my other dogs, even though they are submissive","<p>I partially work with dog sitting and have a little pack of a handful dogs that I take care of a couple of days a week (that is, typically I have each dog 2-3 days per week, sometimes they are alone with me, sometimes I have a couple of them, but I have limited it to 3 simultaneous dogs because more than that is impractical when I take them for a walk).</p>

<p>One of these dogs is a 4-5 year old neutered male shelter dog that very much looks and behaves like a jack russel terrier. Let's call him B.</p>

<p>B was the second dog I started to take care of, before him I had A, a eurasian bitch that I have had since she was 4,5 month old (A is now 1.5 years old).</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly A was submissive to B and everything was fine (A is very submissive when meeting dogs in the dog park, spending most of her time on the back, never causing any troubles). After a couple of month A and B had a one or two fights, nothing serious (i.e., no blood or so but some growling, baring the teeth and some attempted bites). Suddenly A was dominant and B was submissive to A.</p>

<p>After these incidents, B suddenly become very affectionate towards me and my girlfriend. Sometimes we deliver B to his owner somewhere outside (rather than she comes by here and pick him up which is the normal procedure) and he always refuse to walk away with his owner on these occasions and show all signs of unhappiness when I leave (he is very happy to see his owner, it is just that he can't bear that I leave).</p>

<p>After a while I also got a male pomeranian, C, that is of approximately the same age as B. Still no problem. C is quite reserved and doesn't care about me nor other dogs. C is chemically neutered. Only time he shows happiness is when he is picked up by his owners in the afternoons. Still no problems. A, B and C get along well as long as I serve them their food a bit apart.</p>

<p>However, recently I got two more dogs, a male shiba puppy, 4-5 months old, D, as well as a female dachshund, 1,5 years old, E.</p>

<p>Now the problem started: D and E are submissive to B but he is not satisfied with that and harasses them so much that they are scared of both him as well as going through my door when their owners leave them in the morning. Especially D suffers from severe bullying by B and B frequently snap at him, which, not all the time but at least once a day, makes D scream and show all signs of being very scared (shivering, hiding in a corner near the door, focusing all his attention on B and so on).</p>

<p>So far, B has not (AFAIK) ""punched hole"" in D's skin when he has snapped him. Of course we have examined D after these attacks but ""squeezing"" D, moving his joints, examining face and ears and similar has never revealed any wounds or painful spots, although he has been limping for a short while once or twice after such an incidents.</p>

<p>Of course, I roar at B immediately after every incident which makes him roll over on his back, avoiding eye contact with me and show all signs of being submissive.</p>

<p>Generally B has no problems with other dogs when we are in the dog park. He doesn't play that much with other dogs but when other dogs run around in groups he kind of herd them by running behind, barking and trying to snap their hocks (but there has never been any incidents where he has injured the playing dogs he chases like this).</p>

<p>However, during the year I have had B has three times bitten humans. Twice men in their 60s, once an lady in her 80s. B's owner says he has a problem with slightly overweight men in their 60s and both of the male victims above matched that description. Remember, B is a shelter dog. It wouldn't be surprising if he has been abused by men matching that profile.</p>

<p>All these three attacks has been at the heels or calfs. Twice the person wore jeans, once the victim had bare legs. The bite didn't punch hole in the jeans and the man with bare legs only got a very shallow scratch on his skin (like you can do on yourself with your nails). Of course, biting humans, even though the bite is not very severe, is not acceptable behaviour from a dog but he doesn't seem to bite to injure the victim. However, these attacks has all completely unexpected. We have been walking down a crowded road and he just ignores everyone we meet until he suddenly attacks (we frequently go by public transport and he has no problem with that, he mostly sits or lays around my feet ignoring everyone around).</p>

<p>Furthermore, B's owner told me, after I told her about the first incident with D, that B doesn't like puppies. But obviously all puppies are not a problem - A was a puppy when they first met and B has no problems with most puppies in the dog park.</p>

<p>When it comes to E, B is not physical towards her, he just dominates her and forces her out of his way into a corner somewhere. When I have B, D and E together, unless I intervene, D and E end up in a corner near the door clearly very tensed and nervous.</p>

<p>I have tried going out somewhere where we are alone in the nature and release them all together to give them plenty of time and space to figure out their hierarchy but nothing ""happens"": B just hangs out quite close to me waiting for us to be ""done"" while D and E take the chance to sniff around and play with each other.</p>

<p>So what is behind B's aggressive behaviour towards D and E? And how can I make them get along?</p>

<hr>

<p>Response to @Elmy's very well written comment:</p>

<p>Thank you for your views. Especially the first one made sense. We had kind of interpreted the situation as B, when A raised in the hierarchy, wanted to be ""on good footing"" with us since he was lowest in the rank. Does that make sense? If B is below A we thought he felt us humans could protect him from A if the need arose and to achieve that he become affectionate towards us.</p>

<p>Anyway, yes he probably guards and protect us when around other dogs. But, when we are in a dog park, he is not as close as you suggest: typically he is a few meters away but he is very attentive to when we are about to leave and immediately follow us when we start moving. He clearly does not want to be left alone (maybe due to his life in a shelter). The other dogs act more ""natural"" here and want to stay and have fun and therefore have to be called in.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate on how I tell him to stay behind [me]? Do you mean when he is on leach or when he is off leach?</p>

<p>Of course I don't justify his biting, especially not when he attacks humans [1] . However, the shelter dog information seemed important to include when analyzing the situation. A dog that has always been treated good and bites is different from a dog that has been abused and bites.</p>

<p>What do you mean by ""too late""? My reaction is within a few seconds, the attack might still be ongoing when I react. However, I don't spend my days watching every step my dogs take so, unless I provoke an attack, it would be sheer luck if I could see it beforehand. Your suggestion seems unrealistic.</p>

<p><em>That doesn't mean being mean to any dog and constantly putting them on their back. It means setting the rules and controlling that everyone followes the rules. Make it a rule that noone is allowed to overly dominate someone else.</em></p>

<p>How do I achieve this? When B is with A and C he is very nice and calm, both to them and to me and has no problems if I play with A and C or they are in my knee, I serve them food or something. And B is still very nice towards me when D and E are around so I am not sure how I can construct a situation where B and I would have a ""dominance competition"". The only thing I can imagine is if I play with B and give him something to pull and drag. I always end these games by ""winning"" and taking the toy.</p>

<p>Regarding the last advice: yes, I always ""double"" the leach (= the length is halved) when walking around among people but sometimes unexpected things happens (The last attack on a human happened when we had been swimming from some rocks. I had him in his leach when we climbed out of the water on some slippery rocks but fell and lost the leach.).</p>

<p>[1] In between dogs some biting is acceptable, isn't it? The other dogs in my pack sometimes tumbles around playing and everyone is content and happy. Afterwards you can see that they are all greasy around the neck from ""soft"" bites in each other furs. One of them is white and has ""flappy"" ears and from time to time you can even see a small pink ""stains"" in his fur on the ears, probably a minuscule amount of blood when someone by mistake scratched him a little too hard. I have never heard him scream or anything like that so I guess it is just accidents that doesn't bother him that much. Anyway, this has nothing to do with B.</p>

"When and why do dogs ""stop liking other dogs""?","<p>When I walk my dogs I frequently meet other people with dogs that say that my dogs can't greet their dog because their dog doesn't like other dogs.</p>

<p>This claim always baffles me. Dogs are pack animals and live their first weeks or months of their lives with, typically, a handful of siblings that they play and interact with, expressing a lot of joy and happiness over the company.</p>

<p>How come they suddenly forget that experience and start going against their nature and dislike other dogs? Or are their owners projecting their own fear and nervousness on their dogs?</p>

<p>Of course, they grow up and are not as playful anymore (one of my dogs mostly ignore other dogs but if a dog come up and sniff him he justs ignores the sniffing dog and moves on with his business, no harm done) but going from there to actively disliking other dogs is quite a big step. How and why does this happen?</p>

"How to stop cat attacks","<p>I have a eight year old cat who has never shown any sign of aggression until the last six months or so. There have been no household changes during that time period.</p>

<p>The first attack happened when I was sitting on the bed and found a large spider about to crawl up my pajama shorts. I screamed. When I did, the cat hurled himself at my head three times in a row. He gouged a ding about an eighth of an inch long across the lens of my glasses. By the third attack, my husband was able to grab him, toss him (gently) from the bedroom, and shut the door. That was his first and worst attack. All attacks have taken place in the bedroom and they have all taken place in the evening.</p>

<p>A couple more head attacks like the first passed. However, last night, while I was straightening the bed covers, he attacked my hand. He punctured one of the main veins in the back of my hand with his teeth with a gruesome result.</p>

<p>This does not seem to be a ""play"" response at all. I tussle with him often enough: he likes to lie on his back and he holds his claws in and he pretends to bite my hand and beat off my wrist with his back legs while I scratch his chest. This is not that.</p>

<p>He has been seen recently by the vet for a regular checkup and is well.</p>

<p>The only factor I can think of is that the cat has the run of the bedroom during the day, but is closed out at night because he disturbs our sleep. He is not lonely at night, he has a cat buddy to hang out with. I wonder if he gets aggressive at night because he knows he's going to get booted off the bed and he's being possessive of the bed somehow.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> Why is my cat attacking me so viciously after several years of peace? Do cats get curmudgeonly with age? What is the appropriate human response, besides removing him from the scene of the crime? I would like him to stop entirely, but anything that could lessen the frequency would be welcome as well.</p>

"Dog running away with toy","<p>I have searched this site and didn't find a question with the specific issue we're facing.</p>

<p>We've tried to teach our dog fetch and came across an issue we didn't know we we're having prior to this and since then have noticed it's not a problem related to fetch training itself.
Our dog (7 year old Lab mix... Or shepherd... Or anything really) will go after the ball and get it. She does then run our direction when called but takes a turn just in front of us. After that she will lay down and chew the ball making sure she keeps a certain distance to us. Most times we have to pretty much ""corner"" her to get close. We are certain that's because she doesn't want to give up the ball. However she displays no signs of aggression, anger, fear or excitement during the process. Once we get a hold of her she gives up the ball easily when we grab it (we don't pull or anything, she let's go when we touch it). Also later we noticed that when we proceed the walk and she has the ball to carry she does not respond when recalled as long as she has the ball. </p>

<p>Additional info:</p>

<p>She loves chewing more than anything but that's not a suitable activity for walks and I'd like to have her running and be involved in play time when on a walk. She has a chew toy available at home that she has access to 24/7 (and I'd like to keep it that way). Giving up the chew toy is not a problem at all. However she won't fetch that either but drop it when called. 
She is not obsessed with toys. She will let us know she wants the ball when we have it but doesn't do so in an excessive way and is fine when she doesn't get it.
The ball is something special for weekend walks and is otherwise out of her reach because she will chew it up and destroy it.</p>

<p>We have tried multiple things such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reward her with a treat when she gives up the ball (after cornering her) or offering a treat in return for the ball; she won't take the treat cause the ball is more important. </p></li>
<li><p>Don't bother her at all when she has the ball (no recall and nothing); she will come closer to us and lay down there but still keeps a certain distance.</p></li>
<li><p>no recall but walk up to her and put her on the leash to continue the walk not ""mentioning"" the ball at all; no effect at all visible the next times we tried</p></li>
<li><p>making ourselves more interesting by backing off from her after calling her... Cheering, clapping.... The whole thing; it worked two times until she understood the concept.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Actual question:</p>

<p>How do I get my dog to stop walking away with the ball considering the approaches we've tried? And in addition to this (same issue so probably the same answer) how do I make sure she responds when I recall her when she has the ball?</p>

"Cat has bad tooth and won't eat but vet won't remove tooth if she isn't eating","<p>My cat has a very bad rotten mouth with an abscess. We noticed about 5 days ago when she stopped eating, and so we took her to the vet twice. She got a shot of antibiotics and painkillers that we give her twice a day, and both visits she also got an injection of fluids since she won't drink either.</p>

<p>The vet who will remove her bad teeth says that we must get her to eat to be healthy enough for the tooth extraction which is booked for 7 days away.</p>

<p>She is now at 5 days without food and I am very concerned. She wants to eat and has tried numerous times to eat soft food, but every time she will hiss and run away as if it causes her a lot of pain, even with the painkillers.</p>

<p>I am wondering how much longer she can go without food before we need to take drastic action. I have heard that force feeding an animal is bad for them, is that true? To get a feeding tube might be more than I can afford but I don't know what to do. How much longer should we wait to see if she eats? What can we do if she can't eat?</p>

<p>Edit- wanted to share the results in case anyone else has a similar problem. After she continued to not eat we got her into the vet the very next day as an emergency. She had a calcified lump that was preventing her from closing her mouth fully, so that explained why she couldn't eat. She was in a bit of pain after the removal, but by the next day she was eating just fine. So it seems if a cat isn't eating because of a bad tooth/abscess in their mouth, get it removed as soon as possible. If it is really bad there is no point waiting for antibiotics. She is doing so much better especially since she was otherwise healthy.</p>

"Changing out aggressive fish species?","<p>My husband and I ""adopted"" a 55 gallon tank that came with a number of fish, including 2 angelfish and 7 black skirt tetras.  Unfortunately we've been having an issue with both species: the angelfish either fight like crazy (liplocking, nipping, etc.; the female had an infected eye when we took her in and is now blind thanks to him), harass everyone in the tank, or lay a bunch of eggs (they usually eat them all so at least we don't have a ton of babies, but they get very territorial with the others when this happens) and the black skirts have started aggressively fighting (they usually would play together, looked a lot like tag, but now they're actually causing harm to each other).  We have been seriously considering rehoming them and getting new fish, but we weren't sure what would be compatible in our tank?</p>

<p>The other fish we have are: 4 neon tetras, 4 cory catfish, and 1 pleco.</p>

<p>The angels are the only ones picking on anyone outside of their own species, in fact everyone else gets along really well!  If we did switch out the angels and BST, are there any more colorful AND peaceful options we could look into?  We already plan on getting more neons since their school is so small at this time, but right now they're the only spot of color in a sea of silver and black. Thanks in advance for any advice you may have for us! :)</p>

"Is my hedgehog too agressive?","<p>I recently obtained a female albino hedgehog from her previous owners. They weren't that fond of the hedgehog and didn't socialize her well during the ~8 months they had her (they got her at ~1-2 months of age). They didn't take her out much, didn't play with her - basically, she stayed in the cage 99% of the time with them.</p>

<p>So, the hedgehog is ~10 months old, hasn't been socialized well, and is quite aggressive towards me.</p>

<p>I have had her for 2.5 weeks now. During that time I took her out every evening (after she woke up) and let her get used to my presence, noises that I make, etc. She spends about an hour outside of her cage, mostly playing freely on the sofa. For about 20-30% of the time, I try to interact with her by picking her up, trying to play with her. Every time I take her out, I give her a treat that she likes and eats eagerly.</p>

<p>Although she became slightly less aggressive for that time, she is still quite easily startled by me, doesn't let me touch her at all (unless I have picked her up forcefully), and mostly curls up into a ball when I am holding her.</p>

<p>Is this normal behavior? Can I expect the hedgehog to become more accustomed to my interaction if I continue trying to socialize her? What time-frames could I expect for a change in the behavior?</p>

"How to efficiently catch my own fish?","<p>I recently performed some maintenance on my tank which required me to move all of my fish from one tank to another holding tank for a short period of time.</p>

<p>The most difficult part of this entire process was successfully capturing the fish before and after the maintenance. I figured I must be missing some kind of trick or technique which led me to ask:</p>

<p><strong>What is the best way to catch my fish with minimal stress for them?</strong></p>

<p>I used a few different techniques to <em>eventually</em> catch them all but it took a while. The techniques I tried were: </p>

<ul>
<li>For anything with spikes / spines (Bristlenose Catfish etc) I used a jug to transport them in because I didn't want them to catch their spines in the net. On the whole, this worked well but would be harder with faster, smaller fish.</li>
<li>I used a largish net to catch the tetras (cardinal / rummy nose) and most were relatively easy with a bit of corralling. </li>
<li>The most difficult to catch were the Zebra Loaches which seemed both suitably fast and clever to completely outwit me. The net I used was almost as wide as the tank but they were seriously impressive in their evasion attempts. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My primary concern is stressing the fish out</strong>. I don't want to endlessly chase them around the tank because I don't think it does anyone involved any good. I deliberately caught the fish which is normally quite jumpy (Opaline Gourami) first so I had the element of surprise. After a few fish had been taken out, the rest knew what was happening and upped their game.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Additional Thoughts:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I could probably have drained more water out of the tank. It was still about 1 third full so there was room for them to evade me still.</li>
<li>I tried to balance 'sufficiently gentle' and 'fast enough' so maybe I need to go for more speed?</li>

"Is it normal for a feral cat to let me pet him/her?","<p>There is a very cute feral cat in our old home (its next to our new one). Almost 2 weeks ago, I started feeding it everyday. In the last few days, it started to rub me and even allowed me to pet here.</p>

<p>What I noticed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purring.</li>
<li>When I try to pet gently, its turn his head very quickly and sometimes raises his hand (I got a very little scratch :D).</li>
<li>No hissing, it follows me everywhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is: 
Since the cat is allowing me to pet him. Is there a way that I can attract it to live/sleep in a better place? Also, how can I estimate it's age? I want to get some blankets for it but not sure how to let him understand that.</p>

<p>By the way, I'm 100% sure this is a feral cat, since in my community people don't care about pets that much.</p>

"Why is a biological denitrification filter considered cheap to build and operate?","<p>I found more than one (old) websites (in German) (<a href=""http://www.teichratgeber.de/wodkafilter_bau01.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.teichratgeber.de/wodkafilter_bau01.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.ohligers.de/Nitratfilter1.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.ohligers.de/Nitratfilter1.htm</a> and there're probably more) which consider a biological nitrate filter a cheap and easy way of denitrification. Other research is difficult because it takes places in non-Q&amp;A forums which are overly painful to read. I found 3 references to the instructions above.</p>

<p>My research concludes that one needs a redox sonde for about 150 €, a dosage pump for another 60 € (and you probably want to spend double for some basic quality) and a potentially complex chain of filter chambers (not expensive, but not free neither) in order to avoid bacteria duff. The danger of the filter producing extremely smelly sulfuric products is omnipresent and makes it difficult to leave the filter unattended during vacation - or requires electronical regulation hardware which will cost a multiple of the basic setup described above.</p>

<p>A anion exchange granulate-based filter for a 600 l aquarium cost 150 € (or 500 € for 2500 l) and requires recharging every x weeks in boiling water for half an hour. The granulate lasts about 10 years; seporax, the filter media in biological filter, will certainly last longer, but some wearout will happen to it over the time, I assume. The filter shouldn't stop running, but the granulate isn't damaged as long as water flows through it, no matter how much nitrate it contains or whether it's charged or not.</p>

<p>I don't see the point. Am I missing something? Did the conditions/prices change over time (the second link estimates the cost at 800 DM for a 700 l aquarium which is ~400€)? Or did I just hit two pages based on superficial research?</p>

"How do you calculate the terrarium size needed for a lizard?","<p><strong>The Backstory:</strong></p>

<p>Complete pet newbie here, so bear with me please. A good friend of mine has a bearded dragon and asked me to look after it for a couple days while he was out of town. I'm the type of person that likes to approach any situation armed with as much knowledge as possible, so naturally I did some reading on bearded dragons. I've never owned any pets before and had never had much desire to, but I found that I enjoyed just watching his bearded dragon eat and ... glare at everything. A bit more research later and I discovered that lizards and other reptiles are relatively low maintenance, compared to say, a dog or cat. Which brings me to...</p>

<p><strong>The Plan:</strong></p>

<p>I'm seriously considering getting a small- to medium-sized lizard, and building a habitat for it (I'm a semi-pro craftsman). I have a limited amount of wall space in my house to put a vivarium up against, so I was considering a floor-to-ceiling design, with live plants inside. The dimensions of the enclosure I'm envisioning would be about 36"" wide, 26"" deep, and 72"" tall, with some amount of soil at the bottom. The 72"" height would probably be from the ""ground"", so the overall height might be closer to 84-86"". By keeping the depth to 26"" overall it should fit through any doorway. In terms of reptile species, I had looked at the Emerald Swift and I like it, and preliminary reading suggests they like to climb things, but I'm open to other possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

<p>Is there a formula for calculating how many gallons the enclosure should be based on the length/size of the reptile?  Or, is this different for each species?  How does being vertically-oriented affect the ""usable"" space?</p>

"My dog only pees in the house when I'm not home","<p>My 13 month old dog started peeing in the house again after being house trained.  He would <em>only</em> do it at night (when I was asleep) or when I would go out.  At first it seemed just like an accident, but when it started happening more consistently (even when walked immediately before bed or right before I left) I switched to crate training.</p>

<p>He's been mostly fine with the crate, though he does sometimes get stressed in there.  After a month, I decided to try seeing if the habit was broken.  I left him alone in the house (not in the crate) for about 20 minutes to run an errand, and when I got back he had peed 3 times.</p>

<p>If he's only peeing in the house when I'm not there to catch him, how do I correct the behavior?  Or should I just continue to leave him in his crate?  He doesn't have this problem  when I'm home (and awake), even if he's unsupervised or if it's been a while since his last walk.  </p>

"My second cat doesn't know how to play with my other cat and thinks that she's being attacked","<p>We've got a 7-month old calico cat named Milù, who is very active, mischievous and loves to play - with toys or with us. She loves playing hide-and-seek, stalking on us, attacking our hands and feet, chasing us and being chased by us and doing her high jumps when playing with her da Bird toys. </p>

<p>Milù is not a very cuddly cat but she's sweet in her own way. She loves following us around, squatting on the floor to trip us and meows if she doesn't see us. She's a purring machine at night and loves to knead and cuddle with us while we sleep. </p>

<p>I work from home and as you would know, cat + work at home = disaster. My cat simply wouldn't let me work, intentionally or even unintentionally. She's a very active cat and needs constant attention and play. She usually brings me her toys as if telling me ""let's play"" and I just don't have the heart to tell her no. Sometimes, when I ignore her, she lightly bites my legs and hands to show she's upset with me. Other times, she would stare at me for so long and God only knows what she's thinking. I just melt and give in. I tried locking myself in the room so I could concentrate on my work but she meows at the door or stays and waits there for me even for hours.  </p>

<p>So I convinced my husband to get another cat for our calico so she won't feel alone when I work. Many people say two cats are better than one and I got encouraged by this. After all, when we went on a vacation with our cat, I saw her very much interested with other cats and dogs visiting us at our rented apartment at a farm. We thought she wouldn't be hostile to other cats.    </p>

<p>So I called a local shelter and I told them I need an active and playful cat for my calico. They told me they have this 4-month old and already spayed female tabby cat who is a purring machine and loves playing. They also said she had lived at some point with older cats in the streets. She looked like a perfect match to Milù and we decided to get her and named her Violetta.</p>

<p>Violetta is the sweetest cat I've ever met. She purrs loudly to everyone, loves sitting and kneading your lap, and she will do this for hours at any time of the day. She's also full of energy. She never gets tired playing with toys. She's got some flaws too, though. She's not good at cleaning herself, always has claws out for everything (so it hurts when she kneads, so I trimmed her nails) and she complains a lot even over small things. She's also so eager and has a me first attitude.</p>

<p>We did the usual cat introduction ritual for a week - separate rooms, gradual introduction of scents, site swapping, cats eating behind a door, etc. Everything went quite well. Initially, there were some hisses from my resident cat but then she started to feel more comfortable each day. When there were no more hissing and they could eat their meals together, we decided to completely open the house for them. I was so happy to see them sleep almost close to each other and when they started to play. However, this is where the problem starts.</p>

<p>When finally, Milù felt comfortable around Violetta, she gradually went back to her real self - she started zooming around the house again, something she didn't do on the first few days Violetta was introduced to her. And she started playing with Violetta, and she seemed so eager to having her as a playmate. At first, she was a bit of a bully to Violetta, probably to establish dominance over her, and Violetta was fine with this. Then she started chasing Violetta around, something Violetta didn't like at first and she would whine. Then probably Violetta understood that Milù didn't want to hurt her and they started chasing each other around - i.e. literally running around, Milù runs after Violetta then vice versa. Until here, everything was fine. But Milù doesn't want to just run around, she wants a real cat play, - i.e. more physical - swatting, wrestling, biting, etc. And I think this is just normal? But Violetta doesn't want any contact at all, and whenever Milù swats at her or even lightly touches her tail, Violetta would whine and sometimes screams as if she is being murdered. </p>

<p>We tried telling Milù to be more gentle with Violetta, and she did this. When she corners Violetta, she turns around and leaves Violetta alone. But as soon as she has her back on Violetta, Violetta would jump and chase her, and the play begins again, Milù becomes a bit physical, then Violetta whines, and so on. This went on for a while and we thought Violetta would then figure out how to confront Milù.</p>

<p>When they're not playing though, they behave really well. Milù has stopped hissing completely and has accepted Violetta in her home.</p>

<p>However, during playtime, Violetta's whining became worse, then she started growling, then hissing, and I think this frustrated Milù. All she wanted was to play with Violetta. I observed her during their play, and she doesn't seem to have her claws out. I can even see her restraining herself but Violetta continues with her whining. Every time Milù corners her, Violetta would lie on her back in defensive mode and whines and growls at Milù. But if there's aggression on Milù's part, I don't understand why Violetta would come running back at Milù for more play once Milù has turned her back on her.</p>

<p>Two days ago though, somehow things went out of hand. During these plays, Milù, strangely, didn't back down as usual and continued swatting at Violetta. Violetta was screaming and growling, Milù pounced and wouldn't listen to me. My 8-year old daughter was crying and yelling at Milù while she watches the scene inches away from her feet. It was surreal! I had to sprinkle water on Milù to separate the cats. And we put them in separate rooms the whole day.</p>

<p>When my husband came back from work, we tried to put the two cats together again. Everything looked fine. The cats were acting as if nothing happened. Then they started playing! And everything went upside down. They ended up in a serious fight with fur flying around. Milù didn't look worked up, but Violetta was so mad.</p>

<p>So we tried concentrating on Violetta and have made some observations. When we're playing alone with Violetta with a toy, she's so pumped up with adrenaline and even has more energy than Milù does. However, she seems to know how to play with toys only. Other than that, she's unresponsive or doesn't know what to do in other kinds of games. Laser dot - no response, playing with hands - no response, stalking - uninterested, hide and seek - uninterested, us surprising her - no response, she just looks at us, chasing with us - no response.</p>

<p>But these are the things Milù loves doing! And now I'm at a loss! 
I don't know much about Violetta but it seems she grew up completely isolated from other cats that she doesn't know how to interact with them, and every move another cat makes is a threat for her. So I think this is why she suddenly assumes a defensive stance when Milù plays with her. And somehow, Violetta's unpredictability has frustrated Milù.</p>

<p>Now my situation is this: I've got two cats who both need attention, one is in the living room, the other in the bedroom. I can't work because Milù is with me and wants attention, while I hear Violetta meowing at the door in the living room. And it's driving me crazy. Now that Violetta has known the whole house, she isn't fine with being confined again in a room and is constantly meowing.</p>

<p>I'm seriously considering re-homing Violetta. First, because I don't know how to deal with her situation. Milù is my first cat and I have her for only 6 months so my experience in cat is very limited. Violetta needs to know how to be a cat, but only a cat could teach her how to do that. And honestly, I'm not sure if I'd like to sit and wait 'till she learns from Milù. What if they end up hurting each other seriously? I've got an 8-year old daughter and it breaks my heart seeing her cry and yell whenever the two cats fight. What if they end up hurting my daughter in one of those fights?</p>

<p>I really think Violetta is a perfect cat in a household with no other animals in it. I wish they had told me more about Violetta's upbringing before they gave it to me. </p>

<p>Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Since she's a kitten she's always sat by a window we leave cracked open and looked out at the streets. I recently bought a cat harness and leash and have been putting it on her, tying it to something sturdy, then opening the window next to my fire escape to let her stick her head out, smell the air and get a better look at the outside world. I sit near and supervise the whole time. She usually spend 10-15 minutes sniffing and peering out, watching cars go by, etc at which point she'll walk inside and I'll close the window then remove the harness.</p>

<p>Each time so far she's run under the bed after and hid for about 5-10 minutes. There's no other odd behavior following it, she's usually back out and about as long as we wait a few minutes and call her.</p>

"Iontophoresis: does this method have any real scientific backing?","<p>My dog has been administered procaine (called Novocain here in Ukraine) via iontophoresis as part of therapy for intervertebral disk disease, but I have serious doubts about this method.</p>

<p>It was widely used in Soviet polyclinics for humans, and still is as many of those polyclinics haven't really changed, but AFAIK it never helped anyone. It seems to be useless Soviet legacy alternative medicine administered chiefly to hypochondriac babushkas as placebo. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I don't want to argue with the vet because he is a surgeon with a good reputation. Most probably it'll be him who'll do the surgery if it gets needed. I'm really confused.</p>

<p>I'm following the rest of his instructions: giving pills (coxibs). But this iontophoresis thing is really strange to me. The vet told to come to the clinic every day to do this procedure, which costs money, and the taxi costs money.

<p>My 3 Year old boy (corn snake) has come back to me after being looked after by a friend for 9 months. I'm concerned about his body shape; he seems to have a pivot where his spine is, with mounds either side down the while length of his body. I'm wondering if he is overweight? He still has full interest in food.</p>

<p>And just FYI, my friend used him to mate her snake against my wishes if that has anything to do with anything ?!</p>

"Why would defanged snakes not bite?","<p>Regarding scope, this question is about a situation that occurred in what seems very unlikely to be a private home, but rather type of exhibition or possibly breeding venue. However, according to the Meta question ""<a href=""https://pets.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/641/is-there-a-distinction-between-questions-on-pets-and-questions-about-profession"">Is there a distinction between questions on pets, and questions about professional/amateur breeding of pet animals for show or sale?</a>"" the community seems to consider this within scope. </p>

<p>Please also note that I consider defanging to be unethical and can not imagine any situation in which I would support it. I am asking this question out of curiosity.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, I will move on to the question.</p>

<hr>

<p>There is a video called ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/YIMigVo1pyA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cleaning the Cobra Pit</a>"". In it, a man is moving cobras around and brushing up stuff from their habitat. He is removing all their eggs, of which there is a fair number. Most species would defend their eggs and young fiercely, and it seems <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/43520-cobra-facts.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cobras are no exception</a>.</p>

<p>What gets people's attention regarding the video is that the man is getting very close to the snakes, even touching them, walking amongst them, etc, and none of them are acting aggressively towards him, attempting to bite him, etc. Well, some of them (far from all) do raise their hoods and enter a defensive position, but he is totally ignoring that and grabbing after them, and they do not actually strike. From what limited contact I have had with cobras, my understanding is that most cobras would strike in that situation.</p>

<p>The snakes generally do not seem to fear the man very much. The man also seems entirely unafraid of the snakes.</p>

<p>I am assuming that these snakes are defanged, or otherwise <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venomoid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">venomoids</a>. I can not think of any other explanation for the situation observed in the video. However, I am not very knowledgeable about the topic, so I may be wrong.</p>

<p>If my assumption is wrong, then how can this man do what he is doing without being bitten?</p>

<p>I have seen videos of defanged snakes behaving aggressively (or defensively, you may call it) and attempting to bite people.</p>

<p>Why would these snakes not bite the man cleaning the pit? Could it be that he has raised them from their infancy, and that they are sufficiently tame not to act aggressively/defensively towards him? There is quite a large amount of snakes.</p>

"What does it mean when the skin on my cats' backs twitches?","<p>I've noticed this behavior on two of my cats, and I don't believe it is <a href=""http://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/skin/c_ct_feline_hyperesthesia_syndrome"">feline hyperesthesia</a> (neither exhibit any of the other symptoms commonly associated with the condition, and the back twitching does not seem random).</p>

"How long can fox baits be harmful for my dog?","<p>My neighbors whippet recently died from going into the bush when there were fox baits. The councils do warn that they are laying baits. (I also had a whippet that died from being baited on our common property here, but that's a separate story)</p>

<p>The local councils here use <a href=""http://www.animalcontrol.com.au/fox-bait1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Foxoff®</a> poison baits (containing 1080). Is this kind of bait something that becomes safe after a certain time or do they all need to be eaten?</p>

<p>It concerns me, as even though the council gives a time period that is not safe, after my neighbor's dog died, I've been a bit worried about baits being left in the bushland.</p>

"What signs indicate a dog has been baited with poison?","<p>I asked <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/788/how-long-can-fox-baits-be-harmful-for-my-dog"">How long can fox baits be harmful for my dog?</a> about my neighbor's dog dying from eating fox bait.</p>

<p>We had a rescue whippet when we first moved into this apartment complex. She loved to go for walks with our neighbor, a lovely lady, also a whippet owner, who would also have another, third whippet join the dogs on the walks.</p>

<p>At the time our body corporate was inundated with some very nasty threats by one of the apartment owners. Another neighbor's dog (a Staffordshire Bull Terrier) was suspected of being poisoned (baited) as she was very ill, but came through it.</p>

<p>On one walk where I was not present, I was told that the three dogs ran down one of the stairwells, then came running back and that my dog had gone into the garden to relieve herself and maybe sniffed around a bit.</p>

<p>Shortly after, my dog started having a seizure and foaming at the mouth. I was told this lasted for approximately half an hour, as my neighbor rushed her to the vet, but my dog died in the car on the way. I was told she seemed to be in pain and was panting, but at one point calmed down, before resuming the seizure (if that it what it was) and dying.</p>

<p>She had been an abused whippet and my neighbors were convinced it was because of that, maybe she had been hit on the head and a previous brain injury and so had the seizures from this (which can happen with head injuries).</p>

<p>However since then, my neighbors dog died from running into the bush and eating a fox bait. So it has gotten me thinking about my little dog.</p>

<p>What are some of the symptoms of a dog being poisoned/ baited and how long could it take for the symptoms to surface after ingesting a bait?</p>

"How can I improve the relations between my 3 dogs?","<p>Five months ago, I added a male dog to the family, a 7-months-old, Boxer / Pit Bull mix (though he looks like a Shar Pei) named Butcher.

"How to prevent play-fighting from escalating?","<p>I have a cat who likes to play-fight with me - and she clearly knows it's just a game, because she is usually very gentle about it, never uses her claws and only nips my hand or fingers softly - it is actually really cute. At least, at first. Because sometimes, she seems to escalate herself into some kind of frenzy where although she still keeps her claws sheathed she will start biting harder and harder until it is really painful. And I can not even break off the fight easily, because even if I withdraw my hand and put it somewhere else, she keeps trying to get close and bite it - I really have to shoo her off (sometimes repeatedly) to get her to stop.
I don't suppose there is a way to stop her from becoming so frenzied, but is there at least a way I can unilaterally stop the fight when I notice it is happening that restores the peace without actually having to scare her away? Or should I just stop play-fighting with her altogether?
For some background, she is the only cat (and pet) in the household, about 5-6 years old, and a 100% indoor cat.</p>

"Getting to know a dog who has had little human contact: what does all this mean?","<p>2 months ago I bought a plot of land with a workshop on it, and the seller mentioned that he let his friend keep a dog there. He suggested I might like to have the dog stay on there, for security (he's not much of a guard dog once you get to know him, but at least it shows there's always someone visiting.)</p>

<p>The dog is half Irish setter, half some other hunting breed. I have zero experience with dogs.</p>

<p>From the start, it seemed to me that the dog was lonely. He always waits at the gate barking when my or any other car comes) and manically chases his tail when I leave. Yet he would not interact with me in a way I could relate to. He would follow me, but as soon as I turned to look at him, he would run off. At first I thought this was some kind of fear, but now I think it's a game. </p>

<p>I want to get on with this dog, but at the same time I want him to know I am in charge. As a result, for over a month we basically ignored each other. I'm not going to get involved in his running games, it's not what I'm there for. On the other hand I would be happy to interact with the dog by petting him. </p>

<p>A female friend visited and the dog immediately went to her to be petted. He also likes to be petted by the owner (and is happy to be petted by me when the owner is there.) On the other hand the first time the dog allowed me to pet him when there were just the two of us, was today, just after the owner left, and before he had had his customary howl about the owner leaving. I expect he will go back to his random, charging around ways tomorrow.</p>

<p>I asked the owner why he didn't have the dog at home. He said one of his children was scared of the dog. I asked him if the dog had been abused by a man and that was why he let my female friend pet him but not be, and he said he got the dog from a home but there was no prior abuse. I feel the dog would benefit from more social contact (both human and other dogs) and in particular would benefit from some training.</p>

<p><strong>I observe the following behaviour patterns: what can / should I do about them?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Following me, then running away when I pay attention. This one freaks me out a bit sometimes, especially when he snorts right behind me. Sometimes he snorts when he's playing at ""hunting"" with his rag. (When I walk purposefully toward the dog he always stands his ground then suddenly darts out of the way to let me get where I'm going.)</p></li>
<li><p>Smelling my urine, then urinating on top of it (there is no toilet for miles around this plot of land.) Is this some kind of display of dominance or is it harmless? (I'm sure the dog himself doesn't know why he does it.) Anyway, that in itself is not a problem, but he also likes  urinating on my car (its such an old car I've decided not to make a fuss about this, though I gave him a good shouting for trying to urinate on my generator.)</p></li>
<li><p>Running in front of my car. When I leave the dog runs round and round my car, and frequently runs in circles right in front of it. This behaviour is quite annoying, and the only ""solution"" I have is to sound my horn. I really would hate to injure him.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I get the impression the dog likes having me there though he cannot or will not interact in a way which shows we are friends. My way of showing this would be to pet him, but he seems more interested in his ""approach then suddenly run away"" game which I will not be part of. I would like to have more trust with him, in order to be able to reduce some of his antisocial behaviours, as I feel bad bawling him out for doing things I dislike as it's not really his fault if he's never been told.</p>

<p>*As discussed in the comments, I've only bawled him out for urinating on my generator, as I consider it potentially dangerous to the dog.</p>

<p>She was in foster care for some time during the surgery, and then went on to the humane society. Since we've gotten her, she definitely continues to have a limp, especially after sleeping extended periods of time. I've been doing leg stretches for her on the hip, knee and ankle joints every morning and night, we carry her down stairs, but every morning i let her walk up one batch of stairs(15 stairs). </p>

<p>We've been giving her 30-45 minute walks each day(since monday when we adopted her). </p>

<p>On 10/10/15 I see a note taken saying(this based on what i can read):
 ""Rev 6 weeks(assume recovery time), Looking good, a may minimal/mild favoring still, mostly no limp"". We are supposed to keep her on strict leash until 10/30/15. Her left lateral stifle has a ""bump"" which was also noted on 9/17/15 by the foster parents, and it still is present. </p>

<p>I'm mainly concerned as I've never dealt with ACL/CCL surgeries before. She is definitely not wanting to put much weight on the leg, which is what is concerning me. When we lift her up to ""dance"", she puts a majority of her weight on her good leg(right) and when we try to get her to take a few steps she resists. During walks we are not walking at a fast pace, walking on level ground with some incline, however she definitely limps on the leg and refuses to put any weight on it. </p>

<p>Is this ""normal""/expected? I dont want to put her under tooo much stress and cause more harm to that leg, however the humane society indicated that she really didn't have a limp. Is there things we should be doing? should we be forcing her to take 1-2 steps while dancing? Should we be putting heating packs on her knee area to help sooth it?</p>

"Dog bites at people's feet when they get close","<p>I have a 3 year old Yorkie.  He recently picked up a new mannerism that is causing some problems.  He will growl and bite at peoples shoes when they step close to him.</p>

<p>A few thing's I've noticed about the behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's never me or my wife that he bites at</li>
<li>It's often when he's under a table or chair (so maybe it surprises him or he doesn't see the persons face), but not always.</li>
<li>It's when the feet get close, but not necessarily close enough to step on him.  He will attack the feet from his position</li>
<li>Usually men (maybe the bigger feet)</li>
<li>Usually leather shoes (this could just be a coincidence)</li>
</ul>

<p>The items I say ""usually"" with are because I originally thought that each occurrence was related to that, but he proved me wrong by attacking a woman's foot once and recently some Velcro shoes (yes, I said Velcro, can't say I blamed him for that one).</p>

<p>Anyway, most people have thought it was funny, but he's not playing around.  He's seriously violent when he gets into that mode and since he's so small he's easy to get under control, but sometimes I'll be talking to someone and not necessarily watching him. As soon as I look down I'll notice he's on the end of his leash biting a person with the intention of killing their foot.</p>

<p>I do fear that maybe he would do it to someone who is bare footed, or maybe even a child someday (but I think it does relate to the bigger feet).</p>

<p>Does anyone know why this would have recently started happening?  He's small but I don't think he's ever really been stepped on (could be wrong I guess).  And does anyone know what I might do to curb this behavior? </p>

<p>But every time I open the door to go in/come out of the house, this cat keeps trying to come in our house. She doesn't even want anything from us. She just wants to be in our house with us. It breaks our heart to put her outside, but we just cannot take her in right this minute.</p>

<ol>
<li>Girl Calico looks like about a year and a half old.</li>
<li>She used to live in an abandoned house about half a mile from our house.</li>
<li>The abandoned house has about 50 stray cats (NOT joking). Not a single one of them ever came to us.</li>
<li>She is so friendly, it makes me think she was once a domesticated cat thrown out of the house.</li>
<li>She has long and SHARP claws.</li>
<li>She doesn't really know how to control her claws. She always pushes her claws out when playing with us. She climbs up our legs so rough, I have holes in my jeans.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Our problems with the cat coming in:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>As I said, this cat lived with about 50 other cats. So she probably has fleas and ticks and whatever else there is.</li>
<li>We have a 16 month old who doesn't really know how to be nice to the cat. The cat is incredibly patient, but I am not trying to push it.</li>
<li>We have a 16 month old and we do not want to risk the baby getting ticks or fleas or something else from this cat.</li>
<li>We do not really have a lot of money to spare for the cat's health expenses.</li>

<p><strong>My questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Could I go to a department store or a pharmacy and pick something up that would clean the cat up all-around?</li>
<li>I HATE declawing and would not do it. Is there a less crueler process to make their claws not as sharp?</li>
<li>The cat's eyes always have some liquid leaking out of them. What could this be and what could I do regarding that?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am trying my best to bring this cat inside my house given the temperatures are dropping severely outside. She is cold. She wants to be in our house more than anything. I just need to get things straightened out first.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> I know she NEEDS to go to the vet, we are just a bit financially tight for the time being.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"Adopting (rescuing) a pair of Big pet store Leopard Geckos that were raised by uninformed - Help","<p>Looking for input from experienced Gecko keepers that have cared for Geckos with MBD or impaction so we know what to watch and be prepared for with our new adopted Leopard Geckos.</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong> Both look visually healthy(plump tail, clear eyes, posture and skin looks good in pics). Owners were adults who fed, cleaned tank and handled them 2-3+ times per week and really tried to do the right thing with limited knowledge. They say they have never been sick ( no runny poop, lethargy, mobility issues, cloudy eyes or poor appetite).</p>

<p><strong>The Bad:</strong> they were never given calcium and half the 20 gallon tank is sand (not always reptile sand). Help!  They seem healthy now but we are preparing for possible health issues(MBD or impaction) based on their history. What do we need to watch for, plan for and is there anything we can proactively do? If they stay healthy for a certain amount of time are they still at risk for either later in their lives?  </p>

<p><strong>The Other</strong> They don't know the temp they were incubated so genders aren't known yet, no signs of aggression to each other(we'll separate them if they are both males or if there is any sign of an issue)   Question?:If they are male/female should we separate them until they are a little older? We are OK with babies and have a lay box and are prepped for that but I'm not sure if they are too young or if we should avoid letting them bred because of the other potential health issues. Input?</p>

<p><strong>Their History:</strong> They are 7-8 months, found on craigslist, originally bought from Big Pet store (can I say the name?) as small juveniles and owners were not given care instructions and salesperson couldn't answer any questions. They set them up with mealworms, water bowl, sand, 1 hide, astroturf and a basking light and rock and gave no warning that if they ended up both being males that they should plan to separate them :(</p>

<p><strong>Our History:</strong> Our family, primarily my teenage son (""the reptile whisperer""), were educated by a reputable local reptile guy on Skink &amp; Gecko husbandry and have a couple very healthy thriving Leos right now but working with ones that may have issues is new to us.  </p>

<p><strong>Here's what we do with ours:</strong> 
<strong>Tanks:</strong> 10gallon for 1 Gecko, 20gallon for (2)Geckos (2 females or male and female if they get along and are healthy). Substrate we use is usually ECO earth coconut fiber or kitchen roll. Primary heat (Undertank Pad covers about 40% of tank) and we have low heat lamp(not a basking lamp!) that we rarely use - only if the tank temps are off between hot and cold side. 3 hides: 2 warm/hot (one moist) and one cold, water bowl, small bowl with a little calcium(most of the time), light controlled to promote good sleep cycles, temps on both side of the tank monitored.</p>

<p><strong>Diet&amp;care:</strong> Fed gut-loaded crickets daily or every other day, dusted with calcium w/D3 2-3+ times per week, infrequently a Hornworm treat, and tank cleaned frequently. Moist hide and water are checked every other day. Handled 3 -5 days per week - very bonded and comfortable. Son weighs them every couple weeks sometimes more frequent when they were younger. He also makes sure if there are (2) in the tank that both are eating - when younger he separated them to eat: one was a faster hunter (not aggressive just faster).  He also has needed to help one of our females get extra shed off occasionally if she doesn't get it all after a couple days - I'm amazed she totally lets him help with no squirming and she's usually very active its like she totally gets it. </p>

"Managing dog on furosemide (Lasix)","<p><strong>The background</strong></p>

<p>My 9 year old cavvie with CHF was just put on Furosemide after a bit of a scare where his chest and abdomen had quite a lot of fluid built up (approx. 20 fl oz). He's back to his svelte self and he's very bouncy, chipper and affectionate. It's like the dial has been turned back - a lot of the things I had chalked up to him being an older dog is more rightly attributed to the buildup. If it wasn't for his heart condition, he'd be in perfect health.</p>

<p>So now it's alleviated, and he's been on pimobendan and enalipril with hydrocodone for his cough when it gets bad for about 2 years. He's been on furosemide for a little under a week @ 50mg twice daily. My dog is ~25 lbs.</p>

<p><strong>The issue</strong></p>

<p>His elimination schedule is intense and frequent. I go home from work for lunch every day to check on him, so the impact to my schedule is minimal. He's had an accident on the couch every day so far. I don't mind cleaning it up (it's a pretty old, grody couch anyway), but it looks like it happens in his sleep. There's a big, soaked patch where he had the accident, and then a less wet patch where he lay down and it transferred from his fur to the fabric.</p>

<p>He seems to be making it from 1 - 4:30 without any problems.</p>

<p>When my partner and I are home, it's no problem. He generally positions himself so he can peek at us from over/around furniture with his big eyes like O_O to get our attention so we can take him out. He has no accidents when we're awake.</p>

<p>He's had an accident overnight most nights as well.</p>

<p><strong>What we've tried</strong></p>

<p>My first gambit was to ask the vet if we could reduce the dosage. He wasn't keen on the idea since the fluid buildup was so severe.</p>

<p>I've tried playing with the dosage timing so that his most urgent need to eliminate is when we're home or before we leave. This has had mixed success. 8am 8pm hasn't really worked. Will try 6am 6pm tomorrow to see if that leaves us with anything drier.</p>

<p><strong>What's on the way</strong></p>

<p>I've ordered some doggie grass so that we can train him to use it to use during the day when we're not home and during the night.</p>

<p><strong>The questions</strong></p>

<p>Do dogs ""get used"" to being on furosemide? Does the urination urgency decrease as they acclimate themselves to the drug? Does dosage timing make a difference? Do you have any suggestions that we can try?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

"How to stop cats from eating toxic plants?","<h1>The Background</h1>

<p>We have 2 cats, and they are wonderfully smart…<em>except</em> when it comes to eating certain things that they have no business eating.  One of these things is plants.</p>

<p>One of our cats once ate a dead leaf that blew in from outside.  A few minutes later, he threw it up…then promptly began eating <em>another</em> dead leaf.  (I stopped him and swept all the leaves out of the house.)</p>

<p>Our other cat loves to chew on individual bristles of our broom.  Thankfully, he doesn’t eat them—but I really wish he wouldn’t!  He also likes to chew on fake christmas tree pine needles and tinsel, which we discourage through difficult access and shoo-ing him away when he gets close.  (But it is difficult.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Now, I’ve known for years that this behavior often means the cat is trying to solve a digestive or nutritional issue. Before everyone piles on proclaiming this is the answer, please note the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>we <em>only</em> feed our cats high-quality catfood (both wet and dry)</li>
<li>this behavior has existed through several changes in catfood (both brand and flavor)</li>
<li>we have had vets check the cats nutrition, blood chemistry, etc., and they are doing great</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, I don’t think that the unwanted behavior is due to the cats’ diet.  I think it’s just a peculiarity of these two individuals.  </p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>I’m not allergic to cats, but I am interested in improving indoor air quality.  A nice, natural solution for this is simply to keep 3 specific houseplants and “<a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/kamal_meattle_on_how_to_grow_your_own_fresh_air"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">grow your own fresh air</a>”.  </p>

<p>(That is, these 3 plants were tested as the best for removing allergens and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VOCs</a> from the air.)</p>

<p>However, I’m afraid to get these plants, because I think the cats will eat them (or at least chew on them).  They are listed as toxic to cats (and dogs).  </p>

<h1>The Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there any way to keep indoor houseplants, and be <em>certain</em> that they are inaccessible to cats?</p></li>
<li><p>Apart from the usual dietary explanations, is there any other reason cats chew upon and eat things that they shouldn’t?</p></li>
</ul>

This denotes that the cage is not empty.  </p>

<p>From what I've read elsewhere and have been told, the cage should be completely empty so that if/when the puppy goes in her cage, she will realize she is stuck with a puddle of her urine in her cage and nowhere to go which should in turn get her to stop urinating in her cage.  </p>

<p>What is the proper thing to do in this situation?  Should the cage have some sort of towel for a cushion from the hard plastic tray, or should we leave it empty and let the puppy stick it out?

One of the answers said allergies are common in Pitbulls.  My puppy itches at her collar quite often. She has a red spot on her neck that resembles a rash. It's only on one part of her neck, and not all the way around where the collar rests. I can't tell if it is just small cuts she may have caused while itching herself or an actual rash. Once the collar is off her, she typically does not itch there. She also likes to itch at her harness we use to walk her occasionally (which is 100% polyester). </p>

"Dog refuses to eat unless fed by hand","<p>My dog is a 3 year old Pomeranian. He is very happy, active, and loves to be around other people.

Nevertheless, I have been having a problem regarding his eating habits. </p>

<p>A few months ago, an aunt stayed with us and hanged around the home most of the day. She loves animals, so my aunt spent a lot of time with my dog. She pet him, took him out, and started feeding him by putting the food on her hand and then he would eat it from her hand. She would pretty much feed him like if he was a little kid, which I thought was ridiculous. I talked to her about the issue, but she disregarded my conversation and did it behind my back. My aunt left a week ago, but now the problem is that my dog refused to eat unless I do the exact same thing.

"1yo Mastiff puppy is jumping and kissing / poking people in the face","<p>This is my second dog I've owned. He's my first boy-dog and any dog this big. He's a Mastiff Boxer mix with a brindle coat. My last 12year dog was a female black lab that past away 18 months ago. My new dog is totally AMAZING! and I love him in the same way I loved my last dog. But there is a new alarming behavior that I need to work on immediately! I need help and advice. </p>

<p>Like I said, he is an amazing puppy with lots and lots of puppy energy and happiness. For the last couple of months when I take him to the dog park he has this habit of jumping up and ""kissing"" people... like bopping his snout against peoples faces. It's pretty impressive because he has a 5 foot vertical leap on all four paws... like he's bouncing up and kissing you at mouth level. It's really cute and most people don't seem to mind it (because it's a dog park).  </p>

<p>But a few days ago he was doing the same behavior and an elderly lady yelled out loud ""GET YOUR DOG AWAY FROM ME!!!!!"" as he bopped her in the cheek. She seemed to be covering her cheek with her hand like she was hurt. At the time I thought maybe she was over-reacting? But I was concerned so I immediately leashed him up and took him home. I've been taking him back to the dog park each day since. So today I go out to the park with him to get his exercise, and there was this nice woman at the park with her dog and my boy bounced up again and ""kissed"" (or bopped) her in the nose and she got a mild bloody nose from that. That was the second warning sign and now I'm really concerned! What do I do? I need advice from experts. I DO NOT WANT A LAW SUIT OR MY DOG BEING PUT DOWN for being aggressive. He's absolutely not. He's just a Mastiff puppy with a very happy life.</p>

<p>My first plan is to start using the shock collar at the park. And only shock him when he jumps up at people. He WILL NOT listen to my verbal commands if he's really engaged in play. I feel like going to the shock collar is the best method to give him what he wants (play in the dog park) and give me what I want (doggy exercise and discipline ) without the risk of having people hurt by his jumping. He's really a big puppy and I want the best for him. </p>

<p>If there is a better (more expedient) solution then the shock collar I'm open to suggestions. Many many thanks for all of your suggestions.</p>

"Why does my dog rub her chin on stuff?","<p>I have a Dachshund puppy, Peanut. As she is a breed originating as a small creature hunter, she displays some characteristics of that breed. Where my Labrador would point out dead animals, and might sniff around them, he would mostly leave them be. Peanut, however, will stalk small varmints/birds, and if I let her, chase them down, including down their holes/up trees. I understand this behavior.</p>

<p>When I'm walking Peanut, if she happens across a carcase, she'll pick it up and either attempt to eat it, or carry it back to our yard ""for later"" snacking. :) I discourage this behavior.  </p>

<p>Sometimes, however, when we are walking, she'll stop, sniff once or twice (and I usually can't even see what she is sniffing, beyond maybe a spot on the sidewalk), and then <em>kneel down and lay her chin and throat on the spot</em> and kind of rub. (No jokes about a Dachshund not needing to kneel, please). This behavior has me absolutly baffled.  </p>

<p>As I understand it, a cat has some (sweat?) glands in their chins that they use to <em>leave</em> a scent, but I didn't think dogs have that.  </p>

<p>Note that it's not the ""roll around in trash"" behavior. She doesn't actually lay down on either her stomach or back, she just... ""lays her throat and chin"" in the, I guess smell?</p>

<p>I would also add that we got Peanut from a litter my father's dog sired with a friend's Dachshund, so she's purebred. We got her at around 7 weeks, and she's done this behavior since then. She doesn't do it all the time (every walk), but only when she finds a whatever-it-is.  </p>

"Does a cat recognize her offspring after a long period of separation?","<p>My cat had some kittens a while ago, one of which I have given to a friend.</p>

<p>It has been about a year since then, and I was wondering: If my cat (the mother) were to come in contact with her offspring after not seeing it for a while, will the mother still know the other cat is its offspring?</p>

<p>Cats usually sniff each others behinds to catch their scent, which in the animal world, its basically their handshake (for certain categories of animals, such as dogs. Please correct me if I'm wrong). Even after a long period of separation, will the scent of the offspring set off a motherly instinct, or any kind of trigger, thatll allow the mother to know if the cat she's interacting with is infact her offspring?</p>

<p>If they can or can't recognize them by scent, is there another way she would be able to recognize them? (if the father spent time with the offspring and also with the mother cat at different times, and the mother and offspring haven't seen each other since birth. When they first meet, will the mother know its her offspring?)</p>

"Do cats recognize their family? Perhaps by scent?","<p><em>Is there any scientific or anecdotal evidence that cats recognize other cats who closely share their DNA? As in, new kittens from the same mother and the such?</em></p>

<p>I'm suspecting that there might be such a thing, and what follows is my reasoning for doing so.</p>

<p>I adopted my (once feral) cat when she was about 6 months old, from the area around my summer home. Ever since she has lived with me in a city flat. About a month ago, I moved back to the summer home for a while, taking her along.</p>

<p>Interestingly, she seemed to instantly recognize her surroundings, from which she was taken almost a year ago: Once she was allowed to go outside the house, she went out as if she already owned the entire garden. She didn't take her time to explore gradually, as she seems to have done with pretty much every other new area she's been. </p>

<p>There is a number of feral cats in the area. One of them, about 5-6 months old, looks extremely alike my own cat, both in terms of fur length (she has medium-lengthed fur, which is unusual for feral cats in my country), color, markings and so on. It's not unlikely at all that they're sisters from another birth, or that the kitten is my cat's niece. </p>

<p>This kitten is the ONLY cat or kitten I've seen in the area that my cat doesn't feel threatened by or attack at all. Over the last few weeks, I've seen her get defensive or aggressive, or at least meow at every single other cat around. With her kitten double, she just stares with apparent curiosity.</p>

<p>I've heard stories of cats seemingly recognizing their owners' close family as soon as they meet them; my logic tells me it must be hormonal, or otherwise related to smell - naturally, siblings and the such smell alike. But can it happen the other way round?</p>

<p>I highly doubt my cat understands that this kitten looks like her, but do you think there's a chance she recognizes it through scent?</p>

"If a cat tries claiming dominance over its mother, should I stop it?","<p>I've seen my cats bite each other, and after some research, I found that it was the cat claiming dominance (letting the other cat know ""I'm the Alpha"").</p>

<p>What surprised me was that one of my cats (named Fearless) started doing it to his mom, and the mother (named Booboo) didn't like it at all. It hasn't broken out into huge fights (yet), but the two seem eager to show who's the Alpha. Fearless is about 9 months old now, if that makes a difference. The mother cat is around 6 years old.</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong></p>

<p>Should I prevent the offspring from claiming dominance in this situation? Is it a bad thing for the offspring to be the dominant one? In our world, the offspring showing dominance would be frowned upon, but the cat world seems to have some exceptions.</p>

<p>Some other details about home-life for my cats (which relate to this situation):
The mother cat has another offspring (named Fatty (not actually fat though)) that doesn't do this, although it seems as if Fatty is starting to hop on the bandwagon by giving the mother difficulties during bath time (which hasn't happened since Fearless decided to start showing dominance towards Booboo). Fatty and Fearless are from the same litter. If both were to show dominance over the mother, would this trigger some emotional effect and make the mother depressed? (This is more of a bonus question; would be nice to get the answer, but answering the main question alone is good enough for best answer.)</p>

"What effects could long-term nursing have on a cat?","<p>I have a cat thats 9 months old. The mother ended up getting pregnant again shortly after (fixed now, so no more worries), which lead to one of my cats to continue nursing after being introduced to regular dry cat food. Only one of the two kittens from that litter chose to continue nursing AND eat regular kitten food.</p>

<p>After the birth, we litter trained the kittens and had to give them to some family friends (sadly, I can't have an army of cats at my house). After the fact, we noticed that one of the kittens from the litter before is STILL nursing on her mother.</p>

<p>Other than not being as big as her brother (same age, but male. I'm guessing it's a gender thing), she seems perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Part of the recommended integration period also recommends taking bedding that smells like him and putting it where our other cats can smell it and vice versa (so they can smell each other before meeting).

Of late, I have started setting out <a href=""http://ultimacat.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">adult cat food</a> for them and I see that their frequency of visits has increased. </p>

<p>Now they follow a set time-table. Cat 1 visits between 9-9.30am and eats all the food! I set more food out at 9.30am and Cat 2 visits at around 11.00am and eats about half of it. Cat 1 and Cat 3 visit between noon-3pm and feed on the leftovers. Then I put food out again at around 6pm again and Cat 1 visits at around 6.30-7pm. Cat 4 and Cat 5 are only sporadic visiters.</p>

<p>Given that background, my questions are: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do I ensure that Cat 2 doesn't go hungry since from next week I start work and will be in my office between 9am-7pm. I'm on vacation right now and hence it isn't difficult for me to put food out in the middle of the day since I am home. I would rather not resort to some fancy battery operated, timing gadget since I cannot quite afford anything beyond $10-15.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, do cats ""learn"" if I time my feeding and restrict it to setting out food at 8am (before I head to work) and 7pm (after I return from work)? Will I be losing some of my frequent visiters if they perceive that I don't put food out any more in the middle of the day?</p></li>

I have a glass slider in my kitchen that leads to a deck. I had put up an acrylic see-through bird feeder on the outside of the glass with the included suction cups. Eventually the birds started showing up and cat was <em>very</em> interested. She would stalk and hunt as the birds came and went. She would jump up to try and attack (feeder was about 5 foot above the deck) -- obviously never succeeding at the catch but often making a huge racket as she careened through the vertical blinds.</p>

<p>I don't speak cat, so it's hard to tell but it almost seemed like she would be stressed during/after these ""hunts"". </p>

<p>Is this stressful to her? To be able to see all these critters; to stalk and jump at them - coming within the thickness of double-pane glass from success to no avail time and time again? She has plenty of toys inside - scratch pads, fake mice, balls, towers. It really seemed to be a big interest while it was up, but I am concerned that the fun/excitement of the hunt might be outweighed by never making the catch. </p>

<p>Am I just anthropomorphizing this or is there any evidence that this might actually be harmful?</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>Another fact is that I adopted her when she was at or around 2 years old. Her history prior was/is unknown so it is possible that she survived by hunting for most of the beginning of her life. I suppose it is possible that having this memory could be cause for stress if were able to hunt/watch but never get a kill. </p>

"Neighbourhood cat poops and pukes in my garden and driveway","<p>Sorry, cat lovers, you're gonna hate me for this one.</p>

<p>I don't mind cats (or dogs, birds, etc.) but I very specifically don't want a pet in my household. Yet I have a problem that I'm unsure of how to deal with <em>in a reasonable way</em>. This is all in Denmark, so US laws and customs may not apply.</p>

<p>This year, a cat has been pooping in our garden, and ripping out grass or whatever else was around the scen of the crime, to cover it up. I obviously don't want this to continue (I would like my garden un-ripped, and my two small daughters would prefer it un-pooped-in also). It also has been leaving little puke pies around our cars in the drive way, which are quite disgusting, too.</p>

<p>But how do I stop the cat? I have tried planting ""scaredy cat"" plants, whose smell were supposed to discourage cats from coming near, but they don't work. I have also tried putting down metal webbing in the flower beds (because I heard that they don't like to step on such things and/or can't dig in it), and while that worked I can't extend that practice across my entire lawn.</p>

<p>Local law says that it's the responsibility of the pet owner to make sure that one's pet does not annoy others. This means I should go talk to the owner of said cat and ask them to keep the cat out of my garden. To which I would object: (a) I am convinced that <em>no</em> cat owner would agree to confining their cat because it roams in places that other people don't want it to; and (b) I don't even know whose cat this is! I have caught a glimpse of one cat, and followed it to the garden of a neighbour who has a cat door in their front door -- I am aware that this says absolutely zero about whether it's their cat or not. I have obviously not been able to read the chip or tattooed number in the cat's ear either.</p>

<p>I am considering ways of capturing this cat, so that I can either have a proper talk with it, or drive it to a shelter. How would I do that without breaking too many rules and laws?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>, as more info about (my relationship with) the HOA was requested. We are 37 households, and only we and 2 others have (small) kids -- the rest are pensioners. We are talking with only two other households; there is not a lot of communal spirit here -- the first HOA meeting I attended, about a week after we moved in, made it clear to me (in ways I shall not go into here) just how hostile, ludicrously infantile, and petty these people are (even towards each other, not just ""newcomers""). Later, I requested that the run-down communal play area receive a bit of maintenance, only to be shot down rather rudely. I am decidedly not in good standing in their minds, and that is why I cannot think they would be very inclined to help me avoid their shit in my garden.</p>

"Why my cat uses paws to bring food from plate to floor and then eats it from floor?","<p>My cat doesn't like to eat from plate. She rather likes to eat from floor. </p>

<p>In case of large food such as a piece of fish she will kick the food on plate a few times. Then she grabs the piece with mouth and puts it down on floor. Then she will go on kicking, eating some, kicking again, and so on. In this process she will make the whole floor dirty.</p>

<p>In case of solid food like tuna flavored whiskas, she will use her paws to bring one of the tiny pieces to floor. Then she will play football with it. Then she eats it. In this process lots of pieces remain lying here and there and the costly food is wasted. Moreover there is problem of red ants over here who takes full advantage of food lying here and there.</p>

<p>So why my cat does this? Is there any way to teach her not to do this?</p>

<p>She has lots of toys to play with. It is not that she doesn't get to play.</p>

"Cat won't let me sleep at night","<p>My girlfriend's cat will not let me get a full night of sleep. I already have to work around our party-to-the-night neighbors and the get-up-early-with-high-heels neighbors; so this is really annoying.</p>

<p>Basically the cat will always start meowing when she comes from the litter box, and she does not use the litter box silently. She always scratches her paws on the sides, I presume for cleaning them. This takes a couple of minutes, and unfortunately our condo does not damp noises at all. This happens several times during the night.</p>

<p>Usually our bedroom door is open, she will come in and start meowing. This wakes us up, my girlfriend will tap on the bed or her chest. Sometimes the cat will just jump on her chest and cuddle and be quiet. Most times, however, the cat will just respond with more meowing, I guess she wants to play. We don't want to play, but seems to be an alien concept for her.</p>

<p>When the door is closed, she will scratch on the door. This again is loud enough to wake at least me up. We have tried opening the door a crack and then spray the cat. That does not seem to be a sufficient deterrent to let us sleep. Also when either of us goes to the bathroom at night, the cat will sneak into the bedroom. Curiously the cat will then quietly lay on my girlfriend's chest and purr otherwise quietly. After a while the cat leaves silently again.</p>

<p>Right now it seems that the cat is training us. I am already indifferent to all the hair and cat litter in bed, I am almost used to open up doors for the self proclaimed princess. However, I would like to get a full night of sleep again.</p>

<p>Other questions seem to address similar points, but either I do not have enough patience or they are not compatible with this cat.</p>

<li><p><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/1440/how-to-get-my-cat-to-stop-being-annoying-at-night"">How to get my cat to stop being annoying at night?</a></p>

<p>The answers there say that the cat is bored (which I would assume applies here as well) and one should try to make other rooms entertaining. It seems that my girlfriend's cat does not like playing with stuff much, it likes to cuddle with everyone, literally everyone. When there are guests, the cat will try to get on everyone's lap. So her toys seem to be all humans around. And they are now in the bedroom.</p>

<p>When we have guests sleeping in our condo, the cat usually stays with them in the living room. So making a different room interesting does work, but it needs other people.</p>

<p>Expelling the cat from the bedroom has only lead to scratching on the door. The spray bottle has not removed that behavior, so I am woken up either way.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/11108/my-cat-wakes-me-up-at-night-pawing-at-my-door"">My cat wakes me up at night pawing at my door</a></p>

<p>First answer says to never open the door. So not use the spray bottle but ignore the cat? That might work. The diabolical thing is that once I am woken up I usually need to go to the bathroom in order to have a chance of getting to sleep again. So then eventually I need to open the door. Should I get a camping toilet for the bedroom‽</p>

<p>The second answer says that one just cannot close the door. In consequence, this also means that one just cannot have a full night of sleep, a bed free of cat litter or any of those things.</p></li>

<p>There it is suggested to play with the cat. I had done this the yesterday, actually. This cat seems to only respond to cuddling and light play. When there is hard light, she will try to catch the shadow of her tail. I played with a laser pointer (which is eye safe as determined by a fellow physicist and an eye doctor) and got her to the point of exhaustion where she was panting. But apparently that does not do a significant difference.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/7973/my-cat-is-keeping-me-awake-at-night"">My cat is keeping me awake at night</a></p>

<p>Suggestion is to react in a way that the cat does not want. We certainly do not do that now. But what can I do when only I wake up and my girlfriend does not? I could wake her up and tell her to do something with the cat. But cuddling tightly is just exactly what the cat wants. And getting sprayed with water does not seem a big deterrent.</p>

<p>Giving the cat away to my girlfriend's parents is what we did when we went on vacation. In their larger house, the cat usually is quiet and does not nag us to play at night. They have their own cat, a rather old male who is not very active due to back pain. They do not seem to get along too well, but sufficiently to only occasionally hiss at each other. When the cat is back in our condo, it is the old behavior. Giving the cat away to them for the whole time would fix my sleep problem, but my girlfriend would be unhappy about that.</p>

<p>Another person writes that they feed their cat manually (we just have a bowl with food for self-service). The cat wakes them up to get food. Sounds like exactly the wrong direction for me.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that it will take quite some time until I can have a full night of sleep again. So what do I do with this renitent cat which has already gained so much ground in the war over authority?</p>

"Cat suddenly scared and won't come in","<p>My cat, Cali, was feral after the neighbors abandoned her. I think they had abused her. She gradually worked  her way into our home after a year of being skittish and running away while we fed her outside. We lived in Hawaii where being outdoors was safe. Cali gradually became more affectionate, and seemed to want to be an indoor cat after having always been outdoors, going out for about 15 minutes daily at most. </p>

<p>Then two months ago we moved her to California and kept her indoors. It seemed to be going well. She learned to use a litter box and started voluntarily climbing into my lap and sleeping with us at night. But as of a few weeks ago, she wanted to go outside and slipped out one day. After that, she cried incessantly, all day and all night, to be let out. I  tried to keep her in but she drove me nuts with constant, constant loud crying so I started letting her out during the day, assuming she'd come back for meals, which she did, and then we'd keep her in at night. </p>

<p>She was supposed to go to the vet for dental surgery today. I let her out before breakfast yesterday since she had been crying since 5 am, assuming she'd come back to eat as always. But for the first time, she didn't come back to eat. I made a huge mistake. I went looking for her, brought food to her, and when she was eating I tried to pick her up to bring her back into the house so she'd be around for the surgery. She freaked out, scratched me, and ran off. And since then, she's been in hiding. She hid outside all day yesterday and then last night I put her food inside the door to the living room, and she slunk in to get it, but rushed out as soon as she saw me approaching to close the door. She spent the night outside and hid all day today (missed the surgery).</p>

<p>I was worried because she didn't eat all day yesterday, so I left food outside on the porch this morning and I saw her eating it, so  I know she's around,  though she's been hiding all day. I call her every few hours and she won't come, so I left food out again tonight. It's gone so I assume she ate it,  but she won't come in or show herself, even though it's getting really cold. </p>

<p>To make matters worse, we're supposed to move in a few weeks. Cali was supposed to stay with a friend of mine for 8 days while my husband and I drove across country, and I bought my friend a ticket so she could fly Cali to us,  carrying her in the cabin. Now I'm  feeling like maybe I should just try to find someone to adopt her so she doesn't go through any more trauma, and also because she really can't be an outdoor kitty where we're headed.</p>

"Can I produce fish food from overcrowding shrimp?","<p>I recently moved my aquarium from my desk to a shelve and missed intensive inspections for a couple of months. I noticed that I don't have about 50 (which is already much), but a few hundred red cherry shrimp; population potentially growing. Since that might be stressful for all inhabitants in a 60l freshwater aquarium, I was wondering whether it's possible to reduce the number by producing fish food for Mollies from a bunch of them?</p>

<p>I'd start by killing them in a -21°C saturated salt water bath which should cause immediate deadly systemic shock. Then freeze and cut them and store them into my freezer. That way, I should be able to feed the pieces over time.</p>

<p>Freeze-drying would be a good conservation, but requires industrial equipment afaik.</p>

<p>Does this approach make sense: Will the meat remain consumable over - let's say - half a year? Can I cut up the whole bodies or do I need to peal the shrimp? Are there parts I should remove (organs filtering toxins, especially fat parts which are considered bad diet for aquarium fish)?</p>

Searching around I've seen some suggested solutions although a lot really wouldn't be useful in our situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Barriers and various spices to keep them away where they roost - the yard is too open for barriers to be effective and they seem to fly in and wander around rather than nest in a particular area.</li>
<li>Remove food sources - we did the obvious step of bringing the dog bowl back inside some time ago but we have a lot of trees and they seem quite content with amount of natural seed. Also we have budgies outside and while we try to sweep up the area often no doubt some sits there a while before we get to it.</li>
<li>The various loud sound ideas wouldn't go down well in a residential area and I wonder if the ultrasonic options would also disturb our budgies and/or dog?</li>

<p>I don't know much about pigeons but one possible reason they may like to congregate here more than adjoining properties is that the previous owner used to breed / race them.

"Dog no longer trusts us or other dogs after bad foster home and vet experiences","<p>My dog was in a foster home with his brother and foster brother at around 3 weeks of age.  He was nipped by his brother and then bit by his foster brother in the exact same spot on his neck around 3 months of age, so he has always been sensitive to touching that area, but not aggressive, just became noticeably cautious if you would pet that area of his neck.  3 years later, after having a benign cyst removed from his ear, the vet tech ripped his bandages off in a very quick and seemingly painful way because our dog snapped and growled.   The ear was not yet healed, so we had to re-bandage the area, which caused more growling and snapping.  Since that day, he now responds with growling if we are near his neck area to check his ears or check him for ticks.  If we stay in that area too long, he snaps at us.  Additionally, since the vet tech incident, if he finds himself in a painful or upsetting situation such as recently when he pulled a leg muscle, he snapped and growled at my husband when he felt the pain while stretching near my husband.  It was as though he associated his pain with my husband, even though he pulled the muscle while running in the backyard.  My question is:  Is there training that can help us with this situation?  I feel like it’s difficult to fix a situation you can’t anticipate, i.e. I just know that sometimes if we touch his neck the “wrong” way, he growls, and if we have to keep touching the area, like when cleaning the ears he can snap and growl.  As another example of this, he used to have a toy that was a circle shape with a hole in the middle.  He flipped the toy over his head, so it ended up around his neck.  My husband went to take the toy off of his head, and he snapped at him.  So, he spent 15 minutes playing with a toy, then it went over his head, and it turned into a stressful terrible incident for him.  My concern going forward is that the odds of nothing painful ever happening to the dog are slim.  I’m wondering if there are training techniques that would help this situation?</p>

"Cats and throat-hold -- accept or discourage?","<p>My turn to ask for help interpreting a behavior...</p>

<p>I have a pair of neutered sibling cats, Harry and Hazel, about 7 years old.</p>

<p>Periodically -- usually during a mutual grooming session -- Harry will grab Hazel's throat -- not scruffing, but under the chin as if going for a choke attack. He seems to be being gentle about it, and Hazel doesn't actively complain -- she'll go right back to washing him, even if he does it repeatedly -- but to human eyes this seems rude.</p>

<p>I've never seen Hazel apply the same hold.</p>

<p>Is this just ritual dominance/trust assertion, and should I stay out of it even when it happens virtually in my lap? Or should I discourage, since I'm supposedly the dominant cat in the clowder? (Dogs think they're inferior humans. Cats think we're incompetent cats.)</p>

<p>Not a behavior I've observed before, since in the past I've only had one cat at a time -- so I'd appreciate input from folks with years of observing interactions. My ape instinct is to say ""quit that"", but my cat instinct is that as long as they're still friends they should work it out themselves.</p>

"Minimize litter box smell: upstairs or downstairs?","<p>I have 3 cats and we are moving into a two story house.  We are considering two main locations for one or two large uncovered litterboxes: upstairs or downstairs.  Which location would minimize the smell?</p>

"Minimum age of kittens for rabies vaccination","<p>I have a litter of Siberian kittens, and I'm thinking of taking them to a cat show in a couple months, but they'll be at the exact age when they are supposed to get vaccinated at the time. Polyvalent vaccine should be fine -- if I vaccinate them at 9 weeks and re-vaccinate 3 weeks later, they'll have exactly 3 weeks till the show. But then there's the rabies vaccine. All of the kinds I can find locally state that it should be administered to at least 3 months old kittens. If I vaccinate them 3 weeks before the show, they'll be 12 weeks old, which is about 10 days younger than 3 months. Are those 10 days that important? What will happen if I vaccinate the kittens before they're ready? And is there a way to determine if they're ready to be vaccinated other than their age?</p>

"Possible reasons goldfish hanging out near surface","<p>We have two goldfish in an 18L tank, which has a pump filter and a light.  We feed them lightly once a day and I change the water every week or so.  We have had them for a few months and they have apparently been doing well overall.  (We have plans for a bigger tank, but we wanted to see how it went before investing a lot.)</p>

<p>They have always seemed to prefer hanging out at the bottom of the tank, but recently it seemed that they were both floating at the surface and had to work to move lower down.  The water tested okay (KH, GH, pH, Cl2, NO2, NO3).  I read <a href=""http://www.kokosgoldfish.com/BRIEFGUIDEFORNEWOWNERS.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> that this could be the result of some swim bladder disorder which may be caused by constipation.  We followed the instructions there to fast them for 3 days and then feed them mashed pea.</p>

<p>They still are hanging out a lot near the top, and sleep there at night.  They don't look as much now like they are floating and don't seem to have difficulty moving around the rest of the tank.  After feeding time they do forage along the bottom and all over the tank for quite some time.  I noticed they also gulp a lot at the surface after feeding time, even though the food we feed them doesn't float.  They always belch air bubbles after doing that, but I wonder if some of the air gets trapped inside.</p>

<p>So back to the fish' new hangout.  How likely is it this is a sign of infection?  Continued constipation?  Air in digestive tract?  Also, could the recent drop in temperature account for the change in behavior?</p>

"Could letting a cat take a very short spin in the clothes dryer be a good way to prevent later incident?","<p>Would it be ethically wrong to purposely scare a cat from sneaking into the clothes dryer by turning the dryer on for a half spin when it decides to jump in? </p>

<p>It doesnt seem like it could hurt the cat if I only let it make a half spin or so. Also as long as I allow it to jump in of its own curiosity, the cat's fear wouldn't be pointed at me, but just the idea that jumping in the dryer can lead to a very scary result. </p>

<p>I'm just wondering if animal lovers world wide would curse me if I did this. Would it be considered a good or bad way to teach the cat not to get in the dryer? </p>

<p>I could be careful and check the dryer, keep the door closed, etc, but it seems over the years there's a possibility that the cat could sneak in and it be turned on without anyone knowing the cat is inside. I always worry about this when turning on my dryer. </p>

<p>You could say a cat wont jump in there with wet clothes, but sometimes you turn on the dryer if they've been sitting there a while to remove wrinkles, or you could have a front-opening washing machine, in which case the cat could jump in there too. </p>

"Why does my dog only show aggressive behavior indoors?","<p>My dog Cooper is a 1 1/2 yr old Lab mix, and for the last few months, his aggression has been constant. It's odd because he is totally normal away from home. Inside he growls and bares his teeth at my 5 yr old little sister whenever she comes too close to him or pets him. He guards my bed at all times, random areas in the house, trash, and (especially) his food bowl. We've resorted to muzzling him at all times because he has already attacked our other dogs twice and snaps at people other than myself for different things. (He's tried to bite my cousin over the socks/shoes in the bottom of my nightstand!)</p>

<p>Other than his resource guarding and apparent dominance issues, he's a really great dog. He goes to a dog park once a week and does amazing with the people and dogs there, so whatever is wrong has to do with our house.

"How long should I keep a well-adjusted cat in?","<p>I grew up with family cats and come from a family of cat lovers so have been around cats for a long time. However, recently my grandmother died and I offered to adopt her 10 year old tomcat, Ned. </p>

<p>My cousin also offered to adopt the cat, and as adopting him would have required me to ask permission from my landlady and possibly pay extra rent, I let her take him. However a week later, she asked if I could have him instead as she found she was severely allergic. I said yes, after getting permission from our landlady.</p>

<p>I know you're supposed to keep cats in for two weeks, but I really can't overstate how well he has adapted to living with us in such a short amount of time. From his first few hours with us on Sunday evening, he was curiously exploring the house, getting his belly rubbed, getting comfortable. We woke up to find he'd used the litter tray with no problems and is eating healthily. He's slept on our bed with us and sits on our laps most evenings while we watch TV. He's a fussy, affectionate old thing and he often follows you round the house while you're doing chores.</p>

<p>During his brief tenure at my cousin's house, she said he was 'hiding' from her 6 year old son a lot, and it sounds like he was a lot more timid there than he is here, which is a good sign for us I suppose.</p>

<p>Like most cats he loves looking out of the window, and sometimes he cries to go out of the house by the back door, but whenever we slip out of the back door to go outside, he doesn't make a break for it. He clearly wants to explore our small, fairly enclosed back garden but doesn't seem like he wants to escape!</p>

<p>How much leeway is there with this 2 week incubation date? Does anyone have any stories of letting a cat out earlier - accidentally or not - and is there anything I should know if I decide to let him out early? Or despite all the good signs is this a straight up bad idea?</p>

"My cat refuses to eat any wet food","<p>After reading up on a lot of forums about how cats need wet food I have tried to feed my cat wet food from about November until recently (February). I dont try every day, more like every  once in a while when i go to the store i try a different brand and have even tried one or two off amazon. I've tried just a small dollop in his normal food, ive tried just wet food without his food, and ive tried a mixture of both evenly and nothing worked. He hasnt touched wet food any time that ive tried this. When i mix he will leave the whole thing, when i put dried food on top he will eat it off and around the wet food but not touch the wet food at all.</p>

<p>I should mention i have a scheduled feeding time and amount and i have only tried an evening time for the wet food. I keep him on poultry for the most part but on the wet food ive tried even branching to Salmon as a 4th ingredient. His dry food is chicken and turkey based and he eats fine. </p>

<p>He drinks a decent amount of water when i am home, sometimes ill hear him drinking randomly in the evening and every morning after i shower he jumps in right after i get out and licks the floor of the shower for a little bit. I could shower right after he drinks from his bowl and this will still happen so its not like he is dying of dehydration (from what i can tell). His coat is really nice and im taking him on a checkup soon.</p>

<p>I am wondering if this is a problem? Should i keep trying different wet foods or should i give up? Is there a specific process to transition? Is there a specific temp or way to serve the food that makes a difference?</p>

"Identifying maine coon vs. ragdoll vs. ragamuffin","<p>The typical differences given between maine coon, ragdoll, and ragamuffin cats are somewhat vague, and also sometimes involve knowing the cat well enough to be familiar with its disposition. According to <a href=""http://cats.petbreeds.com/compare/8-12-25/Ragamuffin-vs-Maine-Coon-vs-Ragdoll"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://cats.petbreeds.com/compare/8-12-25/Ragamuffin-vs-Maine-Coon-vs-Ragdoll</a> (which is pretty representative of what I've gathered browsing forums, too), these cats share a lot in common. Personality-wise there just isn't enough to go on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maine coon: Gentle, independent, intelligent. Lap cat. Good with everybody.</li>
<li>Ragdoll: Friendly, gentle, quiet. Lap cat. Good with everybody.</li>
<li>Ragamuffin: Affectionate, friendly, gentle. Lap cat. Good with everybody.</li>
</ul>

<p>Physically there's a bunch of fuzzy stuff, like life-span, heart defect risks (HCM in maine coons and ragdolls), etc. All three breeds allow for a wide variety of colorings. Most confusingly, maine coons seem to have a reputation for being a rather large breed, but petbreeds.com actually lists the typical max weights of ragdolls and ragamuffins as higher (20lb vs 15lb maine coon). So, also, not enough to go on.</p>

<p>Same deal with photographs. A lot of sites have a picture of a ""typical"" cat of a certain breed but appearances vary greatly. Even just looking at image search results for <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=maine%20coon&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">maine coon</a>, <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=ragdoll&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ragdoll</a>, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=ragamuffin&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ragamuffin</a>, there is significant overlap, especially as you scroll further down the result list, or if you add a coloring (for example, add ""tuxedo"" to each of those searches).</p>

<p>And of course, all of the above has a lot of variance. It becomes especially difficult when the cat is not purebred.</p>

<p>I find the commonly listed physical and personality differences to be non-specific and unsatisfactory, so:</p>

<h2>The Question:</h2>

<p><strong>Is there any typical physical differences that can be used to quickly get at least a decent guess of which of these three breeds an adult cat is?</strong></p>

<p>In particular: <em>facial features and proportions, eye colors, jaw/teeth, head/ear shape, skeletal structure, tail, legs and paws</em>? (For example, this <a href=""https://www.chewy.com/royal-canin-ragdoll-dry-cat-food-7/dp/55298"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ragdoll-specific food</a> mentions ""the Ragdoll cat's broad jaw"", a trait generally not mentioned in forums or breed comparison sites.) I am specifically looking for some info beyond the standard ""my ragdoll is the sweetest little guy"". Journals and academic sources welcome but certainly not required.</p>

<p>I am more interested in identifying adult/senior cats than kittens, although I certainly wouldn't turn away any kitten identification info.</p>

"Older, larger cat introduced after tragedy...Not going well. HELP!","<p>I have a four year old brother/sister. Izze &amp; Bella. Ive had since kittens. Lovely, sweet indoor cats, they play, wrestle, small 8 lb cats. Izze was the perfect male cat, he was in love with me, fetched, a just a joy. Bella sits and observes mostly, a cuddly cat but gets crabby at times toward her brother, but both, wonderful cats. </p>

<p>Last July my boyfriend was murdered in his home.He had 2 dogs and 3 cats. Long story, but the dogs were locked in a room till they died and the 3 cats fended for themselves for a month till rescued. Lots of violence was going on during that time, not to the cats, we dont think. Traumatic tegardless. All 3 cats were adopted together as kittens and are 12 years old. Lived all their lives in that home with the dogs. All indoor cats. In July 2016, two cats were adopted together by a friend. The 3rd cat, I took home.</p>

<p>Patches is the new cat in the home. She is 12 lbs. She's a bit jumpy, hears every noise and is rather vocal. Mine, not so much. She's a lover but more dog-like, she pushes hard when being pet, even aggressively so with little nips to make you continue and likes to climb on my chest or lay on top of me when on my side. She eats like a dog. My two are slow, she gobbles and stalks their bowls waiting for leftovers. Mine used to take hours for wet food. No rush, no stress.</p>

<p>All 3 are fine together when begging for food. I can pet 2 at a time, if I'm there between them. Sometimes all 3 will sleep on a bed, but not near each other. There are 3 perchesin the house.</p>

<p>So now, since Patches, Izze, my male, 8 pounder gets in.a stalking mood and looks at Patches in an evil way. He chases, she runs, turns, hisses, screams and if they start hitting (all front claw declawed), Bella leaps in to defend her brother and she's a brute! Patches and Bella alone are cordial, but growl at each other sometime. They never go after each other.</p>

<p>My cats never peed on carpets or floors before. Now Izze, my perfect cat is peeing somewhere almost daily. I have 4 litter boxes, 2 up and 2 down.</p>

<p>It's been 6 months. I do not know how to get Izze to stalking and harassing Patches. I've used water, loud noises. It stops them in the moment but sometimes I'm not quick enough. The peeing is destroying my home. </p>

<p>I was in tears tonight, will this ever end?. I think it's all territorial, dominance but not sure what to do now. I live in a 2 bedroom townhouse, 1700 Sq ft. As I said, they are all indoor cats. </p>

<p>Do I let them fight it out? Do I lock Izze away when he starts stalking? Do I keep spraying them? </p>

<p>Any ideas? Patches has been thru so much and so have I. I can't get rid of her, but we are all so stressed.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"Ultrasonic Bark Control","<p>We have a dog who is quite a barker – any activity outside of our yard is cause for a loud and often sustained volley of barking. It is driving one of our neighbors crazy, so we've been experimenting with various bark control devices. We've got a dog door and the biggest problem is when our dog is out and we're not at home.</p>

<p>So far we've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Locking the dog door, effective, but the dog loves to sit out in the yard and watch the world go by. Also, it seems mean to ask him to ""hold it"" for most of the day when one of us can't get home to let him out in the middle of the day. I think it might also make him more excitable and vocal when he is out.</p></li>
<li><p>Sitting with him in the yard and giving him lots of treats when people and dogs go by. It might help, it has definitely improved his recall, but it doesn't seem to be making a significant shift in barking.</p></li>
<li><p>A citronella spray collar - not sure if it works at all. He might either like the smell or he might be ignoring it. He comes in from barking smelling like a lemon…</p></li>
<li><p>Ultrasonic <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B01MR485PN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bird houses</a> that are supposed to create an unpleasant sound when the dog barks, which is in turn supposed to reduce barking. More than anything we've tried, these seem to be having some effect.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, my question(s):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the best placement for these devices? They have a speaker on one side. I assume that they are highly directional. Is there anyway to estimate or measure the ""dispersion angle"" (is that the right term) of the speaker so that I can visualize the area that is covered?</p></li>
<li><p>How sensitive are ultrasonic signals to interference by foliage?</p></li>
<li><p>Any other suggestions for effective placement?</p></li>

"What is the purpose of wet cat food?","<p>What's the purpose/value of a wet food diet for cats? Why would you want to do that?</p>

<p>Due to some recent health issues I've been highly focused on my cats diet, and regularly logging caloric/potassium/B12 intake as well as mass eaten per meal. One thing I noticed is that wet food has an extremely low calorie:mass ratio compared to dry food. </p>

<p>It seems nearly impossible to meet a cat's caloric intake requirements on wet food alone. For example, a 5.3 oz can of a certain brand of wet food contains only 62 kcal, meaning that a cat would have to eat a whopping 18-20 or so ounces of this stuff to get their daily intake in the 200 kcal area. </p>

<p>The four wet foods I have info on here range from 0.735 to 1.245 kcal/g, meaning 160-272g of food that must be consumed per day. That's on or past the upper limit of what I see healthy cats fit in their stomachs in one day (my 3 year old tops out around 200g if she absolutely stuffs herself but typically eats 180g-190g, my older cat maxes out about 180g but typically eats 150g-160g). By comparison the dry food I have on hand is 4.103 kcal/g, meaning only 48g or so must be eaten.</p>

<p>Under the assumption that the nutritional content of wet vs dry food is similar and sufficient, I can't imagine a normal cat being able to eat enough wet food to get even close to their daily caloric intake. Both of my cats only get a disturbingly low 130-180 kcal/day when on wet food only.</p>

<p>So why does wet food exist? For what purpose would you feed your cat wet food? I used to view it as a reasonable alternative to dry food but since I began calorie counting and monitoring diets I can't see a reason to ever feed it to a cat.</p>

<p>The only value I can <em>sort of</em> see in it is if you want to do a wet/dry mix to maintain a healthy caloric intake but also add some mass to the food so the cats aren't walking around on empty stomachs, but I'm not sure if there's any real reason to do that. The other thing is, I wonder if I'm just selecting particularly low calorie wet foods (there seems to be a trend of lower-end cat foods containing higher calorie counts).</p>

<p>The brands I've examined are Royal Canin, Hill's, Wellness, Iams ProHealth, and various small but respectable brands. Currently I've settled on Royal Canin for both wet and dry. </p>

<p><sup>(I don't buy the ""wet foods help cats get water"" line of reasoning so much. While they'll certainly get water from wet food, in my limited personal experience, in a sample of about 20 or so cats,  I've never <em>actually</em> seen a normal, healthy cat severely dehydrate itself when water is available by not drinking it, and a pet fountain or better placement of a water bowl almost always solves issues there. When a cat isn't drinking water it's seems to virtually always be a sign of an actual bigger health issue. But, in any case, I'm interested in other value besides just water content, and I can't justify watery food with critically low caloric intake.)</sup></p>

"Are automatic cat laser toys safe?","<p>I'm looking for some automatic cat toy for proper entertainment. I bumped into automatic laser toys and I'm a but surprised they exist since you're not supposed to hit the cat's eyes with the laser. If it's automatic this might very easily happen.

"Food Pellet - Is my rabbit eating enough?","<p>I've recently gotten a bunny, less than a week, and I researched a lot before getting it. I bought a large cage, timothy hay, Zupreme rabbit food...
As soon as I brought him from the shelter, I filled his water bottle, his food bowl, and the hay disposal. On the first day he was really scared, so he spent most of the day on his hiding spot. But on the second day, I noticed he ate quite a bit of hay and drank the water. However, I feel like he isn't eating much of the pellet. As soon as I put cabbage or carrots, he eats them straight away, but I feel like he is barely touching his food. How much are they supposed to eat? Am I over reacting?
He is 5 months old and 3.7 pounds</p>

"Do mosquitoes bite reptiles? Is there any danger of communicating pathogens?","<p>I'd like to know the generic answer for reptiles, but I'm particularly concerned about tortoises.</p>

<p>Mine is largely an indoor tortoise, and the mosquitoes are already pretty much gone from our area, but I was curious about it.  The occasional bug does get into the house, and since I can't always pick up waste right away, they do find their way to the tortoise's enclosure.</p>

"How to get the dog to be confident enough to play?","<p>I have a 1.5 year old pointer, which will not play with toys. My intention is to go hunting with him, and therefore he needs to learn how to fetch. </p>

<p>I have tried back chain teaching, which were very unsuccessful. I have tried positive feedback training, but it is hard to give him any positive feedback, because he let go of everything as soon as he hears anything that just sounds like a command.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with this, is that it is not disciple that he lacks. He is extremely well in ""dressur"" and enjoys to be trained in all discipline style training. (Sit, stay, heel and etc.) </p>

<p>The reason for this problem might be the two smaller dogs living in the house. It seems that he does not think he ""owns"" anything, and will drown whatever he has, as soon as he he makes contact with person or other dogs. He never plays with them, maybe also because the other dogs is sometimes rough on him. (Must be added that the big dog is trained separately from the other dogs)</p>

  <p>A black and white dutch rabbit goes up to a hurdle with 4 bars, removes the second cross bar up with her mouth and walks through the hurdle, carrying the cross bar.  She does not knock any of the other cross bars off.  She carries the cross bar to the end of the runway and places it to the side, next to another spare bar laying on the floor. </p>

<p>The problem solving concepts implied here are huge.</p>

<ol>
<li>I don't want to jump over the hurdle, but I have to go straight ahead (there is a person behind the bunny) can I move one of those bars?</li>
<li>Ok now I have a bar in my mouth, can I get through here without getting bonked on the head by the rest?</li>
<li>I know the person is going to make me run down this runway, again, where can I put this so it is out of the way?</li>

"Can guinea pigs live separately but see each other often and still be happy?","<p>My girlfriend and I currently do not live together, but we will in the near future, and we are considering getting guinea pigs. Seeing as guinea pigs are social creatures we decided we would want to get two in order to support healthy and happy piggies. </p>

<p>We don't want to shuffle their cage from house to house during the week so we decided that we would possibly want to hold them separately at our homes and bring them together whenever we see each other. Which is just about every day. When we move in together in the next 2 years they will be joined together in one cage. Both will be same gender and have already been together for some time. </p>

<p>Would this work? Would they remember each other and get along as two females? I am worried that if they do not constantly live, eat and sleep together in the same cage they will forget about on another and need to constantly reintroduced.</p>

"How do I stop my Indoor dog from riffling through and knocking over the trashcan?","<p>After some months working with my dog I've managed to more or less get my 8-year-old beagle to behave enough to live indoors with near full access to all areas of the house. This is something that seems to make him very happy, as we don't have a yard and he used to be kept on the small balcony. </p>

<p>He's even better behaved on walks now. I still haven't managed to break him of his obsession with garbage, however. My understanding of training methods is extremely limited, as I've only been studying about pet ownership and training since becoming his co-owner less than a year ago. I've been trying my best at applying principles of positive reinforcement, which is how I've gotten him to behave well within certain contexts, but I'm really very unfamiliar with animals in general as of yet and have very little clue what sorts of incentives to offer - or more accurately, I don't know how to connect refraining from bad behavior with rewards. </p>

<p>So far I've experimented with ""NO"" which only works temporarily. I've tried lightly slapping him whenever he shoves his head into the garbage at home, then when that didn't work I tried chasing him out to the balcony and giving him 30 minute time outs. I've gotten him to behave when he knows I'm watching. But when my back is turned, he's sometimes getting into the garbage or the cereal box or something else.</p>

<p>I've carried out the training presented in the ""It's Yer Choice"" video, and that worked wonderfully - when I'm watching him. When I'm out of sight, the training seems to break down. It doesn't happen every time I'm not watching him, but it happens often enough to be a bit of a headache.</p>

<p>Should I just wait for him to get used to living indoors? Am I doing anything that's reinforcing the garbage obsession? Is there a better way for me to get him to behave when I'm not watching as much as when I am watching?</p>

"Can rabbit and cat live together?","<p>I have a free-roaming (no cage, potty-trained) ~5y old pet rabbit. I would love to adopt a cat from the shelter, but I'm worried about them getting along.</p>

<p>My rabbit is very calm and happy bun, he mostly is just lazying around nearby and is very friendly towards people (licks hands, gets in a lap, etc).</p>

<p>My rabbit did not accept a female bunny friend - she was too bossy, and it upset him greatly. However, he gets fine with parents' cats and dogs, when we visit. He lets dogs lick him and prefers to lie nearby. He is scared of oldest cat, but has mutual interest towards the other one. They lie together in bed and my bunny takes initiative - comes to the cat first, sniffs him, etc. Cat is generally just ignoring him. They are always supervised.</p>

<p>I live in a studio apartment and work from home, but I would still be scared to leave them unsupervised at night / when not home. I could lock bunny up in his old hutch, when I'm away (it's forever open, he hangs out in it), but I feel it would be injustice against him, even though he sleeps there most of the time.</p>

<p>My idea would be to call shelter and look for an adult, calm cat, that is not displaying an agression/without hunting experience. I would ask to foster a cat for a few weeks and see how it goes. But I am still not sure it could work out.</p>

<p>I am afraid my bunny can get hurt at some point, without warning.</p>

"Highly aggressive kittens","<h1>Situation:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Two kittens (originally three in litter, one died recently) are extremely aggressive around food and in pursuit of food. Their behavior includes slashing, biting, growling, and hissing at anything that gets within approximately 4 feet of them while they are eating. They aggressively try to steal food directly from people's hands while they are trying to eat it. One of them recently slashed the other's eye to the point where fluid started oozing out after it tried eating with it.</li>
<li>We have a lot of cats (15+) living around our farmhouse (rural midwest USA). Many have also displayed aggression towards other cats when feeding, swatting and hissing occasionally.</li>
<li>During the times we let the kittens in the house and they are so frantic, there is still food in the bowls we put outside, and they are clearly willing to eat that kind of food inside (it's the same food they're so defensive about). I know that at least one of the kittens has eaten from those bowls before. I do not know how much they have been eating from it recently.</li>
<li>The kittens are both at least a month old, likely older. They are roughly the size that they can be comfortably held within two hands. I believe they have stopped nursing recently.</li>
<li>It is not practical for us to feed all of the cats separately.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Question(s):</h1>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible / likely that this behavior is the product of a couple generations of inbreeding? Or is it more likely that this behavior is due to them being denied access to food by the other cats when we aren't looking?</li>
<li>If the underlying cause of the behavior is not a lack of food, is there a way for it to be corrected? I have friends and family that are interested in taking care of these two kittens. If the behavior persists as they grow up they will become a genuine threat to safety.</li>

"Which South American fish will keep pygmy chain sword plants clean?","<p>I have a new tank (40 gallon long) that's just finished cycling. I've had plants in there for a few weeks already and they're doing well overall, but are starting to show some real algae build-up. In particular my pygmy chain sword plants (<em>Echinodorus tenellus</em>) have quite a lot of brown diatoms and green hair algae.</p>

<p>Since I can finally start stocking the tank with fish, I was thinking I might start with an algae-eater that might clean up the plants. It's a South American community tank, so my three options that I know of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A small pack of <em>Otocinclus</em></li>
<li>A bristlenose, bulldog, or other smallish herbivorous pleco. (Definitely not a common pleco.)</li>
<li>A <em>Farlowella</em>, or one of the other whiptails</li>
</ul>

<p>The tankmates will be 3-4 <em>Apistogramma</em>, a group of <em>Corydoras</em>, and two schools of some apisto-friendly tetras, TBD.</p>

<p>I should note that I'm looking at these fish mainly because I think they're all interesting. I'll be choosing their primary diet appropriately, and any algae-eating is a bonus. On that basis I'd prefer a pleco or whiptail, but I don't have personal experience with either, and I'm thinking they'll be too large to pay much attention to the dainty little leaves on the pygmy chain swords. How efficient would they be at keeping them clean? Would either of them significantly damage the plants in the process?</p>

<hr>

<p>Follow-up: Once I was actually looking at the fish in person, I ended up really, really liking the clown plecos, which don't eat much algae. (And importantly, the girlfriend likes them too.) I decided that this outweighed the utility factor, and got a pair of them. My algae right now is not a <em>big</em> problem, but if it were I'd have definitely gone with a pack of <em>Otocinclus</em>.</p>

"URGENT: Foreign object removed, intestines patched, gut still shows fluid buildup. Going into surgery #3","<p>My friend's dog is about to have a critical surgery, and the vet hasn't seen this particular problem before. I'm hoping one of you can offer additional insight.</p>

<p><strong>The stats...</strong>
Species: Border Collie
Age: 7
Sex/Neuter status: Nuetered
Breed: Pure
Body weight: 50lbs
History: Rock-solid. No health issues.</p>

<p><strong>The symptoms:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Wouldn't eat much/at all for a week.</li>
<li><strong>Ultrasound</strong> showed foreign object in gut</li>
<li><strong>Surgery #1</strong> found and removed a toy squeaker, which had moved a little and done enough damage to a section of intestine that about 1 foot of intestine had to be removed.</li>
<li><strong>Further fluid buildup</strong> shown.</li>
<li><strong>Surgery #2</strong> revealed that body had reacted to first sutures. Used a different type of (longer) sutures to re-patch intestines.</li>
<li><strong>2 days later</strong>, fluid build up had increased from 50ml to 100ml (I think that's the exact figure...I am sure that it was supposed to go down by half and instead doubled). Temperature up.</li>
<li><strong>The decision point</strong>: New fluid buildup COULD be just an infection, or it could be an remaining/new leak in the gut. Can do barium to find out, but if it's a leak then there will be barium in the gut too. Can wait on it to 'heal' but it could also get worse. We decided to do a 3rd surgery to look for a leak, and attempt to patch it if found. </li>
<li><strong>The dilemma:</strong> The vet says that he's only seen one other case where a foreign objected resulted in a gut that was still leaking after 2 surgeries. In that case, he did another patch but the dog died.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My question: It seems like we have bumped up against this particular vet's experience limit.</strong> HE has only dealt with one other case like this, and did not ever discover what went wrong (and what could have been done) in his last case. He admits that he's at a loss for explaining the current situation. My hope is that one of you will have seen it before and can offer some insight.</p>

<p><strong>Any ideas for what could be going on, or how to treat it?</strong> Have you seen anything like this before?</p>

Really would like to neuter them to avoid you issues it's just its not me who'll be paying for it, my dad would so he's got to understand why it's important...

"Is there a safe dose of vitamin D to give a cat?","<p>I know that too much vitamin D (fat soluble) can cause toxicity in cats, but how much is too much? </p>

<p>The reason I asked this is - When I open my vitamin D bottle, because I take it, my kitty goes ""can I get one of those"" - every time.  She's convinced that they must taste great.</p>

<p>My cat is crazy, I've caught her eating dust bunnies which I sometimes pull from her mouth, sometimes I'm not successful.</p>

<p>I've seen her eat feathers from my pillow, biting the plastic ends off things and swallowing the plastic.</p>

<p>I've tried to cat-proof my house but she's just one of those, if I can chew on it, I'll eat it types.   </p>

<p>Fortunately she's gotten better. When she was a kitten she was just crazy.  She likes ear wax and more than once has pulled a used Q-tip out of the garbage and chewed on the used end.</p>

<p>I feed her well. Expensive canned food and some dry food.</p>

<p>She wants my vitamin D. On googling I find that, some cats can be vitamin D deficient, but dosing should be done properly.</p>

<p>My cat is 10 lb. Is once in a while (or maybe just once), vitamin D supplement, a safe dose? It might be that she just wants the gelatin, in which case, maybe I'll squeeze the vitamin D oil out of the pill and give her the gel capsule.   </p>

<p><em>Note added 11 months later:</em>   While not part of the question exactly, my little kitty, now nearly 2 years old and 11 lbs, she no longer begs when I open my (Dr. prescribed) vitamin D pill container.   I think it may have been a kitten thing, kittens having an urge to try stuff, but that's just a guess. </p>

"Goldfishes died first night","<p>We bought 3 small gold fishes from Walmart last night. We poured some tap water in the tank and waited for the Clorine to release (after 2 hours), we put them in with their water (initially in the plastic from Walmart). The night was very cold even in the hall. Say 60 degree. In the morning we saw all three almost dead, although look alive from above, they didn't move at all. Their mouth was slightly moving, but looked like they were dying. Finally all three fully dead. </p>

<p>What could have been the reason? We thought maybe the low temperature? </p>

<p>At this time of photo, the black one was probably dead.

"Is kitten-rabbit ""mating"" behavior something to worry about?","<p>We've got a 3 year old neutered male dwarf rabbit and a male kitten who is almost four months old. The kitten isn't neutered yet, but will be before he turns five months old. </p>

<p>The cat and the rabbit are friendly. They don't groom each other (yet - I have hope!) but they run and play together, and boop noses together sometimes.

"Diagnosing a skin condition in a kitten with no qualified vets around","<p>I have a queen with a litter of 4-weeks-old (as of upcoming Sunday) kittens, and one of the kittens has skin problems. I contacted my regular vets (I have 2), and they weren't able to help.</p>

<p>So, I have a few questions.</p>

<p>Is it possible to do fungal and/or bacterial culture test at home? How? I know close to nothing about this field, but I'm a quick learner. Don't have a microscope though, which can be a problem, but I'll try to get access to one.</p>

<p>What else can it be aside from fungal/bacterial infection? How do I check it? There's one more or less decent vet lab here that can do basic tests, but I have to know what tests to take.</p>

<p>I've more or less resigned myself to being my cats' vet (aside from the legal staff like vet certificates, and surgeries), but I need some guidance, a direction where to search next.</p>

<p>Symptoms.</p>

<p>Only one kitten was affected. Her litter mates and mom are fine.</p>

<p>She developed a crust on the tip of her tail when she was about 1 week old, and a bit of dandruff a bit further on the tail. I didn't pay much attention to it at the time, just noticed that it was there. When she was exactly 2 weeks old, when I was taking photos of the kittens, I noticed that her tail was kind of misshapen, but instead of injury it was just matted at the sides, with hair noticeably thinner at one side, and the crust was still there on the tip of her tail. I contacted one of my vets, she told me to stop overreacting. I waited a couple days, then noticed a matted area with thin hair on the kitten's lower back, and another area, just starting to get matted, a bit further on the back. This time my vet told me to put Miramistin on it twice a day, and that's it. Further 'vet contacts' resulted in them politely flipping me off.</p>

<p>At the moment the kitten has a bald tip of the tail where the crust used to be (I managed to get it off by myself), a bald area further on the tail, a matted area on her lower back with hairs broken a few mm from the skin, another smaller area like that a bit further on the back, and yet another area with broken hairs on her thigh. The tip of the tail seems a bit swollen, but other than that there doesn't seem to be any swelling or reddening. She seems to have itchy paws and ears, although there are no visible signs of anything there. Other than that, she's active, eats well (at least as far as I can tell -- she still breast feeds, doesn't react to solid foods yet), gains weight steadily, and generally seems well, aside from occasional scratching.</p>

<p>Today I borrowed a UV flashlight and scanned all of the kittens, their mom, and the show shelter where I keep them. There were a couple fluorescent flecks on the cats (not green though) but nothing on or inside the shelter. I know it's about 60/40 accuracy, but at least it's something.</p>

<p>Also, my cats are indoor with no access outside whatsoever. The queen is properly vaccinated, was dewormed not long before breeding, and the last time she was on a show was in April, in my own show shelter, and I washed it with chlorhexidile when we got back home. And all of the kitten bedding is washed and ironed thoroughly, and changed regularly. I hardly have any guests, and I got into habit of washing floors near the entrance and around litter boxes with chlorhexidine every other week because of my late kidney cat.</p>

<p>When we changed the harness it has improved a little, we can't use only a collar due to the lifestyle we have (regular hiking, if he falls down anywhere on a lead we don't want to have him dangling by his throat therefore choking or breaking his neck...).</p>

<p>The harness does fit correctly, his old one (image one) was worse but in fact too tight, the other is a much better fit. We have two brushes, a slicker and a combo soft bristle / medium spread pin brush.</p>

"What can I do if my cat is stuck in the washing machine?","<p>A bit of a story that happened a few months ago, before I ask my question with more detail:</p>

<p>I used to have a 2-month old kitten which me and my mum received from a school friend of mine (her older cat wasn't getting on with the kitten) sometime ago. We used to have cats long before I turned 10, but never really had to go through traumatizing experiences because the house back then was safe. So I moved to England, and moved into a new house which needed some maintenance. We were prepared to welcome in our new cat, trying to minimize the risks of our new kitten getting hurt as much as possible. After like 5 weeks of our kitten settling in, on an ordinary day, I came back home from work experience. After talking for a few minutes with my mum in the kitchen, she went to prepare the laundry for the washing machine. I went upstairs, thinking that my kitten would be playing with toys in my room. We couldn't see her for over 10 minutes which was worrying, seeing that she has a habit of stalking us. We looked into every corner, deeply worried, and then I looked at the washing machine glass door, only to notice that the kitten was spinning inside. I cried instantly, getting my mum over to the kitchen. We had no way of going into the washing machine unless we waited for the water to get sucked out. When we finally got her out, she was shaking and her belly was full of water (lungs were filled with washing chemicals as well). This was the first time we came across such a situation and we didn't know what to do. We held her upside down hoping to get some water out of her, but we didn't know whether this was painful for her. She had let go off her feces which was a sign her body was giving up. Pink liquid was coming out of her eyes, but she was still breathing (struggling, for that matter). I searched the closest vet on my phone and called several times to make sure I know where I am going. The closest vet was down the street I live at, but it was a considerably long distance. I am not especially not good at running, and my mum is too old to run, so I ran with the transporter and phone in my hands panicking like crazy. My mum said she'd follow me shortly. The kitten was taken in by the vet and they checked her situation. When my mum came, the vet announced that she had really low chances because of the water and chemicals in her lungs. The vet inserted drugs as a final method, and told us to go home instead of worrying and waiting. One hour after we got home, we were informed that she stopped breathing.</p>

<p>Now, ever since then, we couldn't forgive ourselves for our carelessness, my mum's friend managed to convince us that the pain and emptiness in the house can be defeated most easily through adopting two cats. And so we adopted two cats after a few days. My mum was hard to convince since she knew she was responsible, but anyway.</p>

<p>We tried really hard up until now to train them to not walk around dangerous things, such as the washing machine or the opening entrance door which is going fine at the moment. (We live near the main road with open staircase)</p>

<p>But, in a case this misfortune happens again, what can we do?
Be it if one of the cats is stuck in the machine and we want to get her out as quick as possible... Or when we pull her out and try to get the water out of her lungs?</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to any advice and tips. Thanks in advance.</p>

"Dog sick after boarding","<p>This has happened twice in the past two months.  I dropped my female, 1 year old, spayed dog off at the boarder for a week.  When I picked her up, she was lethargic (just laying down), hot and sweaty, and had a runny nose.  I think her breath smells mucusy, like a human's when they have a cold.</p>

<p>The first time, this went away after a few days.  I attributed it to being in close continual contact with many other dogs, for the first time in her life.  But, I just picked her up today, and it's happened again.</p>

<p>This boarder has ""open"" boarding.  They don't crate them, but rather let them run around in an indoor area with a concrete floor all day.  I assume they sleep on that floor.  The boarder is staffed 24/7.  The workers seem nice.  The place has good reviews online.</p>

<p>Is this normal?  Would a dog often get sick after a week of boarding (continual play, exposure to other dogs, sleeping on the floor)?  Might she have been too cold at night?  Or could something be wrong?</p>

<p>Edit: She's lethargic for a few days after coming home from the kennel, both times I've left her there for a week.  It's strange because, we can watch her on the webcam playing and having fun, which she seems to do often.  </p>

"Ideas about why my dog's prepuce is swollen?","<p>Bear the dog started chewing on his penis a few weeks ago. We noticed that he seemed to be grooming the area excessively, and within a few days, he seemed very lethargic and I noticed that there was puss on the tip of his penis (which we now know is the ""prepuce""). Took him to an emergency vet who put him in a cone and gave us antibiotics. That helped, but the area was still inflamed, so our regular vet gave us higher dose antibiotics, an anti fungal, and topical antibacterial drops. </p>

<p>With all those drugs, he was throwing up a lot, so the vet took him off of the antibiotics. But not the antifungal or the drops. The vet is pretty clear that he doesn't know what is wrong.</p>

<p>At no point have we noticed a change in urination. </p>

<p>It's now been three weeks and Bear is still super lethargic and he seems uncomfortable. His behavior is hard to describe but he is moping. He is barely willing to eat. He'll eat chicken, and hardcore treats (liver, bacon) but he's not interested in his usual food.</p>

<p>His prepuce is now a fairly healthy shade of pink, no puss, and no intense redness, but it is definitely swollen. </p>

<p>So my question is: are there other things we can do to make him more comfortable? And do you have any ideas about what might be going on? Spider bites? Cancer? STDs? </p>

I haven't picked my dachshund up yet and I am doing all my research before hand. 
My husband and I both work full time but different dayparts. Some days there will be a 4 to 6 hour gap where neither of us will be home. And some days there will always be a parent home. You 
Upon bringing my dachshund home, I have already prepared to take a week off from work to give him constant attention.
We do not want to use a crate and this is not negotiable to us - a small pen is something we can work with.</p>

<p>So, from my research I fully understand when to take out our dachshund when I am home.
What I am not fully grasping is what exactly to do when we are away from home. Do I leave water in the pen? Is it just wee wee pads lining the floor until a designated spot is created? Or should there be a bed or blanket in there? </p>

<p>My goal is to eventually have our dog be able to enjoy the entire apartment (with limitations to some rooms of course) without coming home to messes, without keeping him confined. Will I always have to have a wee wee pad down when we are away for those periods of time once they are trained or will they eventually be able to hold it (something I read said a puppy can hold its bladder 1 hour for every month of age. 2 months = 2 hours).</p>

"New shelter dog has chronic ear infection.","<p>My wife recently adopted a small daug (dachshund/pug mix) and he came with a nasty yeasty ear infection.  We have done some research and have found out that he has been in and out of the local shelter over the past year and went to the owners who gave him to us (an owner kept ""loosing"" him and was in and out of the shelter for 6-7 months)  My guess is they didn't know how to deal with his chronic ear infection and couldn't afford his vet bills. We called his original shelter and they said at intake he was severely underweight and infested with flees.  He was yeasty and had bad ear infections. Looking at all his vet records, he has been WAY over vacinated and on lots of antibiotics. </p>

<p>Now to my question... he is very timid and shy. Not aggressive at all but lacks trust (for obvious reasons). I would like to clean his ears (was going to make a homeopathic remedy) and apply some drops the vet gave him but he is not wanting me to touch his ear.  Should I give him a few days to settle in before I just start messing with his ear?  I don't want the first couple days being associated with me causing him pain.  But I also don't want to just ignore his ear infection.  When I'm ready, I've read lots of tips holding the dog to clean and apply the drops... I just don't want to traumatize him. Thoughts?  I really love this sweet guy... he just needs Us to take care of him since no one else in his life really has.  I think this is going to be an on going issue since his immune system is obviously shot. Any advise is greatly appreciated. </p>

"Do dogs commit suicide?","<p>One of our dogs is currently under very heavy medication (something similar to cortisone). Our vet who took this stuff herself during an illness described the side effects to be so exhausting it makes death seem the better option sometimes. A person however is capable of understanding the need of the treatment, what causes the side effects and that they will end after treatment. It is impossible to explain this to a dog.</p>

<p>In the last few days our dog fell into the pond several times while he tried to drink. He always drank from the pond before and normally isn't as clumsy, sometimes he really seemed to slip into the pond on purpose. This only happened after the dosage was reduced, before he was too exhausted to go outside most of the time. I am not interested in the cause of this behavior, as I am currently not near the dog and can't really judge the effect of the drugs on him.</p>

"How can I best protect my fire-bellied toad eggs from the mother?","<p>I've had trouble with my female <em>B. orientalis</em> eating or accidentally killing the eggs she lays.  I've read online that in China, fire-bellied toads are commonly found in rice farms among the rice paddies.  Since the water is so shallow, I'm wondering if using rice paddies in a deeper water setup would be a good idea to protect the eggs until they hatch. </p>

<p>I plan to use sandy loam with about an inch or so of soil or other substrate that will keep the water clear on top, then plant long-grain, brown rice and have it drenched in a ton of non-incandescent 6500k light bulbs.  </p>

<p>Is this a valid process to follow?</p>

<p>Is there anything else I should know before attempting to do this?</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice for growing rice paddies inside a vivarium or has anyone ever even had success with this? </p>

"How to react when a dog lashes-out at his dog friend?","<p>I have three dogs and I can say that they get along very well 99% of the time they are together (which is technically most of the time).</p>

<p>Sometimes they start a fight out of the simplest thing that might tick them off one time and it might not tick them off the other, so I did a little research and concluded that the ideas that I was considering to be the problem were mostly it, the triggers for that reaction are <a href=""http://www.familypet.com/what-could-cause-my-one-indoor-dog-to-lash-out-at-the-other-dog-theyve-always-been-friends/"">described here</a> and they make sense.</p>

<h2>My question is:</h2>

<p><strong>How should I react to this?</strong> I figure it's a bit normal that we as humans tend to tense up when your best friends all of the sudden lash-out at each other... My usual reaction was to yell at them to get their attention and carefully break it up withing being accidentally bit or what not.</p>

<p>They've never made themselves bleed or anything that rough, but I don't know if I should continue to yell and break it up or let them handle the dispute as long as it doesn't get too violent? ...And please don't take me wrong, I do not condone any sort of dog fighting or anything like that, but I'm realistic about the fact that they are still animals (as much as we love them) and I might be getting in the way of something that comes natural to them?</p>

<p>Let me specify that they do this 1% of the time so it's been probably 2, 3 occasions in a 2 to 3 year span, and as soon as I break them up I don't separate them into different rooms or anything like that, I just standby ready to see if they still feel aggressive against each other but it's usually the other way around, they'll be licking each other's scuffle wounds.</p>

<p>Just as a final note for what it's worth, they don't always lay down in the same place, we leave the doors open around the house so sometimes one is in another room; so I guess what I'm saying is that it's optional to them if they want to be together (they usually are).</p>

"Puppy not paying attention when excited","<p>Our 6 month old Pitbull is incredibly friendly and well behaved (for the most part anyway).</p>

<p>We like to take him on walks, and responds well to basic commands. He stops at corners with us before crossing the street and while he still lags a bit or gets ahead to sniff stuff, I believe we're close to getting it right.</p>

<p>The problem is that when he gets excited (ie: when he sees other dogs) it seems like everything he's learned goes out the window.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, he tried to run to the other sidewalk when he spotted a couple of dogs behind a fence. He was totally oblivious to a car that was approaching and I don't want to delve on what could have happened if he hadn't been on a leash.</p>

<p>When this happens, he doesn't even respond to his name.</p>

<p>There's absolutely no indication of aggressiveness. Like I said, he's just <em>incredibly</em> friendly, as are all the dogs we've met in out neighborhood, so he often plays with dogs we meet when on our walks.</p>

"Is my cat's behaviour normal?","<p>Over the past few months, I've been trying to figure out the differences between the two black cats I had for about 5 months. They are about 8 months old and they come from the same litter.</p>

<p>Luna, the much smaller one is a bit quieter than Chilli, the one my inquiry is about. Luna meows when she needs to unlike Chilli, and overall behaves like all of our past cats.</p>

<p>Chilli however, caught my attention through doing things like;</p>

<ul>
<li>Rapidly opening her mouth - imagine a dog catching a treat mid-air - only to close it, with no real reason. She does that around 5 times in half an hour, if nothing in the living room happens and every house member is minding their own business.</li>
<li>When I pet her on the head, she gets so 'excited' that she opens her mouth. Sometimes, she even keeps her mouth open for the next two minutes, even when I had already stopped petting her.</li>
<li>Unlike Luna, Chilli frequently makes a journey to the kitchen and often gets caught eating some of the leftovers from the plates in the sink. We often eat spaghetti and once Chilli sees that we are finished with the plate, she excitedly jumps up and licks the sauce leftovers until there's none left. (We do not eat Spaghetti with any kind of meat)</li>
<li>She never rubs herself against any of the house members, or her sister, or the furniture, nor even the walls. Not from what I have seen at least. Luna however does it very often.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from these actions, Chilli behaves just like our past cats.
The question is, should I be worried? Or is this normal for her to be like this, considering every cat can be different?</p>

"Resolving Jack Russel dog problems","<p>The problem is that my Jack Russel female dog is not normal. We adopted it two years ago and we still have behavior problems with it. We live in an apartment two floors high. We tried to teach it to don't pee or defecate in our sofa but didn't succeed even that we went out with it at the beginning 4 times and then 3 times a day. We had also other problems so we decided to take a dog trainer. The dog trainer gave the idea of a dog cage. We bought it a cage and thought this would resolve the problem.</p>

<p>But no, sometimes it would pee or defecate in the apartment; even in its own cage. How is that possible? I have heard that one of the worst things dog would want to have is defecate or pee in its own bed. So how can that happen? Also, some days ago it peed on our kitchen table when someone left it alone, when my sibling went to the second floor for some time, why is this?</p>

<p>Also, why is it so stubborn? I have a family that doesn't follow the rules 100% but I can say we follow the most? So why does it put its legs on the sofa when we have asked it to not do so?</p>

"Newly adopted Black & Tan Coonhound lunging at 2 young children","<p>I have a small rescue and recently adopted a young Black &amp; Tan Coonhound girl to a family with 2 young elementary school age children.  Shandy is a sweet dog, but sometimes without warning she will lunge at the kids' faces. There is no growling involved and is usually centering around food.  With the little boy, he was sitting down at the dinner table when Shandy lunged at him catching his chin.  This resulted in a small cut and bruise on the child's chin.  Also, the little girl was eating something, and Shandy lunged at her face but luckily missed it when the child jumped away.  Shandy has never tried this with either mom or dad. The family is thinking that Shandy might not be a good fit for them but would still like some helpful suggestions. I suggested that we get a trainer in the home to assess the situation.  The second option would be to just return Shandy to our rescue.  Can you shed any light on this situation?  Is there a certain type of family Shandy should go to in light of what is happening...maybe one with no kids?  Thank you!

"Moving has caused my cat's night-life to eat away at my actual life","<p>We've recently moved from a house to an apartment.  </p>

<p>We've had this cat for quite some time, and it has moved with us twice before.<br>
Both the other times, the cat would disappear for a few days (under a couch) and then start settling down.</p>

<p>We introduced him to the new house using the following method:  </p>

<ol>
<li>We released him from his carrier in the living room, near his food/water and litter box</li>
<li>The first day we kept him there</li>
<li>The second day we opened up the hallway to let him explore</li>
</ol>

<p>However since we opened up the hallway, the nights have gotten worse and worse, and we have since closed that door again.<br>
Around 3, to 3:30 in the morning the cat starts.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Jumping against doors / trying to open doorknobs</li>
<li>Meowing loudly</li>
<li>Growling</li>
<li>Going to the litter-box several times in a row, burying something that isn't there</li>
</ul>

<p>If we leave the doors open from the living room where he spends all of his time, to our bedroom, he will cry out in-front of our bedroom door until one of us wakes up.<br>
If we lock him in the bedroom he'll cry at the door to the hallway. (this was a bad idea)<br>
If we keep him in the living room he'll cry at the door to the hallway.</p>

<p>The only thing that seems to calm him down is our presence.<br>
If we walk around with him (he'll follow us non-stop at night) he's fine and quiet.<br>
If we go and sleep in the living room on the couch (yes, I just spent a night sleeping on the couch because of my cat) he'll purr for a while and remain quiet.</p>

<p>He seems to want us to be in the living room. And I have no idea why.<br>
It only works if it's me or my girlfriend, if our kid is with him he'll just hide and cry out from his hiding spot.  </p>

<p>During the day, he's his usual self.<br>
He sleeps on the back of the couch.<br>
He's only scratching his posts.<br>
He's not peeing anywhere he shouldn't.<br>
He's not crying out during the day.<br>
He comes when we call his name, and he's eating normally.</p>

I'm a bit sleep deprived now and really annoyed at the animal.</p>

One vet told she can't tolerate a post exposure prophylaxis course and die in a few days. Another told she can well tolerate it. The third one said she can only be administered 3 doses of 0 - 3 -7 and no more.</p>

<p>We also have an adult dog at home (vaccinated). Will he require a prophylaxis too because he sniffs the affected puppy and licks her urine? </p>

She is ostensibly OK till now after 12 hours.I'm very much confused whether to continue the prophylaxis course or not give her anything due to high death risk by vaccine at such young age.</p>

"Managing the gradual induction of stray cat into my life","<p>I think <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/6237/2871"">one of the five stray cats</a> that visit my verandah has taken a liking to me and she hung around for a really long time (45+ minutes) staring at me through my large glass windows AFTER she had been fed. She looked playful and was pouncing around and meowing a lot.</p>

<p>I really like this cat a lot but my apartment contract doesn't allow pets on the premises. My landlord is however sympathetic to stray cats.</p>

<p>My question is, I would eventually like to take this cat in as the time progresses and bring it back to the United States with me in 2015 (I am in France right now for a year). I understand the paperwork necessary for this. My question focusses on the <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/1064/2871"">""integration"" part of a separate answer here</a>.</p>

<p>However, in the time being, how should I ""adopt"" this cat without necessarily letting her into my house? If I don't let her into my house, would this cat see this as ""being shut out of my life"" and leave for good? Or would she continue to come back to me as we have a ""feeding cadence"" of twice a day now. Also, I have always considered cats to be rather intelligent creatures (this one is a tuxedo cat). Would my forced indifference towards her translate into rudeness in cat language?</p>

<p>I am afraid that if I do leave on a mandatory 1 month trip next month, she will think I am gone for good and leave.</p>

"Do rabbits experience menopause?","<p>I got a question third hand, (friend > wife > me) and a quick search leaves me wondering where to look for the answer. </p>

<p>The friend has an 11 year old female rabbit that has not been spayed. She wants to know if rabbits experience menopause, and what if any similarities it has with human menopause <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menopause"">(<em>transition to a non-reproductive state, with associated symptoms</em>)</a></p>

<p>A quick glance at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_rabbit#Breeding"">Wikipedia</a> teaches us that rabbits are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_ovulation_%28animals%29"">induced ovulators</a> which means they don't have normal cycles, they ovulate in response to sex. So obviously there are going to be some differences from humans.  The closest scientific study I find is <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18973881"">Efficacy of red clover isoflavones in the menopausal rabbit model.</a> which uses ""experimentally induced menopause"" to test a drug. So while not really addressing this question does provide for the probability of a rabbit/human similarity. </p>

<p>Do rabbits experience menopause? At what age, and what kind of symptoms? Are they able to reproduce until they die of old age (16+ years old)?</p>

"Teach cats to stay close in unfenced area","<p>We have two cats that we would love to take to a summer house with us for weekends during at least half of the year. The idea is that we'll be heading there on Friday and returning on Sunday night/Monday morning. Both cats are very close to us and one of them would really miss us if we left him for two nights. The house is not fully fenced and in my experience taking my more curious cat around, there's no fence that would stop him. The land around the house is around 600 square meters/6500 square foot of grass and trees for them to play, and even though there's no fence there are plants that mark its limits. Coming from the city that is a lot of land for them, however, last weekend, we took the more curious one over there (he's also the more adaptable) and he was already trespassing to neighbour's houses. What can we do to keep them in our property? How can we teach them not to go far from us?</p>

<p>But my rabbit does not have a pocket watch, yet she often manages to get up on the bed minutes before the alarm goes off.  The only clock in the room is a digital alarm, that it is not possible to see unless you are on the bed, so I can't see her checking it through the night without waking me up.  I have heard from a few others who share a bedroom with a rabbit that it is not unusual for them to be up on the bed shortly before the alarm goes off, for some snuggles.</p>

<p>Unlike cats and dogs, rabbits seem to prefer something solid under them when sleeping, so they generally move to the floor for the night. Maybe once a month or so she will wake up in the middle of the night and get up on the bed, grabs a quick snuggle and back to the floor, but usually she waits until 5 to 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  </p>

<p>If the alarm clock was a wind up, you could make the argument that there is a sound made by the clock before the alarm goes off.  But the only non-digital clock in the house is a battery clock in the kitchen (<em>she does not have physical access to the kitchen</em>) and it does not have an alarm.  </p>

<h2>Weight</h2>

<p>He looks thin, is this normal for Korean Jindos?</p>

<h2>Elimination Habits</h2>

<p>When Kairo was a puppy, he use to pee and poop in the corner of the house. But after he turned like 5 months old, I started to walk him once a day. When I started to walk him everyday, he stopped peeing or pooping in the house. But sometimes I could not walk him every single day, and when I don't walk him, he will hold up and does not pee nor poop. Once I didn't walk him for 2 to 3 days, and he still held on to it. I try to let him do it but he won't. He will just wait for me to walk him. </p>

<p>I got really worried about his urinary and excretory system, so after that experience, I walk him twice a day, morning and evening. Is this enough? I'm still not sure. He drinks about 3 to 3 1/2 cups of water a day. Is this routine healthy for him? </p>

<h2>Meals</h2>

<p>And also, he doesn't finish his meals. I give him one cup in the morning and another cup in the evening, but he will only eat the half of it each time. So all in all he is eating just one cup in a day, which I'm really worried about. He doesn't eat the food all at once; he will eat like few bites, then after an hour, he'll take another few bites, and so on (but still eats only half of it). I'm really worried seeing him getting thinner. :( I walk him like 1 hour to 2 hours in the morning but still no changes. Is this routine okay for his health?</p>

"Domesticating wild mice?","<p>My house is under attack by mice.  Droppings everywhere, holes in boxes and plastic bags.  I'm not a killer, so, I decided to use a humane trap.  With it, I caught 8 mice in 2 days, not bad.  But I only decimated them, not eradicated them, so more to go.  I can hear them at night.</p>

<p>I'm quite happy with my traps and bait; the problem is now the weather is 10F degrees outside, and 20"" of snow.  I won't put the mice out there until it's a bit warmer, but I can't just not trap them, either.</p>

<p>I've got a mouse now that I've trapped and placed in an empty fish tank, I just lined the bottom with paper towels and placed a dish of water and bait for food.</p>

<p>I know next to nothing about keeping mice, my intention is to release any that I catch as soon as the weather turns; but how do I care for them in the meantime?  Do I have to worry about disease, or fleas, or getting bitten?  What happens if I do get bit?</p>

<p>The mouse, by the way, is having a temper tantrum, ostensibly from getting caught.  He (or she) has already torn up all of the paper towels into confetti, after one night, and seems to be testing the best choice places to eliminate his/her bowels.  That includes in the water bowl and food dish.  And everywhere else.  So, how often do I have to change the linings, food, and water?</p>

<p>And for posterity, I might as well learn how to sex the mouse... how do I do that?</p>

<p>And if I manage to catch more, should I keep them together or put them in separate tanks?  I don't want babies.  (I have one more tank suitable for this purpose, the others I have are not large enough or don't have adequate covers on top).</p>

Is there a kind of soap or other agent I can use?</p>

"How smart are ferrets?","<p>It's been several years since my ferrets passed on, but I was quite impressed with just how smart they were (well, really only one of my two... the other was sweet, but wasn't particularly bright).</p>

<p>My male surprised me several times with what appeared to be some fairly clever problem-solving.  </p>

<p>For example, he was obsessed with getting into the trash can.  To do this, he started by reaching up, hooking his claws into the plastic liner (which he could just barely reach), and then putting his weight on it until the can tipped over (I caught him swinging back and forth while dangling from the liner to tip the can).</p>

<p>I solved this by raising the can up so it was too high for him to reach the top.</p>

<p>He responded by opening the bottom cabinet drawer next to the can, climbing in, then opening the one above, climbing into that one, and on until he reached the top (using them like stairs).</p>

<p>As much as I love my cats, I can't imagine them doing anything quite so involved.</p>

"Why are my fish always scared?","<p>I have a tank with four 1.5"" Shubunkins, which I've had for one month. There are no other fish. It is a glass-bottom tank with no substrate (for easy cleaning), and has many floating plants for them to hide in. The tank is equipped with just an AquaClear filter and an auto-feeder.</p>

<p>Whenever someone approaches the tank, all of the fish run into the plants, and won't come out. They only swim around when they don't see anyone nearby. I've never seen any other fish behave this way, except maybe catfish.</p>

<p>Why might the fish always be scared? Is that a sign there is something wrong with the tank?</p>

"Pet Insurance: with no pedigree for a street-rescued cat, is it necessary to disclose suspected but unconfirmed breed?","<p>If one has a cat they're pretty sure is a Manx - he has a short tail - but rescued him from the side of the road, is it necessary to when signing him up for pet insurance to tell them the breed he seems to be?</p>

<p>He was found on the side of the highway as a kitten, injured and starving, many years ago. He came running as soon as he saw a human pull over and hold her arms out to him; he seemed to have been abandoned, he seemed diseased and unhealthy then. He got good vet treatment at the time. He's now about 6, and is quite healthy overall, though has always loved food, presumably because of the trauma of not having it as a kitten, and is a bit overweight - he particularly loves bread (wtf weird cat??) and creme fresh. Food puzzles and portion control have been helping with his weight, but he's not there yet. Since he's probably a Manx, he'll probably live to about 20. He's quite intelligent and acts as the caretaker of the other two cats he lives with. </p>

<p>We'd like to sign them all up for pet insurance; but insurance quotes, if we say he's a pedigreed manx, seem to be much more expensive. Nobody has ever actually said ""yes, that's officially a manx cat""; it's conceivable that he lost his tail while he was lost in the woods as a kitten. But even then, manxes are a healthier breed, unlike most other breeds, so you'd expect insurance to be cheaper.</p>

<p>Does it make sense, since we don't have pedigree papers, to sign him up for pet insurance as a generic breed? Or do we have to say ""he's specifically a manx"" even though we've never confirmed that? We're obviously hoping for the former, but want to make sure it's actually ok to do before just going ahead with it.</p>

"How to hold my dog in place to clean his ears?","<p>My dog (a German Shepherd mix) has a severe ear infection and needs ear drops twice a day and an ear flush once a day. He absolutely hates this, and as a result I have not been very successful in cleaning his ears. I'm concerned that if I can't flush his ears properly, the ear drops won't have much of an effect. He weighs over 50 pounds and has plenty of energy, so it's difficult keeping him still.</p>

<p>I read that you should place your dog on a table at about chest level, but I live in a small apartment and the closest thing I have that is that height would either be my stove or my computer desk, two things I definitely don't want him jumping up on.</p>

<p>I live alone and cannot rely on having a friend help me every time. So far I've been leading my dog into the bathroom and giving him treats, then getting ahold of his collar and leading him into a corner. I then wrap my arm around his head to get to his ear, and attempt to apply the ear drops. If I had an extra couple hands at this point, I would also hold his body so I don't feel like I have him in a headlock, and use the other hand to give him treats.</p>

<p>He generally stays quiet (with the occasional yelp), so I don't think I'm hurting him. He just fights very hard to escape my grasp. How can I hold him still long enough to properly clean and treat his ear infection? A friend recommended some kind of large treat/chew toy, but what could I get him that would keep him in place?</p>

"What can I do when the cone of shame is too heavy?","<p>Our puppy Dachshund had an Ovarihysterectomy performed on Monday (she was spayed). She has a small (approximately 2 inch) sutured scar on her belly. She was given a cone to wear and we were asked to keep it on for two weeks(!).  </p>

<p>While the cone (technically) fits, it's actually too heavy for her. She has trouble walking, because in order to do so, she has to keep her head up high and it's stressing her neck. Also, being a hound, she is used to walking with her nose to the ground, which is now impossible.</p>

"Serious flea problems with my dog","<h1>History of the problem</h1>

<p>I have a lot of problems getting rid of the fleas which torture my dog (A year and a half Yorkie :) ). First a brief history + info on what we have tried and what ware the results.</p>

<p>At first for the first time our dog got fleas after we groomed him (mid summer) before that he didn't had any. Once we groomed him in a few days he started scratching more than usual, after we checked him we saw a few on his back(following the length of the spine), not more than 10 ware spotted and that was it. We showered him with regular dog shampoo, used a ""spot on"" drops as a prevention measures and the problem seemed to be solved.</p>

<p>After a few days(not more than a week) we noticed that the little guy started scratching again and from time to time to bite his legs, when we examined we saw more than the previous time and we got <a href=""http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/dog/dog-healthcare/dog-flea-treatment/herbal-dog-flea-shampoo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flee repellent shampoo</a> and spot on drops from a different brand, showered him thoroughly with the shampoo and used the drops again. </p>

<p>On the very next day he was scratching again and had the fleas again. This time we ware in for more serious measures, we got a <a href=""http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/dog/dog-healthcare/dog-flea-treatment/dog-flea-spray-150ml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spray</a> and the ""protective night lamp thingy"" so he couldn't lick himself (advised by the instructions and by a staff member from pets at home). It worked for the night and the next day, that was it. </p>

<p>We sprayed him again, but after the result was the same we stopped (the spray is kind of dangerous and we don't want to cause the little fella more trouble)</p>

<p>After we got to the store again and this time we got these <a href=""http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/johnsons-4fleas-for-puppies-and-small-dogs-6-pack-tablets"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tablets</a> and these <a href=""http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/bob-martin-flea-clear-spot-on-solution-1-x-67mg-for-small-dogs-2---10kg?pageSize=83#"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">drops</a>. We gave him a bath with the same shampoo, gave hime the tablets and they took effect in about 20 minutes and we started seeing the evil creatures on the floor (which was expected result), used the drops and that was it, the effect was for about 10 days.</p>

<p>2 days ago we gave him a bath with the same shampoo and today when I got home I started petting him in his bed, and when he rolled on his back, I saw a very large group of the fleas running on his belly, when I started examining him, I saw that there are large fleas, like they ware there from a long time as well as smaller ones, around his nipples(?) I saw signs of wounds from either scratching or biting by those things.</p>

<h1>Now the question</h1>

<ol>
<li>How should we approach the problem now?</li>
<li>Can you recommend any other products, which helped you before?</li>
</ol>

<h1>Side info</h1>

<p>We live in East London, UK. A large number of cats are passing trough the back yard(which is our first assumption for the cause of the problem), we treated the garden with animal repellent (to keep all kind of animals away) as well with some garden pest controlling product (It was supposed to kill the fleas(it was written on the label), don't remember any name, got it from the local pet store). </p>

<p>The dog is living in the house with us, no other pets. He goes in the garden when he wants, but mainly for 5-10 minutes and always sleeps inside. We walk him in the area (we avoid dog parks, ever since we spotted fleas on him).</p>

<h1>Note:</h1>

<p>I looked at <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/107/how-can-i-get-rid-of-fleas"">this</a> and <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/2479/effectiveness-of-flea-tick-spot-treatment-on-dogs-with-hair"">this</a> questions, but they don't seem to cover our situation.

"What are some dos/don'ts for soothing a freaked out cat?","<p>Say a cat was freaked out by something. It could be a dream, a scary window critter, an unpleasant sound, or something unknown.</p>

<p>Given that the cat is now freaked out but the cause itself is gone or negligible, is there any way to let the cat know it need not be afraid anymore?</p>

<p>This is just speculation but might it be possible through behavior, sounds, or actions to facilitate a quicker recovery?</p>

<p>I have one cat who, when freaked out by who knows what, will come to whatever room I'm in, sit up in a compact manner (tail wrapped, legs close) and watch the door. My initial reaction would be to pet him but I feel that isn't actually going to help since he desires the high alert state for the time being (affection doesn't make you safer). What I then usually do is simply walk out of the room with him in tow trying to locate the source of the freakout. Often I am led from the rear to wherever he initially came from and I sort of just touch things and look around while talking to him quietly. After that he usually starts to poke around himself and moves on.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about other ways that this could be done or other things I could do. I think I'm doing a pretty good job with the above approach but any other information would be great.</p>

There's no way we could carry the dog down a rope escape ladder.</p>

<p>I've thought about using a rope through her harness to lower her to the ground, but I don't feel confident that her walking harness would stay on if she struggles while being lowered (and I'm certain she's going to struggle when we try to push her out an open window while the fire alarms are blaring and the room is filling with smoke). </p>

<p>Although she usually does sleep in her crate, I don't think it would fit through the window without folding it, or that it would stand up to being lowered by rope, so lowering her in her crate is probably not an option.</p>

<p>Is there a harness that would be secure, but is also quick and easy to put on in an emergency? Is there some better way to safely get a dog out a 3rd floor window and safely to the ground in an emergency? </p>

"Growing black stain in a dog's lower eyelid","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>I have a 2.5 years old male, mixed breed dog. We believe his ancestry is mainly cocker spaniel, with a fair amount of poodle and maybe some other thing.</p>

<p>He is in general good health, he is quite obedient, he runs a lot (he runs off-leash by the bike every day) and he is a happy dog. His eyes has always been the source of slight concern though. A year ago, in the mornings, he sometimes had mild red eyes that seems to be a bit itchy. Both eyes were typically of similar concern. It seems to have been mainly resolved now. One time, very early, when he was only 9 weeks, he got a weird eye infection, during which the left eye was red and quite severely swollen (I posted <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/15142/eyeball-going-crazy-in-a-cockapoo"">this</a> when this issue happened). He typically have a little bit of dry eye crap in the morning but it is not much to other dogs I've seen.</p>

<p>Is this black stain is of medical concern or is it just a harmless patch of melanin? Should I bring the dog to a vet?</p>

"Can Bettas have lazy personalities?","<p>I had a betta a few years ago who was the most active, happy fish I've ever seen. He enjoyed hide-and-seek, watched me work at my desk, and constantly swam around his 5 gallon tank. He was a strong swimmer, a big eater, and lived a relatively good, long life. </p>

<p>A few months ago, I decided to pick up betta-keeping again, expecting similar results. I re-did all my research again to make sure I gave him the best environment, but he's a weak, lethargic little dude. I don't know if I've done something wrong, or if he's old, it's his personality... you name it. </p>

<p>Here's Odahviing's tank specs: </p>

<ul>
<li>5 gal, carbon filtered tank (I have to turn the filter way, way down, because he has a hard time swimming in any sort of current, so the filter is more of a dribble). </li>
<li>Heat maintained around 76-78 F</li>
<li>Decor: 2 moss balls, 1 zebra plant and 1 madagascar lace plant (my plants thrive and I make sure to remove spent leaves), 1 fake log, black sand bottom. </li>
<li>25-50% water change every 2-3 weeks, treated with conditioner. I test pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, etc. levels generally each change. All are appropriate, except ammonia is slightly higher than 0 (just barely). </li>
<li>Fed betta pellets 2x/day, 3 in the am, 2 in the pm. </li>
</ul>

<p>About a month ago, I moved him to my desk, where I spend a lot of my time when I'm home. He seemed to get a little more chipper, being closer to the action, but only a little bit. He spends more and more of his time lying still in the plant leaves, since they're big enough to support him, or sitting at the bottom of the tank. He does occasionally take a lap or two around the tank, and still enjoys chasing falling food pellets (he prefers chasing them to the bottom than to eating them at the top). He does eat less now, and much slower. </p>

<p>Maybe I'm a paranoid fish owner, but I'm always worried he's sick and/or dying. Any advice on why my fish is so slow, weak, and lethargic? Is he just really lazy? </p>

"Identifying non-physical neglect in dogs by observation","<p>Let's say there is a dog that has shelter and food and water, physically very healthy, friendly towards people (at least some), physically not abused, but never receiving attention from a human beyond feeding (no walking, playing, socialization, no contact outside of feeding, etc.). Imagine, say, a dog locked in a room, yard, shed, that is given food and water and space to move around but nothing else. I actually have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Informally (or formally) does this qualify as abuse of some type? If so, what is it usually called? The term ""neglect"", in official channels, seems to connote physical neglect rather than not meeting the social and psychological needs of a dog (""that dog is neglected"" -> ""no it's not, it's got food and shelter and is in great shape""). The phrase ""emotional neglect"", fair or not, always seems to immediately trigger eye-rolling in discussions with folks who don't take the issue as seriously as I'd like.</p></li>
<li><p>If so, what are the typical signs and behavioral patterns of a dog in a situation where they are physically treated well but never given serious attention? Can I identify these animals with long term observation? Are there definite red flags that indicate a very high likelihood that this is happening?</p></li>

<p>They have always taken their dogs for walks at least twice daily, but are concerned that this might become increasingly difficult over the next several years.  They also have a large, fenced yard with plenty of room for a dog to run.  Of course, a fenced yard does not provide the dog with the chance to ""get the news of the neighborhood"", so to speak.  (At least I've been told that this is basically what they're doing when they sniff at things when out on walks.)</p>

<p>Should I try separating the two for a bit? Or should we just put them in the house/apartment together and let them work things out on their own? I think my cat would adjust fairly quickly, but I don't really know.</p>

"My dog has adenocarcinoma. Is a heating pad not good?","<p>My dog was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. X-rays were done and showed cancer spread to lungs. He was given about 6 months to live at the time.</p>

<p>He's about 14 years old no and the original diagnosis was a little over 2 years ago!</p>

<p>He looks like a mess now. Mass keeps growing and it takes up a sizable portion of his insides. He's still relatively happy. Wags his tail, barks when he wants food. His mobility has gone down and he sleeps a lot more.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he rests, he'll lay up against a hard surface on his right side. I figured this gave him a little relief from the pressure of the mass.</p>

<p>I placed a small heating pad place on low in his dog bed. I put a double wrapped bath towel over it. I monitored the temp and turned it off after about an hour. He loved it!  </p>

"Luxating patella in Chihuahua?","<p>Ever since my Chihuahua was a puppy, he constantly switches back legs when running. Some times, he runs on all fours. Other times, he will run on 3 legs, always keeping one back leg off the ground. When he does this, it is never the same leg, and some times he switches. He never shows any signs of discomfort or yelps that might indicate pain. We even took him to the vet when he was young and they checked his knees and they did not detect anything. They said smaller breed dogs may do this ""just because they can get away with it."" However, I was doing some reading today and came across <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(dog)"" rel=""nofollow"">this link on wikipedia</a> about luxating patella. It states</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chihuahuas are also known for luxating patella, a genetic condition
  that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the
  patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is
  created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways.
  The knee cap sliding across the bony ridges of the femur can cause
  some pain. <strong>The affected chihuahua will hold its leg flexed, and foot
  off the ground until the quadriceps muscle relaxes and lengthens,
  after which the animal feels no discomfort and continues with
  activity</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis my own. This seems to describe what occurs. But he doesn't have any issue walking, and like I mentioned no indication of pain. Did my vet know what he was talking about? Or should I be concerned?</p>

"Dog threw up white foam","<p>My dog threw up white foam.  This isn't the first time and it doesn't happen often, but she has thrown up this white foam before.</p>

<p>I assume she sometimes swallows parts of her toys because she tears them to shreds.  She always eats normally, the same amount each day and doesn't act as if she is sick.</p>

<p>Is this just normal behavior for a dog to sometimes throw up white foam or is there possible a more serious issue that I should be concerned about, such as a bad bacteria, worms, etc.? Is my dog trying to tell me something by throwing up???</p>

<p>Note: she has done this since I've had her (4 years old now) and she visited the vet in the past year for a check up with nothing wrong.  </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I took my dog to the vet yesterday bc I noticed blood in her poop (about 2 weeks after this post) and it turns out she had some type of stomach virus.  It cost about $180 for the vet visit and medications, but they gave her some antibiotic shots and some pills that I have to give her. So for the record: blood in poop = bad.</p>

"Clicker training -- to pause or not to pause?","<p>I am reading ""Fired up, frantic and freaked out"" by Laura VanArdendonk Baugh.</p>

<p>On page 23 she describes the clicking process as the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click</p></li>
<li><p>Pause</p></li>
<li><p>Move the treat hand</p></li>
<li><p>Deliver</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what's with this ""pause"" step? </p>

<p>I've been doing clicker training for a while now (and I think it's working) but I am doing it on the premise that I have to deliver the treat within 3 seconds of the click in order for the dog to make the connection. And the sooner the better so: better deliver the treat immediately after the click (that's probably within one second).</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are there any clicker training experts or preferably someone with an
  animal behaviourist degree out there who can tell me if this pause
  step in the book is a typo? </p>

"Cat stubbornly keeps repeating behaviour she's not supposed to do (and knows)","<p>I have a set of furniture for my tv and dvds that my cat recently has discovered as something fun to climb on. For that she needs to start from the window-frame, jump behind the curtain and get on a closet.</p>

<p>I don't want her to climb on it, because she could cause damage by chewing, or throwing dvds on the ground, damaging the boxes and scratching the dvds.</p>

<p>I make it very clear that she's not allowed to climb the furniture set, by firmly saying 'no!' (and body language) and grabbing her by the neck and taking her off the furniture, if she persists. This usually works, as shouting or standing up from the couch normally makes her turn back. But sometimes she just rushes forward to reach as much as she can, before I have time to react.</p>

"Why do people have pets?","<p>As a skeptic and someone that never had a pet, all I see in pets are creatures that are very needy and you have to look after, take care when sick, sometimes with expensive procedures, and are a burden if you have to stay away for any time longer than a few hours. </p>

<p>That said, the furthest to a conclusion I reached for the answer to ""why people have pets?"" is that pets, mostly dogs, somewhat resemble the reaction that people that love or care about you have with you, although that's arguably instinctive. For example: a Dog seems happy when he see the owner, just like a girlfriend or family member does. And that is usually taken by people as a reason to bound. Other more simple explanation is that pets are cute and we like to have them around.</p>

<p>So is there any scientific explanation to why people have pets?</p>

"Is it possible and/or cruel to encourage a hamster to be more awake during the evening?","<p>We were considering a small pet for our family when, out of the blue, someone offered us a 6-month old Syrian hamster. The owner felt that their children weren't paying the pet enough attention, and was worried she (the hamster) might be bored and unstimulated due to lack of contact.</p>

<p>So we have an unexpected hamster. Her name is Luna.</p>

<p>We knew that hamsters were nocturnal, of course. But we just assumed that they slept for 8-10 hours through the middle of the day and would be awake at dawn and dusk. Luna seems to sleep an awful lot: she's asleep when we get up between 7-8am. Occasionally she half-wakes and grabs a snack, then sits in her nest with her eyes closed to eat it. She doesn't start to stir until 7pm and she's not properly awake until 8-9pm.</p>

<p>Our children are not that old, and they're both in bed before 9pm. So they don't get to see very much of Luna at all. My wife and I go to see her, give her some fresh food and water and some interaction before we go to bed. But that's not much stimulation for her. The kids are a bit sad they can't play with their new pet, and I'm worried she's going to lack attention with us as much as she did in her previous home.</p>

<p>We could wake her up, but it seems cruel. And we read somewhere that hamsters tend to bite if they're disturbed from their sleep.</p>

<p>It must be said that she doesn't seem bored. We've seen no evidence of repetitive behaviours and all the signs are she's very active at night - her cage is often trashed in the morning!</p>

<p>So, is it possible to encourage or train a hamster to have more periods of activity during the evening? And perhaps more importantly, if it is, is it cruel to do so? If it is ok, how should be we best go about it? Or do we have to accept she'll spend most of our time with us asleep?</p>

"Add Fish or Corals first in a mixed reef setup","<p>I'm hoping there is more science to this than just opinion, because of reasons livestock can cause certain things like phosphates or alkalinity to rise and fall but... I would actually prefer some first hand experience on people's own experiences. When should I introduce my first frags?

"Cat dropping food in her water","<p>This is one I haven't seen before: our cat (about 18 months old, rescued from the street before 6 months old) always wants to be sure there is food floating in her water bowl before she drinks from it. If the water is clear, then without fail she very intentionally switches to her food bowl, takes 3-4 pieces in her mouth, and goes back to her water bowl to drop them in. (She ignores this ritual with other water sources, such as the toilet when someone forgets to leave the lid down...)</p>

<p>The pieces of food gradually soak up water, deteriorate, and make it rather unappealling — from a human point of view. What's the appeal to her? To clarify, we're not concerned, just curious.</p>

<p>One hypothesis so far is that she just likes the taste of her food and wants to flavour her water. But I gather that taste doesn't play a huge role in a cat's diet. Another one is that she isn't sure about the water level and wants some ""buoys"" floating in it to better gauge it. If so, she's a pretty weird cat, considering they don't all do this!</p>

<p>What are your ideas?</p>

<p>She sleeps on the floor instead of my bed now. 
She no longer has an interest in running out the front door when someone comes in. 
We brought in a carrier of another cat, could the smell of that cat be the cause for this behaviour? 
We haven't been able to get her wet food in a week and she's constantly meowing for it. Could the lack of wet food be the cause? 
Her behaviour has also changed quite a bit. We've had her for 3 months although she is 3 years old. Domestic short hair.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crate training is a new concept for many, but is a very effective training tool for adult dogs and puppies. It may take a little time and effort to train your dog to use the crate, but it can prove useful in a variety of situations. For instance, if you have a new dog or puppy, a crate is a fantastic way of teaching it the boundaries of the house and keeping it safe. When you’re travelling in the car, visiting the vet or any other time you may need to confine your dog (eg. after surgery or if it has been injured), it’s much easier and safer if your dog has been trained to enjoy being in a crate.</p>

"How can I help my colleague train her dog to behave in the workplace?","<p>I work in a small office of eight people, one of whom bought a Cockapoo puppy a year ago. In the main it's a great set-up (for Twiglet and us), but recently we've been having some problems that we're finding difficult to solve, made worse by some people in the office not being 'dog people'.</p>

<p>Twiglet's a sweet dog, quite small, with a wonderful attitude towards people and other dogs. He's not hyper but he has a lot of energy which he uses up playing and running in the park next door to our offices, which various people from the company walk him in throughout the day. When he's in the office someone will often sit and play with him for a while, hiding treats or toys and getting him to find them, teaching him tricks, etc. I know that problems of understimulation are associated with having dogs in a work environment, but I really think he's doing okay on that front.</p>

<p>THE PROBLEMS</p>

<p>Most people in the office love having him around and interacting with him but recently he's been displaying two behaviours more and more: jumping up for attention and unbearable whining when either his owner, Jacky, or a man called Ed to whom he has developed an inexplicable attachment, leaves the room even to go to the toilet.</p>

<p>PROBLEM #1</p>

<p>I think I understand the causes of the first problem: some people love him jumping up and encourage it by hugging and petting him. We have made it clear in the office that it is not to be allowed, and in the main he has been getting better. But there is one woman, who is NOT a dog person at all, who just doesn't get it, and who, by pushing him down quite strongly whenever he jumps up, makes it much worse by exciting him. I just can't get through to her politely what she must do in order to get him to stop. She just can't help it: she's quite well strung. I sympathise but I just don't know what to do. If she can't join in with the rest of us in not rewarding him with attention when he jumps up, I don't things are going to change. In the meantime this lady and the rest of us are very tense and nervous, as she can't sense him coming and he gives her a terrible fright. She is quite elderly, perhaps not in years (I think she's less than seventy) but a little frail.</p>

<p>PROBLEM #2 </p>

<p>Despite being happy in the office and being great friends with the rest of us, Twiglet only really has eyes for Jacky (owner) and Ed (friend). Whenever one of them shows signs of leaving the room, as indeed they have to, often at the same time, for work reasons, or just to go to the toilet, Twiglet goes a bit mad. He whines, often developing into barks, runs around the office, looking out of windows... it's a bit hard to deal with. What should we do when this happens? Should we try to ignore him? Usually we sit with him and try to calm him down by stroking him, or getting him to do tricks like Paw or Lie Down, which distracts him slightly. But I worry that this is rewarding the behaviour with attention. However, is it behaviour that is the problem, or an emotional state? ANY advice on this would be very helpful.</p>

<p>QUESTIONS IN BRIEF</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How to deal with the following situation: training a dog not to jump up at people while they're working when one of those people doesn't understand or appreciate the importance of ignoring the dog. She simply reacts quickly and to an extent violently by pushing him down, which gets him excited and leads to more jumping. Very tense situation all round.</p></li>

"When is it safe to add fish?","<p>I have a 50-gallon wide tank and all associated materials.  On November 1st, my tank had tap water chemistry (meaning 0 ammonia, 0 everything); I had just set up my tank.</p>

<p>I added Stress Zyme by API and stress coat to dechlorinate and dechloramine the water.  It also added beneficial bacteria - I have driftwood, slate, and moss in my tank.  I have marbles on top of my gravel.</p>

<p>At two weeks after set-up (Nov. 14) and adding 30 drops of ammonium chloride weekly, the tank has 0.5 ppm ammonia, no nitrites, and 40ppm nitrate.  Is my tank done cycling?  Should I add more ammonia? I added a rotala plant two days ago.</p>

"Will my pet get sick drinking from the toilet?","<p>Many houses have a room with a large white bowl that is regularly refilled with fresh water.  The door is open unless the room is occupied.  The bowl holds much more water than any water dish.  Unlike the water dish, the bowl is refilled several times a day with cool water.  If you are a big dog or an agile cat, what is not to like about this fancy porcelain bowl?</p>

<p>From the pet perspective, a toilet bowl has a lot to offer for drinking water options.  Given the places their tongues go and the things they eat, the toilet is not as dirty a place as a person might imagine.</p>

<p>Assuming a toilet has water coming from a fresh water supply (without additives) and the bowl is cleaned regularly, is it safe for a pet to drink from the toilet?  Are there any studies or research linking drinking water from the toilet bowl to health issues in pets?  </p>

"What breeds of dog are known for handling separation anxiety well?","<p>My wife and I are looking for a dog, preferably a larger breed of dog such as a Siberian Husky or German Shepherd. The problem that I am having with the situation is that my wife and I both live an hour away from work. That means we are both away from home 10 hours a day and work the same schedule. </p>

<p>Is there a breed of dog that would be okay with this type of separation? My wife is not convinced that it would be a bad idea for a dog; however, I am thinking that a dog just would not fit our work schedule.</p>

<p>I am hoping my question is not too opinion-based or too broad, so my question breaks down to whether factual information exists regarding which dog breeds better handle being alone for long periods of time.  Also, is separation anxiety gender-related?</p>

<p>I'm hearing mixed things, so not sure what to start her on.
Apparently she hasn't lost or put on weight since this pic 12 days ago. In this pic she is 8 months pregnant.</p>

<p>I had been intending to start her small amounts of biomare and slowly increase it. I've found out it contains grains, which are not particularly helpful and want to make up a diet for her. </p>

<p>Also Australian pasture is high in iron and our horses, generally, need supplementation in Copper and zinc.</p>

<p>I'm also going to worm ALL the horses with a equimec plus tape. The farrier will come and trim them all. I'll get the vet to check her teeth, the dentist won't be around for 6 months.</p>

"Best way to interrupt a cockatiel's brooding","<p>I am preparing for an international move with my cockatiel.  The bird started brooding and laying eggs about two weeks before the travel date.  It is a 5 year old bird and it is the first time this happens.</p>

<p>Right now she sits on her (infertile) eggs all day long and only comes out of the nest box about twice a day, and only for a short period of time which she spends eating ferociously.  While in the box, she is aggressive.</p>

<p>Because of the travel I must interrupt her brooding somehow.  What is the best way to do this?</p>

<p>The only thing I could think of: I can simply move her to a different cage when she comes out, and never let her back to her eggs. I do not know if the shock this would cause is harmful. I tried taking her to another room when she came out to eat last time. After a few minutes she got very nervous and chirpy, and wanted to go straight back to the box.  Eventually I <em>do need</em> to move her into a different cage for travel ...</p>

"Yellow Hawaiian Tang Bullying and Killing Everything in the Tank!","<p>A little info about my tank, I have various soft reef, beginner reefs. The tank is 55 gallons in size. A couple months ago I bought a Yellow Tang. Upon purchase the Tang was an adolescent. I also bought a Coral Beauty the same day. In the tank at the time, there were around 30 snails and 20 hermit crabs, along with 3 or 4 Emerald crabs; a Scooter Blenny. The Tang and Coral Beauty fought over territory and ended up becoming friends within the first week. The Coral Beauty died weeks later by somehow swimming into the power jet. </p>

<p>Present day - the Tang and the Blenny still remain. They get along. I have attempted introducing several fish, 2 Lawnmower Blennys and a Six Line Wrasse. The Yellow Tang has killed every new fish I have introduced in the tank. I have also caught him killing snails and eating hermit crabs after pulling them out of the shell. There are some peppermint shrimp on the list too. </p>

"How can I know how healthy my turtle's shell is?","<p>Recently while giving my turtle some shell scratching I noticed I could press the plastron (bottom part of shell) and carapace (top part of shell) down closer to each other. This mostly only happens at the extremities of the shell near the head and tail, but it got me worried about whether my turtle's shell is healthy and whether this should be happening. </p>

<p>My turtle has about 6 hours of partial Sunlight exposure through the day with accessible basking spots. I feed it daily, a diet of mixed pellets, worms, chicken, shrimp, and the veggies I have though it doesn't eat much of that. The pellets I use all have calcium, and I do leave cuttlebone floating around in the water, though I'm not sure the turtle shows interest. I also made it some food which is basically mixed pellets with chicken and some veggies, as well as crushed cuttlebone. The turtle is about 3-3.2 inches in shell length and has no signs of pyramiding. </p>

"How to clean (disinfect) my dog everyday after walk?","<p>To give you some perspective, my dog and I go for a walk, every morning (~ 45 min) and evening (~ 30 min).</p>

<p>We don't have any grounds nearby (only fields <sup><strong>(1)</strong></sup>) which means I have to walk him on streets with shrubs and small plans along the sides. There are a number of stray dogs and many people walk their dogs along the same route too. What this means is that there's fresh urine on almost every other plant <sup><strong>(2)</strong></sup> and mine inevitably ends up with urine all over his body <sup><strong>(3)</strong></sup>.</p>

<p>As you may know many dangerous diseases, e.g. Ebola, are introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. This means that not only my dog, but also my entire family, especially me <sup><strong>(4)</strong></sup>, could be in danger.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to clean him up after everyday walks without damaging/harming his coat and skin. Shampooing is not an option as it results in dry skin. (Bathing him with just water doesn't disinfect him. Will a towel bath with Dettol be good enough? Will it introduce any side effects? I don't know.)</p>

"Dogsitting: 2-year-old dog refuses to pee outside, then deliberately pees inside","<p>I dogsit sometimes and just took on a new client yesterday. She's a mostly sweet two-year-old poodle, except for the peeing (and sometimes pooping) inside thing.</p>

<p>I've now walked her three times:</p>

<p>First time: 45 minute walk about 4 hours after she was dropped off, she doesn't pee or poo (she had already pooped inside right after arriving.) Get inside and she has dinner then wants to play, then while playing squats down and just starts peeing... while jumping around. Ok, maybe put that one down to over-excitement... if it hadn't kept happening.</p>

<p>Second time: Another 45 minute walk, she does poo late into the walk and then I stand with her in my back-yard for an extra 10 minutes waiting for her to pee. Get back inside, she goes to her dog bed and lays down... then as I'm watching she gets up and squats down to pee in/around her bed.</p>

<p>Third time: Just walked her for over an hour, no pee or poo... so tied her up in the back-yard and stood there waiting over half an hour for her to go. Still nothing... right now I've just got her ""locked"" in the kitchen since the linoleum is a little easier to clean.</p>

<p>I just don't understand this though, every other dog I've ever owned/watched pees immediately when going outside... especially in the morning! It doesn't seem like a medical issue... she's not having trouble controlling her bladder. She goes hours just fine, and even asks to go out when one might expect it's time for her to potty. No accidents overnight even. It's just that when we walk, she seems to think she should potty inside after the walk...</p>

<p>Any ideas why a dog would act like this? Or how to correct her behavior?</p>

"Should I add water to wet food to provide extra hydration?","<p>I haven't seen my kitten-cats drinking much water lately.  While they get hydration from their wet food, I'm not sure if it's necessarily enough for optimal health.</p>

<p>I'm considering just adding a bit of tap water to their wet food to make it a tad more wet, but I'm not sure if that'd be helpful, or if it might cause the food to spoil too fast.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

"Why is one of my male dogs drinking my other male dog's pee?","<p>Ive seen different versions of this question on here, but its usually male and female dogs - not dogs of the same gender. I'm curious if this is related pheromones or due to increased exercise (or whatever else people think is the reason). </p>

<p>I have a malamute/German-shepard and a lab/boxer/pit mix. The malamute rather aggressively drinks my lab-mix's pee every time they go outside to the bathroom. Literally laps it up mid stream and doesn't stop until my lab-mix stops peeing. Both are males, both are neutered. He doesn't drink excessive amounts of water either.</p>

<p>Both of these dogs get a stupid amount of exercise. The malamute gets 10-15 miles of running a day and both dogs chase me all day while backcountry skiing a few days a week. They are very well loved. They both get joint supplements and are free-fed. The malamute's appetite is usually good. He eats around 6-10 cups of food depending our activity for the day and is very lean at 104lbs. </p>

<p>What do you think is going on? Is this actually a pheromone deal, maybe he is trying to get electrolytes? Should I be concerned?</p>

"Older kitten feeding schedule","<p>My SO and I recently adopted a pair of six month old kittens, and we're trying to work out how much to feed them.  (We have an older cat, but she's not relevant here, yet.)</p>

<p>Currently, we're feeding them a half cup of dry kibble four times a day (total: 2 cups), with occasional canned wet food.  When we feed them, they both gobble it all down quite happily (every last piece of kibble), and a few hours later are mewing at us for more.  It's extremely rare for them to actually leave any food behind.</p>

<p>Should we be feeding them more (within reason), to the point that they seem to have sufficient food?  Should we just ignore the mewing for more feeding?  Experiment to see how much they actually want?  We don't want them to become overweight, but we don't want to keep them constantly hungry, either.</p>

"Kitten behaving strangely","<p>We have a 10 week old kitten that I recently adopted at the age of 6 weeks. Since we adopted him he's been sick quite a lot including ringworm, diaria and lately he has contracted some sort of virus that caused a very high fever on and off - for this he spent almost a week hospitalized with an IV drip. 
During the time he was being treated for the virus the kitten started acting a bit weird - doing things he never did before and vise versa.
For example he would cry asking for food (and look excited to receive it) but after we gave it to him he would sniff it a little bit and walk away not eating anything (and this is food he adored before he got sick). 
Also he used to drink a lot of water from the sink along with our other cat (it was their thing) but now he isn't interested in it at all.</p>

<p>Currently he is still on antibiotics to fight the virus but has generally recovered. Since he stopped eating we tried all sorts of foods but the only food he'll eat now is fancy feast - and even then he's picky with the flavors.</p>

<p>The doctors are saying that generally he's fine now, but are still in the dark regarding this strange behavior. Having said that I should mention that one of that doctors aids stated that it <em>might</em> be FIP (The most fatal cat disease ever) since some of the symptoms are strange behavior, but they can't really be certain until things get really bad or they don't.. So now I'm worried sick that he might be dying :(</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered this type of behavior with their cats? Or maybe know what can be causing it? </p>

"The genetics of catnip susceptibility","<p>In doing a little looking around, I found three different answers to the question: What percent of cats are susceptible to catnip?</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href=""http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/cats/tips/catnip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Humane Society</a> says ""an estimated 50 percent""</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-how-does-catnip-work-on-cats/"" rel=""nofollow"">Scientific American</a> says ""about 70 to 80 percent""</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.cat-world.com.au/all-about-catnip"" rel=""nofollow"">Cat World</a> says ""around 50–66%""</li>
</ul>

<p>Each source carefully notes the figure as an estimate.  None of them cite any sources or give any explanation beyond the figures coming from ""experts.""  (You'd think someone would take a poll, but that's not my point)</p>

<p>I recall hearing many years ago that the gene for catnip sensitivity followed a simple <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)"" rel=""nofollow"">dominant-recessive</a> pattern.  Similar to Mendel's peas, in a well-mixed population, you'll have the pairs RR, Rr, rR, and rr - only 25% (the rr group) will not express the trait, the other 75% will.  That would lend support to Scientific American's numbers.</p>

<p>However, if the genes that cause catnip sensitivity exhibit some form of co-dominance, like human blood groups, then the percentages can skew.</p>

<p>So my question comes down to:  What hard-science exists to explain the variation in sensitivity to catnip among cats?  Have there been any long-term breeding experiments?  Has that portion of the feline genome been explored at all?</p>

"Low Quality Dog Food - What are the risks?","<p>I have an 11 year old Lab.  I have a friend that has a 15 year old lab.  I have another friend who put his 8 year old lab down.</p>

<p>Based upon the following experience I have a question.</p>

<p>The oldest lab, 15 years, has had a natural diet all it's life.  Some cooked meat, some raw meat, pumpkin and green beans. Every once in awhile it would get dog food but very rarely.  This dog is healthy.  Lots of grey hair but very chipper, good weight.  Trots to get balls, there is no more full sprint ball retrieval but this dog stays active.</p>

<p>The eleven year old is in pretty good shape but is beginning to fade.  Some dogfood (upscale, whattever that means), pumpkin and green beans.  Get's cooked chicken and fish remnants.</p>

<p>The 9 year old ate nothing but off the shelf grocery store dogfood.  Whattever was handy.  Poor guy had many tumors and cancer in it's intestinal tract.  Recently euthanized.</p>

<p>It seems that some of the dogs in my life that have been given a more healthy diet are experiencing greater longevity.  The owner of the 15 year old said, ""no dogfood for my dogs.  Only real food.  </p>

<p>There is obviously not enough information to make a determination regarding the wellness of the dogs and their diet.  </p>

<p><strong><em>So my questions are</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>What are the risks of feeding my dog standard off the shelf dog food?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the benefits to feeding a dog a diet of regular real food rather than processed food?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any studies or correlations of data to support one way or the other having a difference on the health of any pet?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There were some incidents a few years ago of a Chinese food manufacturer putting melanin in their food and it was sold in the US.  The results were horrific and there were quite a few deaths of pets.  I can't help but to think that in other processed foods there is harmful compounds that may not kill your pet in the short term but will effect it's health long term regarding various cancers or other malaise that could have an effect on longevity.</p>

<p>I have two cats, and <em>one</em> of them is what I would call an&hellip; <em>aggressive eater.</em> He's always been that way. I took him in as a young stray born of a feral parents, but I managed to domesticate him to be one of the sweetest cats you will ever know. </p>

<p>But feeding times brings out his posturing, and meals are consumed with a constant growling under his breath and guarded glances towards his happily-feeding companion like someone is going to take away his last meal for awhile. Of course that never happens; there is plenty for all. </p>

<p>My thinking was that teaching them to eat together would be a useful part of his social domestication&hellip; but a year later without success, I'm wondering if the potential sense of well-being is worth the stress of something he may never overcome. It has never escalated into anything physical &mdash; the other cat basically ignores him &mdash; and they get along famously in every other way. </p>

"Can biting in pet mice be non agressive?","<p>I bought a pet fancy mouse three months ago. He was six months old at the time, so fairly young and not well socialized. I've spent a lot of time with him, getting him used to being handled and around people. Just like my last mouse, he did nip me a little bit and I taught him that nipping was not alright. The behavior disappeared and now I have a pretty good relationship with him. He willingly climbs onto my hand and even when I let him out to play in his playpen he still loves to come and climb all over me.</p>

Additionally, he is very slow and methodical with his teeth.

I've been trying to discourage the behavior, but he seems intent on continuing.</p>

<li><p>Knowing a bit about how a particular dog will communicate is useful too. Spending time with him/her (as mentioned in comments) can help here, but if nothing else it can be reassuring to know that what appears to be an ""Oh god I'm dying""-type whine might only be a  way of saying ""I'd like to go out"" or ""I'm bored and would like attention"".</p></li>

"How late can I train my cats to let me sleep in?","<p>I have a pair of 6-month-old kittens. About a month ago, they decided that their day should begin before 4am. (Note that they have dry food available all the time, and get some wet at the beginning and end of the day.) Prior to that, serenading was heard more like 5:30am. So, I've been <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferber_method"" rel=""nofollow"">'ferberizing'</a>(*) them -- I go to sleep with earplugs in place, and I don't open the door and let them into the bedroom until I'm ready. After about two weeks of this, the first serious serenade usually comes along at 5:20am. So, what's a reasonable ambition here? Should I just decide that 5:30am is the start of the cat day, at least for now? Or would further struggle result in relative quiet until 6:00am?</p>

<p>Based on the answers so far, I think a bit of elaboration is in order.</p>

<p>This is not my first trip to the cat rodeo; I am well aware that a closed door is a moral insult to the average domestic cat. However, we've never owned a cat who was prepared to be a polite 'midnight visitor' -- whether it's playing hockey with items on dressers or licking exposed ears. In the past, household geometry permitted a division of territory into cat vs. person that put the evil <em>door</em> far enough away from our bedroom that any complaining was not a big issue.</p>

<p>Thus, the initial yes-or-no character of this question: ""Is it reasonable to think that they will learn that companionship and canned cat food will only arrive at time X, and so it's not worth the effort to make a fuss earlier?""</p>

<p>As of when I'm writing this addendum, we have a pair of answers: ""Yes"" and ""Maybe (depending on their motivations, and here are some other strategies, and maybe canned cat food first thing is not such a brilliant plan.)""</p>

<p>A finding of 'No' leads either towards a reconsideration of household geometry options, or an exploration of how to leave the bedroom door open at night without serving as a 2am trampoline (a subject for another question).</p>

<p>(*) Note that we are not literally following ferber by trying to gradually increase the amount of time; in the case at hand, I'm pretty sure that this would only serve to teach them that endurance is a winning strategy.</p>

<p>Every time we leave the mother cat alone outside when we check on here the light orange tabby usually comes. It just started today. It always runs away from us. How do I make it know that I am not going to hurt them?</p>

"My dog doesn't like people of a certain race. What can I do?","<p>We got a Black Labrador when he was five years old, and he's been a really wonderful dog in the years we've had him. Normally he barks to let us know when people have arrived at our front door, but calms down quickly when we let them in and is very friendly to our guests.</p>

<p>A week ago, my Asian friend, whom my dog had never met, came by to pick something up. As soon as my dog saw him in the window, he went absolutely ballistic in a way that I had never seen before. He would not stop barking at my friend when he came in, but fortunately he did not try to bite. My friend didn't think anything of it and tried petting him (my dog tried to avoid it), but I was absolutely mortified that he was behaving so angrily towards my friend. It was a short visit and my dog was on edge for a while afterwards.</p>

<p>I had kind of forgotten the incident until I was walking my dog and we passed an Asian man I didn't know. My dog also went crazy over him and I had to drag him away. My area has very few Asians living in it, so this is a rarity. I wondered if my dog was reacting to their appearance, especially given that in both cases it's very unlikely he smelled anything. </p>

<p>Since I don't know anything about my dog's early life, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he's not ""racist"", but rather has an understandable reason for this reaction, such as a very negative experience with someone who is Asian. He hadn't really been exposed to them since living with me, so there was no chance to get acclimated.</p>

<p>What can I do to help my dog overcome this strong reaction to Asian men? Would having my friend spend time with him (or just be present at my house more often) be enough?</p>

"Dog anxious inside, calm outside","<p>We got a dog a few days ago. He's a 1 year old Chesapeake Bay/Lab mix according to the vet. He was found abandoned in the country, rescued, made it to us eventually. He's not yet neutered, we're going to change that. He starts obedience school in two weeks, but he already knows some commands (come, sit, paw, down). He's crate trained as well. He gets at least one, sometimes two, long walks every day and we have a decent sized yard.</p>

<p>When he's outside in the yard he's calm. He'll happily play, or lay in the sun or shade, or just watch the cars go by. He barks sometimes, but when told not to he listens. Outside he's fantastic.</p>

<p>Inside is a different story. When he's inside he's always pacing and panting excessively, sometimes he whines. He's unable to settle down. Sometimes he comes over and throws his weight against me (which I have a lot of trouble with). He's also taken to chasing the cats, which we're trying to nip in the bud.</p>

<p>There are a few factors I can see contributing to this, but I'm not sure how to help still. </p>

<ol>
<li>We have a cat and a kitten. The cat frequently will hiss, growl, or otherwise voice his displeasure any time he sees the dog. This seems to rile up the dog. The kitten is more afraid of him and the dog has pinned him down and cornered him a few times. We want to make sure the cats aren't injured. I can see how the cats can be a stress point for him.</li>
<li>My husband is far from being a dog person. He's willing to tell the dog ""No"" or ""Back"" and defend the cats but that is the limit of his dog interaction. Having a person around he isn't allowed to interact with also seems to make him stressed. </li>
<li>He can't really see out any of the windows inside. This is a combination of the height of the windows and the furniture arrangement. I've been trying to rearrange furniture to give him window access but so far he does not seem interested. I'm not sure how big of a factor this is.</li>
<li>He doesn't have a ton of time at the moment. A filled bone, a kong, two small stuffed animals, an ""unstuffed"" squeaky animal, tennis ball, and tug rope. I'm very open to getting him more toys, I'm just not sure what to get him and how many he should have.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know we haven't had him very long, and things will get better when we start obedience classes; but I'd really like to make his inside-life better in the meantime if I can.</p>

<p>What can I do to make him feel more comfortable inside? Does anyone have advice on training him that I am his human and my husband is not? </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Dog is calm outside of house but stressed and anxious inside. How can I help him?</p>

"Male cat is attacking female cat when he sees/smells another cat","<p>I'm currently experiencing behavioral problems in my male cat that has escalated over the approximate year since they started. </p>

<p>Fable is a 4 year old male, and Twitch is one month younger. They've been together since ages 12 weeks and 8 weeks, were adopted within a few days of each other from the same shelter but different rooms, and were fixed and declawed at 5-6 months about a week or so apart. They get along really well, will often groom each other, play, and sleep together. Sometimes play can get a little rough and she'll hiss or growl at him to signal she's done and he'll quit after a few warnings.</p>

<p>The cats are indoor cats, but we have a fully screened in porch so we often leave the door to it open for them. There's several cats that come roaming around onto our property, and if they get too close to the porch, Fable gets extremely territorial.</p>

<p>The first instance about a year ago a male stray came up to say hi to them through the screen door, and Fable muscled his way between Twitch and the stray. He didn't do anything aggressive to her, but seemed very clearly to be guarding her. The next time it happened was when he started hitting her. Since then, it has escalated to him hitting her more, chasing her through the house, pinning her down and biting (though no injuries), and the past two times she has urinated in fright.</p>

<p>We're able to stop Fable just by grabbing him by the scruff and holding him still for a few moments, and Twitch will take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours to calm down before she's back to her self, which we consider a reasonably quick recovery. After this everything goes back to normal for a few weeks until another cat gets too close to the porch. </p>

<p>My theory is that when he smells another cat, it overwhelms his senses and he no longer recognizes Twitch by smell, so he attacks her because she's a cat. This is possible because he hit her once before after she came home from being fixed and she smelled like the vet and drugs instead of herself. My mom thinks he's just lashing out at her to chase her away from the other cat because he can't attack and chase away the cat on the other side of the screen so he's trying to separate them by any means necessary. However these are both just guesses to try to describe the scenario better.</p>

<p>I'm looking for possible solutions to this problem. </p>

<p>We're considering locking up at sunset, as most of these incidents happen after dark, but that only avoids the problem and can also be frustrating for everyone because they won't understand why they can't go onto the porch when they could before. </p>

<p>We've tried scaring off the cats with yelling and even throwing things in their direction to no avail, and we don't want to put out anything scent-deterring in case it bothers our cats or any of the forest animals near our property.</p>

<p>We don't want to put either cat on medication. </p>

<p>As far as I know, punishment after the fact is useless, since Fable won't understand if we punish him after he calms down, and if we punish him while he's in a fight mood, he might escalate the situation with us.</p>

<p>They are well exercised for house cats. They play several times a day both with each other and alone with their toys, and we throw treats across the house for Fable to chase instead of handing him them. We don't believe he is pent up.</p>

<p>We don't have any family members or friends with cats, so we can't have anyone bring a cat by to try to get him accustomed to strangers and we're not even sure that would work. </p>

<p>Are there any training methods to handle this kind of aggression? Can we train him somehow to not go into a fight mode when he sees/smells an unfamiliar cat? Or is the only option to avoid the situation entirely? </p>

"How can I get my cat to like me?","<p>I have a five year old cat named Binx. I've had him since birth. I also have two other cats that are his sisters. Only four years old. Binx has never really been a cuddly, passionate cat until about two years ago when he started giving all of his attention to my dad. My dad dislikes cats- although he doesn't mind Binx. But Binx loves him! He goes crazy once he gets home from work. He'll follow him around the house, lay on his chest, knead him and purr like crazy. He doesn't do any of this with me. I feed him and play with him so I always thought he'd be somewhat close to me but he's not. He doesn't care to be around me. He's had crystals for almost his whole life and every time he's gotten them I'm around and I'm the one to take him to the vet so I'm unsure if he's associating me with these bad moments? </p>

"How to minimize litter being tracked out of a custom litter box?","<p><strong><em>tl;dr</em>-</strong>  I'm making a litter box and I want to design it in a way that prevents cats from tracking much litter out of it.  How could this be done?</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm designing a do-it-yourself litter box because normal litter boxes aren't quite sanitary enough.</p>

<p>I have two main complaints:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I can't stand the smell of cat litter or cat leavings.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't like how litter can track when cats come out of a litter box.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, my solution's basically this (don't do this at home, may not be safe/correct, etc.):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Get a big plastic box, e.g. <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00GP74TOU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this 25-gallon Rubbermaid storage container</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut a hole in a side of the box and insert a cat door, e.g. <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B075S9ZVGN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Some commercial cat boxes already have doors, though these doors tend to let air through on purpose.  This design intentionally seeks a more air-tight door, so I figure I'll use one designed as a pet door for a house.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cut two more holes in the top/upper-side of it and run air tubes with low-noise blower fans.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B075333HWM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This 4-inch fan</a> is rated 47 CFM (ft^3/min) with 25dB at 9W.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00EPE3XHY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This 4-inch tubing and clamps</a> to go with the fan.</p></li>
<li><p>Probably some sort of screen or/and filter to keep bugs out and kittens in.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mount a block of wood in a window sill.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The block'll basically prevent the window from fully closing; instead, the window'll close on it.</p></li>
<li><p>The block'll have two 4-inch holes in it on either side for connecting the tubes.</p></li>
<li><p>The two 4-inch holes would be on opposite sides of the window to help minimize out-going air being drawn back in.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Connect litter box to window with tubes&amp;blowers to continuously vent the litter box's internal air with fresh air.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I suspect that this should pretty much cover the smell part.  If too much of the litter stench still gets through the litter box's door, I might have a second-stage box that's also vented with separate tubes.</p>

<p>All that said, there's still the problem of the cats tracking litter.  How can this be addressed?</p>

<p>Current ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Actually do the second-stage box, then put a litter mat in it.</p>

<ul>
<li>However, I already have litter mats outside of my current litter boxes, but some litter's still getting tracked out anyway.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Have the cats climb down into the litter box area such that they have to climb up to get back out.</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe the climbing-out process will help clean the litter off?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Narrow corridor into the litter box with web-like matting.</p>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps this would brush the cats off as they climb into/out-of the litter box?</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there another way a litter box like this might be designed to minimize litter tracking?</p>

"My dog bit a puppy","<p>I have a 3.5 year old female Labrador.I have had her since she was 8 weeks old.She is extremely friendly when we meet other people and dogs.I have been taking her to a dog park for a few months now and spend about an hour every day at the dog park.She usually gets other dogs to chase her with a stick in her mouth.I am always supervising her play at the park.If she doesn't like a dog behavior (mainly humping) she will let them know politely 2-3 times and then I usually intervene and make sure that dog leaves her alone before she snaps.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after about 45min at the dog park, I took her to my friend's place to meet their new puppy ( 12 weeks Akita male). I have met the puppy before and he is very calm and relaxed.My dog was excited to see the pup.This was the pup's first encounter with a dog socially(other than the vet and walks). My dog picked a toy and wanted to play tug with the pup.The pup was happy too and at that point, they seemed to get along well.They went to the yard to play.My friend was supervising them.I was inside talking to my friend.After a couple of minutes of play, the pup started whelping in pain.I didn't punish my dog at that time.I am not exactly sure what happened.</p>

<p>The pup has 2 bites on the ear, 1 on the muzzle and 1 on the jaw.There was some blood.The pup was scared for quite some time.</p>

<p>What steps should I take to make sure my dog doesn't do something like this ever again.I know I should have been supervising them play and probably introduced them slowly in a confined space.Should I not take my dog to the dog park? Does that make her more aggressive? She knows she is not supposed to bite humans, I have tried inculcating the bite inhibition from puppyhood.She is very gentle with kids.</p>

<p>I am really sad that this happened and want to make sure that I train her positively to not do it again.But I am not sure what that entails.Would really appreciate some advice and suggestions.</p>

"Cat Sub-Q Ringer's Solution: Not DPHV Free?","<p>I received a donation or 4 bags of Hospira Brand Ringer's Solution (1000 ml each) and they say that they are not DPHV-free. My cat is in Stage 3 kidney disease. Is it too dangerous to trust this type of solution for even a few weeks? He must have 150 ml per day.</p>

<p>The bags have already reached their expiration dates. Two were ""expired"" on Jan 1, 2018, and the other two were expired 2 weeks ago on Feb 1, 2018. The entire plastic quality is not clear like with some other brands bags, but the color is the same for the entire bag, not just where the solution is stored. Solution looks ""clear"" and not cloudy or darker than the plastic. Probably not as dark as the plastic.</p>

<p>I was told when given these bags that the bags should be used within the next 4 weeks.</p>

<p>What do I do? There is a scarcity of Ringer's Solution/IV bags right now due to the hurricane in Puerto Rico that disabled the facilities that provide most of these products to the USA. Each bag is going for $16 each in my area.</p>

"How much fur does a cat shed?","<p>Is there any known estimate of the total mass of fur shed by a cat over a year? I can find some anecdotal estimates that full regrowth can be achieved over 8 to 12 weeks, but that does not give me any answer with regards to the actual mass.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some precisions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The answer certainly depends on the cat size but also type of hair, and environment. Cat owners easily observe that shed amounts vary depending on, for instance, current temperature (the animal gets a lighter fur in summer, and denser in winter). It is possible that the growth rate varies with temperature. As such, there cannot be a simple answer valid for all cats, but that does not mean that the question is unanswerable, only that the answer will consist in multiple data points. It's like a question about the height of a human: not all humans have the same height, but it is not totally meaningless to talk of averages.</p></li>
<li><p>Cats are neither photosynthetic nor nuclear-powered. As such, the carbon atoms found in the fur keratin can only come from their food intake (excluding water). Basically, if a cat east 200g of food per day, then it cannot shed more than 200g of fur per day on average, or 73 kg over a year. But I really expect the figure to be a lot lower than that.</p></li>
<li><p>I find unsubstantiated claims that an average cat may have 20 to 40 millions of hair, with an average thickness of about 20µm, and can grow back a complete coat in ""8 to 12 weeks"" (if shaved). Assuming an average length of 4 cm per hair, and that hair density is close to that of water, then the total fur weight (under these assumptions) would be 250 to 500g and the beast could produce such an amount 5 times per year, leading to a total of up to 2.5 kg over a year.</p>

<p>This estimate is based on totally unscientific figures that could be off by a large amount. Moreover, if the growth rate varies depending on conditions, then chances are that a fully-shaved cat will have a higher growth rate, and a non-shaved cat will settle for a lower growth rate and thus shedding amount.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, I am trying to find some better sources for data so as to get at least ballpark numbers. Basically, are we talking about 100g, 1kg, 10kg per year or so?</p>

"My cat is afraid of me and plays aggressively","<p>I recently adopted a 1 and a half months cat.</p>

<p>He was very calm and friendly when i first brought him home and he would sleep on everyone's lap.
So i took him to the vet to get him checked and make sure he's Ok.
The vet diagnosed him with a disease which he said he's got it from his mother.
So i had to apply an eye drop to his eyes every six hours or he could lose his eyes.
He didn't like it at all. I had to force him to sit stable so i could apply the eye drop.</p>

<p>Since then, he is almost always afraid of people and me(unless he's sleepy), he never sits on lap, never purrs and plays really aggressively and bites and scratches.When someone is approaching him, he puffs his tail and runs away(most of the time).</p>

<p>He's now at 2 months and a half of age.
So my question here is, is he ever going to go back normal and show some affection and be nice , or will he remain this way? Should i rehome him or is he scared of all people?
What should i do to make him trust me again?
What should i avoid doing?
Thank you and sorry for the length of this question.</p>

"How high a PSL is considered normal in cats with no other symptoms of pancreatitis?","<p>My cat recently had a blood test that includes measuring PSL (pancreas serum level? lipase?).  This was a broader senior-cat panel, <em>not</em> an fPLI.

(I haven't seen the report yet; my vet was reading this to me over the phone.)</p>

<p>What they don't say is what's considered ""moderately high"".  With a normal range going up to 26 (I don't know the units either), do they mean not to worry about 30? 50? 100?</p>

"How can I mark my own territory and communicate this to my pet rabbit?","<p>So we got a holland lop rabbit a few weeks ago second hand from another couple. 
He's been great so far, but I've been reading online about communicating with my rabbit by mimicking his own behavior, such as communicating insult by walking up to him, taking a step back, then turning my back on him, similar to what he does to me when i do something he doesn't like and he demands an apology in this way.</p>

<p>I also read that rabbits understand territory in 3 categories, their own personal space shared with a mate and only close personal friends - public space, shared by all, and territory owned by someone else. 
I wonder, how can I mark my own territory (such as my bedroom) so he will understand this is my territory, and be less likely to wander in there and get in to things. 
Rabbits mark by peeing or pooping, I'm certainly not going to take a dump on my carpet.. lol - so how can I mark my territory in a way he'll understand and respect? it's easy to be a human about it, consistently remove him from a room etc.. and he'll eventually learn ""if i go in there, I'm gonna get kicked out, so i wont go in there"" - but I want to do it in a way where his natural instincts kick in and tell him ""this is someone else's territory"" - If i can get that point across by marking it as my own in a way he understands, coupled with normal training techniques (removing him from the room) he'll get the point </p>

<p>does anyone have any advice? I've actually had some success curbing annoying behavior be acting insulted like he does to me, but I'd really like to learn more about the territory stuff</p>

Loves, people, and other dogs when were out on walks. We recently had the opportunity to rescue a female pug between 2 and 4 years old. She has an elongated soft palate, so she is a little louder when breathing and she can be quite 'bossy' or 'dominant' around the younger pup, even though she's new to the house. As a result, the puppy seems quite scared of her. Drops toys if she comes near, will back away if she comes near, just generally seems a little freaked when she is around.

"Why would a cat ask to play all the time and how to satisfy her?","<p>I have a quite energetic, 1.5 year old female cat, who used to live outside until 6 months old. </p>

<p>We get along nicely, and I try to have play sessions with her 2-3 times a day for at least 5 minutes - it's usually two 5-minute and two 10-minute sessions every day. I have to note that these are not on a fixed schedule; the cat does not know when to expect playtime at all, and a couple of times per month there might be a day with no play sessions at all.</p>

<p><em>The thing is - no matter how much she plays, it never seems to be enough for her</em>! This makes me a little skeptical: </p>

<p><strong>Is she getting the fun, exercise and stimulation she needs?</strong> <strong>Can there be other reasons why a cat would like to play much more than usual?</strong></p>

<p>There already is quality and variety in her playtime, so I doubt that new toys are the answer here. Is it possible at all that a new kitten in the household would help her? Could she just be lonely and looking for ways to spend more time with me? Any other ideas what this behaviour could indicate?</p>

<p>Here's some more info on her playing and asking-for-play behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I often alternate between toys from session to session, give her challenges, encourage her to run around chasing the toy and the such. She also likes to play hide-and-seek and peek-a-boo, although string toys are her favorite. She loves it all (sometimes she even purrs while playing). Most of the play sessions are very energetic. </p></li>
<li><p>I've never seen the slightest indication that she gets tired when playing. Sometimes she hides and waits for the moment the toy is not moving before attacking, but I believe that's just good hunting technique she learned while outside, not an indication of tiredness.</p></li>
<li><p>The more often I play with her, the more playtime she's going to ask for. If I don't play with her for a couple of days, she might not ask at all, although she'll still engage joyfully as soon as I grab a toy.</p></li>
<li><p>How she asks for playtime: Trying to lure me to the living room when I'm not there by meowing expectantly, coming to my door then running away, showing/bringing me a toy, rubbing on my legs to get my attention before making play gestures with her paws, lying on her back while playing with an imaginary toy hanging above her.</p></li>
<li><p>She does not get aggressive when not played with, and is not
aggressive in general. She never breaks things or attacks clothes/furniture or other items.</p></li>
<li><p>She always respects my privacy; won't wake me up at all, won't bother me again if she's tried and I'm busy. Will only try to call out for me a couple of times and stop if she fails.</p></li>
<li><p>Playing is the activity we spend the most time together on: she does like to be petted, but less frequently than your average house-cat, and does not usually like to be held.</p></li>

"Would flying stress my cats more than driving?","<p>In a few months I will be moving across the US with 2 cats (The female is introverted and will slink away to hide when the unexpected happens. The male is a lot more outgoing, but can be unexpectedly skittish.)</p>

<p>At the moment I am debating between flying and driving them.  My assumption of the pro's and cons of each type of trip are:</p>

<p><strong>Fly</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pro: Shorter duration: 2 flights over 7 hours</li>
<li>Con: Higher stress environment: noisy, bustling airports and planes</li>
<li>Con: Once the trip starts, it cannot be stopped.</li>
<li>Con: More expensive: Need 1 booked person and $125 per cat</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Drive</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pro: Lower stress: It's just like a really long trip to the vet</li>
<li>Pro: Can take a time out from traveling if needed.</li>
<li>Pro: Cheaper: Just Gas and hotel rooms</li>
<li>Con: A much longer duration: 26 hours of driving spread over 3 days</li>
</ul>

<p>My assumption is that the driving will suck for me (but I have the time to do it), but will be better for the cats (they can better handle the lower level but longer duration stress).  </p>

<p>Is this a valid assumption about the levels of stress of each type of trip, and in general how cats react to such stress?</p>

<p>Note that while <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/5641/13984"">Travelling with cat by plane</a> is great for tips on that mode of transportation, my question is more about comparing flying with driving.</p>

"Losing Fish Though Levels Test Fine","<p>We have a 40 gallon tank with an established Nitrogen Cycle.  We went several months with just 1 Three-Striped Cory and 3 Gold Dust Mollies.  </p>

<p>The tank has its own filter that came with it, rated for its size, a heater, gravel substrate, 3 large rocks, a piece of driftwood and half a dozen or so live plants.</p>

"Limping cat - bone tumor?","<p>One of my cats unexpectedly started limping about 2 weeks ago.  She was fine one day, then the next day she was heavily limping on her left hind leg and within another day or so she would not even attempt to step on it, simply jumping on one hind leg keeping the other close to her belly. If it's important, she is around 12-13 years old (she's a rescue so nobody really knows for sure).</p>

<p>As it was Christmas, it was impossible to get to the vet on the day, so I took her to a vet as soon a I could a couple of days later. They did an x-ray and afterwards the vet told me that from the x-ray it's most likely that she had a torn ligament in her knee.  I took the cat home along with a 2 weeks' worth of anti-inflamatory medication. They said a surgery could be considered but only after the cat would loose some weight. Otherwise, just give her a lot of peace and quite, make sure she doesn't need to jump/run/etc - and it would heal on its own over a period of a couple of months or maybe a bit more.</p>

<p>A few days later I got a phone call from the vet that they were reviewing the x-rays again with another vet and that other vet commented that there may be a bit of bone loss in her leg, which means that she's got a bone tumor and her leg would need to be amputated to spare her constant pain. The vet emphasised that such tumor is usually benign.</p>

<p>Now, this doesn't seem to add up for me. If it were a bone loss caused by bone tumor, it would be gradual; instead the limping came on abruptly: everything was perfectly fine one day and she was not stepping on the leg the next day. Also, she doesn't seem at all to be in pain.  Her behaviour hasn't changed other than less movement.  She is still happily eating and drinking.</p>

<p>I'm taking her to the vet again tomorrow - they want to do a biopsy of the tissue.  Yet, I'm now suspicious about the whole thing.  Obviously, if there's no other way to save the cat, we'll go for the amputation, but I don't want to do it just because ""whatever"". The vet stated it almost in passing, the same way I would state that I need to buy some cat food.</p>

<p>My question is: how likely is this really to be a bone loss due to tumor vs. what else can it be? Even if this is a tumor, is there any way to avoid amputating the leg?</p>

<p>In regards to her weight, for her size, the ideal weight is about 5 kg. She is currently 6.7 kg. She was abused early in her life, then taken away from her owner by RSPCA and I adopted her from RSPCA. When I brought her home, she was under 3 kg.  Despite trying to control her diet, she quickly gained weight (she'd go outside and catch mice or birds and eat them) and got to 8.5 kg within a year.  We've managed to loose about 2 kg since then.

"training a dog to herd","<p>I am interested to learn how to train a dog (of course of specific breeds) to herd (ducks, other animals). Is there a guide, book, or research results available? I already made a cursory search in google. The popular search results are wikihow and blogposts. I am looking for a more scientific approach, hence I am asking if anyone knows research papers, or journals, or books.</p>

<p>I am interested to know what methods are used to train: </p>

<ol>
<li>Are dogs given commands, rewards?</li>
<li>During the training process, are dogs shown a demonstration? (which they can imitate later?)</li>
<li>Or are dogs 'left to figure it out'? (and given a series of punishment/rewards for tasks that are not done/completed)</li>
</ol>

<p>Any definitive sources are well appreciated! </p>

"What substrate/base should I use for this small fish pond?","<p>I have bought a property that has a tiny decorative pond with waterfall and sizeable filter.  It looks as though a larger pond use to be in its place. </p>

"Why does my cat only bite my partner?","<p>My girlfriend and I have a 1 year old (or slightly younger) orange tabby that we adopted a little over a month ago. He is a good, easy-going cat overall, but he sometimes bites my girlfriend, either on the hand or face, for seemingly doing nothing. She’ll be petting him and he’ll want to bite her hand. Or, he will willingly come to HER while we’re laying in bed, cuddle, be loving, and then bites her face hard. He NEVER does this with me. </p>

<p>I should point out that I work from home, so I spend the most time with him. I feed him, I clean out his litter, I play with him. She will occasionally play with him and pet him when she comes home. </p>

<p>I was thinking maybe this is the reason why he bites only her. She has recently started to feed him and give him his treats whenever she is home but, so far he is still biting. Almost every day. I hope she just needs to continue to feed him and play with him for his behavior to change (We just started, afterall) But I worry it may be something else? Anybody have ideas or suggestions? </p>

"Can rabbits eat banana leaves?","<p>A <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/a/23469/13"">recent answer</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>as an alternative source of fiber, you can also give your rabbit banana leaves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did a quick google search and found a few blog posts by house rabbit parents who have feed their bunnies banana leaves. A couple of posts suggest that it should be limited do to high levels of some thing that may not be good for rabbits.</p>

<p>When I looked for scientific references I found a diet with 40% banana leaves can be feed for 105 days without adverse effects.  But this is for production rabbits not pet rabbits.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract : An experiment is described in which 40 rabbits, 12 weeks old, were fed on diets containing 0, 20, 40 or 60% banana leaves (DM basis) for 105 days. Growth rate was highest for 40% banana leaves while DM intake was reduced on 60% banana leaves. It is suggested that rabbits can be fed up to 40% banana leaves without adverse effects on growth, feed intake and physiology. <a href=""https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20003035319"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a></p>

<p>Clearly they can eat some banana leaves, but is at a healthy form of fiber in the long term (<em>8-12 years</em>)? Do banana leaves contain any substances that should be moderated? </p>

"Neighbourhood cat claiming our home as her territory","<p>I live in a neighbourhood which is inhabited by a fairly large number of cats. One in particular, a smokey grey female around 3-4 years old, is <em>very</em> friendly, to the point where she casually strolls into mine and other neighbours' home without much care for other pets. She also gets along well with other neighbourhood cats, she was on good terms with my cat and they'd often playfully chase each other around.</p>

<p>Sadly we lost our cat to a road collision at the beginning of December. The regular visits and attention-seeking from this smokey grey cat played a huge part in helping us to grieve and feel better over the Christmas period. However, I'm starting to feel that she's starting to make herself a bit <em>too</em> welcome in our home. We let her in for about 5-10 minutes at a time, during which she's rubbing her head against any corner she can find (claiming the house as her own), and wanting a big fuss from us. Whenever we return home she hears the jingle of our keys and immediately rushes to our door.</p>

<p>We're currently looking to rehome a new cat (not her, we know where she lives and who her owners are :) ) and we're very unsure as to how any new cat would react to this neighbourhood cat inviting herself in. We'd be keeping any new cat away from the front door, we wouldn't be letting him/her outside until s/he's settled in and willing to return home. However it's inevitable that the two will meet indoors at some point, so should we start to discourage her from marking her scent in our house? Or should we use a gentle introduction plan for her and our new cat?</p>

"Suggestions for a leash reactive dog who reacts to random people","<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for helping my dog get over her leash reactivity towards people? My newly adopted rescue dog gets triggered by dogs and people on walks. We've been working on this for a couple months, and she's slowly getting better about dogs (she can almost always handle them across the street now) but seems to be getting worse about people.</p>

<p>The thing is, she's fine with about 95% of people, and then will randomly get stiff at random people. If she were just reactive towards people with hats, or elderly asian folks or bald men or something, it would be easy...get her around a bunch of those folks, and show her they're good. However, it seems completely unpredictable who she'll react to. She reacts to people equally across all genders, colors and atire. She's a bit more reactive near our apartment, but other than that there's no discernible pattern. I fear my strategy of asking her to sit, sweet talking her and giving her treats when a person approaches might actually be contributing to her people reactivity since because I can't find a pattern, I do this for all people, even though she likely won't react to them.</p>

<p>Any ideas for helping my dog who's only reactive to occasional random people?</p>

<p>EDIT: By reactive towards people/dogs I mean:While I'm holding the leash and walking her posture will stiffen. She then lunges at them barking loudly and without pause. When her posture stiffens she'll stop responding to my 'look' command that she follows very well when not triggered. She'll sometimes sit if i ask her while she's lunging and barking, but she'll still bark aggressively</p>

"How to know 2 day old puppies are getting enough milk?","<p>So my dog, a 5 year old German Shepherd, had 8 puppies 2 days ago. She delivered normally and, from the little that I know, they all seemed healthy. They were crying right after birth, and all.of them manoeuvred their way to suck milk.<br>
But since then (48hrs) we have noticed that the puppies sleeping a bit too much compared to their first day. We felt like something was wrong so we checked our dog to see if nipples were producing milk properly and we found that on pressing them only the last two (near the hind legs)  released very little milk, and the rest released nothing. Also we saw in some other dogs the milk sacs are usually very swollen after birth but for my dog only the last two are swollen and the rest are very little if not completely flat. 
Is this normal for German shepherds?  And if not then should we consider dog formula milk for the puppies? Also is the formula milk safe and healthy for the pups?<br>
How do we tell if the puppies are healthy and feeding properly? </p>

<p>Honestly I'm really worried and would appreciate your inputs!!</p>

<p>P.S.: my vet is out of town for Easter holidays and won't be back for the next four days so yeah really need your advice for now! </p>

"How do I get my dog to stop eating, literally, everything?","<p>I have a pure-bred Catahoula dog. He is 80lbs and just turned 1yr old. I can't give him bedding because he eats it. He literally eats everything his bedding (he pooped out the bedding all over the yard, his rope toys, he eats them (can't give those to him any more), I even tried a tough rubber mat for him to lay on - nope,  he ate part of it before I took it away.</p>

<p>He eats regularly his dog food, he gets plenty of water and regular exercise. He isn't alone because I have another dog that he also plays with, as well as 2 cats (such a happy blended family that I have). But I can't get him to stop eating Everything. I can't turn my back for even one minute - it is getting to be too much. Lately I have had 2 episodes where there was explosive diarrhoea from his crate - he sleeps in there. It is more like a giant pen - but I can't trust him out in the house overnight not to eat things, so I put him in his pen overnight, as well as my other dog- she goes into her crate too (so they are both treated the same) but he loves her crate, he sleeps, and naps in his pen during the day too when he is out and about - so I don't think it has anything to do with that. What do I do?</p>

<p>We walk him 2x a day, we take him for hikes a few times a week as well, we play with him daily. What more could it be? He poops random objects. He has torn apart all of his toys, we have gotten the big king toys to chew on and put treats inside for him to play with for a while. I know this is like a run on, but I want you to know that I have done almost everything I can think of to keep him from eating anything that is in his sight.</p>

"Testing for external factors contributing to a cat's loss, keeping other cat safe","<p><em>Very</em> long story, as short as possible (intro first, questions at bottom):</p>

<p>Two cats. In <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/16406/987"">mid-February</a> cat C (female, indoor, 3 yr, spayed), presented with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thick, excessive drooling.</li>
<li>Mild appetite loss.</li>
<li>Constipation (somewhere between moderate and severe).</li>
</ul>

<p>Cat C also has a lifetime history of snoring / noisy breathing from the sinus area, mild eye discharge, and heavy water consumption, but generally appears healthy and active.</p>

<p>Around that same time cat V had a very, very small, odd, brown discharge from the corner of his mouth (he was always prone to drooling, having an overbite), which at first I thought was a bit of food but it kept returning after cleaning (however, he was also due for dental work and was exhibiting signs of dental problems, eating from the side in particular). Cats were isolated, cat V appeared to recover, with the discharge discontinuing within a week. Cat C was taken in for dental worth, signs of mild gum infection noticed, teeth cleaned, given <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/16467/can-i-crush-baytril-pills"">antibiotics</a> for 2 weeks. Condition cleared up, cause of constipation remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Also starting around that time cat V (male, indoor, 16 yr, neutered):</p>

<ul>
<li>Appetite began decreasing, slowly at first. Then stopped eating entirely about 2.5 weeks ago.</li>
<li>About 2 weeks ago presented with symptoms highly resembling lymphoma:

<ul>
<li>Enlarged lymph node (3.5 cm)</li>
<li>Slightly enlarged spleen.</li>
<li>Severe anemia (lack of rbc production determined).</li>
<li>Unusual (but inconclusive) size distribution of lymphocytes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>V became jaundiced then his calcium levels suddenly plummeted last week and, sadly, there were no remaining options and we decided to put him down.</li>
<li>We were never able to get a positive lab confirmation of a cancer (three lymphatic samples and a spleen sample via needle aspirate + lots of bloodwork, V was not stable enough for a biopsy) although it remained high on our theory list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cat V has a history of IBD since January, but otherwise healthy with no signs of liver or kidney problems, no signs of pancreatitis, no signs of diabetes. He had a mild heart murmor and mild HCM since birth, inconsequential. V had become severely hypokalemic and had a benign but rare aldosterone-secreting adrenal tumor <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/16031/feline-hyperaldosteronism-conns-disease-alternative-treatment-options"">successfully removed</a> in January and made a full recovery, we determined his IBD had been masked by the tumor's released hormones. His liver was slightly enlarged but recovered after the tumor was removed. He was on 5mg prednisolone daily and biweekly B12 injections since. V also had poor coat regrowth since last August (possibly explained by tumor or vitamin deficiencies) and his black coat was turning orange since December (which we explained through salivary staining but could have other factors). We were 99.99999% confident that his lymphoma[-like] illness, even if cancer, was not directly related to the previous adrenal tumor.</p>

<p>Now, Cat C's appetite has fluctuated greatly in the past 2 weeks (mild - moderate appetite loss) as has her activity level (ranging from mild lethargy to normal), but there are too many variables to know if it is significant: Loss of other cat, the weather has been significantly warmer (and the presence of potentially disease-carrying flying insects adds more potential complications to this whole thing as well), my own stress/anxiety/depression regarding loss of other pet, etc. I do not know if it is cause for concern or not.</p>

<p>Both cats received yearly rabies and feline distemper vaccines, and C was negative for FIV in 2014. Both cats are indoor and have not been outside in at least 3 years.</p>

<p>Additionally, around March, I began <em>noticing</em> water quality problems in my apartment (sharp rise in amount of unknown sediment in water), but it's highly possible, especially after talking to neighbors, that the water here has never been that great. Inaccurate home test kits revealed no interesting info except for a <em>slightly</em> elevated copper level that was still well below the EPA guidelines for humans. I switched both cats (and myself) to bottled water.</p>

<p>I am leaving out a lot for brevity.</p>

<p>My concern now is for both the safety of cat C as well as any other cats that I may bring into the house in the future. <strong>I have no idea if C's mystery illness was linked to V's mystery illness, and I have no idea if water quality is related to any of this, and I have no idea what is relevant vs. noise.</strong> It's a complete mystery all around. The dots are not connected.</p>

<p>What this all boils down to is:</p>

<hr>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Communicable Diseases: C is going to the vet this week to get tested to see if she is a carrier for FeLV, FIV, FIP, and feline distemper. <strong>Given her mystery illness and the two month timeline and hypothesizing that there is a link to V's condition, what else should I have her tested for?</strong> Is there any communicable disease that could cause drooling, appetite loss, and constipation on initial infection, with the potential to become asymptomatic in some cats, that can also lead to anemia / severe inflammatory response, or greatly increase the risk of a cancer?</p></li>
<li><p>Chronic Toxicity: I haven't sent my water to a proper lab. <strong>Ignoring C's illness, given V's decline, and hypothesizing that chronic exposure to something in the water over a period of up to 3 years is linked to V's condition, what could do this and what should I test for? Are there signs of exposure I can look for in C?</strong> From my research, copper, zinc, aluminum seem to be on the top of my list. Unfortunately we never took any samples from V's liver since it wasn't showing any signs of inflammation and the bile ducts were clear on ultrasound, so it's not possible to know if he was accumulating any minerals or heavy metals. It's my understanding that we can also take hair samples from C to look for accumulation of toxic substances. Note, however, that it has been almost 2 months since I took both cats off the tap water. However, long term exposure, or V's sensitivity due to his age or perhaps his IBD, could have made him more sensitive, or it was too late to prevent any damage.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The whole situation has been incredibly complicated, with many factors whose relations, if any, remain unclear, and many occurrences with multiple reasonable explanations. </p>

"New cat only licks sauce / gravy from wet food and ignores the chunks, but eats dry food without issues","<p>My girlfriend and I adopted a shelter cat, unknown age, but we were told she was rather old (10 to 17 years?). Was very shy in the beginning and hid under the bed or in my wardrobe. But purred when petted. Now she has fully accepted us as their servants, always comming and sitting on our laps when we return from work and get comfortable on the couch. She's not hiding anymore and roams the flat freely. Hopefully we can let her out into the garden soon.</p>

<p>Her eating habits are rather un-cat-ish though:
She eats very little, most of the food goes to the trashcan when her bowls (yes several, we don't really know what food she was used to) are renewed.
She eats dry food, we see her eating from it, and sometimes we can hear her munching when we are in bed.
She drinks water sufficiently.
From the wet food she only licks sauce / gravy and ignores the chunks (maybe she eats a few chunks, but merely as a by-product of gravy-licking)
(Maybe I should write a letter to whiskas asking for a bucket of their gravy.)</p>

"Why is my cat so attached to me? Is there anything wrong?","<p>I have three cats. My oldest is fifteen years old, and lately I've noticed that he's beginning to get really attached to me. On an abnormal level. </p>

<p>It began when we moved. Previous to moving, the cat had definitely preferred me, but nothing out of the ordinary. When we moved for the first time in his life, I put him on my bed and sat with him until he felt ready to explore the house. We stayed in that house for a year, and I noticed that he preferred to stay on the bed more than usual during that time. </p>

<p>We moved again a year later, and I put him on my bed again and sat with him. His behavior increased so that now he sleeps almost nowhere but the bed, and constantly wants me to sit on the bed with him, so that he can lie on me. He's become more and more persistent about this over time. </p>

<p>Previous to moving, the cat had liked to sit on/sleep with me in bed. Nothing abnormal. But now it is at the level where he wants to do it constantly. There is no exaggeration. Constantly. If I don't sit on the bed, he will sit on it and meow loudly at me (remember I'm sitting right there at my computer), until one of us gives in. If he gives up, he will go down the hall meowing loudly, and come back later. He seems content if I put him on my lap while I work, but this is difficult for me to do, as I need to type. </p>

<p>Additionally, the cat shows worrying signs if I'm gone for more than a day. Usually this is just meowing as he looks for me and ultimately sleeping, but recently I was gone for three days, coming back only in the evening and leaving early the next day. The cat quickly lost weight, and I believe he stayed in my room the entire time. He seemed perfectly normal, otherwise. </p>

<p><strong>Why is my cat acting this way? Is it something I should be worried about?</strong> </p>

<p><em>Additional details:</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>My cat has a hyper thyroid condition, which has always caused him to vomit/regurgitate a lot. He is on a medication for it (and has been for over a year), which was working, but now doesn't seem to be having quite as much effect. The reason I mention this is because he vomited a lot the first two days I was gone (this is NOT abnormal). This might be why he lost weight... but he hasn't lost that much before when vomiting. All the vomit was in my room, which is why I think he stayed there. (The medication is not to blame; he's been on it for a year) </li>
<li>My cat has dry itchy skin which is causing him to pull out his fur, which has caused us to put a soft cone on him. He's been wearing cones for a year, and seems completely unaware of and unaffected by them. </li>
<li>The behavior described above is not new. It's been there for the majority of my cat's life. It is simply now more exaggerated than it has ever been. This change was gradual, and not sudden. </li>
<li>I do not believe this is a fear issue. The cat moves around the house freely, often sleeping under the dining room table or on the living room floor. Sometimes he sleeps in my mother's office, as she is usually the one who feeds him. He generally tries to sit on my bed with me first though. </li>
<li>I live with my family, so there are other people and two other cats for him to interact with. There is plenty of food, and he is eating fine. </li>

"Am I causing two cats to fight?","<p>We recently started feeding two stray cats in my apartment complex and initially they all behaved. However for the past two days one cat is trying to pick a fight and chase the other one away (the smaller one). The bigger cat is almost always near where we feed them. The smaller one actually disappeared for two days and returned yesterday where the big cat again tried to chase him up a tree and then stood there waiting at the bottom. They don't fight while eating. The bigger one typically eats faster and then goes after the smaller one. Am I causing this in some way? Are they competing over food? We usually give plenty to both of them. We used to keep a sizable bowl of dry food for them to nibble on when they are hungry again but it looked like nobody ate from it a lot and we stopped keeping that. </p>

"Nitrogen cycle for new fish tank","<p>I recently bought a fish tank. I googled about basics for setting up a fish tank. Almost every webpages help me to understand how important the nitrogen cycle is for a healthy fish tank. So I decided to learn about how to do nitrogen cycle and googled allot from the past few days. But by reading many articles, I am really getting confused about the entire cycle process and also many of the beginners like me don't know the correct process. Anyway I decided  to start cycling from this weekend with the knowledge I got from different sources. But I just need to ask you guys that the procedure am going to do is correct?. Please advice me or correct me if I am going to do this in wrong way. I just explained the cycling process am going to do in a overall view below.</p>

<p>Day 1:  I am setting up my tank with air pump, filter, heater, gravel, substrate, plants and a pH level tester. I have API ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and pH test kit and water conditioner. I will add 8 small guppies. I will feed them a little everyday which they can eat in 2 or 3 minutes. </p>

<p>Day 4: I will do 20℅water change (won't clean gravel or plants, just do top water change) without testing the ammonia level.</p>

<p>Day 8:  I will test the ammonia level first before changing water. If ammonia is below 1ppm, I will leave the water as it is without changing. If ammonia is above 1ppm,  I will do a water change by 40℅ and clean 1/4 th of the gravel or substrate and gentle clean filter.</p>

<p>Day 12: I will do 20℅water change without testing the ammonia level.</p>

<p>Day 16: I will test ammonia and nitrite levels before water change. If ammonia and nitrite levels are below 1ppm, I will leave the water as it is without changing. If the ammonia and nitrite levels are above 1ppm, I will do a 40℅ water change and will clean 1/4 th of gravel or substrate and gentle filter clean.</p>

<p>Day 20: I will do 20℅water change without testing the ammonia and nitrite level.</p>

<p>Day 24: I will test ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels before water change. If ammonia and nitrite is below 1ppm and nitrate is below 10ppm, I won't make any water change. But if ammonia or nitrite is above 1ppm, I will do a 40℅ water change and clean 1/4 th of gravel and substrate and plants and gentle filter clean. </p>

<p>And I will continue the below process in every four days till ammonia and nitrite levels reach 0ppm. </p>

<p>Continuation Process: I will test the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels before water change. If ammonia and nitrite is below 1ppm, I will leave the water without changing. If it's above 1ppm, will do 40℅ water change and clean some portion of gravel, substrate and plants. </p>

<p>I am not much aware about the nitrate test. What should I do if the nitrate level goes above 10 or 20 ppm?. Should I need to change water?. 
Is high level nitrates harmful for fish?</p>

<p>And also not aware much about the pH tester. Do I need to test pH level also along with the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate test and add pH controller agent based on the pH result?</p>

<p>Any advice will be helpful for people like me who are beginners in this hobby :)</p>

"My boyfriend's dog hate me... help! Warning! Long post","<p>OK, let me preface this by saying I have never been a dog person. I think they are cute, and enjoy playing with people's dogs at their homes, but I did not/do not want one. I'm slightly allergic to them, and far too much of a neat freak to have them. That being said, my boyfriend moved in with me about 4 months ago. His female wiener dog had been staying in the country with his mom and her male wiener dog. When we would visit my boyfriend's mom's house, Lady (his dog) would jump into his lap and stare me down while he pet her. I never paid her much mind, I knew she probably just missed him. She would sit by me and let me pet her too. </p>

<p>All of that changed when we brought her home with us. When my boyfriend asked me if he could bring her home, knowing my aversion to having dogs in my home, I asked 3 questions:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Is she potty trained? I just installed $6,000 carpet in my house.
The previous owners had let their multiple dogs use their carpet as
a urinal and the carpet had to go.</li>
<li>Does she eat underwear or shoes? This was a concern for me because I
have some very expensive shoes and I had a puppy when I was younger
that would drag out our entire hamper to eat our underwear.</li>
<li>Is she aggressive towards kids? I have a 6 year old daughter.</li>
</ol>

<p>His answers were yes - she never uses the restroom in the house, no - she never ate underwear even as a puppy, nor shoes, and no- she's very good with kids. </p>

<p>Here's my problem.... it's MY house... the dog thinks SHE owns it. Within 2 weeks of living here, she ate 4 pairs of my panties, I found them in shreds under my bed. and she peed in my carpet twice... on the floor in my room on my side of the bed only. Now, before the typical ""put your underwear in a basket"" ""pick up your panties"" comments rain down... my basket is a tall basket with a lid. She's a mini-doxen. My panties SHOULD be secure. Next comment I'm sure I'll get, ""Shut your bedroom door."" I do. My boyfriend however is bad about leaving it open despite me telling him to shut it so she doesn't eat my panties.</p>

<p>The next issue I keep running into is her possessiveness over my boyfriend, and I've noticed as of lately, it's going into possessiveness over my daughter, his son, my sister, my brother.... basically anyone that's over except for me and my mom. A friend of mine with a lot of experience with dogs said that she's staking her ""Claim."" She's trying to ""claim"" my boyfriend, the kids, basically anyone that will let her. My mom and I are both very dominate female personalities, she's never tried ""claiming"" either of us. My friend said that her eating my underwear, especially since she's not a puppy and never did it to my bf's ex-wife (who she apparently didn't like either), in addition to her peeing on the carpet on my side of the bed is a way to try to show her claim to my territory and dominance over me. My friend said that I had to show I was dominate over her. </p>

<p>I didn't believe my friend until I noticed that she'd be laying down somewhere, and if she saw me walking in the direction of my boyfriend, whether I was going to him or not, she'd dash by me and jump into the seat next to him or into his lap and stare me down. Previously during this behavior, the bf would laugh and say ""aw, she loves me."" and I would just shake my head at her and continue what I was doing. After reading about ""Small Dog Syndrome"" and ""Claiming"", I realized that was the way she was asserting dominance over me and that my friend had been right. </p>

<p>So, now when she does that, whether I'm going to sit by my bf or not, I pick her up, set her in the floor, and take my place beside my bf to show her I'm the dominate female in the house. She then ate a pair of my boyfriend's underwear on 2 separate occasions once I started asserting my dominance in the house. My friend said that she was probably mad at him for letting me ""take her spot"". She also rolls over and bears her belly to me. My bf said that it's her submitting to me, but I've read that studies show it's also a strategic move to attack and protect itself at the same time. She doesn't do this with anyone else in the house. Last week, I was trying to put her outside to pee because she had been kenneled all day from us being at work. She jumped up in the chair and stared at me, so I went to pick her up to put her outside. I did NOT pick her up around her belly... but SHE PEED ON ME!!!! I was furious! I put her outside, cleaned up, and called my boyfriend immediately. He laughed and said, ""You scared the piss out of her! She's scared of you!"" She has no reason to be scared of me. I don't hit her. I feed her, I give her water, I let her outside. But I have rules. I don't let her in the kitchen when I'm cooking unless I call her in. And I don't allow her to sniff around the table at dinner time. Also, if she hasn't had a bath recently or stinks, I don't let her on the furniture. I don't put up with begging when we eat either. And in light of her proclivity for peeing in my room and eating my panties, I have said she's not allowed in bedrooms or bathrooms. She's used to having free-reign. Now, she rolls over when I walk into the room, and pees on herself. It's been happening a lot... and quite frankly, it's driving me crazy. I want to get rid of the dog, but my boyfriend loves her. I have tried playing with her, I give her treats, I pet her/rub her belly/scratch her ears...... but nothing works... My boyfriend says ""Maybe she senses you don't like dogs."" Maybe... but I love him, so I'm really trying with her. </p>

<p>I've also been told I should lean over her when she rolls over, not on her, just over her, so that she recognizes me as the dominant female, and that while I do this, to stare her down until she looks away. I did this. It worked... but that's when the rolling over and pissing herself issue started. I know she hates me, honestly, the feeling is mutual after her acting this way, but I'm at my wits end on what to do about her.... any advice will be helpful. I'm not trying to incite a riot of ""you're mean because you don't like dogs."" comments... everybody is different, everybody has their preferences, my preference just happens to be a pet-free home. I'm really trying with this dog... she's just always been the alpha female in the house, and I don't play that game. I truly need help with what to do about this. I'm not willing to roll over for her, if you catch my meaning, just to make her easier to get along with. </p>

<p>My friend I mentioned earlier stated that we're having these issues because she has staked a claim on my bf and may consider him ""her person or her mate"" or something. She said it's common with wiener dogs... </p>

<p>Please, any constructive and helpful advice is needed. I know there's going to be some backlash on this because some people won't read what I'm really trying to get at, but please, help?</p>

"Aggressive Indian Watchdog","<p>I am from the United States. I am partnered with a friend of mine in a small industry startup in his home village in South India.</p>

<p>I visit 2-3 times each year. There is a small street dog, named Taiku, at our factory who has been adopted by the facility personnel and does a wonderful job keeping of watch over the place at night. </p>

<p>The problem is, while he is used to the locals he is always very wary of me whenever I arrive at the factory. Whether I arrive in the company car, by foot, or on the back of my partner's motorcycle, he will threaten me as soon as he observes me by holding his ground and issuing an unending guttural growl. This happens every time I arrive, every day, each time I visit. </p>

<p>I am used to making peace with aggressive dogs back home who will bark and snarl when they are trying to establish ward off intruders. However, Taiku prefers a low growl and a cold stare, which we were always taught to respect as a serious warning.</p>

<p>Foreigners don't find themselves in this village very often and he behaves this way with anyone I bring along with me. I think it is the sight of us, perhaps our white-skinned faces, rather than our scent that puts him off, as he won't necessarily behave this way around me all the time. </p>

<p>For example, when I am in the office, there is usually no drama. In fact, he is currently sitting two feet away from my feet. There was one instance when he even affectionately stood between my legs. I thought at that point maybe we had made a breakthrough. I took it easy for a moment and let him do his thing, and a couple minutes later (after I was out of the range of his jaws), I got his attention by making a gentle tounge-cluck and offering my hand for him to smell. However, once he observed my face, began growling, at which point he had to be escorted out of the office.</p>

<p>He is very persistent in his opposition to me. He will continue to growl at me even with my partner's hand holding the scruff of his neck, or even while being confronted with a raised stick by one of the staff members, (which he otherwise respect and will submit convincingly to).</p>

<p>My daily arrivals are usually a fiasco of staff members dancing between us, yelling and chasing him around with a stick. I always hold my ground and calmly proceed inside. I've never reacted in fear and he's never made good on any of his threats. I'm not particularly worried about actually getting bit, but I'm wondering if there would be a more peaceful way to arrive. </p>

<p>Has anyone experience with a dog like this? There is never any attempt to become familiar with me, just instant, persistent aggression that seems to distract him completely from everything else around him. Is there anything I can do to make peace?</p>

"How can I comfort my dog when he is dry heaving and obsessively trying to eat leaves?","<p>A couple weeks ago, my dog had an episode where he was dry-heaving for a few hours. When I let him outside he obsessively and frenetically looked for certain types of dried leaves to eat (note that he couldn't eat any grass because the ground was covered with snow).</p>

<p>About halfway through the episode, my dog succeeded in vomiting, but it didn't stop the dry-heaving nor the obsession with eating leaves.  Eventually the episode passed and he calmed down, and there were no more symptoms.</p>

<p>This has now started up again.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to ease his anxiety and help him vomit when he can't find grass in the winter time?  Does letting him out to eat grass/leaves help the vomit come sooner? After he vomits, is there anything I can do to help the dry-heaving stop sooner?</p>

"How can I prevent my dog from being a racist?","<p>My dog has an issue with other kinds of people...specifically, Indian people (Asia).   Whenever he gets close to the vicinity of Indian people, especially when we have guests in our home, he gets very angry and extremely aggressive, even if he hasn't met them before.  With other people, like Caucasians and Latinos, he will remain extremely gentle upon first meeting them.</p>

<p>It seems to be only Indian people that are causing the issue. I've read that dogs are colorblind so I don't think he's discriminating based on skin color, but I suspect it may be to the smell of some people. However, I've had friends who don't smell as strong as other Indians and he still barks at them as well. This issue is isolated just for Indians for some odd reason and I don't know what's going on with him.</p>

<p>How can I prevent my dog from being ""racist""? Is there some sort of conditioning or training I can do to make him more receptive and more pleasant to other Indians out there? </p>

"Five gallon fish tank","<p>I have a ailing Betta. The man at the aquarium store sold me some meds for fungus. I think it burnt him. Now he has fin rot. Today I took out about a gallon of water and put in fresh with Prime conditioner and a bit of aqua salt. Also added Melafix per instructions. Poor thing is almost fin less, but still swimming.</p>

<p>Now my question is, if he pulls through I will be very happy, but if he dies, what can I do about getting the tank sanitized? I read where people use bleach water, that's a no no. Acrylic tank, I used to use salt to scrub with, but don't know if this will scratch it and I would boil rocks. What about all the plants? and the decorations? This tank cost me a lot of money setting it up and would like to be able to re use it in the future, if my little buddy does not make it. I am afraid I will transfer this disease to another fish. Opinions any one?</p>

<p>I am so shocked this even happened. I had many tanks before and as well as Betas, hardly lost any fish, just started back to this hobby and this happened.</p>

"My mom's cat doesn't like my cats","<p>I have two cats, about 1.5 years old and supposed to be brothers, but don't know if that's true =)</p>

<p>My mom also has a cat, she is about 8 years old, a bit bitchy was the only cat in the household since she lives there with my mum.</p>

<p>I tried to bring them with me when I visted her, so that they can play with each other and all that stuff. But the cat of my mum really seems to dislike to idea of the presence of other cats. She hisses and snaps at them, try to hit them and mostly go out of their way and hides somewhere until they are gone.</p>

<p>I have to say, although I got the two cats way to early from the owner, because she lied about the age, and I am not the most talented one in raising cats, they behave really good when we visit the other cat. They know that there is something wrong, but they aren't intimidated by her. They bow down before her, go out of her way, apporach very slowly to show her that they mean no harm, so I don't think they can do any better.</p>

<p>We also tried to have them together for a longer period of time, e.g. nearly two weeks when I visited my mum for the christmas holiday. But nothings changed.</p>

<p>Is there any way we could improve their relationship? I know, it's the same with people, sometimes you definitely don't like someone. But it would be nice if they would get along fine, that way we could give them to someone together when we want to go for holiday or visit relatives or something like that.
Do you have any idea?</p>

"A single parakeet and an older cat - good idea?","<p>I have a single male 5 year old parakeet. He is very tame and friendly. I know he is unafraid of dogs, as I have had two wonder up to the cage and my bird has been very curious. In fact, I was more worried that he would bite their noses! The dogs acted more uninterested or a bit fearful of him. But dogs are dogs and not cats. haha. </p>

<p>I’ve had dogs all my life. My dog of 12 years passed away in 2017 and my mom (who we were still living with at the time) adopted a puppy about 3 months later. Now that we’re moved into our own place I miss that companionship of a larger animal. (My bird is great but he doesn’t like to be pet, nor can he keep my feet warm at night haha). We live in an apartment and even a small dog wouldn’t fit our lifestyle right now, but a cat would (an older, laid back cat). </p>

<p>My bird is housed in a cage that is about 24”x24”x30” give or take. His cage stands on a multipurpose kitchen roller cabinet thing (about 4 feet off the ground). We keep him in our living room. It fits the base of his cage perfectly with no room on any  side for an animal to perch. The cage and stand stand with the back to a wall and one side to a bookshelf. There’s no place a cat could be near it, besides the floor. During the day, I roll him to the center of the room, closer to a window to see out of, the back still facing a wall, but sides exposed. </p>

<p>My husband and I are looking into adopting a cat 4-6 years old, mellow and laid back. (I absolutely fell head over heels with middle age/senior cats when I volunteered at our local humane society four years ago)</p>

<p>He is a student online and may work part time, but as of right now he is home all day. (I work full time, but I am home at night on the weekends; I also come home for an hour during the middle of the day) He will be able to keep an eye on everyone. If we are both out we would like to keep the cat in our bedroom with the door closed (potentially locked) with everything he/she needs while we’re gone (2-3 hours at a time max). And keep the bird in our living room. </p>

<p><strong>The daily dynamic would work like this:</strong> give the cat ample play time for 30 minutes or so them put him/her in our room while our bird has some fly-about time for 30 minutes. Once the bird is back in the cat will be allowed in the common area of the house again. At night I’d like to keep the cat in our bedroom with the door closed until I can be 100% certain nothing may happened during the night. However, I’m prepared to keep the cat in our room at night for the rest of its life. </p>

<p><strong>I AM NOT ASKING</strong> advice on having the bird out of the cage while the cat is in the same room. That is not my intention. I am planning to <em>never</em> have the bird out of its cage with a cat in the room.</p>

<p><strong>I AM ASKING</strong> will an older cat be interested in a bird at all? I assume it will depend on the cat itself. Will just the presence of a cat be harmful to the bird? I’m not sure how he will act since he his fine with other larger creatures than himself (i.e. dogs).
I am aware that both are natural “enemies” and have read plenty of horror stories, and for good reason. I want someone to level with me and their experiences with bringing home an older cat with a bird already in the household. 
We plan to keep the cat fed and preoccupied to the best of our ability so it won’t be interested. Or is this whole idea of a cat in the house a bad idea all together? </p>

"Juwel Filter Pump Too High?","<p>We have a Juwel Lido 200.</p>

<p>The black filter box was on the right side of the aquarium; but we wanted to move it so we removed the silicone and re-siliconed it on the left-side of the aquarium instead.</p>

<p>However, when we moved it we weren't careful enough about the height at which we put it; and it's a little higher than before - perhaps 1cm or so.</p>

<p>The heater is still submerged (and over the min water line on the heater); but the pump is only partially submerged now. The impeller and output are submerged; but not all of the rest of the pump.</p>

<p>If you look at the pictures on the Juwel website (<a href=""https://www.juwel-aquarium.co.uk/Products/Filtering/Pumps/Eccoflow-pumps/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.juwel-aquarium.co.uk/Products/Filtering/Pumps/Eccoflow-pumps/</a>), the water level covers three of the five gratings on the black box-part of the pump.</p>

<p>I know ideally these should be fully submerged; but all i can find on this online in general is that it ""may reduce the life of the pump"" because the water also helps cool the pump.</p>

<p>Since this morning the female cat has been acting very strange. I noticed she was lowering the front half of her body to the ground and sticking her bum into the air while tapping her back feet back and forward. At first, I assumed she was maybe going through heat or something and was trying to get the male cat to have sex with her (which he showed no interest to, obviously), but now I am starting to get a little worried. She has been doing this all day, as much as possible, while making whimpering sounds and having small tremors. It seems like she is in some discomfort. She has been very active today and even when relaxing she is still holding her bum in the air. She has also been craving a lot of attention from me, cuddling into me as much as possible, which is not like her. Normally she likes to be on her own.</p>

<p>Is this normal? Was I correct and she is just going through heat? Her strange behavior is really worrying me.</p>

"Sand to Clay Ratio for Horse Footing","<p>This is the best place I could think to ask this question. I figured there would be plenty of horse people on here and this question is tangentially related to horses.</p>

<p>I have an area of my pasture that has basically been destroyed. The horses eat in this area in the winter and drink from nearby all year round. The ground has eroded quite a bit from them making holes in the mud and carrying it off on their feet over the year. It doesn't help that they kill the grass and the rain run off erodes it to. There is nothing to do about that. I'm not interested in feeding them in different areas as this would be a ton of extra work and the 4-wheeler and even the horses would eventually mess these areas up as well. Better to have one sacrificial area.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for is the depth I need to mix in sand to make the clay harder. I'm basing this off of building a footing for an arena. I don't want to use anything like gravel or concrete wash, because they'd cause more problems in the long run than they'd solve now. I was watching a tv show on how they improved the Kentucky Horse Park for the FEI games and one arena builder built the bases for these arenas by mixing 50/50 sand and clay. He said you can pack it, but not as well as mother nature can in 6 months. </p>

<p>My hope is that if I get sand and mix it with the clay where the horses eat, they won't be standing in deep mud. This reduces the risk of illness through things like scratches, it makes the horses more comfortable, and reduces my irritation in blanketing in the mud.</p>

<p>Here is my math. 300' of fence line, 10' wide strip, 3"" deep. This ends up being 750cubic/ft. There are 27cubic/ft. in a cubic yard. So 750/27= ~28cubic/yards. I figure that if you mix 3"" of sand with the top 3"" of clay, evenly, you'll end up with a 6"" bed, which I think would be fine. Google says a standard dump truck contains 10-14 cubic/yards of sand. So (2) dump truck loads would do the area. </p>

<p>Do you guys think this would be deep enough to firm up the footing in a 300'x10' strip for the horses to stand on when eating. I don't need it to be like asphalt, I just want it hard enough that they aren't sinking and leaving huge holes. Could I go shallower and only do 1.5"" of sand, so I'd have 3"" of hardened base? Do I even need to mix it, or will it mix well enough as the horses walk on it and stomp it into the mud below? </p>

<p>Thanks for the help guys. If you have a question about something I've left out, feel free to ask and I'll update with the answer.</p>

"Should I feed my cat whenever she asks?","<p>My cat has always been good about weight. She's always been fit, incredibly active, and agile.

"Anxious dog howls and screams when we take our other dog out","<p>So we have three dogs ages 5, 3, and 7 months. We take the two older dogs outside to go potty at the same time and take the puppy separately because she gets distracted to easily. Whenever we take the puppy out our 3 year old starts jumping on the gate and screaming as loud as he can and absolutely freaking out. We tried switching it up and taking him out with the puppy and taking the 5 year old out alone and he did the same thing. Is this some form of separation anxiety? Is there anything we can do to stop it? I’m at a loss as to what to do at this point. <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Grxun.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Allowing puppy on couch","<p>So to start off I have seen this question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/1757/5-month-puppy-first-day-at-home-guarding-couch-growling-biting"">Guarding couch</a></p>

<p>which deals with a problem that occurred in the one incident but it seemed more related to guarding than anything.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>So I am about to have a new puppy around the house and will probably be posting / seeking much help from this community in the process. She was just born so will have her after some weeks before the transfer so my wife and I are trying to be as informed as we can before hand.  We have both owned dogs before, and dog sat many times, but we have one disagreement so I wanted to get some thoughts from people who have more experience and actual evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Is it bad to let a new puppy up on furniture such as our couch?</p>

<p>We will have a separate crate / bed left open for her always so she has her own space so does allowing her as a puppy up on the couch initially create the thought that it is her space as well and she can come up whenever she wants? I have seen where people say to let the dogs up only when they are invited and then they should obey when you tell them to get off but isn't it easier and more repeatable to simply not let them up in the first place? For me I find it confusing for the dogs that sometimes they are allowed but other times they are not so seems harder to enforce the not allowed part.</p>

"Hiding rescue cat will get comfortable one day?","<p>I've scoured the internet and found lots of similar questions, so I know the answer is just to give it time. But if anyone has any suggestions and reassurances I'd love to hear them. </p>

<p>I adopted a rescue cat just under a week ago. She's just over a year old and was being fostered in a home with several other cats. The woman who fostered her said she had become significantly less timid in the few months she'd been there, eventually seeking out pets and affection, and thought she might one day be a lap cat (obviously no guarantees). </p>

<p>I made the mistake of not confining her to one room when I first brought her home (though I have a small apartment and not a lot of rooms with doors that aren't my bedroom), and she's since been hiding most of the time. She occasionally creeps into whatever room I'm in to hide there, but only in the evenings. I've tried to give her space, although I think I pushed too hard one day and set us back a bit. She tends to squirm backwards, further under the bed/couch, if I approach her slowly with a treat in my hand. She's eating well and using the litter box without any issues. She does tend to explore more at night when I'm asleep, because she wakes me up meowing (is she anxious?).</p>

<p>I guess the issue is that I'm impatient and worried that she'll never warm up to me. It's only been a week, but she's a darling and I'm eager to pet her. Is there anything I can do to make her more comfortable, or anything I shouldn't do? I assume it's too late to confine her to one room. Has anyone had experience with a rescue cat that took a long while to get comfortable? How long did you wait? Any assurances would be greatly appreciated. She's my first solo pet and I'm anxious about doing the right thing. Thanks.</p>

"My dog won't get tired","<p>I have a mix of Border Collie with Australian Shepherd. Recently we moved to a country house and now he has a 24/7 access to big green fields and almost 24/7 human attention. Happy dog. But I'm worried about him going over his limits for his love of playing. Looks like even when tired he just continues to find stuff to do, run, catch, bark.
Is that ok? Or should I put some limits? My other dogs are not that crazy and I never had that worry with them, even though they had the same benefits.</p>

"New cat's third eyelid showing when asleep","<p>I have a new rescue cat who is slowly settling in - she's very timid, but getting braver every day. This question is about her eyes. </p>

<p>When she is falling asleep/already asleep and her eyes are half-closed, her pupils kind of roll back into her head. I know this is because of the third eyelid cats have, but I keep seeing online that it could be a sign of serious illness. I've only ever seen it when she's falling asleep, and when she is deeply asleep her eyes are closed all the way and I don't see anything. I've never seen it happen when she is awake.</p>

<p>I'm mostly worried because I saw that it could be a symptom of dehydration, and I immediately started wondering if she was getting enough water. I've never seen her drink, and I haven't been monitoring the water level in her bowl closely enough, I guess. She eats a small can of wet food in addition to dry food every day, and there's urine in her litter box every day. I can't really speak to lethargy or not, because she mostly spends her time hiding or sleeping.</p>

<p>I'd take her to the vet, but since she's been here less than a week I can't really get close to her yet, so the effort of catching her and putting her in the carrier would be fairly traumatizing. I will probably call the vet in the morning regardless, to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen this before? Do I just have a cat with weird sleep habits, or is it something worse? </p>

"Is it possible to feed a cat a healthy meat diet?","<p>I was given 3 kittens by a friend who's cat had a litter.   Not wanting to separate them, I took all 3.  They were great kittens, they played, they loved the house and they seemed healthy.  2 boys and 1 girl.</p>

<p>Now, fully grown, the top cat is a big healthy beast of a cat.  More than one person has told me that he's the ""biggest cat I've ever seen"".  About 17 lbs but not fat.   He rules the house.  He's not mean, he just sits there and watches everyone.   His name, appropriately is Panther but sometimes I just call him boss.</p>

<p>The little one, the only girl, grew up picked on by her brothers.   She's soft and cuddly and cute as can be.  Despite being basically a twin, she's 11 lbs of fluff, but on occasion when she gets spooked, she'll grab you and you get a sense that there's some real muscle behind her fluff.   Growing up she was the smallest and I think she got used to being the smallest.   Her name is Peaches.</p>

<p>The middle one is the one I'm asking about.   He and his brother as kittens were equals, but as they grew to full size, Panther added more weight to a more solid frame and Pepper, the middle cat, stayed skinny and he weighs about 14 lbs, and is visibly skinny.    All 3 are currently about 2 years 8 months old.</p>

<p>I used to give them treats.  Turkey was a favorite but when Pepper started to only want to eat Turkey and nothing else, I stopped giving them that.  All 3 cats went cold turkey as they say, because I know it's not healthy for a cat to only eat meat.</p>

<p>The problem is, Pepper doesn't seem to like cat food.  He eats it sparingly and he's growing skinnier.  He's stopped washing himself as well as his brother and sister and his fur is growing a little bit oily and clumpy.    I know that there could be several causes for this, but I'm also wondering if perhaps he just doesn't like cat food and if I can try making him turkey or chicken based meals.</p>

<p>I know that some places sell ""raw"" cat food but I've tried that in the past and my cats didn't like it.  It's also quite expensive, no cheaper than Turkey.</p>

<p>So, here's my question.</p>

<p><strong>Is experimenting with feeding him turkey again a bad idea?</strong>, with proper supplements (there's a specific protein I think that cats need to be fed that they get from cat food but not from meat), but I don't remember what it is.   Is that worth trying or would I just need to make him go cold turkey again if I did that.</p>

<p>And can canned and dry cat food be bad for some cats?</p>

<p>EDIT - Update a couple months later.</p>

<p>My cat who went on the self imposed ""I just want to eat sliced turkey"" diet has adapted to eating cat food and he's back to being about the same weight as his slightly bigger brother.   No longer skinny.   He still begs sometimes when I open the fridge, but he's eating cat food again.    I have a soft heart and I want to feed him cold cuts, but I don't.   I haven't bought turkey slices in nearly 3 months and he seems to have forgotten that they exist.  Other meats don't have the same pull on him, so he's good now.    So, long story short, the cold turkey with sliced turkey experiment worked.</p>

<p>The trick now for me, as they're approaching 3 years old, is that all 3 are slowly putting on weight.   I have to ease them into eating less now, but that's another question.</p>

"What research is there on the long term effects of pinch-induced behavioral inhibition conditioning on cats?","<p>There have been <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18222719"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">studies</a> using ""clipnosis"" a.k.a. pinch-induced behavioral inhibition (PIBI) as a technique to immobilize a variety of animals. The following study examines the use of such a technique on cats: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Research has documented immobilization of rodents, rabbits, guinea pigs and dogs by mechanical means, typically using neck clips or inversion ('animal hypnosis').  [...]<br>
   Domestic cats may be effectively immobilized by clips placed along the animal's dorsum. We use the term 'pinch-induced behavioral inhibition' (PIBI) for this behavior because it describes both the method and the response, while avoiding the more anthropomorphic term 'hypnosis'. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such a technique renders many cats incapable of moving, as the loose skin is pinched and it <em>appears</em> that movement would prove to be painful. </p>

<p>Many pets are carried by the scruff of the neck by their mothers as babies, but this is usually considered unwise practice because as animals mature (as discussed <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/1003/is-it-ok-to-pick-my-adult-cat-up-by-the-scruff-of-the-neck"">Is it ok to pick my adult cat up by the scruff of the neck?</a>), the skin is not designed to carry the weight of a animal. In the wild, a grown animal being carried by the scruff of the neck would usually be the next meal of the animal within whose mouth it was being carried. </p>

<p>The immobilization and subsequent inactivity of the animal is perceived to have a hypnotic or calming effect. I argue that this perceived calming effect is due to the animal's inability to move, and the pain involved in attempting to move.  I also see this technique as being threatening to the animal, as it is not a natural position for an adult pet.</p>

<p><strong><em><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/a/437/87"">This post</a> advocates the use of PIBI, but be warned the images here can be upsetting to some people.</em></strong></p>

<p>What research is there about whether it is painful for the cat and the psychological effects with regard  to PIBI?</p>

"Can I put any other fish in with a male betta?","<p>I had a male betta fish for a long time, and was told by the people at the pet store that I could put in a pleco fish (aka an algae eater) because it would stay near the bottom.

Only occasionally will she eat it right away when I put it out for her, but most of the time she ""eventually"" gets to it. The vet told me as long as she is eating at some point, it's ok. Some dogs are not that motivated by food and she is in healthy shape. </p>

<p>The other day I was running out of dry food so I bought a can of Newman's Own chicken and rice food. I was actually quite surprised out how ""human-like"" it looked. When I gave it to her, she absolutely devoured it in like 30 seconds.</p>

<p>I feel slightly guilty for feeding her dry food that she's not that excited by. Should I change to wet food b/c she seems to enjoy it more? Maybe mix 50/50 dry/wet?</p>

<p>The other is a rescue dog, about the same age.  He has lived with the female for about 3-4 years.  He's steadily lost hair and his flesh is a combination of pink and black skin underneath.  He still has full hair around his face and chest/shoulders. But it's VERY thin back of that, and almost gone on his belly.  He also has ""tags"" of flesh on his stomach area.  And, he's skinny, and doesn't smell good even when he's bathed.</p>

<p>He's got access to as much food as he wants (dry) but has stayed skinny.</p>

<p>Obviously, it's not contagious as Wendy hasn't gotten this at all.</p>

<p>I am sorry I haven't put a lot of effort into him but have some money to at least try something.  Is it possible this is worms?  If so what type, and what type of medicine should I try?  Honestly, I don't have the budget for the 150-300 that a vet would charge, but am willing to spend 30-40 on an OTC or internet-order treatment.  Thanks.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing, he's not extremely active, but no obvious sign of lethargy.  Pretty quiet though.</p>

"What reasons could there be for my rabbit not defecating?","<p>My 6 year old female outdoor rabbit is free to roam for up to 8 hours a day in our large garden, but has stopped eating the grass and hay.

<p>We initially put her on a course of antibiotics, and put some water on her pellets to soften just to get her to eat, which helped as she now munches them dry again. We also noticed that she started eating the crusts of the wholemeal bread we fling out for the birds. Thinking she was hungry, we gave her small amounts.</p>

<p>I have noticed over the last few days now, there are less and less droppings around so I'm really worried. The vet is only going to suggest we put her down, so is there anything else we can do?</p>

<p>For the past few years, for various reasons, I couldn't have any dogs and frankly my life felt somewhat insufficient. Finally I think I'm ready to get one. Considering all possible choices I decided to get a zwergschnauzer, and that would be my first ever dog since moving to USA.</p>

<p>I want to get a purebred male, either a young adult or a puppy. However it seems to be quite a difficult task to find a good puppy in my area (San Francisco Bay Area). </p>

<p>First of all the price. According to ads I found on the Internet, it varies from $350 to $3000 for a puppy. I mean I understand you get what you pay for, but really $3000 for a puppy? And we're talking about one of the most popular breeds in US, not some exotic one.</p>

<p>I am not trying to get a show dog, but a family pet, yet I want to get a good and healthy puppy and if it really makes huge difference, maybe I should prepare myself to pay reasonably higher than average price? But I won't pay $3000. It would probably be cheaper to fly to Germany and bring one here.</p>

<p>Also it seems finding a puppy is difficult. I've been emailing in response to all ads I've found on Craigslist, eBay Classifieds, and PetFinder. Most of the puppies are either already sold out or of a mixed breed. </p>

"Is there any evidence to suggest that lizards can recognize a human face?","<p>I was playing air drums next to my 2-year old Uromastyx's tank, and I noticed out of the corner of my eye that she kept glancing up and my face, despite my hands going crazy 2 feet down (almost giving me a ""what are you doing?"" look, but that might be giving her too much credit).</p>

<p>I thought that was interesting, so I stood up, but extended my arms to keep my hands at the same place (increasing the distance between my hands and face), and she actually readjusted, and kept looking at my head.</p>

<p>This struck me as odd because she's very skidish, and tends to run from anything moving. This would seem to suggest that she's giving special attention to the face, but as far as I know, they don't have the mental machinery to make such a recognition (Fusiform Face Area?)</p>

"What are safe materials for repairing a scratching post?","<p>We have a small carpeted cat tree with a sisal/hemp covered scratching post support. The cats seem to love this scratching post more than any other, as they have torn up the sisal to where it is falling off the post in several places. I would like to repair this by replacing the sisal cord in its entirety. The post was commercially made and cost around $40 new.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://youtu.be/2JSwgrr6sY4?t=20s"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a> that does make it look very possible to do this repair myself. The video (and several other sources) suggest using either white (Elmer's) glue or hot glue as a means of securing the sisal to the post. This would certainly be low cost, but I'm concerned about the toxicity. So far as I've noticed, none of the other scratching posts we've bought have used an adhesive of any kind. Instead, it seems they've used an out-of-sight metal fastener (staple, nail etc.).</p>

<p>One of our cats has a habit of eating everything he can get his teeth around. Is glue a safe material for repairing the cat tree, or would be risk of poisoning? Or should I just do the repairs the hard way and get a staple gun or break out the hammer and nails?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was all set to repair the post with solid materials only (new sisal and metal staples). I started disassembling the torn and shredded sisal and it became clear that the original manufacturer had used at least 2 types of glue. One is a hot-glue look alike used near the ends, which were also secured with numerous staples. The other was more of a contact cement applied to the whole cardboard tube, around which the sisal was wrapped. I'm going to look into the glue safety some more and see if I can't get something similar.</p>

"House training a pound puppy","<p>Not an exact duplicate because of my puppy's background.</p>

<p>So, I have an almost one year old puppy, some sort of Chihuahua+Terrier mix (8 lbs). I adopted her when she was 8 months old, and was advised that she had been moved from pound to pound (as an ambassador for events and such) for 5 months, meaning by the time she was 8 months old she'd been living in a shelter for most of her life. Nothing is known about her life before the shelter, so it's entirely possible that by the time she came into my life there had been no attempt at house-breaking her whatsoever.</p>

<p>So, now I have a one year old puppy whom I've been trying to house train for 4 months with little to no effect. She won't go to the bathroom in her crate (that's where I feed her), so that's a plus, but she seems to <strong>prefer</strong> to go in the house than to go outside. I'll wake up or get home and immediately take her from her crate to outside, where she'll pee and poop if I'm lucky. Typically she'll just run around until I have to bring her back in, at which point she'll immediately run off and poop in the corner. It might also be good to point out that she's on restricted water (only while eating or after exerting herself), but she still manages to pee... a lot.</p>

<p>She knows that she shouldn't be doing it, because she'll never do it if she knows I can see her and when I do find it she cowers/hides (even though I've never been aggressive towards her or even yelled).</p>

"How to proceed with a pet snake that starts jabbing when held?","<p>I was considering adopting a milk snake. She's 5 ft. long and the first time I held her she was very friendly, wrapping herself around both my arms, and mostly staying in that position. I held her for several minutes, slowly wrapping her around the other arm as she gradually moved around and uncoiled herself.</p>

<p>The second time I met her though, she moved much faster, and made two sudden movements of jabbing. But she was jabbing away from me (at no one). (What does that mean?) As she was moving faster, it was harder to keep her coiled around my arms, so I brought her closer to my chest, at which point she wrapped herself around my neck. This was fine, until I felt a sharp pain in my cheek just under my ear. My friend had to pry the snake's jaws open with her fingers, and she was very upset, saying she's had the snake since it hatched and had never seen her bite anyone. She also said the snake was supposed to be fed yesterday and was probably very hungry.</p>

<p>Today I ventured to hold the snake again. Almost immediately though, the snake started jabbing again in random directions. I quickly gave the snake back to my friend, and she quickly and tightly coiled herself around my friend's arms. Then my friend tried holding the snake close to my arm for a few minutes to let her get my scent. The snake however burrowed into my friend's sweater.</p>

<p>If the snake feels threatened by me, how should I proceed to make her feel safe? Is it possible? Why was she so friendly the first time, but not the others? Are snakes (or milksnakes) very unpredictable or moody?</p>

"Understanding and Encouraging Blanket Spelunking","<p>Of the three cats in my life, the first two were relatively chill, and the latest is by far the most full of energy, vigor, and character.  As an example, the first cat never showed the slightest interest in blanket spelunking<sup>1</sup>, the second appreciated a good blanket spelunk, but was quickly satisfied she had seen what needed to be seen.  The latest is absolutely obsessed with it.  Ever wrinkle, every corner, every seam- it <em>must</em> be thoroughly explored and examined!</p>

<p>As I continue to adjust to this personality that is so different from what I am accustomed to, I feel like anything I can do to encourage positive outlets of his energy, I need to latch on to.  Blanket Spelunking is right up there on the list, alongside several others.</p>

<p>So first, I want to get inside the cat's head.  This doesn't seem to be a hunting-related behavior, at least not on the surface of it.  I can tell it is fun, but why?  I understand why human kids build forts, but what is the motive for the feline spelunker?</p>

"Toilet Trained Cat... Almost","<p>So my wife and I set ourselves to training our cat to use the toilet. Over the course of several months, we performed the following steps and were met with great success.</p>

<ol>
<li>We moved the covered litter box close to the toilet.</li>
<li>We switched the litter out for a soluble brand so it wouldn't wreck our plumbing.</li>
<li>We raised the litter box to the level of the toilet.</li>
<li>We removed the top of the covered litter box.</li>
<li>We moved it on top of the toilet.</li>
<li>My wife then molded an aluminum turkey pan to fit inside the bowl of the toilet and filled it with the soluble litter. </li>
<li>We cut a small hole in the center of the turkey pan.</li>
<li>Over time, we gradually expanded the size of the hole until there was nothing left for our kitty to stand on but the toilet seat.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all that exists is the shining rim of the turkey pan below the toilet seat.</p>

<p>Our cat has been successfully peeing and pooping in the toilet for about 3 months or so now. That is until this last Christmas. When we put our tree up, it created a nice, little, isolated corner in our apartment. One day I discovered a poop in the corner. Since then, there have been a handful of incidents where she'll poop in the same corner if it's not covered with stuff, or like this morning, she'll poop right in <strong><em>front</em></strong> of the toilet on the mat. It doesn't happen every time, or even half the time, but just every now and then.</p>

<p>I have a hunch that our cat doesn't particularly like the sensation of pooping on the toilet because it splashes up onto her butt. Things that I've read say that if a cat doesn't like their pooping space, they'll pick a different spot. I <em>know</em> there are people who have had complete success with toilet training.</p>

<p>At this point, we're determined to have her using the toilet, so going back to a litter box isn't really an option. Has anyone else had this same problem? And how would you recommend addressing it?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>I have considered using toilet paper to cover the surface of the water. This has proven... from experience... to reduce/eliminate splash entirely, but I don't think it will stay there all day, and I don't think I could train her to put toilet paper over the surface of the water.</p>

<p>This really comes down to whether or not this is just something behavioral that needs extra training/addressing in some other manner, or if there's something creative that can be done to improve her experience.</p>

"Does store-bought coral come from coral reefs?","<p>While I'm not currently thinking of building a salt-water tank, I might do after a few years of experience.</p>

<p>If they're coming from the ocean (The biggest aquarium of all :D) and already-depleted coral reefs, it would seem a bit unethical to me.</p>

"Cat bites my face at night and when he seems happy","<p>I just got two 6 months old brother male kittens, both neutered and vaccinated. One of the two, the smaller one Gintoki, keeps biting lightly whatever he can of my hands, arms, neck and my wife's as well. Most of the time it is barely anything and I understand he's not doing this to be mean as he is most of the time purring when he does that, that I'm not exactly sure how to react to it since I know it can create bad tendencies as he will grow older.</p>

<p>Now that's not too worrying for now as we only had them since last Sunday(18-03-18), but now the issue is that Gintoki and the other slightly bigger <em>Jotaro</em> come at night in bed and are both biting our faces: e.g. ears, nose, jaw, chin. Once more they don't sound mad again as they are purring and not especially trying to attack us. We are going to start keeping our room's door closed at night, but is there anything else we can do? Can this be something only temporary? Will it make the two kittens hate us? As you can see I'm quite worried.</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> We haven't seen that they are biting more than before and the door was left open except for one night were we closed it for 5 minutes and Gintoki would meow loudly so that wasn't going to happen. I'll see to try what the response advised me and see how that goes.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> Now what I have been able to deduce is that they bite our face during sleep because they want to be fed. And that they prefer to bite my face with or without a light beard. They never really hurt me, and I have been able to sleep better by providing them a bit of food before sleeping (they will come back just a bit later).</p>

"(Re)introducing a new dog","<p>Until yesterday, I had two dogs living in two different houses. A 4-month Dobberman puppy and an 8-month half black lab (we don't know his exact breed). Today was supposed to be the day when they finally met and became friends.</p>

<p>I probably started wrong right off the bat by not doing any research and putting them together immediately at the lab's house. The Dobberman was afraid at first but then they started playing. There was a little trouble as the lab is slightly bigger and would kind of tackle the Dobberman, leaving him off balance.</p>

<p>After running around for a while, they begun to play fight. I (and all of my family) assumed this was ok and let them go on. When there was growling and barking we separated them for a few seconds then let them resume. This went on for many hours. Now that it's sleeping time, we are afraid of what they might do to each other without surveillance. The first idea was to lock the lab, but it looks like it won't work.</p>

<p>So, here are my questions on the situation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Did I do the introduction wrong?</p></li>
<li><p>Will I need to introduce the dogs to each other again?</p></li>
<li><p>Should the dogs be allowed to play fight?</p></li>
<li><p>What should I do in times when I can't keep constant vigilance?</p></li>

"Introducing harness/leash training to cats in a new space","<p>My two indoor kitties have stayed with me in a second floor, 540 sq ft apartment for two years, and enjoyed watching birds outside safely from the balcony. Perhaps letting them get used to a bit of the outdoors via balcony was my mistake, but they <em>loved</em> it. </p>

<p>I'm moving to a single-level, 330 sq ft cottage in the next week, however, and I worry about their restlessness. The windows are not as ideal for bird watching, and they'll no longer have a balcony to go outside on. I also worry about restlessness in the significantly smaller space (although I am very good about playing with them every day... otherwise I don't sleep, haha). I'm thinking it would be cool to  harness train them so I can take them into the yard with me for an engaging experience.</p>

<p>I have one boy and one girl cat, both 3 years old decently active and at ideal cat-weight. I have put them in harnesses a few times and, while it's not their favorite thing (boy-cat forgets how to move normally), they don't do too bad.</p>

<p>So my question is <strong>If I begin harness training for walks when I move into the new space, will that be beneficial or disadvantageous when trying to teach them?</strong> </p>

<p>More specifically - In my head, I imagine that if I start  harness/leash training them immediately when placing it in the new space will ""normalize"" it for them. ""Oh - this is a new space and these things happen when I'm in this space."" Alternatively, maybe doing so will make them <em>hate</em> the new space, which would be the exact opposite of what I'd want.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on if this is a good or never-do-this-ever type of idea? Any experiences? </p>

"Fish keep dying, rogue homicidal fish or is my filter too powerful?","<p>I have a 36 gallon tank with an Aqueon® QuietFlow Aquarium Power Filter 55/75. as of now there are 2 red minor tetras and 4 neon tetras. I had another red minor tetra and 4 more neon tetras that all died over the last week. (There were a couple more that died the week before). </p>

<p>I used to have the 30 gal version of the filter, but it didnt seem to be able to keep up and the algae got out of control. I did a 50% water change, upgraded the filter to the 55/75 version and soaked all the decorations in bleach (and rinsed them off well after). It cleared up the water very well and the new filter seems to be working well. </p>

<p>About a week after I did the cleaning I got the new fish and since then they seem die off about 1 per day. Within a day of putting them in the tank, I notice that a couple of the neon tetras seem to have bits of their tails missing. Then about once a day I see a dead fish (almost always a neon tetra) thats sucked up against the Is this a case of an overagressive red minor tetra and they only get stuck by the filter after they die, or could my filter be too powerful and they get sucked up into it and not being able to swim away?</p>

<p>Edit: One thing I forgot to mention is that I got a water test done at PetSmart and they mentioned that the only issue is the Ph seems a bit low and I should do a 25% water change, could that be the issue?</p>

"Is my two-year old Maine coon too lean?","<p>We have five cats, four adults and a kitten. Other cats eat well but this one is just keeping slim lean thin like it was a fashion model on a catwalk. She is a Maine coon and just got two years old this month, and I'm getting anxious about her weight. She is a little over 90 cm (3 feet) including tail, and weighs about 3,5 kg (under 8 lb). Wikipedia says an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Coon#Breed_description"" rel=""nofollow"">adult female Maine coon</a> should be 10 to 15 lb.</p>

<p>She eats dry food and wet food, just like the others, but ever so small amounts of it at a time. We have dry food on constant offer and wet food two or three times a day. During the first 18 months I told myself that she is just busy growing up, as these Maine coons are slow to build up their body, so she just don't get body mass until she has reached her full size. But our other cats are (slightly) younger than this one, and they're looking like already at their full adult size. So for the last half a year I've been wondering if she is allright.</p>

<p>Half a year ago she was at a vet to get her vaccines and the vet said something about her possibly being in heat every so often, and that consumes a lot of energy. The vet said our cat sure is a bit too lean, but it should change soon after spaying. I don't know, we have plans to let her have one set of kittens before doing that. And we've been waiting for her to grow up before introducing her to a tom. (That's part of it why we now have the male kitten..)</p>

<p>After that talk with the vet I've started buying <em>Royal Canin <a href=""http://www.medicanimal.com/product/~product_id=106444"" rel=""nofollow"">Exigent 33 Aromatic Attraction</a></em> food for fussy cats. The slim cat seems to like it, but our other cats love it. So our other cats are gaining weight perhaps a bit too merrily, only because I'm trying to fatten this one.</p>

<p>To sum it up: a two year old female Maine coon is ever so slim, even though she does eat. How slim is normal for this breed? Am I worried for nothing, and if not, what can I do?</p>

"How does a cat's personality change by having kittens?","<p>I'm pretty sure that having kittens (and nursing them, etc) changes a female cat both physically and mentally. <strong>Exactly how it changes the cat</strong> is not quite clear to me. To me a female cat that has had kittens seems more ""adult"" than another one who was spayed before ever having kittens.  I have never given much thought to it really. I believe that having kittens is good for the cat, and especially for me, because I don't want my cat to behave like a big kitten all through her adult life.</p>

<p>Getting rid of the kittens has not proven difficult, at least in the country I live in. People will buy cheap cross-breed kittens willingly, especially from a seller like me, who sells clean and healthy vet-checked, vaccined, dewormed kittens. I'm asking for approximately the ""production costs"" price only, so it is definitely not a business to me. The only issue is if I really want to have my cat have kittens at all. At the moment I have one unspayed female cat, so this question is about her. Of all the cats I've ever had I've let two females produce kittens, first in 1988 and second time in 2012.</p>

"How can we calm our dog after eating?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Our dog is a Pitbull/Husky mix. We got him from the kennel where he spent about 7 years of his life (got adopted twice but returned to the kennel a few weeks after), he's been with us for 1,5 years. He doesn't like other dogs or animals (we're doing slow progress on that) but usually loves humans.</p>

<p>He is a very powerful dog with lots of energy. Education was hard at first (lots of exercise and discipline) but we got there with patience and he is much better balanced and calm. He has some rules that he understands and sometimes he tries to break them, we think he is only testing us, nothing special.</p>

<p>However, he gets very excited sometimes. He loves eating, we had to get a special bowl so he doesn't just vacuum the food. When we fill his bowl, he sits down because he knows we only give him the ""eat"" command when he calms down, but he still looks excited and runs like crazy towards the bowl when we tell him to and eats like a maniac.</p>

<p>After eating, he gets very excited. Currently, we're having some work done in the yard, so he is being held by a long leash (on his harness). He doesn't have room to run and just walks around in circles and barks at the sky.</p>

<p>How can we calm our dog after eating? Sometimes he is calm, sometimes he is excited, that's normal for him and we are glad he is this way.

"why did my cat stare at me with her third eyelid pulled across?","<p>For the first time ever, she had her third eyelid, the one that pulls across from the inner corner, about a quarter of the way across both eyes in fact, but I have never seen her face like this, she was staring at me in a new way and not blinking love blinks when I  stroked her or closing her eyes and purring. </p>

<p>One factor might be that I have had to halt her from sitting on my computer keyboard as she altering the settngs in ways that needed a repair, she was getting stroked while sitting on the keyboard, which was hard to handle, so I out a book under the laptop so that she has no flat surface to sit on, one idea that I found on-line that might not be the best solution, after all. Though I sroke her when she  is on the armchair too.</p>

<p>Another factor is that I changed my coloured light-bulb for a white brighter one, an overhead light, nothing in her eyes, no brighter than the kitchen.</p>

<p>She has a suede rug on my desk, the run of my home 100% (bedroom and kitchen, living room, she goes where she wants, sleeps where she wants) food and water, clean litter, petting on offer, which is when she stared so, while on the suede rug, perhaps she is bored of it, but she usually bucks her head back to let me know that she wants me to stop, she scented me, rubbed her cheeks on my jacket. Still, she is not perky, she was like this in the kitchen too, just not herself...</p>

<p>I just want our special bond back. The bond with the love blinks. Maybe I am worrying over nothing and she will change back. Do cats have off days? Is she just growing up? She is four human years</p>

"How much time should I expect to volunteer at a shelter in order to be useful?","<p>I was once part of a group that volunteered at a shelter for an afternoon (as part of a community-service project).  But that wasn't very useful to the shelter; they have mandatory training programs for volunteers and none of us had gone through that, so we ended up spending the afternoon at a bunny romp.  That was fun, but I didn't feel like I was helping them -- more like staying out of their way.  (I'd been expecting to spend the afternoon cleaning cages or walking dogs or doing data-entry.)</p>

<p>If I wanted to volunteer <em>usefully</em> at a shelter, how is that time best structured?  I work full-time and have other obligations; would a few hours once or twice a month be at all useful, or is that below the ""thanks for the thought, but..."" line?  What are the typical time commitments that shelters look for from volunteers?</p>

"Where to get leg band for parrot in USA?","<p>I need to travel internationally with cockatiels.</p>

<p>For travel it is often required to have some sort of identification attached to the animal, such as microchips or leg bands.  For birds of this size the only option is leg bands.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Where can I get <em>traceable</em> leg bands for adult parrots in the US?</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a standardized system for leg band (codes), nor any centralized database.  I believe USDA only issues leg bands when birds are imported, but not for domestic birds (not 100% sure).  The point is that the leg band I get should be <em>traceable</em>, i.e. whatever USA or foreign authority that looks at it should be able to retrieve information about the bird based on the code.  What are my options?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.acstiels.com/#!bands/c1m0a"" rel=""nofollow"">ACS</a> and <a href=""http://cockatiels.org/membership-information/registered-leg-bands/"" rel=""nofollow"">NCS</a> sells traceable bands for members (breeders), but my understanding is that these are closed bands only suitable for baby birds.  Once the bird grows up, the band doesn't come off and it's not possible to put on a closed band, so this is not what I need.  (I might have misunderstood something though.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Based on further research, this question boils down to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Which reputable organizations in the USA offer <em>open</em> and <em>traceable</em> leg bands?  I found one so far: <a href=""http://www.afabirds.org/leg_bands_open.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">AFA</a></p></li>
<li><p>It would be useful to know what requirements EU countries typically put on leg bands, if any.  While this question is more vague, from experience the USA is notorious for not adopting international standards (e.g. for USA-obtained microchips one usually needs to get a compatible microchip reader when travelling abroad...)</p></li>

<p>We adopted an intact male dog and after a week, things have taken a turn for the worse. My neutered dog starting walking around and posturing with his ears pinned back and his hair standing straight up on his back. Eventually the un neutered male has enough of this and they start fighting. I separate them and then things go back to normal for a period of time. The intact male is always the one to finally strike first but I know it is in reaction to the neutered dogs behavior. </p>

 From what I’ve read, I don’t really fancy putting her in a breeding box and stressing her out, so would moving the male to a separate tank be a kinder option? Also, I haven’t got any peas in at the minute, but I do have broccoli that I can give her to see if that’ll make a difference.

I read multiple sites that said it was okay to move him within 24 hours of setting the tank up. The filter is working, and the heater is too. The temp says it is 78 degrees F. We put the conditioner in the water when we filled the tank up yesterday, so it sat for 24 hours with the filter on. I also checked the pH, nitrate, nitrite, and a few other factors of the tank which all came back as perfect. We moved him into the tank like we were supposed to, and he seemed to assimilate nicely to the new tank. When I sit by the tank, he usually comes straight up to me and then swims around. There's only one plant in there for him now, but I will be getting more tomorrow. I got the silk fake plants recommended for Bettas. I left the light on in the tank and turned the light off in my room, leaving him for about an hour. Half an hour in I checked on him and he was by the filter (he was just hanging out by it, it's not too strong and he wasn't stuck). Then when I came back in a half an hour later he was in the corner of the tank between the plant and wall. He was laying on the gravel between the two, not stuck though. It took him a minute, but he swam up to me and now he's swimming around okay. Is this normal for them to do? His fins look alright, and he doesn't appear to be breathing rapidly or have an ich on him. I've fed him flakes today, which he doesn't go for immediately but he will eat them. I'm getting pellets soon also. Is he just stressed from the move, or is there something more serious going on? This is the first betta I've owned so I just want to make sure he's doing okay and nothing else is happening to him. </p>

"My snake has started shedding, but seems unwilling/unable to finish","<p>I have a juvenile corn snake. This is her second shed with me so far, and the first went very easily. This time, however, she seems to be unwilling or unable to fully work her skin off. On Thursday night I first noticed that she'd begun to shed, and she'd successfully worked off the skin on her head and the base of her neck. (It looked very clean, and from what I can tell both eye caps came off.) From my experience with the previous shed I assumed she'd work the rest of it off over the course of the night. Since then, however, she's made no further progress at all--it's now Saturday morning here, and she still doesn't have her shed any further down than the spot on her neck near her head. I can tell she's not completely inactive, since she's moved between her hot and cool side hides, but instead of rubbing up against the rough objects in her tank she seems to only be hiding inside one hide or the other. </p>

<p>I'm beginning to get very worried--am I correct that this is longer than a snake should take from the beginning of the skin peeling off to having the full shed loose? (I see lots of resources online for how long it should take from blue phase to shed, but none for how long the shed should take.) And if so, what actions should I taking here? About fifteen minutes ago, upon waking up, I made a moist hide out of Tupperware and paper towels; she's in that currently and I'm hoping it will help, but I'm not sure what further I can do.</p>

<p>For further details: she ate two pinky mice last Sunday, her hot side is 84 degrees, her cool side fluctuates slightly but generally is around 70-75,her humidity is and has been at around 35-40%. Other than the usual pre-shed shyness I haven't noticed anything unusual about her behavior lately.</p>

<p>This one says research has shown without pointing to the actual research ...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sadly, silica litter puts our feline counterparts at risk whenever
  nature calls. silica dust can be kicked up and inhaled by both cats
  and humans. what’s worse, silica crystals often stick to cats’ paws,
  and the dust frequently settles on their fur, leading to ingestion
  whenever a cat grooms itself. and while many clay litter users still
  aren’t fully aware of the dangers associated with crystalline silica,
  the research is decidedly more certain.</p>

<p>Another one from a somewhat more reputable-looking site</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crystalline silica cat litter is one of the newest types of absorbent
  litter on the market. It works by absorbing your cats urine and
  ""drying"" it eliminating the smell and keeping the litter dry. This
  type of litter is quite popular due to it's ease of use. However, some
  health concerns exist. Silica Cat Litter Concerns Silica dust contains
  silica particles and is a known human carcinogen according to the
  International Agency on Cancer. Breathing in this silica dust may pose
  a health risk to you and your cat.</p>
  
  <p>Prolonged exposure to crystalline silica dust has been associated with
  silicosis (a non-cancerous, sometimes fatal lung disease), bronchitis
  and tuberculosis in humans.</p>
  
  <p>In cats, inhaling the silica dust can cause respiratory infections. If
  your cat ingests the silica while cleaning its paws, the silica may
  accumulate in your cat's intestines over a period of time causing
  health problems. When ingested, the litter will expand and absorb
  moisture in the intestines preventing the absorption of nutrients as
  well as cause dehydration and blockages.</p>

"Cat’s Tail Only Goes To the Right After Fall","<p>My male cat (neutered, 13 y/o) fell while I was away two weeks ago. I don’t know how he fell or where. When I came home after being gone for only a few hours he had a noticeable limp and couldn’t lift his tail. We took him to the ER vet who did X-rays, and then to my regular vet the next day (he was injured on a Sunday). </p>

<p>X-rays were all clear as far as breaks/fractures but there was some swelling and he was vocal when the vet poked around his left hip/hind leg. He was given anti inflammatories and pain meds. </p>

<p>It’s been a little over 2 weeks. The limp is gone (I tried to limit his activity as much as possible in the first week or so) he’s not vocal about any pain and everything else about his behavior is totally normal. </p>

<p>But!! I am SO confused about his tail. He couldn’t lift it at all the first few days; it progressively got better and it’s now not exactly totally lifted but a billion times better than it was; however, he is holding his tail completely to the right. When he walks, if I pet him on the back and he does the happy tail lift, it’s still completely to the right. He flicks the end back and forth and isn’t in pain when I touch it, and I don’t feel any lumps or irregularities when I feel it. The photo shows his tail shifted to the right but it’s actually far more right than that most of the time. </p>

<p>What in the world would cause this? Is it possible it will return to normal with time? (I did follow up with the vet, and he said he has no idea why his tail would be like that and we could do more X-rays but there wasn’t much that could be done). <img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5kFtZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tO5sg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Feeding Geriatric Cat with Hyperthyroidism and Cancer","<p>My sweet girl is nearing 17 and has been suffering with hyperthyroidism for several years.  Just last year she was also diagnosed with terminal small cell lymphoma in her bowel.  She has previously been on the Hills y/d diet, and it did successfully bring her T4 levels down and eliminate her need for medication, but I've always been pretty upset over the high corn/carbohydrate content of that food.  I was trusting my vet, though, that it was the best course of treatment for her.  However, now with the cancer diagnosis, I was advised to feed her a diet with very low carbohydrate, as carbohydrates apparently ""feed"" the cancer, so she went to a carbohydrate-free diet and back on the thyroid medication.  However, now her thyroid levels are off the charts even with the medication and I was advised to put her BACK on y/d.  OR, only now, when my cat is very old and sick after being hyperthyroid for YEARS, has my vet told me about the curative radioactive iodine treatment being an option.  I would do it without hesitation except that it is VERY expensive, and my poor old girl would have to endure the stress of an hour-long car ride to another city to receive the treatment.  I can't bear to put her through all that when I'm worried the stress alone might do her in at this point.  I don't know how much longer she has, I was told probably less than a year, but I want to do the best I can for her while she's still with me.</p>

<p>In short, my question is this:  since curative treatments aren't really an option for my cat, is there a way to feed my cat a low-iodine, low-carb, high protein, high fat diet?  I've been researching homemade cat food options, but I don't know how to ensure I'm feeding my girl as little iodine as possible.  I've found several websites advising making your own low-iodine cat food instead of using y/d, but I can't seem to find any recipes or specific information on how to do that.  Is it even possible?  I'd appreciate any advice. </p>

<p>He's a wonderful dog: cute, loyal, funny, gentle and trustworthy. </p>

<p>However, this dog <strong>constantly, loudly, whines</strong>. It's completely behavioral and to myself it's very debilitating. My wife and I have two babies on the way. We're in a small place, I need to get the loud high pitched whining noises to stop. At a point of desperation I'm willing to even try a bark collar (shock collar) and Im looking for some experience here with them:</p>

<p>Do bark collars work for older animals to modify behavior (specifically whining)? </p>

<p>Are they considered humane?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Here's more history about our JRT, should it help your answer here:</p>

<p>My wife found him about eight years ago, he was neglected by owner in apt complex, she suspects there was abuse as well. The whining and whimpering has always gone on. My wife is able to be a lot more tolerant of it (I'm ashamed to say)than myself and others. </p>

<p>I moved in about two years ago and brought two cats with me. All the animals get along seemingly well and my wife maintains that there's been no major change in his behavior since I moved in. </p>

<p>Of note he seems to wine more often under the following various circumstances: in the evening, when she and I are together awake in the house, when food is present.</p>

<p>The pitch of the whine is enough to drive most insane. The real concern here is the wife and I are about to have twins (babies) in ~ 6 months. A legitimate concern comes out, I think l, as we live in a small place and if the babies to come will be able to sleep with the whining.</p>

<p>I've never given up on a pet and i'm not about to start. </p>

<p>We've only had two effective treatments: Benadryl worked for a few days. The only other thing that gets him to stop whining is my wife going to bed. He goes up there with her, gets into bed with her, and sleeps. </p>

<p>We have tried some tactics with no success: positive and negative reinforcement taking him out and giving him attention when he's not whining. When he does wine, as consistently as possible we will spray his feet with water from a squirt bottle.
We have been doing this fairly consistently for a bout 6 months. He's an old guy though and I don't suspect change in behavior with him will be easy.</p>

<p>I have never used a bark (shock) collar before. They come off as a little much. He's an old guy I don't think it's fair to put him through that.But we're at a tough spot, as it needs to stop.</p>

"Stray puppy wants to eat with its littermates but gets attacked whenever it does","<p>I usually feed milk to newly born stray puppies as soon as I come to know about their existence in my area. However, when the puppies grow enough, they start fighting.</p>

<p><strong>14 days ago</strong></p>

<p>Recently, among a litter of puppies, I found that one puppy was being beaten by the other puppies. That puppy became sad and for two days it did not drink milk or anything, so I moved it to a different area with a different bowl. But the problem was it was not eating anything.</p>

<p><strong>After 3 days</strong></p>

<p>I took it to the vet hospital and the vet gave it injections and provided a bottle with glucose solution. After the puppy drank from the bottle, it had some energy and started to drink water. For two days I gave it the syrup given by the vet and fed it separately from the other puppies.</p>

<p><strong>After 4 days</strong></p>

<p>After 4 days, it started drinking milk, but it still wasn't eating anything. Unfortunately though it also seemed that <strong>it was now strongly interested in making a group</strong> with those other puppies again. It started not drinking milk which was given separately in its personal bowl and started going to the bowl provided for the other puppies.</p>

<p>The other puppies, on seeing it, started barking and attacking it again, and it again became distressed. It again started not eating anything and drinking anything. </p>

<p>Because of the syrup medicine, it was starving strongly, and still not drinking the milk that was in its bowl and instead trying to drink from the other puppys' bowl. So all of them were jumping on it and barking. One of them injured it and injured the area near its ear and eye, drawing blood. This happened in my absence but my friend told me what happened. All the puppies are vaccinated.</p>

<p>I now feel that even though I do any medicines it will not work. The glucose bottle never works. I spent a lot of time with the puppy to make it feel safe - it sleeps on my legs, it plays with me, but when it comes for food, it still goes to the other puppies to be bullied. It feels very sad and hungry but still not eating separately and it is still interested in being bullied.</p>

<p><strong>What is more important? Letting the puppy bond with the other puppies, or making sure it eats?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Today, I saw that the puppy was again attacked by the other puppies and was again forced to leave the territory. I made it its separate area, a safe place nearby. It finally ate food separately today, but now it is scared. It still visits the other puppies when we are away. The other puppies do not bark at it unless it tries to eat from their bowl. So the fight is for the bowl, not for food. Today I put too much food in both the bowls - both bowls were full and the food was mostly wasted.</p>

"Betta laying on bottom of floor with no outward signs of illness... why?","<p>My betta has been in a 6 gallon (23 litres) planted tank with 5 ember tetras and a couple of dwarf shrimp for about 2 weeks now. He and the tetras seem to get along fine (no aggressive signs from any of them) but the shrimp live in fear of the betta so we decided to give him his own tank. Also we have sand substrate and the betta seemed to like to chew and spit out grains so we thought gravel would be better for him.</p>

<p>The new tank set up is as follows:
5 gallon heated to about 75 degrees (24 deg C) with amazon sword, tropical ferns, mopani wood and gravel. Only tank mate is a nerite snail. We used Prime to dechlorinate the water and added API quick start. </p>

<p>After setting up the tank and waiting about 9 hours, we introduced the betta. Less than 24 hours later the betta was laying on the floor of the tank most of the time. The water parameters seem fine, 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites, 0 nitrates, 7.6 pH (same pH as previous tank). </p>

<p>One last thing, the water in the new tank did look a little murky but I don't know why... we cleaned the gravel, boiled the wood and did not feed him in the new tank. (maybe it was due to some tannins leaking from the wood)</p>

<p>We reintroduced him into the old tank today and although he is a bit more active, he still lays long periods of time at the bottom of the tank. We've checked him and doesn't show any physical damage. </p>

<p>If there are no signs of illness why might he be acting this way? Also any suggestions on treatment? Or should we just give him some time?</p>

<p>I really appreciate any insight into my problem with my betta. </p>

"Is my Shih Tzu puppy underfed? How can I help her?","<p>We have a ""princess type"" shih tzu (the small type, but not teacup type, which are the smallest), and she's about 4+ months old by now.</p>

<p>To cut the story short, we think we've gotten ill advice on how to feed our puppy and we think we've been giving her way too little food since we got her. (Something like 2 tablespoons of kibbles per meal 2 x day) </p>

<p>We do give her multi vitamins 2x / day as well, and treats every now and then. </p>

<p>Only this week (at 4 months) did we start to increase it to about a small cup /meal x2 day  since she seems bigger now (thinking that the bigger she is the more food she'll be needing).</p>

<p>We are receiving feedback from friends that our puppy seems skinny (underneath that fluffy hair of hers) and they could feel her ribs. </p>

<p>I researched on Google and I was horrified to read that growing puppies need a lot of food to ""properly develop"", up to about 4 months, and even some articles saying to let puppy eat till she is full!! (watching out for those overfeeding of course.) </p>

<p>So this has got me worried.</p>

<p>Should I be worried? She seems healthy and happy and playful and has a strong appetite. </p>

<p>So now I'm thinking about increasing her food a bit more than required to kind of make up for it.</p>

<p>She's about 5 lbs now. </p>

<p>Should we be feeding her more? Are there other things we should be doing?</p>

"What could cause my dog to bite/pull her own hair out?","<p>The title pretty much says it - my dog, Chewy, has been biting and pulling the hair out on her front arms. Her name was given before this problem started. :)</p>

<p>It's not every day, and I cannot find a pattern but about every week or so I'll come home from work to chunks of hair pulled out around the house (normally all in the same area where she was laying), or wake up to what sounds like carpet being ripped out, which is an awful sound.</p>

<p>This has been happening for probably a year and a half.</p>

<p><strong>About my dog</strong></p>

<p>She is about 2.5 years old and is a Chow/Lab mix. She is honestly the nicest dog I have ever been around and NEVER gets aggressive (I only mention that because I know it is common for Chows to be aggressive/protective).</p>

<p>She was fixed as soon as she was old enough. </p>

<p><strong>What we've done/tried so far</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Keep her hair trimmed (especially around her arms/paws) because we thought that the length might be bothering her (and if it were shorter she might not be able to bite it as much). This had little to no effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Taken her to the vet, several times. The vet thinks Chewy has anxiety issues, which I agree with completely. We've tried a couple of different medications, the latest being Amitriptyline HCL, but haven't had any luck.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Her anxiety</strong></p>

<p>We've moved 3 times since we've had Chewy, which I think has contributed to her anxiety of being in a new place. However, we've been at our new house since July 2014 so I would hope that wouldn't be an issue now.</p>

<p>She also has a fascination with being under things. Coffee tables, end tables, chairs, our bed, anything she can fit under, she'd rather be under it. She sleeps under our bed every night, and is under our coffee table in front of me as I type this. I've read this could have something to do with feeling protected. </p>

<p>I should also mention that she isn't shy at all. She has no issues with people or people coming over, etc.; she greets anyone and everyone pretty much immediately. That is why I am unsure about her feeling ""unprotected"" when she is always under something.</p>

<p><strong>Allergies</strong></p>

<p>I am not 100% sure that Chewy has allergies, but she might. When she was a puppy, our vet told us that she <em>might</em> have allergies and suggested we switch to a grain-free food. She's been on grain-free food ever since, although we aren't too particular when it comes to treats, etc., not having grains. She doesn't appear to have allergies to me (but I am not a vet and she hasn't been tested for allergies to my knowledge).</p>

<p><strong>Bathing</strong></p>

<p>I've also considered the fact that she might have dry skin, which could cause itching and thus her biting her arms. She honestly isn't bathed very often. She's an indoor dog but we really only bathe her when she absolutely needs it (i.e. gets muddy outside). I'm wondering if she needs to be bathed more often, possibly with a shampoo that can moisturize her skin?</p>

<p>Here is what her arm looks like right now, you can see the baldness (this is her left arm), although it doesn't look <em>that</em> bad right now:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/v1KEv.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Is toy destruction a sign that my dog needs more exercise?","<p><strong>Short Story</strong></p>

<p>Is my dog doing ok? He destroys toys, but not other stuff (yet). He gets 2 walks a day, each is 2 miles and 1 hour in duration. He is alone and sleeps during the day (9 hours) He's 2 years old.</p>

<p>Mostly it's the toy destruction that has me wondering: is he getting enough exercise or is it just his personality? He LOVES chewing his toys. I'm fine with getting more expensive/durable toys, but I don't want to mask an underlying exercise need that isn't being met.</p>

<p><strong>Long Story</strong></p>

<p>I adopted a 2 year old American Staffordshire Terrier / Boxer mix a week ago. I take him for a 2 mile / hour long walk morning and evening before meals.</p>

<p>He's alone for 9-10 hours per day while I'm at work. I leave the radio on, have a video chat  with him at lunch, and give him a Kong with wet food for entertainment. I do not have a backyard.</p>

<p>He cries for 2-5 minutes after I leave, then he sleeps all day. He usually grabs 1 or 2 things he's not supposed to during the day. He doesn't destroy them or heavily chew them, just leaves them strewn about my apartment. He does destroy his toys however.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to eventually play fetch with him in the morning for 30 minutes, but I'm waiting until I have a better idea how he is around other dogs. He'll always have a muzzle if there are other dogs and I'll try long line training first.</p>

"Is it a bad idea to make different-sized dogs sleep in different rooms?","<p>As we are getting further into winter, the temperature gradient in my house (at night) has increased: the conservatory is cold, the kitchen is room-temperature, and the living room is warm (there are lots of radiators in there).</p>

<p>Now, I have three dogs: a small Cavachon with thin fur, a medium-sized Labernese with quite thick fur, and a huge Bernese mountain dog with very thick fur.</p>

<p>Is it a good idea to make these dogs sleep in different rooms (the Cavachon in the living room, the Labernese in the kitchen, and the Bernese in the conservatory), so that they are at their most comfortable temperature, or is it better to make them all sleep in the same room (making at least two of them uncomfortable)?

"Strategy for taking in two very young, non-socialized stray cats","<p>Two very young cats (siblings) moved into my yard and the surrounding properties. They first appeared when they were about 3-4 months old(?) and they're probably 5-6 months old now. I would like to take them in. They appear healthy and active; unfortunately, they do not appear to be socialized &mdash; at least they will not let me near them (yet). I don't know if their parents were feral, but I know kittens born to feral cats can be socialized at an early age. </p>

<p>I started feeding them about a week ago. They still run off when I go outside, but they're returning within minutes now that I leave them food on a regular basis. I put their bowls near a large sliding glass door leading into our living room, so they're becoming more accustomed to seeing me moving about the house. They're starting to sit near the door in the evening waiting for dinner, but when I approach the door, they run off.</p>

<p>How should I proceed? Are there any techniques to help them get used to me and (hopefully) more socialized? Is there anything else I can do?</p>

<p>We've become quite fond of them, and I want to give them every chance. </p>

<p>Update, one of the cats cautiously approached me as I was setting out their food today. I held my hand out and she rubbed on it and eventually let me pet her a bit. She was a bit apprehensive but I sat calm and quiet and she started to purr and vocalize a bit. The other cat is still much more skittish.</p>

"Why do my cats get cuddly in these rooms only?","<p>My cats are almost one year old and I
ve had them for around 8-9 months. I've been noticing for a good month now, that both of them enjoy cuddling in the toilet and bathroom. Yes, toilet room is separate and on the opposite end of the corridor to the bathroom. </p>

<p>I will be quite blunt here - When I go to toilet to do my stuff, my cats always imply on me opening the door, only to get inside and go around my legs and jump on my lap. They look more joyous than they normally do. They jump towards my hand for a cuddle, they lick my fingers, bite them playfully etc. I thought that it was something to do with the door being closed - as I read many other questions, cats 'panic' when the doors are closed anywhere! - but turns out it makes no difference. I went once without closing the door and the same thing happened. </p>

<p>Then at some point the same thing kept happening in the bathroom, whenever for example I was brushing my teeth, washing hands, or anything else. They'd go around my legs and do everything mentioned previously. </p>

<p>They don't ever do that in any other rooms. They'd obviously stick their head out for some head scratching but that lasts for a few seconds. In the toilet room and bathroom it can last for half an hour.</p>

"Is my cat pulling its fur out due to a lack of teeth?","<p>My cat has begun to pull his fur out while grooming. At first, I thought it might be an allergic reaction, as was indicated by a Google search, but I have since dismissed that theory. My cat is not <em>overgrooming</em>, he's just grooming normally (I also removed several things that might be causing an allergic reaction: room fresheners and diet change - no change). My cat is indoor only. </p>

<p>What I have noticed is that my cat no longer 'chews' when grooming. This behavior has been replaced by pulling the fur out wholesale. I have three cats, and while grooming they all pause and seem to 'nibble' or 'chew' on a certain area for a moment, before moving on. I've always assumed this is normal behavior. My cat now no longer does this, and is instead pulling his fur out. </p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is my cat doing this? Is there something I can do to prevent it? </p>

<p><strong>Important Factors:</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li>I noticed this change shortly after my cat had dental surgery. He had
a lot of teeth removed, including almost all of his molars, and one
lower incisor. Aside from the incisor, his front teeth remain intact. I'm beginning to wonder if this lack of teeth is causing my cat to pull his fur out, though I'm not sure why it would. </li>
<li>I no longer let my cat eat dry food, due to the surgery mentioned above. He wants to eat it, but cannot chew it. This results in him swallowing it whole, where it sits in a lump in his stomach and slowly expands with the moisture (the food is very hard and dry). I let my cat have small amounts of dry food on occasion, but otherwise feed him only canned wet food (which he eats fine cut up). </li>
</ul>

"Associating vocal command with behavior during clicker training (cats)","<p>I've been clicker training my youngest cat (Romeo, 3-4 years old, male, neutered). He associated the clicker with a treat, and now we're working on ""down"" (as in, jump off the counter you troublemaker).</p>

<p>He knows that during a training session (we work in the bedroom away from the other cats) that if he jumps off the bed he gets a click and treat. So he'll jump up and down off the bed repeatedly (without the voice command) and then make frustrated noises at me for not rewarding him. Once he's done that a few times, and sits down, I'll give him the ""down"" command (a few times) and when he jumps down I reward him.</p>

<p>Am I responding to him in the right way (and he just needs more repetition to associate the voice command with the behavior?), or should I be doing something else. I don't like to see him get so frustrated at not getting the reward, but I've never done clicker training before. Is the frustration part of the process?</p>

Admittedly, I made some mistakes along the way due to ignorance and would give anything to turn back the clock and do at least a couple of things differently, but unfortunately that is not an option.  Still, I'd like to know what might have caused its death and can't afford a <a href=""https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/necropsy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>necropsy</strong></a>.  Does anyone know of someone who does pro bono necropsies?  Please offer your recommendations if you do.  In the meantime, I am wondering if the following development isn't some sort of clue to what might have caused the kitten's demise.</p>

<p>The kitten must have died between 3 and 6 a.m. on the 26th of May.  It has now been more than 48 hours since its death (yes, we need to bury it soon).  Its belly is now very round and bloated. Does this reveal anything about what may have caused it to die? It also has developed small tear-drop shaped darkish skin scales on the right side of its abdomen (and also one long thin oval at the bottom of its belly. The skin scales are dark gray in color.  Does this also reveal anything about its condition or what caused it to die?</p>

<p><strong>Additional information you may find helpful:</strong></p>

<p>We think the kitten (a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby_cat#Mackerel_tabby"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>mackerel tabby</strong></a> with brown striping), might have been born prematurely because it was pretty small when I first found it.  I had no idea what to do with it at first, but I eventually put it in a cage with another cat we have who had a litter of seven healthy kittens about a month prior to my finding this orphaned kitten.  (The orphaned kitten is from a different mother.)  Though the mother of seven didn't seem crazy about adding an eighth kitten to the mix, she wasn't opposed to it either, so I thought it would all work out.</p>

<p>A day or two later, however, during a routine check on these kittens, I found one of the older kittens sitting on the orphaned kitten's head (I think it was trying to quiet it) and the orphaned kitten had (for lack of a better way of expressing it) pooped itself with a somewhat sizeable yellowish/brown stool that was somewhat watery, but firm.</p>

<p>At that point, I decided to take the orphaned kitten out of that environment, but then I didn't know what to feed it and I made the mistake of giving it some cow's milk (whole milk and organic). That was a huge mistake. Not long after that, it had a bout of vomiting and diarrhea. That's when I finally decided to go online and do a bit of research (discovering that cow's milk is a big no no) and found a goat's milk formula to use (which called for goat's milk, yogurt (I also used goat's milk yogurt), water, and egg yolk. The orphaned kitten did not expel for quite some time after that, but then when it did, its stools looked really healthy -- brown, firm, fully formed. I was really happy about this development, but then, all of a sudden, the orphaned kitten had two bowel movements on one day (the 21st). This time, however, the stools were fully formed and solid, but very light colored, yellowish, and were expelled with a bit of water.  I thought maybe I was heating the formula up too much, so I pulled back on that a bit and subsequent stools were still light yellow (kind of a mustard color), sometimes hard, large and fully formed and at other times, soft, but I stopped seeing watery, loose bowel movements.</p>

<p>Another detail of importance is the kitten's temperature.  In the beginning, this orphaned kitten was often cold when I picked it up, but in the days leading up to its death, it seemed to occasionally be holding on to some sort of body temperature of its own.</p>

<p>When I saw that the bowel movements were returning to normal and some type of evidence that it was beginning to maintain some sort of body temperature, I had thought it had made it through the danger zone, especially since it seemed to be crying a lot less and appeared to be doing some sort of imprinting -- long steady gazes into the faces of those who held it.  To find it dead was a complete shock to say the least.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've gone online and tried to research this and I've seen posts that indicate it might be some sort of problem related to an underdeveloped intestinal tract, any number of diseases kittens may contract, and even a heart problem.  Nothing, thus far, however, has been all that conclusive.  Furthermore, my search for skin scales on dead kittens is proving to be pretty futile, but I can't help but wonder if this is an important detail that might narrow it down a bit.</p>

<p>I've attached some photos to help you help me make sense of this little kitten's death.  It won't bring it back to life, but any insight you can lend might bring me (and perhaps others in a similar predicament) a little bit of closure.</p>

"Stress relief of parakeets? Is vegetable glycerine safe for parakeets/ small birds?","<p>I just brought home a baby parakeet. I know the typical recommendation for having a parakeet is either provide it with enough attention that it accepts you as it's flock or give it a buddy. My intention is to keep him as a lone parakeet, that attaches to me  vs another bird in its cage. I know this process may take some time for him to warm up to me but until he trusts me I know he will be a little stressed (he's a baby so he will adapt But he was caged with 8 other parakeets and is now alone). </p>

<p>I have read that rescue remedy flower essences for pets is ""safe"" for birds because it's base is vegetable glycerin instead of alcohol but it comes in a dropper bottle and I can't find info on how much to give him. I could see giving one or two drops in a larger parrots water being of little concern but I wonder about the dosage and safeness for a tiny bird like my budgie. </p>

<p>What's the dosage?
Does anyone know if vegetable glycerin could cause diarrhea? Or has anyone used this on birds before? If so, how much did you give? By mouth or in water dish? Does anyone have any other tips on what would be a good stress relieving supplement instead? I just want to make him as comfortable as possible, I'm much more used to larger birds, and know budgies have sensitive bodies and that stress can literally kill them.</p>

<p>Background, behavior and Environment Info: he's between 2-3 months old. His cage is placed in view of my cockatiel, but not within reach of each other. The room he's in has the most amount of activity so he's never in dead space. He's already stepping up onto my finger, and will hang onto my shirt, but doesn't hang out for more than 5minutes before getting wiggly, as of yet. He has plenty of toys and perches, and he has ample water and seed (the same kind he was on at the pet store until I've had him long enough to switch). A spray of millet is available. I cover him at night. He's strictly indoors. He didn't eat food for the first day except a little millet, but is eating now. It's day 3. He had what I'd assume was stress induced diarrhea for the first 24hrs, I assume stress because it went away after he started eating again. He was not hand fed or hand raised and has no ankle band. The store he came from does not allow customer interaction with them which is good for stress and contamination while there, but not so good for human socialization or hand recognition. He made little chirping sounds at the pet store but hasn't made a sound until tonight... After covering him it sounded like he was purring himself to sleep.</p>

<p>Active Ingredients: HPUS 5x dilution of Helianthemum, Hummularium, Clematis Vitalba, Impatiens glandulifera, Primus cerasifera, Ornithogalum umbellatum. Inactive Ingredients: 80%Glycerin 20%water. The active ingredients are the Latin names for the different flower essences.</p>

"Cat is tipping over bed-side lamps during the night","<p>I've had my newest cat just a couple months.  This is a female spay DSH tortie, shelter rescue, estimated age 1.5 years.</p>

<p>I have small tables at each head corner of my bed, holding various things on shelves at different levels, including a telephone, my alarm clock, tissues, a mini first-aid kit, books I am reading before bed, and each has a small lamp on the top.  These lamps are just over a foot tall, and maybe 8 or 9 inches diameter on the shades (about 35-40cm tall, 20-25cm dia).</p>

<p>As she has become more comfortable in her new home and with me as her human, she has taken on a new hobby.  The cat has been rubbing against the shades of these lamps while I am sleeping, and frequently rubbing hard enough to tip it over onto the floor.  Fortunately in this age of plastic LED bulbs, there is really no harm done, though the shades might be getting lightly wrinkled.  The biggest problem here is the sudden jolting awake this causes for me.  Unfortunately, this means I am not really able to issue a proper corrective action.</p>

<p>I have noticed this happens mostly in the hour before wake-up time- 0545 for me, but it has happened as early as 0200.  I wonder if it might be a deliberate attempt to get me up for breakfast, although it doesn't work, I just put the lamp back and go back to sleep.</p>

<p>I considered spraying the lamps with a citrus oil, as I have used this successfully in other places.  But I find that <em>I</em> do not like that smell either, and these lamps are very near my nose while sleeping.  I also considered trying some sort of adhesive on the bottom of the lamp, but I am not sure what kind would work well, yet still allow adjusting or shifting the lamp when desired.</p>

<p>Has anyone had a similar situation, and any other suggestions of things to try?</p>

<p>Updates/ Response to some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Screws.  This would be an absolute desperate last resort in my mind.  These lamps and tables have value as aesthetic as well as practical objects, and I can't justify ruining that.</li>
<li>Kick the cat out.  Cat has her own bed in the bedroom, and prefers to sleep there.  I have rarely rolled over to find her against my leg or around my feet. Far more often if I wake up at night, she is in her own bed.  As mentioned, this cat is still relatively new to me, so this may change as we become better friends, and if so, <em>I will enjoy it</em>.  I also prefer the air flow with the door open- it gets stuffy when closed.</li>
<li>Inverted spike-y mats.  Although others swear it works, in my experience, this is a myth.  My prior cat genuinely enjoyed lying on the stuff.  Current cat totally ignores it.  Plus, the tables are small enough and close enough to the bed to keep the lamps in scent-rubbing reach even with rear paws on the bed, and fore paws just on the edge of the table.</li>
<li>Command brand picture hanging strips.  This was an excellent suggestion and I had some left over from, what else, hanging pictures.  I put two pieces on the base of each lamp yesterday evening, and this morning at 0509 I hear ""rip -  clunk - crash.""  Careful examination in the morning revealed the flaw- the strips have thickness, raising the lamp up by a few millimeters.  Plus, these strips have a lot of ""play"" in them side-to-side.  So when pushed in the direction opposite the axis of how I placed the strips, actually produced a levering effect making it <em>easier</em> to tip over.  I am going to add a third strip perpendicular to the other two and try again.  Fingers crossed.</li>
<li>Replace the lamps with head-board mounted kinds.  I will do some shopping and see what I can come up with.  My headboard is of the upholstered style, and rather thick.  There are some boards along the back side I might be able to get a screw into if I pull the bed out.  I'm not confident I can find anything, but I will look.</li>
</ul>

<p>Going Further:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why?  Is the cat just scent marking, or is she trying to wake me up either for breakfast or simple attention?  So far, she has only done this at night, or at least, I have never observed her rubbing the lamps except at night.  And so far, only once in the middle of the night, and far more often in the hour before scheduled alarm clock time.  I really can't say for sure.  Deliberate wake-up attempt is of course a valid hypothesis, but I doubt we could ever prove it.  I think it best to begin by assuming (for now) it is simple marking behavior, and the tipping is accidental.</li>

<li>Brutus has tried to hump the cats before, but not to the extent I'm describing now.</li>
<li>All animals have been eating without any problems.</li>
<li>All animals have been relieving themselves without any problems.

"could my cat catch something from this oddly-acting mouse?","<p>So this all started at one A.M., when I usually go down to get a cat to lay with me in bed. When I opened the door to let them in, I noticed that our oldest kitty had something in his mouth, so I went to investigate.</p>

<p>It was a mouse. A living, squeaking mouse.</p>

<p>The second the cat saw me look at the thing, he dropped it, and I managed to get a basket over it before my other cats could kill the poor thing. I put him outside and, after a moment, he started to move! I was really happy, but I noticed some odd behaviour, and I want to make sure that my kitty isn't in any danger.</p>

<p>At first, he fidgeted a bit, clearly coming out of shock, and then began to wash the saliva off of himself. As he got up to move, I noticed that he was moving in lazy circles. Not constantly, only three or four times, and he'd stop to groom himself or have a sniff at something, so I'm wondering if he was cleaning his tail? Then again, I've also seen that rabies or plasmodium symptoms could cause circling. Or perhaps the shock of it all?</p>

<p>As I'm writing this, it's about ten minutes since I saw him circling, and he's no longer in sight of my window. What do you guys think? Should I be worried?</p>

"Why did my mother cat suddenly attack me?","<p>My nice and well behaved Siamese delivered her first litter 6 weeks ago. We had a very strong bond, she would sleep with me and I was her favorite human. She trusted me enough to go in labor lying on me which tells a lot about our relationship. First month after the labor everything was perfect, she was bringing me kittens or she would leave me with them alone while she takes a nap somewhere quiet. I didn't touch them too much, but they all loved sleeping on me together with mamma. 2 weeks ago when they were all sleeping behind me I turned around to check on them and mamma cat suddenly jumped on my face and started attacking me viciously. She would not stop, I barely escaped and closed myself in a room. I got some pretty serious injuries all over my body. 
I called for help and we managed to lock her up. She wouldn't let me near her next two days and I somehow managed to get her food inside. Now she seems to be fine when the kittens are not around, she even comes for pets and sleeps on my lap, but when kittens come near me she gets upset and attacks the same way if I make any suspicious moves. The biggest problem is that kittens are very active now and it's hard to keep them in one room. I thought things would get better now that they're bigger, but it only gets worse. Will my cat trust me again? How will she react when kittens leave in 2 weeks?</p>

"rats not getting along,rats too young?","<p>Im a new rat owner, and Iv'e gotten three rats at the moment. As a new rat owner I made the mistake of not getting my first rat in a pair or group and I got the largest one at the pet store. His name is Walter and he was put as the ""Jumbo rat."" He had healing or healed bite marks and bruises on his tail. I had him for a few days then got all this information about rats needing to be in pairs or groups because of how social they are. </p>

<p>So I got two new ""medium rats."" Victor and Charles (I've had the babies for five days now). I have a large tank and a carrier at the moment but no barred cages because of money issues. I've been putting the rats in neutral areas and they've been great together. I put them in the carrier for awhile and they did well in there, not fighting but just sniffing and sleeping beside each other. </p>

<p><strong>But, whenever I have them all in the tank it all just goes down.</strong> Victor and Walter seem to be the ones fighting for dominance and Charles is the calm one that always gets brought into it. Victor squeaks quite loudly at Walter, I'm not sure if its because of how he's scared of the larger rat or its a dominance thing? And it seems to stress Walter out or irritate him then a fight happens. I break it up, though. I'm not sure if I should let it go until it gets bad. <strong>But I think its all because I'm introducing them wrong?</strong></p>

<p>I have put the carrier in the tank, so they know each other's smells. I put the lid on at night and when I'm out then when I'm at home I take it off and watch them. <strong>As soon as Victor or Charles step out of the carrier a fight happens.</strong> I've been checking the two for any wounds and they have scratches and bites on them. Charles even has a small bite wound on his head which worries me terribly. I don't know what I should do and it's all been putting me in a terrible mental state.</p>

"5-month puppy first day at home: guarding couch, growling, biting","<p>Apologies for the long post in advance!</p>

<p>After our beloved Dobermann passed away some time ago, we decided to get a new dog. We picked a cute 5-month mixed race puppy from a local shelter. In the shelter she looked lovely: active, curious, loving of human interaction, very good relationship with the rest of dogs, etc. She did look like the perfect dog for us.</p>

<p>Today we picked her up from the shelter and took her home. She was great, very excited all the way, and very loving. But after 30 minutes of snooping around the house, she jumped on the couch.</p>

<p>I thought 'here we go', and simply picked her up and put her down on the floor, saying 'Off'. Same thing we did with our previous dog when she was a puppy, and it wasn't a big deal. It just takes some repetition and conviction.</p>

<p>So down she went to the floor, and 5 minutes later she jumped again. So i picked her up again, and then she growled a bit. I thought 'wow, this one's bold'. After 3 or 4 more attempts, the growling started to become serious. I remained calm and kept putting her down on the floor, saying 'Off'.
A little bit later, I was in the kitchen when I heard my wife yell at the dog. The dog had snapped at her and she was quite upset and afraid to pick her up. So I grabbed the dog again, she growled very menacingly and tried to bite me too.</p>

<p>The situation got worse progressively. After 3 or 4 more attempts, the puppy would growl at us just by getting anywhere near the sofa. I knew we had to stand our ground, or else she would just be reinforced in her behaviour. So I tried sitting in the couch as close as possible so that she wouldn't growl, then slowly inch towards her, trying to 'claim' the space back by spreading my legs, square shoulders, and so on. When I was close enough I just picked her up again and tried to put her on the floor and then she bit me in the arm. The teeth didn't get past the thick sweater I was wearing but it was a bite nonetheless.</p>

<p>After some hesitation, I was determined to take the dog away from the couch. So I wrapped my arm with a thick blanket and picked her up and put her down again, and she tried to bite me, a lot. After she was on the floor we took her out to the garden and waited til she was calm, then i put her on leash and let her free again.</p>

<p>Now we're just sitting on the couch and every time she jumps on the couch, I just pull the leash and put her down. Oddly enough, this does not seem to upset her and she goes back to her dog bed after that. She's now sleeping in her bed looking all cute and innocent, waiting for the next opening... This has been going on for about 1 hour now and I'm writing during this break in the hostilities to ask you people, how weird is this? 
I've been reading online and this seems to be a common problem with dogs, but it seems to happen with people who start by letting the dogs on the furniture, and then the dogs become possessive/dominant over time and etc. This also usually happens with teenage dogs, not puppies. </p>

<p>This dog has been with us for a total of 6 hours, and I know for a fact she's never ever seen a couch before in her life, since she was abandoned when she was days old and left at the shelter together with her brothers. She hasn't been abused or had any incidents that might explain this.</p>

<p>It's also strange that she seems to click out of this behaviour as soon as she touches the floor. 5 minutes after biting me, she was all sweet and licking my hand and following me around the house like nothing ever happened.</p>

<p>Do you think this is just her testing the waters and trying to find her place, and will go away soon? Or is it an indication of some kind of problem? We plan to have children soon and I'm not having an unstable / nippy dog around the house when that happens.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> as per suggestions in comments, we tried putting some unwashed clothes on the dog bed. This seemed to work for a while. After an uneventful night, we are now more or less back to the situation of yesterday, minus the biting because we use the leash to pull her off the couch, but the growling continues. We will now seek advice from an ethologist to try to find a solution for this. In the meantime, any suggestions or thoughts are very welcome. </p>

"Should a cat's nose be wet or dry?","<p>My cat's nose is usually very moist. However, today I found it to be very hot and dry. I've searched about that, but the Internet seems really divided about the subject; some says a dry nose means a sick cat and others that it's a wet nose...</p>

"What effect does the number of littermates have on the appetite of a kitten?","<p>My ragdoll kitten is now 5 months old and it has developed a somewhat stout body. The healthy cat body figures I've found are showing an adult cat. By these figures my kitten is overweight, but as it is still a kitten I've not paid much attention - until recently.</p>

<p>This ragdoll kitten is one of six. In my mind I see him fighting for food when he was still living with his littermates. We received him at the age of 13 weeks. Now, I'm comparing this ragdoll to our two years old Maine coon, whom we received when she was 15 weeks old. The Maine coon was, and <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/1618/278"">still is</a>, quite a lean bodied kitten/cat. As far as I know she is one of three littermates and therefore would not have needed to fight for food.</p>

<p>Is it possible that the number of littermates has an effect on the kitten's appetite later in life? We have dry food on constant offer for our cats, and we serve wet food without a firm schedule two or three times a day. The ""largelitter"" ragdoll attacks wet food like he was starving to death, while the ""small-litter"" Maine coon stays away and goes to eat only after all our other cats have left the vicinity of food plate(s).</p>

<p>So, is this just coincidental to these kitten and cat that we have, or is it generally true? Additionally, should I pay attention to this when shaping our feeding policy and habits?</p>

"Would a sailfin dragon get along with a cat?","<p>I've read that Sailfin Dragons a quite receptive of human handling and can make pretty good pets. I'm curious if that means they would get along with other animals too.</p>

<p>I have two cats, and they're both well behaved around reptiles. They show some interest in the smaller lizards that scurry about suddenly, but other than that they ignore them (they're well aware they would be in huge trouble with me if they bothered any of the reptiles).</p>

<p>Still, I acknowledge that most reptiles see cats as predators, and there's a short period where it takes them to get used to their presence and realize that they're perfectly safe. What I'm curious about, is that since sailfin dragons get to be about a meter long, would they consider my cats to be predators at all? A meter is a little over 3 feet long and easily larger than both of my cats.</p>

<p>The reason I'm interested in them, is that they're supposed to be a more reasonable cousin of iguanas, but should I worry about them attacking my cats? How well would a sailfin dragon get along with a cat?</p>

"What is ""crating"" a dog?","<p>First; this is not to ask for a <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/1276/278"">step-by-step training</a> advice.</p>

<p>There are many <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/search?q=%5Bdogs%5Dcrate"">questions and answers on Pets-SE</a> that mention ""crating"" and ""crate-training"" a dog. First time I personally found crate-training was in this question:</p>

<p><a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/1793/278"">Crate training our puppy is not working?</a></p>

<p>Having my doubts I went to Google it, to find <a href=""http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/cratetraining.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""How to Crate Train your dog or puppy.""</a> which I read until this <em>""Never close the door until the dog is relaxed and comfortable.""</em> came up. Of course I read the rest of the article too, but that quote is what made me ask this.</p>

<p>Okay, we had a crate for our dog too. The crate was there for the dog to go in to have a peaceful place to sleep and rest. Here's the difference, we <em>never</em> closed the door. At the moment we don't have any crate at home, except those disassembled ones in basement. I consider both of our dogs ""crate-trained"" so that they feel okay in a closed crate when we take them to a dog show. Maybe we are just lucky to have two such nice dogs that we can leave them home by themselves while the human members of our family are away at work and school.</p>

<p>So, the question. Why would I close the crate door at home? What <em>is</em> ""crating a dog"" really? What purpose has it, other than to offer a dog a safe place to sleep and rest?</p>

"Does my cat have eye worms?","<p>I managed to pull 5-6 strange elastic white-transparent <em>organisms</em> from Toby's eyes. I never witnessed them move.</p>

<p>They're definitely not hairs, and using 19x macro lens took some pictures of them improvising a home-made microscope.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I took him to the vet, where we managed to pull one more worm (?) from the eye and vet examined it using his microscope. He seemed confused and unsure. I am from Europe and the only parasite here that infests cats eyes is <em>Thelazia callipaeda</em>, so we assumed it should be it, although the vet admitted he couldn't identify body parts (morphology or whatever), and neither was moving. I also failed to find similarity between verified (cdc.gov) microscopic images of T. Callipaeda and my own kinda-microscopic images.</p>

<p>Anyway, we decided to move forward with Milbemax.</p>

"Is Cotton Wool an acceptable substitute for Hamster bedding?","<p>I've got two Roborovski Hamsters which both have good sized cages. I like to try and change their bedding frequently which obviously increases the cost of the bedding.</p>

<p>It seems there are two types of material required for a hamster:</p>

<ul>
<li>Absorbent shavings to cover the ground</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005AIPPVQ/ref=s9_acsd_top_hd_bw_bVufAN_c_x_2_w"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Softer bedding to build a bed with</a></li>

<ul>
<li>Perhaps cotton wool is less absorbent</li>
<li>Maybe the fibres would get caught around their legs or something?</li>

"Neighbor's cat coming back for kitten","<p>I've been looking around and haven't find someone in the same situation as I am, so I'm making my first question here.</p>

<p>About 1 1/2 month ago my neighbor's cat gave birth to 4 kittens in my basement. We don't know exactly when they were born, but we found them 5 1/2 weeks ago and 1 or 2 days later they opened their eyes.
We took care of the mother, giving her food and water and after she started leaving the den we spent some time with her close to it.</p>

<p>This weekend the neighbor took 3 of the kittens to new homes and we had already decided to keep 1 of them the day we found them.</p>

<p>Since the mother was away from the den more often than not and the kitten stayed there alone, we took it inside the house on monday afternoon.
The kitten spent the day under the bed (which I learned is common) and sometimes her mother came to the glass back door of the kitchen and started meowing.
The kitten was too afraid to leave my room and meowed back from my door, but as soon as someone moved she went back under the bed.</p>

<p>At the evening we sort of felt bad for the mom as she was meowing all around the house and gave back the kitten and they stayed around this back door on a covered outside area of the house.</p>

<p>We left the house and when we came back at night the mother was meowing again and we couldn't find the kitten.
After searching all monday night and the mother meowing through the night, yesterday morning we found the kitten under a canvas covering some stuff on a kind of ""covered roof terrace"" that we have.</p>

<p>Fearing what could happen with this adventurous kitty we took it back inside my room again. She spent part of the day under the bed again and when her mother meowed on the door she meowed back by my door or from under the bed.
At night she started going to the glass door and meowing face to face with her mom.
As far as we can tell the kitten slept through the night in my room, only starting to meow to her mom at the early morning.</p>

<p>Today we let the kitten with her mom again some time, blocking the exits, basically confining the kitten to this covered outside area and inside the house (the mom can jump the blocks). She tried to drink some milk and they played and ate some dry cat food and drank water together.</p>

<p>Since we never had a cat I don't know if what we're doing is right, given the circumstances.
Should we keep letting them have some time together during part of the day and separate them for most of the day and all night, even though they meow for each other and see each other through the glass? I don't know if this can harm them psychologically, especially the kitten. Will the mother eventually just ""abandon"" the kitten?
When the mother goes away the kitten comes back to my room and she has improved a lot more than I expected. She plays with a paper ball I gave her and last night she was exploring my room and even slept by my feet, played with me and let me pet her a little.</p>

<p>Sorry for writing almost a book of backstory, I really tried to trim it down a lot, but I also wanted to give as much information as possible and sometimes I'm very wordy.</p>

<p>When looking on blogs, youtube videos, etc. general content from outside my country, all of them have completely banned these wood types as they are toxic to the hamsters.

"Canine insulin injection -- what am I doing wrong?","<p>My dog was recently diagnosed with diabetes, so I have been giving her twice-daily insulin injections for the past 10 days. I've watched my vet do it, I've watched dozens of YouTube videos, and I've read everything I can find about the proper technique, but somehow, I can't seem to get it right.</p>

<p>Every time I inject my dog, she fidgets when I insert the needle, but not overly much, but as soon as I begin to inject the insulin itself, she yelps and either jerks away, or tries to bite me. More than once I've ended up with bent syringes and insulin on her fur because of it.</p>

<p>I'm following the procedure as shown, for example, in this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jOEKUTU-Ac"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jOEKUTU-Ac</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Take the insulin out of the fridge and roll it around to mix it up.</li>
<li>Draw out slightly more than the needed dose into a new fresh syringe, tap out the air bubbles, then return the excess.</li>
<li>Allow the syringe to warm up in my hand for several minutes as I prepare and put out the dogs' food.</li>
<li>After my dog is finished her meal, I pull her onto my lap and find a place where the skin is loose. I have been rotating between left and right shoulder and left and right rump so far.</li>
<li>Pull up a fold of skin (""tent"" it) between my fingers.</li>
<li>Push the needle into the middle of the folder at ~45 degree angle</li>
<li>Slowly inject the contents of the syringe.</li>

<p>From everything I've read, this is supposed to be so painless that the dog may not even acknowledge that anything happened, but my dog is getting progressively more anxious each time I do it. I thought I would have gotten the hang of it by now, but I seem to be getting worse.</p>

<p>My main concern is that I'm doing something wrong and injecting the insulin incorrectly; my vet said something about making sure I was doing a subdural and not an intradermal injection, but how would I know? As far as I can tell I'm getting the needle beneath the skin correctly: it's hard to tell with my dog's long hair, but I'm not feeling any resistance to either the needle or the fluid, and the needle's not coming back out of the skin.</p>

How can you know if the trigger is inside or outside, in the food or something else, maybe it's just part of the diet, how do you tell?
As far as I can tell, it can take days or weeks before the symptoms are noticable.</p>

"New older cat coming into the house","<p>I have had my current cat for about 2 years now. She is a lovely manx. </p>

<p>3 months ago we moved to my parents house where there was a small foxy, who she was fine with, but never came closer than an arms length away from, sometimes she would hiss at him and try to claw him. But this was very rare.</p>

<p>Over the time I have had her I have only been scratched once, and that was surely on accident. </p>

<p>She is very play-full but loves to sleep all day as cats do. </p>

<p>We have just moved into a new larger home then we have had before and she seems to have been fitting in nicely with no other animals around. </p>

<p>However we have adopted a new cat who is about a year + older then her, and is a male. He seems nice and friendly. </p>

<p>What I want to know is how they might get along, and do you have any tips on introducing them to each other?</p>

<p>Will they use the same cat litter?
Will they eat the same dry food? - I am getting them two wet food bowls. But Marshmallow ( current cat ) tends to take a day or two to finish one bowl of food, she isn't really a big eater. </p>

"How to get kitten to stop playing with aluminum blinds","<p>I adopted a kitten in November, and she's nearly 6 months old now. Within the last couple of weeks, she's been trying to climb the aluminum blinds in my apartment. I prefer to keep the blinds down for most of the day as we live on the ground floor of our complex.</p>

<p>There are two sets of blinds in the apartment, one in the bedroom, and one smaller set in the living room. One suggestion we received was to put double-sided tape on the window sill to discourage her going on to it. It worked until she found she could step carefully in the areas we didn't/couldn't get to. I don't want to discourage her chilling in the window, or even climbing through the blinds to the other side to sit. What I'd like to discourage is her trying to climb the blinds.</p>

<p>Initially I believed it may be due to the cord hanging down, and she was trying to get a better reach at it, but when I pull the cord down to a more reachable distance, she still preferred to climb the blinds. This makes me believe that it's more of a <em>vertical</em> issue, rather than a <em>catching</em> issue. Her interest in them is also dependent on our proximity to the window. I don't spend a lot of time in the living room, but when I'm out there she tries to climb it, and every night when I go to bed, she tries to climb those.</p>

<p>I currently do not own any cat towers or anything of that nature, simply due to not having the requisite amount of space to put it anywhere, as well as the possibility that I may have to move in the near future.</p>

<p>Another suggestion we received was to buy a spray bottle and spray her with it when she tries to climb, which is good for immediate feedback, but terrible for all of the reasons you can find by googling it.</p>

<p>Is this being a vertical issue a safe assumption to make? If so, what sort of things can I try to get her to reduce, or stop her attempts at climbing up the blind? If not, what else might it be?</p>

"Yorkie vs. 10-month old son - how to deal with aggression","<p>I have a Yorkie named Master Chief and a 10-month old infant named Austin.  I think in general he has been a real sport about the new baby in the house.  It was a major change for all of us, but one he couldn't understand and certainly didn't ask for, so I give him a lot of credit there.  He has tolerated a lot.</p>

<p>Now that my son is crawling around like a mad-man, Chief's gotten a little more aggressive and I'm a <em>little</em> concerned. </p>

<p>One of Chief's major <s>malfunctions</s> quirks is a weird aggression towards people who touch him or his bed (except petting him, especially belly rubs) while in his bed.  If I ever try to move his bed or him, he will start to bite me.  I don't think he's trying to hurt me or draw blood, but he's not messing around either.  </p>

<p>He has exhibited this aggression towards my son if he crawls up to his bed while Chief is laying in it.  Chief's main bed is on our bed towards the foot.  Austin (my son) will usually breastfeed and then play in our bed for an hour or two in the morning and that's when that happens.  Chief also has another bed (for the daytime) in the living room, which he doesn't exhibit the same level aggression with, but he can still be pretty protective when he's laying in it.  Chief will stand up, puff up his chest and get this look in his eye and actually (on a few occasions) lunged with his teeth at my boy.  He left a visible mark on his face once (no blood).</p>

<p>We got a small plush ball (grapefruit sized) for Austin.  Chief immediately thought it was his and got pretty protective of it.  We correct him whenever possible or take it away, but this has caused a couple issues when Austin has grabbed the ball and Chief didn't like it.</p>

<p>Austin will occasionally grab one of Chief's toy balls and I've seen a few different actions.  I've seen Chief get aggressive, I've also seen him get playful like he wants Austin to throw the ball (of course he doesn't and at that point Chief usually tries to forcefully, but playfully, take it from him - and he usually accidentally hurts Austin at that point which we now try to avoid by not having Chief's balls around Austin).</p>

<p>There have been a couple other cases, some just (seemingly) completely random.  He's only left a mark that one time, but he's definitely lunged and bit a few times - usually either missing or me or my wife are there to grab him or push him in the nick of time.</p>

<p>We obviously (especially recently) don't leave them together without supervision.  We weren't too worried about this before.  Chief never had issues until Austin was about 7 months.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> So my question is: is there anything I can do to try to keep my Yorkie from exhibiting aggression when my 10-month old son crawls up to his bed while he's sleeping in it?  And what tips (in general) can you give me for taming his aggression towards my son in other situations?</p>

"Film on surface of female betta tank","<p>I recently took in one of my friends male Bettas to treat it for for ich (ichthyophhirius). When I brought him back I noticed a film on the surface of her other Betta's tank (this one is a female). It's a small 2 gallon hexagonal tank with a mini filter, that is made for 1-3 gallons and has a very slow trickle. The same filter is powered by a pump that also runs a bubbler that she has attached by a t-valve, so both have little power. It is to my knowledge that Bettas, especially in small tanks need little water movement due to the fact they naturally thrive in ditches and rice patties. But what I saw made me a little concerned. Her tank has film at the top. I used her net and swiped up the film best I could. It wasn't sludgy, it was actually more clear, almost white as it became dry. I asked her about it and she said that only her females tank does that. Her male is in an identical tank and he makes bubble nests all the time. She switched them from each having their own bowl to these tanks about 6 months ago and said her females bowl had the film then too.</p>

<p>I am familiar with the idea of a film being caused by a poor tank environment, algae, or not being clean enough but her water is clear, and her gravel looks clean too. I'd like to be able to recommend a fix for her if one exists but I'm not sure if this is normal for female bettas. She has no live plants and no other fish or invertebrates in either setup, so I'm confused by there being a difference.</p>

<p>What could this film be? Is there a film that only females make, possibly for reproduction? Or is this a sign that maybe her tiny setup isn't doing enough? Or a mix of both?</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros: the kittens might not have fully accepted their current location as their home, so bringing them home sooner should make the transition easier for them.</li>

"Training for Canine Parking Lot Anxiety (?)","<p>I am fortunate enough to be able to take my dog on an afternoon outing (nearly everyday) with the goal of wearing her out. We typically stop at one of the local grocers on the way home for any missing dinner ingredients. I have noticed that she occasionally displays somewhat anxious behaviors when I get back to the car. Some parking lots seem to upset her more than others.</p>

<p>This morning we ran an errand and I pulled into a parking lot to ""get one thing"". I stopped the car and my girl popped up onto the center arm rest, shaking. As if she was terrified of being there. Clearly an anxiety issue. My impromptu solution was to leave without going into the store. My pup is more important and after we drove off, she was fine again. </p>

<p>My guesses are:</p>

<ul>
<li>someone tried to reach into the car while she was alone (to pet her, or take her)?</li>
<li>the noise and general chaos of a busy parking lot overwhelms her</li>
<li>she saw something that upset her (which could be litterally anything)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm concerned about this. I can prevent it from happening again by never leaving her alone in the car again, but that doesn't seem very practical. Eventually I'll have to leave her in the car (for any number of reasons). Is there a realistic way to train her to not be afraid if she's alone in the car? Or some way to help her feel safer when she is?</p>

<p><em>Note: My dog gets 1-2 half hour walks, a 1-2 hour outing, and a beef neck bone to chew on (daily average). Outings = dog park playtime, off leash on wooded trails, learning to run beside my bicycle, etc.</em></p>

"Leave a dog alone during night/daytime?","<p>Where I live there are some regulations about leaving your pet alone. I don't know the details but I guess it is ok to leave a dog alone for a couple of hours, while fishes probably can be left alone for days as long as they are fed.</p>

<p>Anyway, I rarely leave my dog alone for more than an hour so it is not a problem anyway but I was thinking about the purposes behind this legislation and for dogs it is quite simple, they need to take a walk every few hours and they are pack animals that don't like to be left alone.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong>, every night when I sleep I leave the dog ""alone"" for 8-9 hours. Obviously this is fine because the dog mostly sleeps during the night anyway and, here is my question: does a dog who wakes up in the middle of the night and realise that its human is in the house feel alone because there is no interaction between human and dog? Or is it satisfied by being able to smell and hear the human?</p>

<p>And a second question: the answer to my first question is quite obviously something like ""most dogs are happy with being near a human during the night and don't need any direct interaction with the human to feel good"" but that might be because dogs, like humans, sleep during the night. However, I frequently take a 3-4 hour nap during the day when my dog is supposed to be awake and active. Is this ""cruel"" to the dog? The (sound) idea behind the legislation I mentioned in the beginning is that dogs need company and stimulation and, if I sleep during the day, I obviously can't provide my dog with that.</p>

<p>(I can add that my dog usually sleeps on the floor next to my bed when I take my naps. It doesn't do anything the indicates it is sad, annoyed or something like that. It might look bored but that isn't really connected to me sleeping: it looks bored now when I write this question because I don't play with it or stimulate it in any other way. But that's a dog's life, I guess!)</p>

"What would cause an oral polyp to recur in my cat?","<p>About a year ago my then-newly-adopted adult male cat had a small growth under his tongue, which my vet removed and biopsied.  It was a benign fibrous polyp, which I understand sometimes happens.</p>

<p>Now, almost a year later, he has another one (much smaller so far) in the same place.  My vet was surprised; she said they don't usually come back like that.  The surgeon who removed the first one happened to be there so we consulted her too, and she said she'd never seen that before and she believed she'd left a large enough ""buffer zone"" in removing the first one, but she'll leave a larger one this time.</p>

<p>My vet recommends removing and biopsying this one and I will follow that recommendation.  My question is: what might be causing this?  Should I expect it to happen yet again in the future?  Is there anything I should be doing to reduce the likelihood of recurrence?</p>

<p>The cat is estimated to be about 5 years old, indoor-only, and eats standard dry and canned food with the occasional treat.  He is missing several of his teeth (incisors); we don't know why (he came that way).  I understand that sometimes polyps form around foreign bodies; this was not the case the first time.  I'm not aware of any mouth injuries and he hasn't been in any fights involving biting.</p>

"At what age cats should stop biting and scratching games?","<p>I have a Maine Coon kitten who is 1.5 months old. When he's playful, he starts biting and scratching whenever he sees your arm next to him, and any hand movement is like an invitation to bite. Trying to put a hand on his back causes him to roll over and fight it with claws and teeth. Same is with feet. He even purrs when biting. He never purrs when playing with toys.</p>

<p>When he's sleepy, he's nice and sweet, purring and allowing to be petted. He sleeps next to us, so he doesn't hate us.</p>

<p>Different internet resources divide into two groups: some say 'He's just a kitten, it's totally fine, he'll stop', and others say 'If I don't teach him not to bite, he'll bite all his life'.</p>

<p>We've tried playing with him with toys, tried screaming when it's painful, tried spraying with water once, nothing seems to be working really. At most, he switches to something else, and next time he wants to bite again, he bites.</p>

<p>After few months(7 months) she became friendlier. I was very much attached to her. She used to stay out whole day and at night slept in our bathroom inside. </p>

<p>One day even after calling a lot of times she didn't come out of the bathroom, When I went inside she was <strong>struggling to walk. She had lost control of her rear legs and was trying to drag from the front feet.</strong> </p>

<p>I immediately took her to vet. The vet examined her . I informed that <strong>she had been attacked by a stray cat on her head a few months ago, but that had cured</strong> by now.  I was told that she's anemic and the vet put her some drips and injection(maybe pain killers) but couldn't really determine the cause of this sudden paralysis.</p>

<p>While she was still on that drips, <strong>she dilated her eyes and stretched her legs</strong>. The vet gave answer. I couldn't digest the fact. <strong>I called her repeatedly, petted her and with my calls she again started 'meow'ing.</strong> I was happy again. She <strong>hadn't eaten anything from the day of this sudden paralysis(2 days ago)</strong> I went home, she still refused to eat, couldn't move around. She had lost her control of moving. <strong>After few hours, she was serious again</strong>(dilated eyes, stretched out legs, no response) I ran immediately to see the vet. On the way, she was trying to tell something(it was continuous movement of mouth like chewing) She <strong>called out 'meow'</strong> twice.

"Dog strange behavior before pooping","<p>My dog is a shiba. He is now 16 months old. We live in a hot region in Brazil. This is our first pet, therefore we don't know how to address many suspicious behaviors. Unfortunately, some of these symptoms have lasted for most of his life now, and the vets we have seen so far in the city were unable to effectively help us. The symptoms I'm talking about are related to pooping. He only poops during walks.</p>

<p>These two symptoms have lasted for most of his life now:</p>

<ul>
<li>He always takes a long time, that is, he seems to need to walk a lot, before he can seem to be able to poop.</li>
<li>For most of the minutes before pooping, he gets agitated, like he needs desperately to get free of some pain --- even though this lasts!... as I said, he takes time!</li>
</ul>

<p>The next two symptoms have occurred before (not always), but are especially strong lately (for many weeks now), making me even more concerned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Immediately after pooping, he vigorously licks his anus.</li>
<li>While walking, he suddenly (very suddenly) sits down with his anus on the ground, or walks strangely with his anus down (a little, not touching the ground), as if something suddenly started to ache.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what about his feces? They have (almost) never been hard and dry --- rather the contrary: they used to be (seemingly unhealthy) soft most times. This has changed a few weeks ago, after a major dietary change (we are trying things out): before, he used to eat raw meat exclusively; then he started to be fed just cooked meat, rice and potatoes. After that change, his feces seem to be always healthy (neither hard nor soft). However, that dietary change didn't seem to affect the aforementioned symptoms. Not yet.</p>

<li>rubber wire: elastic and cheap, but I have no references on the internet about how cats deal with them. I fear rubber pieces are nasty if ingested;</li>
<li>(plastic coated) iron wire: much sturdier than the other alternatives, but more rigid. My window protections are metal wire webs and they hold well against weight, claws and teeth. I'm more worried about the cats' health if they tried to chew metal and ruined their teeth. Not sure about how plastic coating affects this last point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The alternative is to coat whatever wire I decide to use with those anti-chewing sprays, but I would rather not if I manage to.
Another alternative would be to avoid ""ropes"" altogether and go for a fixed wooden bridge, which could be feasible but is not an answer to the question.</p>

<p>Do you have any chewing experience on any of these material? Can you give advice on these concerns (and possibly other ones I didn't consider)? Thank you.</p>

"Should a mirror be removed from a budgie cage before socializing it with others?","<p>Today we were gifted with a budgie from an elderly extended family member who is no longer able to care for her along with a cage containing a couple of mirrors. She seems quite transfixed on them and my understanding is they recognize the reflection as another bird instead of themselves. I did some further research and a few posts I've found such as <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-should-I-put-mirrors-in-my-budgies-cage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Why should I put mirrors in my budgie's cage?</a> seem to suggest that mirrors are sometimes not such a good idea.</p>

<p>At the moment she's in her original cage with mirrors and we thought we'd leave her that way a few days until she gets used to the new surroundings. But at some point we'd like to place her in a large cage with four other budgies and I'm wondering if maybe the mirrors should be removed for a week or so in advance so she's more likely to socialize with the other birds after being ""alone"" for a while or if that's likely to cause her any stress?</p>

"How to feed stray/wild cat","<p>I do not have a pet, but every other day a cat comes to us for food. This has been going on for a month now. In our part of the world (subcontinent), the stray cats/dogs will eat just about anything.</p>

<p>I read that adult cats should not be given milk or wheat products such as bread. Is this valid for all cats or just the house cats. Meat is quite expensive, and if milk is not to be given, then what other food could be the option? Could I give her raw or boiled eggs?</p>

"Help. A common goldfish living in 3 gallon tank","<p>My wife got a goldfish from our pre-school. It came in a ""fishbowl"" the size of a large coffee cup and a tiny ziplock with fish food. It was severely stressed: fins clamped at his side, sunken belly, gulping bubbles at the top of the tank, flashing, drifting sideways, etc.</p>

<p>I had a used 3 gallon fish tank, but had no time to set up or cycle. So, I put the ""fish-cup"" in the center of the empty tank and over the period of days, added maybe 4-6 oz per hour of sink water to the fish-cup (I have a RO filter) until the tank water level exceeded the ""fish-cup"" and he could escape into the tank.</p>

<p>He did experience some shock (lethargy), but the flashing and side-drifting stopped. I kept adding RO water and removed and replaced the majority of the water almost daily.</p>

<p>Two days ago I started running the filter for about 4 hours during the day (on a timer). He's not happy about the water-current, but he is alive. He explores (I think he's looking for a way out) and hides in his cave when people are around. He's eating, resting, actively swimming. No flashing, no lethargy. His major stress comes from me exchanging water. He freaks out, but the water needs changing. Right?</p>

<p>I was going to start the kids with aquatic plants then eventually add ghost shrimp. Maybe a betta for Christmas. For all the prior neglect, this goldfish is in much better shape now. I know the tank is too small for the goldfish. I feed him twice daily. I exchange about a half-gallon of the water daily with a pinch of baking soda to offset acidity. But I am not going to do much more. I might add a plant, but I worry anything new might stress him. I've had him for a week now and he seems ok.</p>

<p>I've never had a goldfish before, so I don't know how they act. He seems to pace the tank like a caged tiger. Back and forth, up and down, front and back. After I add fish food, he waits... then stalks like a deep-water shark zipping up from the bottom and attacking at the surface. Is all of this ""goldfish behavior"" and him really needing a huge tank? Am I doing enough for his survival? If he lives a year, I might reconsider getting set up with a much larger tank. I just want to know if I'm giving him a sufficient minimum to survive.</p>

"Is the way I moved my fish to a new tank ok?","<p>Yesterday I got a new tank, I upgraded from a standard 10 gallon tank to a 29 gallon. The ten gallon was over populated so I decided to try and move my fish over as soon as I could. The ten gallon tank had sand as substrate that was a pain to clean so I decided to get a more coarse gravel. I had an aqueon 10 quiet flow filter, the new tank came with the same filter but bigger (rated for up to 30 gallons). Because I removed the original sand I figured it would be smart to run both the new and old filter because of all the bacteria in the old one. I moved all the decorations to the new tank. I took out about 7-8 gallons from the 10 gallon tank to put into the 29 gallon, the rest of the water got too gross from moving stuff, and I filled it the rest of the way up. I slowly moved the fish over from the 10 to the 29, making sure to properly acclimated them first. Now today some of my fish seem “out of it” my red tail shark is very resilient and seems totally fine, but my sword tails are all in the top left corner of the tank hiding near the filter. Is this normal for the circumstances? Is it ok that I moved the fish over in this manor?<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KLCeo.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"My cat is acting strange","<p>My cat is almost a year old. I got her when she was just between six and seven weeks old. She has been the perfect cat.  She loves me to pieces and she is great with the kids. </p>

<p>We moved about two and a half months ago and about a month ago she started to show some, I'm not sure if I should call it aggression, it seems like she's scared all of a sudden. She has been jumpy lately as well.  </p>

<p>She is still very social and wants to be held all the time but silly things seem to scare her now. Even me setting my phone down next to her if she's not totally paying attention and she's laying in my lap will scare her. </p>

<p>I feel like it's not me because she always wants to be around me and cuddle and have her belly rubbed. Just randomly she will freak out and scratch me for no apparent reason. She can be in the other room doing her own thing and she will just run in here to scratch me and then run away.  I don't know if it's the move or what it is.  </p>

<p>Just now she was in the living room looking out the sliding glass door, she started to walk this way and out of the blue she got spooked and scratched me. My arm was dripping blood. Any ideas?  </p>

<p>I find myself wondering whether anyone has tried doing brain-activity scans to see whether the same general brain centers light up in other animals as in humans when they hear music, and how that varies depending on species, musical style, and individuals.

<p>(Some cats I've known will come into the room when I turn the stereo on, but that may just be because this signals that I'm likely to be sitting still for an extended period and am probably willing to cuddle.

"Is my cat's new toy making him agressive towards me?","<p>About two months back I bought my cat a wand toy, with a cloth heart filled with crinkling plastic and catnip at the end. He doesn't care much for his other toys unless I spray them with catnip, then he will roll about with them and drool all over. Great, but that won't get him running about, hence I figured the wand toy would be great as he won't figure out (and still hasn't) that it is me dragging it about.</p>

<p>The toy is a great success, but sadly a bit too much. In the morning when I get up I feed him his wet food, then I sit down to work. I'll have maybe an hour or so before he jumps on my desk and demands attention. He will run all over and press his head against me to rub his scent. This has never been a problem until around when I got the toy. He'd normally get petted a bit and be content and lay down to let me work. Now instead he puts his ears back, meows loudly at me in an upset manner, and starts biting or clawing at my hands and face. When I get up to raise my height above his, he will run off to the kitchen where the toy is kept. </p>

<p>In the past I gave in and played with him, but I've come to realize I may be reinforcing the behaviour and would like to try and correct it. At present when he claws or bites I pick him up and put him on the floor. He will however defiantly jump back up and get more hostile. So then I pick him up and put him in the hallway and close the door. He will loudly protest and hit at the door (running his paws over it, but without claws thank goodness). I leave him until he is calm again, then I open the door. Sometimes he will behave then, but other times he will come and start the whole thing up again. </p>

<p>I should note also that since he got the new toy, he no longer wants his other toys sprayed with catnip. He will actively ignore them but indicate he wants to play. I have a laser pointer also but he has also figured that out, and seems frustrated he can't really catch the dot. The only other toy he likes is a ball with a hole that drops treats when knocked about. He only gets that every few days though as I don't want him to gain too much weight. Also, I live in an apartment, so I need to help him be active. His other favourite activities are watching birds or people from his cat trees, he has one at the front that overlooks the street, and one in the back that overlooks the gardens. </p>

<p>My question is what could I do to fix this situation? Should I keep putting him in the hallway if he is mean and only play with him when he is nice? Or would it be better if I pro-actively played with him as soon as he's gotten his breakfast, or even before?  </p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to say that I've gotten Feliway about a week and a half ago, but so far I've not seen any behaviour changes. Not sure if it needs more time to work or it simply doesn't affect my cat.</p>

"Dog Training - Nothing in Life is Free Punishment Confusion","<p>Our family adopted an 11 month old Coonhound 2 weeks ago and have decided to use the Nothing In Life Is Free training approach.  For basic things (such as making him sit before we let him out or ignoring his barking before giving him food)  this program seems to be both intuitive and effective.  For more complicated things, like when punishment is required for play biting or chewing, things in general that do demand our immediate attention, this program is not so intuitive.</p>

<p>One of the core tenets of this program, as I understand it, seems to be that you never allow your dog to demand attention from you.  (For instance - this seems to be a common trend: ""Attention seeking behaviors don’t work.  Some dogs become quite pushy about attention, demanding that you pet him by pawing, nudging and/or barking.  Ignore attention seeking behavior rather then pushing your dog away or scolding him. - <a href=""http://www.aplaceforpaws.com/reference-articles/dog-training/nothing-in-life-is-free-rules-to-live-by.html"">http://www.aplaceforpaws.com/reference-articles/dog-training/nothing-in-life-is-free-rules-to-live-by.html</a>"".  There's also specific mention that negative attention is still attention. (<a href=""http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm"">http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm</a> - ""Telling him ""no"" or pushing him away is not the kind of attention he's after, but it's still attention"").  If our dog jumps up as soon as we let him out of the crate or gets up on the counter, is the correct thing really just to ignore him and let him do what he wants?</p>

<p>In a recent situation, we took him on an hour long walk, and as soon as we got home he started attacking the Christmas Tree.  If we're not supposed to allow our dog to demand attention from us, what is the appropriate way to curb this behavior?</p>

<p>In another recent situation, he jumped on the couch without us inviting him up and tried to walk all over us.  It seems like the NILIF program says that he can't be up on the couch unless he's invited, but it also says that we should ignore attention seeking behavior.  It seems to me that there's a direct conflict here and I'm not entirely sure how to proceed.</p>

<p>Basically what I'm wondering is, it seems like there are inconsistencies in the guidelines for the NILIF program.  What is the correct way to handle punishment for bad behavior, or is simply ignoring the bad behavior the actual solution?  </p>

<p>Currently, for things such as biting or chewing, I have been following the advice I grew up with and either holding his mouth open or holding his mouth shut. I'm not entirely sure what the correct response is for other bad behaviors. </p>

<p>*On a side note, this dog is 11 months old and was crated for almost the first 9 months of his life.  He understands Sit and Down - he will follow a verbal Sit command but not a verbal Down command (we have to use the hand motion).  I believe this is a good program to follow, if it is not please let me know.  From everything we've been told by the Vet and have read online, the positive-reinforcement only training is not good for him.</p>

  <li><p>Why does she only pee on the carpet but will 100% poop in the toilet even when the floor of the toilet is dry.</p></li>

I read through the <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/a/2802/3424"">""how I can keep a rabbit cool""</a> thread wanted to know if there were more insight for those of us who live in climate zones that can get up to 112F during the summer.</p>

<p>I was looking to purchase some 'Californian' species of rabbits, are they more adapted to these dry &amp; heat conditions of my area?  They would end up being in outdoor hutches and so any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.  Maybe this idea is a No-Go for my climate...</p>

"Can my cat have yogurt?","<p>According to <a href=""http://www.thepetbeastro.com/2012/07/15-foods-to-avoid-feeding-your-dog-or-cat/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">15 Foods to avoid</a>, it states that diary products should not be allow for cats and dogs. However, has an exception for plain yogurt and cottage cheese.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BfJBw.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I used to give my cat the leftover yogurt on the surface of the cup (not plain, eg. Aloe Vera yogurt), and she enjoyed it. This is to give her some probiotic for digestion as she's getting old. Sometimes she will get soft stool the next day, but did not vomit. I thought this will be good since she tend to have very  hard stool. Does this mean that it is safe for cats to digest minimial amount of such yogurt? Is it <strong>harmful</strong> to them in any way??</p>

"How to punish an aggressive misbehaving puppy?","<p>My parents adopted a puppy(Nora) a month ago, she's about 3 months old now. I'm having trouble disciplining her when she misbehaves.</p>

<p>She is not getting along with our other pets. By that I mean that she almost constantly bothers them. She bites and jumps at our older dog, she runs after our cats and grab them. The other dog pretends to viciously bite her, but pretending is all he can do, so he usually ends up barking and whining for help. Our adult cat doesn't hesitate to slap her if she comes too close, she even scratched the puppy once. But Nora doesn't seem to get any of the message and keeps bothering them.</p>

<p>When she does this I'd usually tell her ""no"", if the behaviour continues I raise my voice and if she continues, which happens quite often, I would punish her by putting her alone in a room for a little time. </p>

<p>The problem is : how can I do that when she runs away from me? She basically just stay out of my reach and carry on her misbehavior if possible! And if I manage to catch her, she tries to get out of my grip by vigorously contorting, rolling on the floor and trying to bite me! How can I handle this? She's so agitated I'm afraid that she'd bite my face if I try to carry her.</p>

<p>I am more of a cat person so I know that I may be biased. But I find her far too rough to the other pets. I live in fear that she may hurt my kittens. I'm worried that the adult cat may hurt her for good as well.</p>

<p>My father is home all day long but he is quite passive and I know that he doesn't do anything to actually raise/train her. So it's basically up to me and my mother to do this. Needless to say, coming home after a long day of work to a disobeying puppy leaves us with very little patience.</p>

<p>Honestly, if things don't get better, I consider suggesting that we get rid of her. But I would rather avoid this. I have a long record of taking in abandonned cats and I don't feel like doing this to Nora.</p>

"my cats won't play together (not neutered or spayed)","<p>I have a 1 year old female cat who as a kitten up until now used to play with me as if I am another cat, she runs, and I'll have to follow her then its her turn to chase. I do that because she's been my only cat and we couldn't bring her another cat to play with until now. The point is she is only used to playing with people as animals but not real animals. When she was younger we brought her two kittens to play with she used to chase them and run away from them as play but whenever they tried to touch her she hisses. We unfortunately had to give the two kittens to a friend for a particular reason. So sense that time she didn't have an animal friend to spend time with.I felt she wasn't having her fair play so I decided to get another cat for her to play with.</p>

<p>It is a 7 month old male. I thought it was OK if he is younger hence his body size is bigger than her. Now she tolerates him since they both know she's the boss. But whenever he tries to PLAY with her she hits him, and runs after him, sometimes hissing, sometimes she backs off and leaves him alone. And sometimes I hear him screaming and she's attacking him so I get my water spray and shoot her and that's when the fight is over.</p>

<p>I'd like to say that their is no rolling around she is just hitting him with her paw and he starts screaming and that's when I think he's just doing that so I would come stop her. They both love playing with us. but they almost never play together.</p>

<p>I'd like to remind that both cats are tolerant to each others presence but they don't play together.
So how do i make them play together?</p>

<p>But as i mentioned maybe in an unclear way that Joury had previous experience with cat's (the two kittens i mentioned up).But the two kittens were not coward so i think thats why she played with them. Silver tries to play with Joury alot. But it's always he runs when she is about to do an act or when he gets too close she either hits him or gives him a glare. I could notice that she sometimes wants to kinda play with him but whenever she shows him she's about to move he runs from fear. It's like they both want to play together sometimes but it's always she gets some kind of ego in the last second and doesn't except him or he feels afraid for no reason so she hits him. What do you suggest i do?</p>

"Fungus blocking fish from eliminating","<p>I recently acquired fungus in one of my tanks (from what I can tell I can see 3 fish with signs of it and one who has it the worst). I took the three and put them in a hospital tank to try to contain spreading, but am treating both. The worst of the three has a ring of the fungus around his gut right where most females have the gravid spot. He is still eating and eliminating, BUT instead of his poo being able to drag behind him and fall off it's stuck in the fungus and is wrapping around his body as it grows. I'm concerned with this happening he will lose the ability to eliminate, and stop eating or die from it (if the fungal infection doesn't kill him). I've seen people pick up larger fish with non latex gloves, for wound care and breeding purposes, but I try my best to put my hands in the tanks as little as possible, and never intend to  touch any of my fish. I am wondering if I can use my hands to rub part of the fuzzy off?</p>

<p>Ive treated sick fish for people over the years, wether it be my own, at a pet store, or friends and  haven't experienced THIS as a specific issue. I know this sounds like a strange or stupid question for most people, but I want his healing to be as smooth as possible and increase his chances of living. It's only been 24 hours since I started treatment, and was hoping to see enough improvement that he could poo like a normal fish. I added a different texture of plant to the hospital tank to encourage him to rub against and aquarium salt for general, Gill and fin health. If I can't rub some off, are there any additional recommendations? </p>

"Whats the best way to prevent cats from going places they shouldn't?","<p>We have 2 kittens that we brought home 5 days ago, they are 12 and 13 weeks old now. They have a very tall cat tree that they use, they use the litterbox and they get along very well.</p>

<p>There are certain things we don't want them to do, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jumping on the dinner table and kitchen counters.</li>
<li>Playing with/eating the (fake) plants.</li>
<li>Jumping on the towel shelf (it's in the bathroom, next to the litterbox, don't want their dirty paws on my towels).</li>
<li>Climbing the curtains.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure they do this because they think it's fun, not because they lack attention; I work from home and I try to pet them every half hour.</p>

<p>I have tried the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ignoring them completely when they do the above.</li>
<li>Removing them while saying a firm ""NO"" and then walking away. They keep going right back at it and I come back, rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>Sticking double-sided tape on the plant pots, they just ripped it off and started playing with it, then tried to eat it, and then right back to bashing the leaves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next thing I want to try is to use a tiny water gun that I can conceal in my hand and squirt them, then act like I didn't even notice they are there so they don't associate the water with me.</p>

<p>I heard that clicker training is the best way to train your cat to do what you want, but how does that work if you just want to train them to NOT do what you DON'T want?</p>

"activated charcoal filters + fan for covered litter box?","<p>A couple of weeks ago I finally adopted two cats (both 2yo, from different shelters). One of the two does not cover his poop, probably because he never learned to, and it's too late to teach him now. The other cat actually does double duty if he finds uncovered poop in the litter box, covering (so to speak) for his roommate. Anyway, the stuff stinks really badly, and the exhaust fan in my inside bathroom does not do an adequate job of clearing up the air.</p>

<p>I have one of those covered litter boxes (the Van Ness CP7), and it already has vents on the top (with zeolite filters that don't do anything), so I'm thinking of attaching some sort of fan that would pull the air and force it through an activated charcoal filter. Does such a thing already exist? I haven't been able to find anything on Amazon. I've looked at lots of small air purifiers, and none appear to be suitable for fitting on top of the box. </p>

<p>Suggestions? Pointers? </p>

<p>I also assume the carts won't like it if there is a whirring fan and air movement while they do their business, so a PIR sensor and a relay connected to an Arduino would take care of that. Plus, it would get me statistics for how much and how long they use the box for while I'm away :) ).</p>

"Does my cat have a boyfriend?","<p>So I just walked downstairs to find my black cat chilling out on the table with a ginger cat in the room, with no issues whatsoever.

"How to train a dog to properly cross a road?","<p>Reading several articles on guide dogs for the blind I often found that, when it comes to the road crossing bit, they say that the dogs are not trained to pay attention to the crossing lights or the beeper some crossings are equipped with, they rather look at the changes in traffic movement.
Anyone knows how do they train the dogs to ""look for cars"" before crossing?  </p>

<p>Edit: I'm aware that there is a command given by the handler but my question is about how they get taught to evaluate the traffic after the command is given.
This is an example of the various things I read (from guidedogsofamerica FAQ page):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: <em>I heard that dogs are color blind, so how do they know when the
  light turns green so they can cross the street?</em></p>
  
  <p>A: Guide Dogs do not read the lights nor make the decision to cross
  the street. It is the guide dog user that gives the command to go
  forward. First the guide dog user listens for the traffic. When the
  guide dog user determines it is safe to go forward, they give the
  command and cross the street. <strong>If the guide dog determines it is unsafe
  to cross the street when it is given the command, it will
  “intelligently disobey”. This might happen if the guide dog user
  misjudges the traffic or if a motorist suddenly comes around a corner
  speeding.</strong> In many cases, guide dogs have saved lives because they have
  protected their partners from dangerous situations involving unsafe
  motor vehicles.</p>

"What Are Some Ways to Increase Space for Cats in a Small House?","<p>I have a fairly small house (Ok, it's really small) Not an apartment but still very small. I also have a cat, who loves exploring every bit of my small house. He loves the basement. </p>

<p>The basement is unfinished, so it has a lot of stuff just laying around until I can put things on shelves. The shelves, however, are also just laying around, they also have things on them. </p>

<p>Important things: As you may have already noticed, this is a recipe for disaster. Cat jumps on a shelf, important breakable stuff falls down, breakable stuff breaks. This makes the cat happy, but me... Not so much. </p>

<p>My cat has loads of things to lay on upstairs, including a large cat post positioned in front of the living room windows, an arsenal of cardboard boxes strategically placed on shelves and desks, and couches, and chairs, and beds. However, downstairs is a cat paradise. </p>

<p>Shelves and other in abstract positions, loads of raised up (and unsafe now blocked off) places to lay, and of course... Drum roll please... The nice warm vibrating top of our front load dryer. </p>

<p>The only problem with this is that he has only the small upstairs to adventure in when contractors are here. (which is quite frequent as I am trying to get my basement finished.) I don't want my cat going downstairs while, or even after, the contractors are here. </p>

<p>The reason I don't want him going down after the contractors are here is because there is loads of wood, power tools, boxes of nails, screws, other sharp and dangerous miscellaneous items... Or, at least, there is until I clean the basement. </p>

I don't really want to pay to much money on this, as I need some money for finishing my basement too. What are some ways of doing this? I want a good long-term solution. </p>

<p>As the name of the service suggests, I registered for free, however, because I'm using a free service, I'm afraid it might somehow be lacking in one way or another compared to premium services. Would that be the case? </p>

<p>Do I need to register the chip in multiple services to improve my chance of finding her when lost? What's the process like? </p>

<p>All in all, my question revolves around what the process is like when my dog is found, and what I can do to improve my chance of recovering her. </p>

<p>Thank you so much all you wonderful souls for answering my questions!</p>

"Training or Protection?","<p><strong>Critical ages for puppies</strong></p>

<p>So after reading many sites, it seems that at the 8-16 week period for a puppy, it is ideal to enroll them into training classes and socialize them, however; vaccination for Parvo starts at 8 weeks and isn't completed until they reach around  16 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>So I would think that most of the puppies enrolled would not have completed their vaccination period? Would it be better to enroll and have them socialize or to keep them safe and not risk Parvo?</p>

<p>Also FYI our puppy is 10 weeks old right now.</p>

"13 week old kitten will not stop sucking on me","<p>I have a 13 week old kitten, which I took away from her mama when she was 9 weeks old. She stopped nursing from her mom and started sucking on my ear lobes and neck (and sometimes the tip of my fingers). She is definitely a healthy happy kitty! She only does this when she's ready to go to sleep. I feel like I can't bond with her because I'm constantly setting her down on the floor or pushing her off my earlobes. It's like I give the Tabby more attention than I give her. (She's a Calico.) Is this normal? Will she eventually stop, or do I need to double check on her health? I don't think shes stressed, she will only fight me when she's being put down. Until I give her something to suck on, she wins every time.... How do I get her to stop sucking on me?</p>

"One cat licks the other, but hates being licked","<p>I have two 3-year-old cats. They are siblings (same litter), one female, one male. They get along reasonably well, with the occasional boxing and hissing match but nothing too serious (see my previous questions for examples), but also playing and sleeping next to each other in adorable positions on occasion.</p>

<p>Curiously, the female will lick the male (especially on the head, which is harder for him to clean himself) quite often (maybe a couple of times a day) and he enjoys it just fine. In fact, he'll often then try to lick her in return.</p>

<p>Thing is, she hates it when he does that. He can't lick her for two seconds before getting boxed in the face.</p>

<p>I've <a href=""https://www.catster.com/cat-behavior/why-is-cat-licking-you"" rel=""noreferrer"">read</a> that there is a hierarchy to licking, with the most senior cat usually starting the licking party. However, that article also states that the cat may do that with the expectation of getting licked back.</p>

<p>For the record, my wife and I are unsure of who's the more senior of our two cats. The male is significantly larger, so he's got a clear advantage on the physical aspect, but we also think the female is in the running (though I'm having trouble putting into words why). We usually conclude that they're actually competing for the role to this day.</p>

<p>So, is there anything to read into the female's behavior? Or is it probably just a personality thing (she's just not that into being licked)?</p>

"Kittens Playing or Fighting","<p>I have some 12 week old kittens that just met. We kept them separate for a couple days so that they could play with each other under the door, then we propped the door open just a bit. They liked playing with each other through the door and did it a lot. We recently put them together, and their behavior is hard for me to categorize. I had cats when I was younger, but not recently, and I haven't seen cats meet (at least not much and not recently). Anyway, here are some behaviors:</p>

<p><strong>Behaviors that make me think they're playing</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>No growling nor hissing</li>
<li>Ears generally up and forward</li>
<li>No tense standoffs</li>
<li>No hair raised nor arched backs</li>
<li>No injuries: no favouring of limbs, body parts, etc., no blood, no fur being removed, etc.</li>
<li>They were able to stop playing at eat within a foot of each other without attacking again. One of them did growl quietly sometimes while eating, but they generally seemed amicable.</li>
<li>Both cats engage in play; neither tries to run off and end the play session.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Behaviors that make me think they might be fighting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>They never stop. It's obvious they're both really tired; they won't go for a toy at all, but any time they see each other, they go at it again.</li>
<li>They don't allow each other breaks. There is a slightly bigger male, and he generally pins the other (the female has a defensive style and assumes a position on her back preemptively). But, any time the male walks away, the female comes and gets him from behind again.</li>
<li>They do make a little noises. The female doesn't like when he bites her back legs, so she calls out (not loud, but in frustration it sounds like), and the male doesn't like being attacked from behind.</li>
<li>They're pretty intense. It's not a slow, relaxed play session like I see on youtube: we let it go for two or 2.5 hours last night, and they nearly never let up.</li>
</ul>

<p>The signals seem really confusing to me. It seems like whether they're being aggressive or playful, they need to take a break. The female was sick a couple weeks ago, so I would think she needs her rest. They slept <em>very</em> well last night! And we can't detect any injuries anywhere. In case it helps, they're ragdolls.</p>

<p>Any recommendations? Should we split them up seeking for an easier, calmer relationship after a while?</p>

"For an adult, housebroken dog, is it okay to not have a crate?","<p>I am planning to adopt an adult dog that is already housebroken. Everything I read about crate training says that it is very helpful for house training puppies, but I can’t find anything about adult dogs who are already past that point.</p>

<p>Is it okay to not have a crate for adult, housebroken dogs? I’ve read about how dogs have an instinct to create a “den” and that a crate can satisfy that, so if I put their bedding in a secluded area to address that, do I need to bother with the expense and hassle of a crate?</p>

"My dog consistently wakes up about an hour before I do","<p>My two-year-old dog seems to only be able to hold her pee for about six hours, which is unfortunately less than the amount of sleep I need to get in a night. We'll potty her before we go to bed, but she'll still consistently wake up an hour or so before I do, no matter what time we go to bed. As in, I tried going to bed earlier and getting up earlier to take her out, but she only got up even earlier.</p>

<p>Now that she's been doing this for a little bit, she'll also start whining for her breakfast. I hate giving it to her because I know it's only training her to get up early and eat; but I also can't deal with her whining for a half hour while I'm trying to sleep.</p>

<p>How can we train her to be better at waiting for us to get up in the morning? For example, not giving her water after a certain time? I'm hesitant to try that on my own because I already worry we don't give her enough water.</p>

"Are dogs much less sensitive to high noise than humans?","<p>I must admit (a bit shamesly) that I was not aware of the fact that volume is on a logarithmic scale and thus following sentence (<a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/flying/cirrus-sr20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a>) surprised me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The back seats are closer to 87 dBA, which is good for transporting dogs. A Honda Accord at 70 mph subjects its occupants to around 65 dBA of noise, or about 1/30th the noise level of Cirrus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, what actually shocked me, is the last part of the first sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>which is good for transporting dogs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we assume that:</p>

<ul>
<li>a Honda Accord at 70 mph (65 dBA) is quite noisy (quite very noisy?),</li>
<li>22 dBA (87-65) difference is <strong>thirty times more</strong> (so quite very, very noisy)</li>
</ul>

<p>then we may conclude that sound level inside this light aircraft's cockpit offers circumstances that are very not comfortable, if not dangerous, to humans. In fact they actually are dangerous since most sources and organisations, that I reviewed, requires ear protection equipment for environment with sound level at or above 85 dBA.</p>

"Dog gets upset with any motion on the television. How can I desensitize her to it?","<p>I just adopted a new dog who has a strange trigger: she gets really upset and starts barking wildly when there is motion on the television, even backing out of the room in fear. I did a number of tests (spaced out across several hours to not stress her out too much) and found the following:</p>

<h1>Things that don't bother her</h1>

<ul>
<li>Nothing is displayed, but TV is on (ruling out being bothered by the TV making a high pitched sound that humans can't hear)</li>
<li>A menu or other static screen</li>
<li>Static pictures of an environment</li>
<li>Me watching a show on an iPad with the volume up or playing a computer game with the volume up (ruling out that it's a noise issue)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Things that do bother her</h1>

<ul>
<li>A cartoon with motion</li>
<li>A live action scene with motion</li>
<li>Both of the above when the volume is muted</li>
</ul>

<p>What I found especially interesting was a video of someone doing a close up of some electronics. She was fine when the shot just showed the electronics sitting on a table, but as soon as a hand came on screen, and especially if the presenter manipulated the electronics (like opening a panel to reveal additional buttons), she started growling. I tried to comfort her, an eventually she deliberately tried to ignore watching the TV, but still seemed a bit on edge.</p>

<p>As described in <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/7124/9263"">Do dogs see television and computers the way we do?</a>, dogs don't see screens like we do. Still, the motion seems to bother her and I'd hate to give up TV watching entirely. My apartment is kind of small, and so far she's preferred to stay within sight of me. How can I desensitize her to the television so that I can watch it normally?</p>

"Cultures where dogs are not being walked","<p>I´ve seen alot of talking about walking one dog or not, but this question is more about cultures where dog are simply not being walked because their function is a bit different than what is usually assumed.  </p>

<p>I´m referring to villages in The Philippines that I´ve visited a couple of times - and probably many other places on this planet where dogs primarily are kept to alarm against burglars.  </p>

<p>On an early sidenote, I always wondered how people would even know that there´s a burglar, cause the dogs are barking allover the neighborhood the whole night long, nonstop!   </p>

<p>Anyway, the dogs pet function is there as well - more for some than for others - but they´re never being walked, period.</p>

<p>I´ve noticed that a lot of these dogs are not cuddly and very interested people, and even the cuddliest one I met who came and put its head on my lap while looking at me, would be very confused about what the idea was of throwing a ball that it could catch. </p>

<p>The good thing is that the dogs can come and go as they want. They may be staying over at other peoples (with dogs) places for weeks, causing great frustration of their owners of course. In such a case, I knew that the dog was never mistreated or not given enough food.. I think it simply just liked another certain dog at that other place.</p>

<p>So summa sumarum, they are given the same freedom as cats, who are also not being walked.</p>

<p>I know cats and dogs are not the same kind of animals at all, but I guess that when it comes to socializing they live a much better life than their counterparts that are being walked every day, because they get to meet other dogs whenever they feel like it. </p>

<p>On the other hand, they don´t get much exercised this way but actually don´t suffer from obesity at all. Probably because their diet is different, or maybe their kind (ascals, they´re called) has a higher metabolism.</p>

<p>What do you people think? Is it in a dogs DNA to only be happy when walked 3 times a day, or is this something we teach them to appreciate? Can they not have a good life without that, when actually being left to do what a dog wants to do?</p>

Everytime it happends, we are on the bed and not sleeping (watching TV).</p>

<p>The vet said it may be some kind of revenge, but I didn't manage to identify any pattern on why he would pee on my bed.</p>

<p>I also caught my cats - from what it looked like - playfighting as any other cats would do, however I noticed that it is mostly Chilli that will 'attack' her first and it is also mostly her that will continue after a few second pauses.
Today, I was doing my stuff in the bathroom when all of a sudden Luna meowed, very likely asking me to open the door for her. After a few seconds I opened the door only to find that Chilli was literally sitting on top of her and was licking her face. Luna looked extremely uncomfortable and jumped out of Chilli's grasp in a matter of seconds. 
On several occasions, Chilli would approach Luna and attempt to clean her, however Luna would usually resort to escape.</p>

<p>Although there are times when even Luna sleeps beside Chilli and cleans her, should I be concerned about how Luna is treated by her sister? Oh and also, I think it's valuable to say that Luna is the cat that rubs against the house members' legs and some other furniture, while Chilli does not do this at all. Lastly, my mother spotted that they rarely eat together when given wet food, and that is something that did not happen before. Chilli becomes uninterested with the food when she sees Luna eating it. Chilli would usually eat after Luna is gone and not in the surroundings.</p>

<p>Overall, is there anything that suggests that my cat is bullying her sister, and if yes, is there anything I can do to approach this problem?</p>

"Can I train my ferret for ferreting?","<p>Ferrets were originally domesticated and bred for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret#Ferreting"" rel=""nofollow"">""ferreting""</a>, which means going into rodent holes and chasing out the resident rats/mice/rabbits/etc into traps.</p>

<p>I live on a property that has lots of ground squirrels, and their holes are something of a nuisance and a danger to my family's horses. The rest of my family seems to think killing them is acceptable, while I believe it to be morally akin to mass murder. I would prefer to find a more humane way of removing the ground squirrels, and relocating them alive would certainly be an improvement.</p>

"Why does my cat eat inedible things, how can I stop it, and what are the medical side-effects?","<p>My cat has a bad and frequent habit of eating (or trying to eat) inedible items. Specifically, she tends to eat plastic trash bags, cardboard, and paper, though she is especially prone to eating the trash bags.

She is otherwise a healthy, affectionate cat, who eats all of her food and is active around the house.</p>

<p>The only thing I have figured out to prevent it is to either lay a very thick coating of some kind of repellent such as <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0030BE192"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>, or to simply put my garbage cans in a closet.</p>

"Affect of Kh on Neocaridina Shrimp","<p>It is my understanding that, in the aquarium, Kh (carbonate hardness) raises the PH slightly, but primarily acts as a ""buffer"", preventing large PH swings.  For Neocaridina shrimp (I keep red cherries, but I suppose for any Neos) I have seen recommended Kh levels from anywhere between 0 to 3.  Though, most common is probably 1-2.  However, I read that several very successful shrimp breeders don't supplement their RO water with any Kh whatsoever, using only Gh+ remineralizers.</p>

<p>What are the pros and cons of forgoing the addition of Kh to Neocaridina tanks?  It does give you the opportunity to add other Kh sensitive species like Tigers or Bees (shrimp species not cats or insects), but are there any other benefits?  Are there any cons besides having a less stable Ph?  Why is having a less stable Ph not a concern for these breeders?</p>

"Kitten stopped using litterbox, how should I correct him?","<p>I have a male, 5 month old kitten. I received him at 2 months old from a friend. When I brought him home he didn't use the litter box, but I realized that he didn't like the litter. Since then, I changed the litter, and he started using the box with no problem. Now, all of a sudden, he stopped using the litter box again. He now uses my dog's beds, blankets, pillows, clothing, anything fabric.</p>

<p>I clean out the box about twice a week, and change the litter about every 1-2 weeks. I use the Nature's Miracle pet cleaner and Arm and Hammer baking soda to try to remove the scent as best as possible.</p>

<p>I know that it's not like he can't make it to the box because I've seen him go up to the box, sniff it, then do his businesses a foot away. I do have a couple of ferrets who have yet to learn that they too need to use their own litter box, but the cat is not allowed around the ferrets, so I don't think he could have seen them.</p>

<p>I tried disciplining him, but this seems to do nothing. Also, every time he uses the litter box, whether on his own or with me having to correct him, I try to reward him. Would anyone know why he suddenly stopped using the litter box after three months of no problems? And what else should I do to try to correct this behavior? </p>

<p>What none of these seem to address is the suitability of shaving or trimming the rabbit's fur.  I have read various opinions on this and they range from ""don't do it unless you have special expensive equipment like a vet"" or ""don't do it because the fur will protect the bunny from the heat"" to ""it will definitely help to keep the rabbit cooler"".  There are also differing opinions on how short a cut should be.</p>

<p>I have had experience shaving rabbit fur, but not expressly for the purpose for dealing with being outdoors in hot weather, so I am familiar with the issues doing the actual shaving, but not with the practicality of it.</p>

<p>Will shaving a rabbit help them to better deal with the heat?  Will it be helpful in filling gaps in other cooling methods when they aren't possible, for instance those which appear to require frequent presence to refresh cold water or frozen water bottles?</p>

"How do I stop my 10 month old puppy from eliminating on the carpet?","<p>We have a 1 year old puppy, part Anatolian Shepherd and the rest unknown, who has been with us since she was 5 weeks old.  We went to adopt a 2 year old Basenji from a rescue but it didn't work out, and the kids fell in love with this little girl while we were there.  This is our first dog and we're still learning as we go.</p>

<p>My partner was not comfortable with crate training as the puppy whimpered horribly even at being in a box or crate for the night, and it felt cruel to leave her there (in retrospect this was probably a mistake).  She was allowed in the linoleum hallway and kitchen and the carpeted family room, including on the couch, gated off from the rest of the home.  We took her hour every 30 minutes for the first 6 months, every hour for the next 3, and every 1-2 hours since then.  We also take her out any time we see sniffing or agitation, though we can't watch her 24/7.</p>

<p>She both urinated and defecated on the family room floor and hallway floor at first.  This was easy to clean from the latter.  The former we soaked all we could then treated with Nature's Miracle to eliminate the odor.  When we did so we scolded her when we caught her in the act and then led her outside.  When she goes outside, even now, she is verbally praised and receives attention, which makes her happy.  Over time she has tended to go outside more and more.</p>

<p>She seems better about urination outside than about defecation.  Our morning routine was to wake up, let her out, feed her while having breakfast, and often by 20 minutes later she had defecated on the floor.  We've begun letting her out a second time after breakfast, but she still sometimes comes in and goes on the floor instead.  It seems like she may not be able to control it, but by this age I had thought she should be able to.  My only remaining thought is that the scent from past 'accidents' may be making her want to go, though I shampooed the carpet last month with Nature's Miracle mixed in.</p>

<p>Last night we returned home from a 2 hour shopping trip.  She had managed to undo our gate, go up the stairs where she is only allowed to be on the way to bed at night, and urinate in the hallway.  There has never been an accident upstairs and should be no scent, so I was very confused at why she would do this.  All of my hypothesis seem to have been invalidated now.</p>

<p>Is this likely a training issue, and age issue, or a medical issue?  How do I address it?  The longer it goes on the worse the smell gets inside, which I fear will eventually make it impossible to stop.</p>

<p>I would like to add that she is a very good girl otherwise, though very stubborn at times.</p>

"Can a new cat owner, with no experience handling animals, be expected to successfully restrain a cat using a towel?","<p>I need to give my cat ear medicine because he previously had ear mites (before adoption, he was a stray), and his eye medicine because he has herpes induced conjunctivitis, which isn't serious yet, but once in a while you can make out he closes one a little more than the other. </p>

<p>I've had a look at the videos I was able to find through google, and understand the basic ""scarf technique"" for restraining a cat using a towel. The issues I am having:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>My cat is not even a <em>little</em> interested in sitting still on a towel -- I pick him up, and place him in the middle of a laid out towel, and he's already struggling to leap away.</p></li>
<li><p>I tried giving him treats whenever he plops down on a towel, but as soon as I begin wrapping, he's well on his way to running away</p></li>
<li><p>The ""Y"" finger hold around his neck doesn't get him to be still as I try to wrap him up</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My take on the issue is that my relationship with him is still new: I only adopted him about 10 days ago. He has been a total blast so far: got used to the new house within a couple of days (he started playing with me in his safe room in the first hour he was home!), uses the litter box like a champ, absolutely loves cuddles and playing, eats food, drinks water, leaves people alone when they are sleeping -- basically, does everything without any of the difficulties I was warned about. </p>

<p>However, he still doesn't trust me much, it seems, given his behaviour with the towel...so, maybe that's a hint we are still ""new""? What am I supposed to do though, if he really needs his medicine? How do I get him to understand that I promise I would not hurt him? I can't. He doesn't understand words.</p>

<p>Is my theory about being in a new relationship with a cat correct? I don't think it is, because vets are able to do what they need to with new animals all the time, but I simply do not have the training of a vet. What are my options? </p>

"Can an elderly cat adjust to a new cat in the household?","<p>In the past I had a pair of littermates who I'd adopted at the age of 10 weeks.  When they were around 12 years old I asked my vet how old would be ""too old"" to adopt an additional cat -- that is, at what age would they not be able to tolerate an addition -- and she said ""pretty soon"".  I had the impression that she was making this judgement based on their age and not an evaluation of their individual personalities.</p>

<p>My current cats are middle-aged (about 6 and 8), and while my spouse has informed me that we have no plans to adopt more cats, it got me wondering about my vet's past advice.  <em>Is</em> there such a thing as ""too old for new additions""?

"What books explain most comprehensively the lure and reward method of dog training?","<p>Having first read some reviews of several books on canine clicker training, in the hunt for works that experienced trainers would list among the ""must read"" books on the subject, I have now finished Karen Pryor's <em>Reaching the Animal Mind</em> and I am part-way through her earlier <em>Don't Shoot the Dog</em>. Pryor has been a leading figure in the development of the marker method as it has been used with dolphins, dogs, and other species, including humans. In my opinion in the first three-quarters or so of her first-mentioned book she gives an admirably clear and waffle-free explanation of the marker method as it is used with dogs (and a clicker) as well as with other species (such as dolphins, with whom the usual marker is a whistle).</p>

<p>Since she expounds a method that uses positive reinforcement only, it is no surprise that she criticises the traditional use of dominance and aversion. But she is also critical of lure and reward, a rival positive approach, which she views as likely to produce dogs who are overly passive even when the method is used together with a clicker.</p>

<p>I wish to form my own opinion on this other positive method that she is criticising. So my question is as follows. What books have you read that, in light of your practical experiences, you believe most comprehensively explain the lure and reward method of training dogs and the ideas that underlie it? Perhaps there are some books by some of the key figures who developed this approach? At the moment, I don't even know who those figures are. I know some of the popular writers, but not who the main shapers of the method have been. (For the clicker method there is Pryor and then the line goes back through at least three of B F Skinner's students.)</p>

"What to do when moving next to a bird sanctuary with a loosely-domesticated cat?","<p>I'm about to move and a really promising location in a new city and it's surrounded by a large forest and bird sanctuary. That's great to me, but to my cat I suspect it will mean the beginning of his reign as a genocidal maniac against the local birds. On the one hand, regardless of where I move it seems this cat will be a bane on wildlife. On the other hand, given that this is a bird <em>sanctuary</em>, it feels particularly wrong to move there with this cat and just let it do its thing.</p>

<p>TL;DR skipping details on bottom: 3 year old Cat is very active and violent, otherwise a good cat to us humans. Never able to keep a collar or even harnesses on him. We rescued him off the streets and he's only semi-domesticated, keeping him indoors seems like barely an option.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, <strong>what can we do regarding this move and this cat to minimize disturbance to the bird sanctuary?</strong> Is it a no go, either we don't move there or we give away the cat? Is there any training or equipment we can use to minimize him disturbing the bird sanctuary? We could try to force him to be an indoor cat but I don't think he'll handle that well, it seems very against his nature. We could just let him do his thing, but we care a lot about the forest and know that cats can wreak havoc on its wildlife.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Some background on the cat: my partner and I met this cat as it meowed from under a porch as we were discussing getting a cat, an idea that we'd been considering for a few weeks. It was mid-February in a northern climate and very cold and snowy. We meowed at the cat for a bit and pretty fast he came and met us. We inspected the cat, picking him up and checking his fur and body out. He was pretty clean, no fleas we could see, seemed to be in good health. His paws and teeth indicated that this cat had been leaving outdoors for at least a few months, and he was mature but &lt;1 year old from what the vet said.</em></p>

<p><em>We've had this cat for a few years now. He was a real terror at first in terms of violence; he was mostly playful and not that aggressive but he was strong and intense in playing, would attack our feet and attack us at night if he had the chance. Over time and being neutered he's gotten better in some ways but is still an aggressive, big and tough cat. He used to go outside and disappear for days at a time when we first got him, but he'd keep coming back, even after we moved with him to new rentals locally a few times. Now he'll only go out for a few hours or a day at most, but he still begs to go out, tries to sneak out, and will even start attacking us more often if we refuse to let him out for a few days.</em></p>

<p><em>This cat in some ways good and maybe even trainable - extremely food motivated, will walk on a leash, never had any problems using a litter box, minimal scratching of furniture. At the same time, he can be a monster, half-killing chipmunks and leaving dead mice at our door regularly. We've tried collars and even two harnesses and he escaped all of them within days, though we do have him RFID chipped (unless he got rid of that too!)</em></p>

<p><em>I've seen my cat with 2 sparrows he's brought home dead in the past, he does 'cat chattering' when watching birds out the window, and I saw him try to climb into a bush to catch a bird once which he probably would've succeeded had I not chased him away. He's also killed and maimed many other animals not just birds.</em></p>

"Identifying a cat parasite","<p>Yesterday I let a stray cat sleep on a chair on my balcony.
After it got up, I saw it left dozens of blood filled parasites on the chair, but I'm not sure of which kind.</p>

<p>They are tiny (1-2mm diameter), very slow moving, some are black and some red-ish from blood, they pop easily and leave a bloody splatter, it's hard to see their legs, but they have small antennas. </p>

<p>I'm attaching a photo, but it's not great, as they are too small to easily photograph.</p>

"Skittish, hissing kitten","<p>A few months I got my kitten and she was of course the typical shy, skittish kitten that would hide. I kept her in a room and would just sit with her, she would even hiss at me. She was only 10 weeks at the time. After a month, she finally got the courage to come out of the room and come to the bed but she wouldn't let you touch her or she'd run off. I called the lady I got her from and once I told her how the kitten was acting, and she told me that she probably traumatized her because she had been remodeling her home and the litter of kittens had got into a wall/cabinet and she didn't want them to go further so she panicked and blocked the area off, made lots of noise and kept reaching out for them. I mean, can you imagine how that may have looked for them? After hours of doing this, she said she still couldn't get them out so she waited until the mama cat came around and the kittens finally felt safe enough to come out, at which point she also blocked the area off so that they couldn't get in again. </p>

<p>Fast forward to today and my kitten only let's me touch her if I'm in the bed or sitting in the living. When I reach out (I under hand pet her so that it doesn't look like I'm trying to grab her but it doesn't work) to her from any other part of the house, she runs from like shes never seen me before even though she rubs on me all the time when I'm in one of her favorite spots. I don't chase her but sometimes if she gets stuck somewhere I can't grab her because she's so terrified, and now that she is older, she uses her claws and she hisses, I thought this behavior would stop but she will fight if she feels like shes being touched or if you have to grab her. It's like she doesn't trust me outside of those two areas she hisses and she runs off like she's never had human interaction. She will also run if you walk past her in an attempt to get away from you even if you're not trying to get her. She is always on high alert when she isn't in the bed or on the sofa, she runs from everything. When I give her treats and wet cat food, she wont come to me. I've waited 10-15 minutes with her and she just looks at me. Instead, she prefers that I drop off the food under the table or in a corner where she can be alone. How can I stop all this awful behavior?</p>

"Recently adopted 4 month old pomeranian puppy, I am concerned about his behavior","<p>He is a 4 month unneutered male pomernanian. He seems to have a lot of energy and wants to socialize and play all the time. He isn't trained the way he should've been. I have had him for a week now. The first day, he did not whine nor cry. He isn't potty trained and had numerous accidents. The second to fourth day he gotten use to me and started interacting. He's much more shy and ""serious"" with my boy friend. He is very addicted to treats, that I noticed. Every time I reach for one to start training him he goes into an absolute frenzy.</p>

<p>Fifth day, I noticed he is whining now, when left in the playpen and crate, when left alone, when I leave for work. He doesn't whine with my boy friend or very minimal. I started seeing some aggression, anxiety and isn't eating as well. He still has accidents, but is a little better than before.</p>

<p>Sixth day, I am distraught. He has chewed on the floor board, peeing everywhere, doesn't want to go in his crate, or play pen. He isn't eating his kibble, only wet food. Nipping at face kind of like rushing at it. Biting hands (probably from teething) and cries whenever not in my presence.</p>

<p>Did I give him too much attention or not enough? Should I leave him alone not free roamin in my sight and to the minimal interactions (walk, play, feed, potty, train) and have him crated? I could use some advice.</p>

"Temporarily Adopting a Problem Dog","<p>My in-laws had bought a puppy, of the breed Staffordshire Bull Terrier, to replace an elderly Staffordshire that died some 6 months before. They never had a puppy before and had little dog training experience. The dog, now about 6 months old, has some problematic behaviours which are largely because the my in-laws whole household (3 adults and a child) haven't dealt with the behaviour in the right way from a young age. I think they liked the idea of having a puppy, but didn't do the research before they got her and failed to apply consistent training.</p>

<p>I'm no dog training guru myself but I have adopted a problem dog from the dog's home in the past which had behavioural issues which  I had to overcome and I have assisted in training dogs when I was a child.</p>

<p>My in-laws have reached the point that they are seriously considering giving up the dog for to its behaviour.</p>

<p>The dog's issues I believe are centered around play aggression that they have inadvertently encouraged by rewarding the behaviour with attention. This had led to some situations with my own children and the 11 year old becoming scared of the dog, she bites and jumps at their faces. Unfortunately this behaviour is then re-enforced through her getting attention, or being lured away with dog treats. It hasn't yet turned into any dominance type aggression, it is mostly just over exuberant play at this stage.</p>

<p>I feel like the issues are easily solved so long as disciplined and consistent dog training practices are employed, they are going on holiday for two weeks soon and I'm considering looking after the dog for that time to try and make some improvement with training while they are away, but I have some worries as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a dog, mentioned above, he is now a docile 8 year old, Collie Beagle cross. The staffy puppy would be coming into our house for two weeks and while the two dogs have met on a few occasions, it could cause tension between the two dogs if they are living in the same house.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of the puppies play aggression comes out when my young (2 and 5 year) kids are around, so bringing her into our house would place her into that trigger environment every day.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm used to dog training and being the assertive alpha male, if I was able to make an improvement after two weeks, I'm worried that her then going back to her home may just confuse her, make her behaviour worse and she may just instantly revert to her old ways once under the charge of the in-laws again.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In short, I have one question. Is adopting her for two weeks and trying to 'fix' her behaviour in that period a terrible idea and could it result in more behavioural issues? Or is it worth while to prevent them giving up the dog permanently?</p>

"My Koi is acting skittish suddenly, and found injuries","<p>I've been keeping 2 young koi in an aquarium for a year now. They've grown bigger and accustom to me. Their tank is about 55-60 gallons, and I live in the northeast. They were from the same shop and same breed, and they also look similar so they're most likely siblings. But one has grown bigger than the other and eats more aggressively. The smaller one has recently been acting more skittish, and panics a lot.</p>

<p>In a result I think it may have injured its scales from the decor. I heard scales heal pretty quickly so I want to make sure I might be overreacting. But if it's not the case, I set up a quarantine tank next to the main just incase. The wounds however, have made the lager koi chase the smaller one more than usual-even biting the other's fins and the area of the wounds.
They are probably too domesticated to shift to a pond, but I've also been planning to build one next year.</p>

<p>So are these injuries serious (images)? And can an aquarium Koi shift to a pond koi?</p>

"My kittens keep fighting!!","<p>About a month ago we bought our kitten ( Missy ) she's a really playful girl, a little bit to playful. She was forever biting us and scratching, running around the room, she can't go out for another 3 months as she's not neutered, so we thought we should buy another kitten so she has another playmate, in the hope she would stop biting us ! 
We bought our new kitten ( Scoobie ) yesterday, we bought a male as they are supposed to get on better this way. 
I will admit, we didn't introduce them correctly, we just sat the down together and hoped for the best, we separated them at night however. 
Our new little scoobie is a couple weeks younger than Missy - Missy is around 12 weeks, Scoobie is about 9. 
Scoobie is a very calm and loving cat, I think he is still in the sleepy kitten stage. I can't work out if Missy is trying to fight or play with Scoobie, but she has no boundries, so if Scoobie squeals a little she pulls back for a minute then continues. 
What can we do? Missy is just to rough with Scoobie, but Scoobie still goes up to her wanting to play and interact, so he's not scared of her? However he can't catch a break as Missy won't leave him alone ! Only when he eats ( in a separate part to her) she allows it.
Missy does bite and do that rabbit kick with her back legs on Scoobie, which we try to break up and distract Missy with toys ( which doesn't work ) We have tried to put them in separate rooms, mainly putting Scoobie in a room so Missy still has her 'house' but then Scoobie constantly cries and Missy almost forgets that Scoobie is in there so doesn't pay attention to the door or him! </p>

"Auto feeder: do cats need a bowl for their kibble, or is gathering from floor ok?","<p>TLDR;
I need to portion-feed my cat as he loves food too much. I made a feeding machine that is mounted out of reach, which means the kibble falls down and scatters on the floor, where he has to go around gathering it. Is this OK for a cat, or is not having his food in a bowl stressful?</p>

<p>Longer story:
When we got our cat from the shelter he was 8 kilos (17.6 pounds) so we feed him a fixed amount of kibble a day (prescribed by our vet) trying to get it down (which works, he's now around 6 kilos).</p>

<p>We used to feed him about three times a day: ~1/3 in the morning, ~1/3 when we get home and ~1/3 in the evening.</p>

<p>A problem we're having is how he likes to wake us extremely early (somewhere between 4 and 6 in the morning) because he is hungry. So I made a small feeding machine that will dispense his food, starting at half past 5 in the morning. It will dispense 1/4 of his food every 5 hours (so 5:30, 10:30, 15:30 and 20:30), as I read cats like to eat smaller portions during the day, instead of just one big one.
(In the beginning it would give out smaller portions every hour, but I got the feeling this was too disruptive for him: by the time he settled down after eating and started taking a nap, he'd hear his new food falling and would start eating again.)</p>

<p>So this works great in the morning: when he hears the machine he jumps off the bed and goes downstairs to eat, without waking us. Afterwards he comes back to the end of the bed for some more sleep.</p>

<p>I can't put the machine on the ground because I'm sure with his determination to eat, he will destroy it. So at the moment it's mounted underneath one of the shelves we made for him to climb on and the kibble will just fall down and scatter and he has to go around that part of the room to get all of it. Do I have to find some way to get the kibble into a neat bowl, or is it OK for him to have to gather them? It does seem to help against eating too fast (because he has to search for some of them) and he seems happy enough (because food). But could this be stressful for him?</p>

<p>PS: He can get as much water as he wants. There is a bowl in nearly every room (away from his food so it doesn't fall in) that we change every day.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:
Before, I made a cardboard contraption with different holes and slots to put his food in so he has to search for it. I was thinking of making a larger, wooden one (like this: <a href=""https://www.purinaone.com/cats/a-dish-poses-little-challenge-make-a-diy-hunter-feeder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.purinaone.com/cats/a-dish-poses-little-challenge-make-a-diy-hunter-feeder</a>) and put it underneath the machine so most of his food will fall in.</p>

<p><strong>update 2</strong>:
The 'machine' I made is an auger with a container on top for the kibble. A servo motor on the back turns the auger so kibble comes out. On the back is an ESP8266 board (basically a tiny computer with wifi) that connects to my home wifi so I can tell it to move and for how long. This is done automatically at set times, but I can also use my phone to trigger it. On the top you can see a wider part, which slides into a holder that is attached to the bottom of my shelf. The parts are 3D printed. It's a prototype so it still has some exposed wires in the back. This one is printed using PLA but I'm going to make another one out of a verified food-safe material.

"Do all female cats have longer fur around their abdomen rather than around the rest of their body?","<p>My cat has regular short fur around her body but at her abdomen (more like at her bladder) she has longer fur, a family member told me it's because she is becoming a grown up by the days and the long fur around her abdomen is their to protect her abdomen more, because her body is getting ready for mating and pregnancy procedures. My cat is a mixed breed so I'm thinking it can be due to the admixture of breeds she's brought up to have.</p>

"Is it safe to store bird seed in plastic trash bags? (Inside those big yellow cat litter bins)","<p>My wife loves her bird feeders. The problem with this is that we either store bird seed outside and the birds get to it, making a big paper mess, or we store it inside. Storing it inside, we have to worry about kicking around a big bag of bird seed (Storage space is at a premium at our house, so it has to sit by the back door). I'm thinking it wouldn't be a bad idea to store the seed in trash bags inside one of those big yellow plastic cat litter tubs.</p>

<p>The question here is it safe for the birds? I'm vaguely aware that some plastics are not food safe and will seep toxins, and neither trash bags nor kitty litter boxes seem like good candidates for manufacturers to test against for food safety. If regular trash bags are an issue, is there any sort of material that is safe for this type of storage?</p>

"Motion-induced dizziness in cats","<p>Humans can become dizzy by spinning around quickly. Small children will occasionally do this on purpose, for the thrill.</p>

<p>However, intentional dizziness inducing behavior is (as far as I am aware) never observed in cats or kittens. (Although I did see a particularly spectacular quadruple spin after one of my kittens collided with another in midair.) It would also be harder to observe the effects of dizziness as cats are quadrupedal and so are more stable than bipedal humans.</p>

<p>According to some not-always-reliable sources on the internet (such as Yahoo Answers or YouTube), cats can become dizzy, but recover from it much more rapidly than humans; but these accounts appear to be merely anecdotal, with others reporting the opposite, that despite their attempts they have been unable to induce observable dizziness in their cats.</p>

<p>It is a known fact that cats can become dizzy due to things like ear infections or medication side-effects, and that motion can aggravate it (<a href=""http://www.vetinfo.com/causes-of-dizziness-cats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a>), so it would seem plausable that a cat could become dizzy by spinning fast enough for long enough even in absence of those factors. However, I can't find any non-sketchy sites that give a clear answer about this.</p>

<p>Can cats become dizzy due to spinning, in absence of disease or other special circumstance? How quickly do they recover from dizziness compared to humans?</p>

"Shearing our Golden Retriever with Sheep Shears","<p>I'm a bit embarrassed to say this, but our dog has a persistent ringworm problem. Several times throughout the years, we'd apply Viaderm or something that can be bought from our local vet. Then, when she'd (it's a she) stop itching so much and we'd used up all her Viaderm, we'll stop treating her. Then her ringworm comes back. I guess through the years, her number of spots with infection has only increased.</p>

<p>What I'm thinking now is to treat her for good. We'd shave her bald then apply the Viaderm for weeks. We've tried shaving her last year (or was it 2 years ago??), but it was a tedious task -- it's a thick curly fur, and you could hardly call her bald. So I was thinking of using a sheep shear.</p>

"Hair loss on stray cat's head behind ears","<p>There are two stray cats (around 6-7 months old I guess) near my house. I often feed them boiled chicken or cooked egg yolk. About 10 days ago I started giving them Whiskas Dry Kitten Food. </p>

<p>Few days ago I observed a hair loss small spot on one of the cat's head (Zag). And now it has grown in size. 
I tried to look for fleas or ticks but couldn't find much, as he doesn't allow me to search through his hair a lot. There's a similar small stripe like spot on his body, but it's small in size now.
I know ideally I'm supposed to take Zag to the Vet, but being a student I'm really low on budget. Also I can't take them in because of my apartment issues.</p>

<p>Is it possible that he might be having an allergy to the cat food? His brother (Zig) is fine and has no such signs of hair loss. They sleep together most of the times, so if it would have been an infection it should have spread to his brother too, right?
Zag's behaviour is pretty normal he plays a lot and grooms himself too.
On the contrary, once I started feedinng Zig catfood he has become more playful.</p>

<p>I would be grateful if anyone having any clue about such hair loss pattern could tell me what it could be.</p>

First of all, I want to be able to leave my dogs outside when I go to work, but they will dig. (And I know all about waking them and playing with them and getting enough exercise and giving them toys, etc, you don't need to tell me. It doesn't matter how much I exercise them, they have a seemingly unlimited amount of energy... They're tamaskans, so they are highly intelligent and get bored easily too even though they have like a million kong toys, stuffed animals, bones, and rawhide ...). I've considered making them a sandbox, but I can see the sand slowly migrating out of the box since they will definitely be throwing it everywhere when digging... I'm thinking about putting down chicken wire. My first question is - would it be better to put it under the turf (I was told that the grass won't be rooted by the time I move in so I can lift it and place the wire if I want) or just on top of the grass? I hear it will sink into the soil and get covered by grass so it won't be visible anyways. My second question is - how much and when should I water? It gets hot in Texas. I have a sprinkler system so I can just set up a schedule. I read that is better to water deeply 2-3 times a week early in the morning (why not at night?). But because I have big dogs who will pee on the grass every day, I wonder if I should water more often but in smaller amount to prevent burn spots? But then internet also says that watering often will result in shallows grass roots that will require more water to stay alive. Any thoughts appreciated.</p>

"How can I teach my kitten not to steal the other kitten's food?","<p>I have two kittens, not from the same litter. The older kitten is 5 months old, and I have had her for 3 months. The younger kitten (not even half the size) is 3 months old and I have had her for 2 months. The older kitten was already quite a bit bigger than the younger kitten when the younger kitten joined us. No, it is not the older kitten stealing the food!</p>

<p>Younger kitten suddenly morphs into what I call ""piglet-face"" as soon as she realizes it's time for wet food. She gulps it back as though she hasn't eaten in days, and then beelines for older kitten's food the instant she's finished hers. There are two bowls of dry food out at all times, so she is not starving because she is eating that regularly throughout the day. Older kitten has never tried to get at her food while she's eating, in fact, older kitten eats very slowly and calmly, likes to eat some and come back for the rest later, and when younger kitten comes and shoves her face into older kitten's bowl, she makes no attempt to stop her, just sits there looking put-out. Older kitten does not act passively like this in other situations though (playing, lap-sharing, etc), she has no problem standing up for herself, or just being plain saucy, then.</p>

<p>Younger kitten does not have worms, so it isn't that (older kitten was actually very dirty with loads of fleas and really bad worms when I got her, but got rid of them before younger kitten joined us).</p>

<p>I have tried putting older kitten's bowl in a higher spot away from the usual food area, but this seems to put her off her food a bit (maybe it seems like punishment?) and younger kitten gets it anyway. I have tried putting younger kitten in the bathroom with her food until older kitten has finished hers, but like I said, older kitten likes to eat her wet food in 2-4 different goes, so not fair to younger kitten if she is locked in the bathroom that whole time (plus the litter box is in there, so it means older kitten would also be locked away from litter box...just doesn't work).</p>

<p>Is there any way I can teach younger kitten to slow down and/or stop stealing older kitten's food? Or teach older kitten not to let her food be stolen? Or just some suggestions for eating arrangements so everyone gets to eat their own food?</p>

"Cockatiel going into tight spaces and getting angry","<p>My cockatiel got into the habit of going into tight spaces and getting angry there.  She goes into the cupboard, clothes dryer, climbs into any pots or dishes that are around, or just squeezes inbetween my thigh and the arm of the sofa.  When she's in closed spaces like this, she gets angry when I put my hand near her, or sometimes even if I just go close to her.  She hisses, fans out the tail and sometimes screams at me.  As soon as I remove her from the closed space, she's a friendly bird again.</p>

<p>The bird started doing this maybe 5 month ago or so.  She's 18 months old now.</p>

<p>We used to put her into the cupboard often before, because she would stay put and play happily with bread tags in there while we were doing something else in the kitchen (usually washing dishes in front of the same cupboard).  It's difficult to get some work done with a bird that keeps following you around and always poking her beak into whatever you're doing, so it was convenient.</p>

<p>After she started getting angry in such places, we didn't let her go there any more, and we're trying to not let her into tight spaces in general.  Though the cupboard is still her favourite place and she'd try to fly inside whenever it's open.  (Second favourite are all kinds of pots or bowls.)</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong> Why does the bird do this, and in particular, is this <em>usual</em> / <em>common</em> behaviour for cockatiels?  Is this some kind of nesting instinct and is it related to sexual behaviour?  What can I do to avoid it?</p>

<h3>The time line</h3>

<p><em>~16:20 EST</em>:    One of my free range rabbits starts following me around to indicate he'd like some kibble, after a minute or two I give in, scoop up the kibble.  Surprisingly my other rabbit seems unaware of what's going on and I need to flag her down to get her attention.  She acts a bit confused for a few seconds, but then catches on and  flies up to the top level (4 floors) of the condo quicker than I can dispense the kibble.  I note to my girlfriend how I've <strong>never</strong> seen her move that fast.</p>

<p><em>~16:35 EST</em>:  The caged guinea pig in the living room that we adopted 3 weeks ago starts to wheet, and I decide to give it some Romaine lettuce.  I take a few extra leaves over to the rabbits.  My female rabbit refuses the lettuce which is highly unusual. </p>

<p><em>16:50 EST</em>: <strong>I notice my female rabbit is acting strange and throws her self into the corner litter pan, which almost never gets used because it's highly exposed and doesn't have great access to hay.  This is quite odd, my female rabbit (unlike the make) never lays or roots in the litter pans.  Upon closer inspection, I notice that her breathing is more than twice her normal rate (hard to see in the video due to the frame rate).  I watch her for several minutes as she struggles to get comfortable, and keeps kicking the back of the liter pan because she is unable to fully stretch out in it.</strong>  After a few minutes of this it becomes clear she isn't playing, or scared of me or something in the house.   I try to console her, it doesn't help, and seems to make her switch positions. I back off and call for the girlfriend, who agrees, there's something seriously wrong.   I struggle with what to do; she looks like she might have a heart attack; a car ride to the vet could make it worse.</p>

<p><em>16:48 EST</em>: I decide she needs to see a vet, but that I need a video of her behavior before I go.  I call the ER in case they can give me some advice; the person who answers is almost useless, and for some reason thinks I'm talking about a cat when I clearly opened with ""my pet rabbit is hyperventilating"" after waisting 4 more minutes to determine that this person is incapable of pulling up my rabbits medical files (we always take her there) I'm able to hang up.</p>

<p><em>17:10 EST</em>: I gather both rabbits into their carrier (oddly the male puts up no fight whereas he NEVER lets me pick him up, he must somehow understand the severity of the situation).  My female tosses and turns after being placed in the carrier.</p>

<p><em>17:38 EST</em>: I arrive at the medical center, and have to wait in line behind 2 people at the emergency counter</p>

<p><em>17:45 EST</em>: One of the 4 people at the main (non-ER) desk recognizes the queue and asks if we are all there for emergency, we all say yes.  This spurs one of the other people there to call the person in front of me to their counter a minute later.</p>

<p><em>17:53 EST</em>:  I'm annoyed that I'm still in line; the person being served in front of me has been has been at the counter for 15 minutes, and it's clear her problem might not even be urgent, let a lone an emergency.  <strong>I decide to unzip the carrier to verify my rabbit is actually still alive, thankfully she is.  Her breathing has slowed, but is still faster than normal.  I place my hand under the carrier to better support her and feel her shiver for about 2.5 seconds then stopped, then repeated again about every 5-10 seconds.</strong></p>

<p><em>18:03 EST</em>: The person in front of me finally look like they are finishing up payments and other administrative things and begins reaching for her suitcase.  About 2 minutes later she pulls out a black trash bag with a cat inside. A minute later the receptions phones for someone to pick up a 'DOA cat'.  My confidence in the hospital begins to fade.</p>

<p><em>18:05 EST</em>: I can finally rest my carrier on the counter and get a better look at my rabbit as I begin to check her in.  <strong>I can visibly she her tremble / shiver.</strong>  The receptionist immediately realizes she should call someone up front to determine if my rabbit should be triage.  We continue the check-in process and for some reason they again struggle to pull up my rabbit's records. After 5 minutes, the receptionist recognizes that no one has come to access the rabbit yet, and calls again for someone.  </p>

<p><em>18:12 EST</em> Finally some one qualified comes to check out the rabbit.  She of course doesn't notice her shiver, just her breathing.  After questioning me about the last time she ate, decides she's ""stable enough"", and my check in process continues for another 2 minutes.</p>

<p><em>~18:40 EST</em> An on staff vet meets me in the waiting area, and brings me to a examination room.  <strong>My rabbit is still shaking at this point, but breathing is almost normal.</strong>  She does seem a bit more confused than usual.  After explaining the situation, the doctor asked if she'd any trouble breathing or small poops.  <strong>I noted that she had been having slightly smaller poops that we attributed to trying to introduce her to the guinea pig over 20 hrs ago, and that at ~04:00 EST she had done what sounded like a sneeze followed by 5 coughs, which was unusual for her.</strong>  The doctor asked me to send her the video I had taken (posted above), and to take the rabbit to the exotics area where she'll preform the examination since it will be more quiet.</p>

<p><em>~19:00 EST</em> The doctor returns with my rabbit and says she seems fine now.  Indeed, <strong>all symptoms are gone</strong>.  The doctor tells me she wasn't sure what was wrong, perhaps she was just afraid.  I told her this wasn't likely as she's one of the most people tolerant rabbits I've ever had, and explained I thought it was pain or neurology related.  She agreed and listed a bacterial cause, lead poising and gas as possible culprits, but said there wasn't any evidence of physical harm.  She prescribed the usual regiment of metoclopramide, pain killers and critical care and recommended that I pick up some simethicone from a regular pharmacy and feed her 1 ml to treat gas.  She went on to tell me how their exotic vet would be on staff tomorrow if I felt I needed her to see someone who knew more about rabbits.</p>

<p><em>19:25 EST</em> I bring the rabbit back into the house.  When released from the carrier, she immediately begins to gorge on hay.  </p>

<hr>

<p>I'm glad my rabbit seems to be alright now, but obviously, my confidence in the hospital has been shaken a little by my experience.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen rabbit behavior like this before?</p>

<p>Could she really have E. cuniculi, or could have it really been just gas pains?  Is there anything else it should have been? Perhaps something the guinea pig gave her?  </p>

<p>I'm doubtful about the lead poising as she had it before and the symptoms were much different.  </p>

<p>I'm trying to determine weather she should be brought to the specialist tomorrow.  </p>

<p>Further, it would be nice to have a plan if this were to ever happen again in the future. Should I just feed her some simethicone instead of heading to the hospital, or perhaps I should call around and try to find an ER with an exotic vet on staff next time even if that means driving an 1.5 hrs instead of 20 min.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Update</em>: about 2 months later my other rabbit choose the same potty to exhibit very similar behavior, though he acted a little less frantic, perhaps because he's overall more fearful of people and was likely to be trying harder to hid it.  With my other rabbit it also seemed a bit more evident that it was stomach related and not neurological.  The exotics vet wasn't on call that night so we fed him metacloprmide for 12 hrs.  He seemed to be in less pain in the morning, so we kept going. About 18 hrs later he was back to normal.</p>

"What time of day to feed our adult dogs?","<p>Our dogs are four and six years old. We have been feeding them twice a day since each was one year old. Recently I came across a <a href=""http://www.pawboutique.com/dodisy.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">web page</a> that argued quite well on the reasons why it is better to feed an adult dog only once a day. That text did not say (or I missed it) what would be a good time of day for feeding.</p>

<p>Why is evening better? The food we give our dogs is dry pellets, which in my imagination makes for easy digestion. Won't the dogs then have empty stomach by the next day and won't that make them restlessly looking for the next bowlful of food? My family is away from home during the day and I'd like our dogs to calmly rest that time. Wouldn't it be good to give them food in the morning before we leave for work and school?</p>

"Planted Nano Aquarium Experiment","<p><strong>Material</strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>several 750ml cylindrical glass containers: with and without top cap  </li>
<li>different types of substrates: gravel (small to mid-size grains), sand and fertilized soil for aquarium (neutral Ph)  </li>
<li>different types of plants: low maintenance and fast growth  </li>
<li>different types of water: tap, filtered and <strong>distilled</strong>  </li>
<li>different types of fertilizers: soluble, solid and ammonium hydroxide 25%  </li>
<li>different types of light sources: 0.2~10W 3000K and natural sunlight  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Experiment</strong>  </p>

<p>Basically, the experiment consist of trying to find a configuration and a proper amount of light+fertilizers that would increase the lifespan of the plants. However, as much as I've tried (ex: 0~50ppm ammonia, 4~24hr/day light, ...), nothing seems to change the following pattern:  </p>

<ul>
<li>day 1: bubbles whenever there is enough light  </li>
<li>day 2~4: less bubbles, plant as hole less green  </li>
<li>day 5~7: leaf falling, first signs of algae  </li>
<li>day 8~12: almost no bubbles, some parts of the plant are rot  </li>
<li>day 13+: the plant is probably dead and algae blooms  </li>
</ul>

"Cat has acute episodes of extreme ALT levels. Vet and we are at a loss as there's no obvious toxin access, looking for weird or uncommon ideas","<p>We've been to a pretty good vet. We know the symptoms, but we just can't figure out what might be going on, or a cause. The vet says its serious and possibly life threatening, but he's at a loss what else it might be as well. I'll write what we know - any ideas, insights, suggestions for uncommon causes, weird or exceptional toxins, ideas sparked by the information, or anything else, would be helpful, to prevent recurrence.</p>

<p>The cat is about 10 years old, spayed female rescue, lived with us 5+ years, 5kg, rude good health apart from occasional bouts of stress cystitis (urinary stress diet + extra soup/water + cistaid given to counter this). Also pathologically misanthropic - her general view on humans is that apart from opening doors and providing food, they should all go away. But we love her anyway :)</p>

<h1>First episode &amp; vet visit</h1>

<p>About 2 months ago (25 April 2018) she had an acute episode of some kind of poisoning. She vomited a lot, but otherwise seemed fine all day. The next morning, over the course of 12 hours she went from ""off her food"" in the morning, to pretty much laid down and indifferent to everything waiting to die by afternoon, to the point of not even hissing, avoiding or clawing at human fingers near her face. Serious stuff for her.</p>

<p>We contacted the emergency vet hospital, who gave us some tips, and did some online research, and watched her a long time. She had no confusion, when pushed off the bed she didn't fail in co-ordination, no dilated pupils, tongue was very pale though.</p>

<p>We took her to the vet (well known to us, and competent). They identified a significant heart murmur (usual feline myopathy) in passing, did ultrasound and bloods, which confirmed no liver tumour or masses, no sign of internal bleeding, but general signs of gross insult/damage to the liver, some anaemia (25 on whatever scale is used in the UK) and off the scale for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ALT</a> (Alanine aminotransferase, an enzyme related to liver cell necrosis/toxicity: the level was 6000+ according to independent lab they asked to retest it. I gather usual is &lt; 100 ish?). She was so gone that the vet could take a blood sample from the neck without protest or sedation (when she recovered next week, the same vet couldn't even palpitate her stomach without risk of injury!). The conclusion was liver toxicity, and indeed the next afternoon she noticeably regained her appetite, and suddenly began to recover, and the episode ended. She was put onto beta blockers and thinners (Atenolol + Plavix) for the heart condition, and tolerated them, and all was well. A retest a week later showed ALT level had dropped to ~ 600 and the anaemia had ""resolved"".</p>

<h1>Today's episode &amp; vet visit</h1>

<p>This morning (2 June 2018) she was off her food. There hadn't been any vomiting, but she remained off food all day and by 4pm was once more showing the same signs as before - laid down, lethargic, and so on. We decided the risk was too great to leave overnight, and took her to the vet. </p>

<p>We arrived at 7pm, and he said at once it was serious and probably life-threatening. He expressed concern it might be internal haemorrhaging or a missed tumour, and redid the ultrasound, but there's no evidence of leakage or pooled liquid or other issues internally, and no masses in the liver or anywhere else he checked. Yet again ALT levels are sky-high - his machine goes up to 2000 and ALT is off the scale (he said done by a lab it could easily be 6000 or whatever), and anaemia is lower than last time, just 18 now, and the tongue is very pale. Most other levels are normal-ish, I gather. He didn't want to use a drip to address blood pressure as that would accentuate the anaemia issues, and said to stop giving the blood thinner until we know more, as well. We finally left about 9pm. In all, he saw her for almost 2 hours, compared to the usual 10-15 minute consultation.</p>

<p>We went through a bunch of possibilities but he said that the symptoms looks most like paracetamol poisoning - but that it doesn't fit that either. It could be an infection, except there's no other evidence and why would it go then return? It seems most likely she ate something - just inhaling even dust from a tablet wouldn't be enough, she would need to eat quite a lot to have this effect, and there just aren't any tablets around, and in 5 years we've never seen her scouring the floor for anything. She's in a flat (apartment) so she's isolated from any other cats and probably all/most pathogens they could carry. She has access to a terrace with some plants, but this doesn't resemble any plant poisoning he could suggest. The household products used aren't normally spilt, and those we do use he said would cause irritation, diahrrea, or vomiting, which we didn't see this time.</p>

<h1>And.....</h1>

<p>We're at a loss, and so is the vet. I'm staying up all night to watch her breathing, in case it worsens and she suddenly needs to go to the emergency hospital. I'm about 60/40 that she will be OK, but the fact it's happened twice and we can't think how, even after taking all the precautions we can think of against odd eventualities, is really a worry.</p>

<p>Like I said at the start - any thoughts, insights, suggestions or things missed, that this narrative sparks off, or that might be worth checking or considering, would be very welcome.</p>

"How to deal with a hell hound","<p>There was a time when we did not have any trouble with our dogs. We have a very responsible alpha male dog. One snarl will end any fights before it started. He has a friend, a gay dog. We found out he is gay because he loves to get humped on, and does not hump on a female dog. </p>

<p>The gay dog and the alpha male are both old buddies, so its no question the gay dog thought she was female, and the alpha male humps him. Even though we adopted 2 strays, 1 male and female. The alpha male and the gay dog are in control, there are no fights whatsoever even when food is concerned. And even though the female dog became mature, there are no fights still. No one mates the female, not even the alpha male. </p>

<p>Last month the alpha male died of sickness. The gay dog went to a serious depression, and we did too, because the alpha male was the best dog that we ever had, but we have to move on. We showed the dogs that we can make it through even without the alpha male, so we went on every day normally. Now we did own a stray male dog did we? Right now its like he stated himself as the Alpha male and then all hell broke lose. </p>

<p>That dog and the female became partners, starting last month, they hate baths when there was a time they don't mind it at all. We watched Ceasar Millan's videos on how to approach them, because we thought they became like that because of our action, maybe we are hurting them physically during bath time, so we tried to use gloves with soft cotton, but we just received snarls and even bites. </p>

<p>That's not all, during the time when the female was in heat, that alpha male dog becomes a hell hound. He bites the gay dog so hard, he even goes to the jugular vein. We use chokers to detach them, but when we all leave the house, we always return with the gay dog bruised. If you want to know what did the gay dog do to deserve such punishment from the hell hound? Absolutely nothing, the gay dog just sits there, then the attacks happen, there was even a time when the gay dog was just sleeping, then he was attacked!</p>

<p>Caging the hell hound is dangerous because there was a time that my mother tried to cage him and the dog bite my mothers hand, almost detaching the finger. She had to have stitches and operations to get the finger attached. </p>

<p>If you will think we are hurting the dogs during caging, we do not. Our procedure to put them in the cage is simple, open the cage, call their names and they should go inside the cage, we don't force them to go inside the cage.</p>

<p>So, right the family is deciding what to do with this dog, we are a family of 6, 2 of us agreed to kill the dog (Mom and I), 4 of them says no. But the dangerous dog keeps on rampaging the gay dog and us every day, so how do we deal with such dog? Are we right to think that we should kill it for the good of everyone?</p>

<p>What we did:</p>

<p>1) Normal Discipline - back then, when they snarl we say no. It somehow stops them, but now, not even loud noises can not stop the dog from snarling.</p>

<p>2) Throwing cold water during the fights - I think we saw something like to detach two dogs that are fighting, and discipline a dog, a bucket of water can be used so that we may not harm them physically, but that does not work, chokers do the job.</p>

<p>3) No Physical harm are done to the dogs (yet) - Because we know it is illegal, but if something ever happens to my mother again, that's another story.</p>

"Moving to a house where a dog lived?","<p>We're moving to a new house in about a month.  </p>

<p>The house has a white Labrador living there at the moment - I have no idea of the age, gender or temperament.  I don't know where in the house the Lab sleeps, but her bed was in the garage when we've visited for open days.</p>

<p>My dog Pete is a 6 year-old Bearded Collie crossed with Huntaway.  He's a neutered male, and while he used to chew things and dig as a puppy, he hasn't done that for a long time.   Pete sleeps on a low mattress in our combined living/dining room.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What do I need to do or prepare for when we move in?</p>

<p>Should I try to reduce any scent from the previous dog by excessively watering outside and scrubbing down inside?  Or am  I anticipating non-existent problems?</p>

"Is my dog the aggressive one?","<p>we just adopted a three year old dog, she is very friendly towards people when they come at the house or approach her, and outdoors she isn't even interested in other people.</p>

<p>I've been practicing walking her and right now i think it is safe to say she looks at me as the pack leader, she very rarely pulls, just when she finds an interesting smell and a little tug on the leash brings her right back, so for the third day i think we made wonderful progress. She also pulls a bit when we stop at a grassy area for her to relieve herself i think this is normal and this is her reward for behaving during the walk, i let her smell around and pull me a little ( is this ok?).</p>

<p>The problem is with other dogs, at the pound we took her for a walk, and at the exit we passed a couple of dogs returning from a walk and she freaked out, people at the pound told us she was just jealous. She has gotten better we are at a point where most times other dogs bark at her and she just ignores them.</p>

<p>So yesterday i noticed a dog giving her a stare down i ignored him and just when we were at our closest point (5-10 m, i was not going any closer and was returning home at this point) she noticed him and started barking (not sure who started growling and barking first), i gave her a tug and/or a pat on the neck and she snapped out of it and started ignoring the other dog's barking.</p>

<p>Today another dog was loose while his owner was sitting they started barking at each other and i got her to stop immediately again, but then she started crying ( as in i want to socialize?), So i moved away a little bit and when she stopped crying and calmed down i decided to let her approach, she behaved very well, started smelling him (the other dog seemed a bit scared or protective), she didn't bark or growl and only when we were very close to the other dog's owner the other dog started showing his teeth, barking, and growling, mine did nothing, the other owner told me this was normal behaviour for his dog so i decided to go away.</p>

<p>At the pound my dog lived with another dog.</p>

<p>I always try to keep calm and just correct her behaviour and ignore the other dogs, but i feel she wants to socialize, but it seems other dog owners in my area are ""bad owners"", what can i do? And am.i doing stuff right?</p>

"Sometimes my kitten doesn't eat from his plate","<p>This happens around 20-25% of the time I feed my kitten.  </p>

<p>The kitten asks me for food. I put the food in the plate &amp; keep it at his usual eating place. He will smell it and then walk away disdainfully. 
However,if I take small bite size portions in my hand and feed him - he will eat it - I have to feed him around 3-4 bites by hand &amp; then he will move to the plate and start eating it. Alternately, if instead of feeding him by hand, if I take a piece and put it on the floor, he will eat it. Again if he eats around 3-4 pieces from the floor, he will move to the plate and start eating off the plate.  </p>

The tank is stock on the heavy side of thing and I purchase a larger tank (75gal) for another project I will not be doing finally. So I will use the larger tank to transfer the livestock of the small one when I move in about 2 week. I read <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/5904/is-it-safe-to-move-fish-and-all-equipment-to-a-new-tank"">the question ""Is it safe to move fish and all equipment to a new tank?""</a>, but since the tank difference is much bigger I can't simply do as he did.

<p>I would like to avoid moving the livestock twice in a small amount of time. If I move the old filtration with the livestock could I simply add every one in the 75 and wait before adding anything else?

"Tips for encouraging a cat to eat more?","<p>My ~10-year-old cat (male, neutered, indoor-only) has recently has a decline in appetite and corresponding weight loss.  We've been to the vet, had X-rays and blood tests (normal), had an ultrasound, and are waiting for a possible biopsy of lymph nodes in/near the GI tract (showed as enlarged on the ultrasound), but the first available appointment is a few weeks away.  In the meantime, I'm looking for ways to encourage him to eat more.</p>

<p>When I put wet food down he eats a few mouthfuls and then loses interest.  I've tried a variety of canned foods, both pate and chunks in gravy, and including a prescription food specialized for GI problems.  The cat is allergic to fish, so canned tuna isn't an option (unless I get desperate enough that ""food now"" trumps ""allergic reaction later"").  Dry food is available all time.  He'll eat a few treats if I feed them to him one at a time, but not if I put a bunch out at once.  Fresh water is available at all times (multiple locations, replaced a couple times a day).</p>

<p>I normally feed wet food in shallow bowls; my vet suggested a plate instead, which hasn't made a difference so far.  She also suggested serving canned food at room temperature, not straight out of the fridge, which I'm doing.</p>

<p>My vet prescribed a low dose of an antidepressant (yes, really!) because a side-effect is appetite stimulation.  That seemed to make a difference on the first day, but not much since (it's been a week since we started this).</p>

<p>He had to have three teeth pulled about seven weeks ago due to resorptive lesions in his mouth.  My vet has examined him since and found no further problems in his mouth -- and, in fact, he was eating normally for a while after that surgery.  The loss of appetite is much more recent.</p>

<p>How can I get him to eat more?  Are there particular foods that might work better?  (I'm flexible about <em>what</em> I feed him, aside from the fish thing, if it'll get more nutrients into him.)</p>

<p>Obviously we need to identify and solve the underlying medical problem.  That's not what this question is about, though input on that is welcome too.</p>

<p>My Question is what percentage of new owners transfer contact information when a chip was originally registered to a previous owner/organization?  I am particularly interested in the break out of shelter/rescue pets.  </p>

<p>I know in our family all of our pets are rescued.  The shelters we adopt from have generally installed the chip and they are listed as the owner.  The shelter keeps a record of adopting the specific pet to us.  We have chosen not to update contact information for the chip.  </p>

<p>So worst case, our pet ends up back at the shelter we rescued them from.  Because we know this, our local rescues acts as an always available intermediary. </p>

"Is it normal for a cat to go out and go back home voluntarily?","<h1>Some Background</h1>

<p>I live in an apartment at the 12th story of a high-rise residential apartment building in a typical Chinese city. The building has elevators and stairwells. In every story of the building, there are tens of apartments along the long hallway.
About 2 months ago, I encountered a cat when I was about to go out from home and waiting for the elevator. When the elevator arrived and door opened, this cat just popped out of the elevator. He followed me and just sit at my doorstep, seemingly wanting to go inside, so I let him. I then adopted this cat whom I think was abandoned by others (which is not uncommon) in the same residential area.</p>

<h1>First Time Letting Go</h1>

<p>As time goes by, he became increasingly eager to going out. Several days ago, I let him go. He knows where the stairwells are and where it leads to (i.e., ""the outside world""). (The experience was gained by his former ""failed"" attempts to ""escape"".) So he went by himself, like the same voluntary way he came to me at the beginning.</p>

<p>Another day I saw him outside and ""miao""-ed at him. Then he just came back with me. (He went in and out elevator swiftly with me, and sit at my doorstep waiting for me to open the door.)</p>

<h1>The Second Time Letting Go</h1>

<p>He came back, ate, drank, and sleep. 
After less than 48 hours, he seems to want to go out again. As before, I let him go.</p>

<h1>The Unexpected and The Question</h1>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, less than 2 days after his second leaving, my girlfriend opened the door as we were about to go out. The cat was just lying there waiting for us to open the door so that he could go in.</p>

<p>We are really shocked at this. Therefore I wish to know:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it normal for a cat to manage to go back ""home"" in a situation where s/he has to climb an exact number of stories to get the correct floor and find the correct door among tens of other doors?</p>
  
  <p>How does he know which story to go for and which door to stop at? Is it by scent?</p>

When we first got her she would act worried and cry often; pretty normal for a dog in her situation. That faded as we trained her not to and she began to get comfortable.</p>

<p>After a while we noticed her playing with rolled up socks and a few of our other dog's (Boston Terrier) furry toys. So we bought all the dogs their own toys.

"Can goldfish have opinions?","<p>I have two goldfish for 2 years named Archimedes and Nelson. They lived in an aquarium with big white gravel. I changed their soil with dark blue pebbles as a result of advice given by my breeder. A few minutes after having handed Archimedes and Nelson their aquarium with their new soils, they slowly approached the ground and they began by ""rubbing"" with their new gravel (they swam for 2 seconds horizontally by scraping the gravel) . A few hours later and the following days, I did not observe this new behavior.</p>

<p>Are goldfish directly aware of their environment? Can they prefer certain things to others (prefer blue gravel than white gravel) and express their preferences explicitly through specific behaviors?</p>

<p>More broadly: goldfish (or other species) may have preferred fish (like best friends), prefer plants or soils more than others for their color, shape or texture.</p>

<ul>
<li>I feed a variety of wet and dry food. Usually dry food overnight/in the morning (when I go to work) and a pouch of wet food in the evening</li>
<li>stable weight over the last couple of years or so (older cat in particular did get a bit fat a few years ago due to being greedy but I got that under control!)</li>
<li>no relevant health issues (diabetes etc) for oldest cat only a bad tooth and a fall from height a few years ago. Yearly visit to vets for vaccinations etc and all looks good, and I haven't seen anything that I found concerning.</li>
<li>I occasionally give them tinned tuna, sardines etc but not as their regular meals.</li>
<li>they currently all eat together (side by side) and seem to be part of one social group</li>

"Are we feeding our bunny enough?","<p>About a month ago, our bunny had to go to the vet for what turned out to be a respiratory problem (probably a cold; Metacam did the trick, but that's by the bye). While at the vet, she mentioned that he was a good weight, but his teeth were too sharp and we ought to reduce his nuggets to 1-2 teaspoons per day. At the time, he was getting quite a lot of hay and the occasional fresh vegetable -- mostly parsley, spinach and coriander (cilantro), and the occasional carrot head -- but that was a considerable reduction to his dry food (which he loves).</p>

<p>Anyway, we reduced his nugget intake -- which didn't go down well, initially -- and he's slowly gotten used to it. (It was weeks before he was flopping again!) Consequently, his hay intake has increased and we give him slightly more fresh vegetables to compensate; plus he's become a bit crazy when it's nugget time!</p>

<p>He's not a fan of hay, so even though his consumption has increased, it's clear that it isn't as much as what the nuggets provided, as he's lost a lot of weight. For example, when you stroke him, his skeleton is now really obvious and he seems more sleepy than usual. He's happy, but we're concerned that he's not getting enough food.</p>

<p>Is this normal? If so, then I guess we'll just try to be less ""protective""; if not, presuming it's not a more serious issue, what additional food can we supply that's good for him (both his digestion <em>and</em> teeth) that he will actually eat?</p>

<p>(Mini lop; male, neutered; ~16mo. I don't remember his ""good weight"", but it was slightly over 1kg and he's smaller-than-average, even for a mini lop.)</p>

"Introducing a blind cat and a playful kitten","<p>I am currently fostering Alex, a two year old cat who was left completely blind after a car accident about two months ago. He has only recently left the vet clinic but is already quite well adjusted and fairly confident around the house where he's allowed to roam.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I am caring for a kitten that was (mostly) abandoned by its feral mother (she sometimes visits to eat) outside my building. The kitten must be two months old or possibly older (can't know). The kitten is only allowed in the house when I can supervise, otherwise he is either outside or in another room. He does not spend nights inside.</p>

<p>I've been trying to get them to socialise but I'm not sure that I'm making the right progress. I've taken it very slowly, starting out with a few minutes of them being around each other at a time, and building up gradually over the last couple of weeks. Since the kitten is outside my building, I can't keep him indoors and do the whole ""play through the door"" thing regularly - though we've done that, it ended with hissing. The best I've achieved so far is to get them to take turns playing with the same toy (mouse and bell on a string) and that was going great until the older cat performed a small but angry attack against the kitten. The kitten hit back. Some more hissing ensued, then they both retreated.</p>

<p>Can I have advice from anyone who's had to deal with a similar situation? Or any thoughts on whether this latest one was a positive encounter? I don't want to give up but I'm becoming impatient.</p>

"Is it safe to paint the toenails of a reptile, or does it pose a hazard to the reptile?","<p>I have no intention of doing this myself, but I saw some photos on Facebook of someone's bearded lizard with painted toenails and I was curious.

<p>Personally I see at least two possible hazard areas:  </p>

<ul>
<li>the nail varnish itself being toxic and either being absorbed through the nails or swallowed</li>
<li>the nail varnish flaking off and posing a choking hazard, particularly for a smaller reptile like a gecko</li>
</ul>

<p>If toxicity is a problem, are children's nail varnishes less toxic? And if it <em>is</em> all right to use nail varnish on a reptile, how would it be safely removed?

  <p>Due to the popularity of the product we saw a huge spike in demand
  Sept/Oct last year. As a result we ran the whole European stock out
  before the new shed antler arrives in April.   As you know it’s a
  natural product and we can’t just produce as much as we want.   We
  hope to have Pets at home restocked in March and have sourced some
  antler from the Southern hemisphere but it takes a long time to get
  here and get all the correct government paperwork in place.   So
  hopefully during March you should see a return to normal, but in the
  meantime if you do require some we are keeping a small supply</p>

He has a big cage to hop around in, and for the most part we leave its door open, giving him freedom to hop around his room and eat the cardboard boxes we leave in there for him. He's allowed to venture out into the living room or bedroom as long as one of us is there to keep half an eye on him. </p>

<p>We're thinking about adding a cat to our household (bringing the tally up to two humans, one bun, and one kitty). We want to make sure any cat we adopt will coexist with our rabbit, or maybe even be friends. The rabbit is pretty chill with new people as long as they aren't too aggressive with him, so we're hoping the same would be true with a cat.</p>

<p>It will be hard to find a cat with experience with bunnies, so what else should we look for? Should we get a young cat or kitten, hoping we can train it not to antagonize the bunny? A kitten would be about the size of the bun (for the first few weeks), so that might help him not fear the cat. Or should we go for an older cat that's too lazy to care? The bunny wouldn't feel threatened by the cat's attention if it were totally apathetic toward him. </p>

<p>How should we go about finding a feline companion for the bunny?</p>

"Why are there two ring stewards at the Westminster Kennel Club show?","<p>I've been watching some of the breed judging at the 2014 <a href=""http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/"">Westminster Kennel Club</a> conformation show online and I noticed that there are two stewards in the ring. Any of the other dog shows that I've been to have had a single ring steward (I've shown at <a href=""http://www.akc.org/"">AKC</a>, <a href=""http://www.ckc.ca/en/"">CKC</a> and <a href=""http://iabca.com/"">IABCA</a> shows, and attended but not shown at <a href=""http://www.ukcdogs.com/"">UKC</a> shows). Looking at the <a href=""http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/2014/show/WKC_2014_Judging_Program.pdf"">judging program</a> for the show, there are indeed two stewards listed for almost every ring.</p>

<p>So, why does the Westminster KC show use two stewards for most rings? And in the few cases that they only have one, why are those rings different?</p>

"How do I identify my alpha dog, or do I even have one?","<p>I have owned three dogs, L, R, and C.  Here is their development in chronological order.</p>

<p>L is our first, male, neutered dog; born in 2000, we've had him since 2002 and he is still alive as of this posting.  He shivers a lot, and was nervous coming out of his crate for weeks after we first got him. He loved to live under the bed. Eventually, he lives on top of the bed and buries himself, but he also makes his way down, eats, goes outside, and sometimes relaxes.  He is very attached to my wife, going so far as to want to be in the shower with her; we used to have to lock the bathroom door to prevent wet dog every morning, until we got a shower with a sliding door.  He seems to have wised up about these things and simply lays down on the rug and waits.  L does not play with toys unless no one is looking.  L would not eat unless no one was looking.  L acts very submissive to my wife, flipping over for her and somewhat friendly (but also very vocal with barks) when she is home, but is a different, quiet dog when she is not around.</p>

<p>R is our second, male, neutered dog; born in 2001, we got him in 2003 or 2004 as a companion to L to help get L out of his shell.  He passed away 3 years ago.  R was a foodie and would eat until he burst if we let him (he had Cushing's Disease).  R could be very aggressive in play, and loved to tug on rope and chase and catch frisbees.  R would try to steal L's food (and our food).  L would growl and chase R away from his food.  Sometimes R didn't care what L thought, but other times he deferred to L.  To get L to eat, instead of waiting for night time, we would bring R into the room, then L would gobble his food down.  L and R played together a lot and relaxed against each other at times.  It was rare, but occasionally L and R would fight, mostly over treats (which R would steal from L and hoard; we chalked that up to his hunger disease), and they each had nips in their ears from the other having bitten down.  R was a larger sized dog than L.  R was extremely attached to me and would follow my every command; he acted depressed when I was not around, but would still participate in play.  He came when I called for him and tried to be with me whenever he could.</p>

<p>C is our third, female, spayed dog and is also alive at this time. We suspect she was born in 2008, and we got her in 2012 as a companion to L after R passed.  She grooms L on the face constantly, and L licks her mouth at times and sniffs her.  There has been a rare mounting attempts from L.  They lay down next to each other and sleep together in a basket, not unlike how L and R would.  She is the same size as R was.  Now that L is older, he eats his food without prompting; something he learned during the his time with R.  L will now try to steal C's food.  If C sees L stealing her food, she rushes over, shoves L out of the way with a growl, and eats her food.  She occasionally takes from L's bowl, but only when he isn't around.  Like R, C is attached to me and waits at the door for me to come home; she dances like crazy when I arrive.  She seems mopey when I am not home, in the same fashion that L is mopey when my wife is not home.  She comes when I call for her and tries to be with me whenever she can.</p>

<p>Is (was) there an alpha dog here, and what could be used to identify the alpha?  Is it L or C?  Was R an alpha?  Perhaps myself or my wife?</p>

"One cat doesn't understand the other is just play-fighting","<p>My girlfriend and I have two three-year-old cats: Napoleon (male) and Josefine (female). They are siblings from the same litter. I have been studying abroad for the last 9 months, so currently my girlfriend's the one taking care of them.</p>

<p>The two cats get along just fine for the vast majority of the day. They eat together, the female frequently bathes the male (though baths usually become a small fight for some reason, and she really doesn't like it when he tries to bathe her), and my girlfriend sends me pictures (<a href=""https://youtu.be/NINRL_I7O9c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">and videos</a>) of the cats sleeping cuddling together in the most adorable ways at least once a week.</p>

<p>However, whenever the two play together, Napoleon seems to have a hard time understanding the boundaries of acceptable behavior and takes things a bit too far.</p>

<p>It doesn't help that Napoleon is significantly larger (1&nbsp;kg = 2&nbsp;lb heavier even though they're the same age) than Josefine, and that she sometimes honestly seems to ask for it.</p>

<p>As a representative example, please <a href=""https://youtu.be/hZaPHGjAkEc?t=15s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">watch this 45-second video</a>. Josefine waits to ambush Napoleon as he leaves the bathroom (where we keep their sandbox) and gives him a light tap on the head (I interpret this as a play-ambush). He gets seemingly startled and then the situation momentarily escalates (but not severely), followed by Josefine becoming slightly submissive (hunching down) and letting out long, trembling meows as both seemingly vie for an opportunity to strike. Napoleon then lets out some meows of his own and Josefine becomes very submissive, lying down.</p>

<p>The video ends there, and my girlfriend says that's when she interrupted the fight by calling their attention. In similar situations when she hasn't stopped them (she usually lets them solve things out for themselves), Napoleon will go for a bite or something of the sort, Josefine will bat him away and run away, at which point Napoleon will sometimes give chase. If he does, the fight continues with more jabs and some biting. Nails always remain sheathed and the bites don't seem to be meant to injure (no one's ever come out bleeding, shall we say).</p>

<p>Sometimes we just see the chase and don't see the instigating incident (or whether there was one), but Josefine seems to be the usual initial instigator. Other times the cats play ""tag"", running around the house with no issue.</p>

<p>Once the fights are over, the cats don't seem to avoid each other or anything indicating lasting animosity. That being said, one time (and only one time that we're aware of) Napoleon did end up with a tuft of Josefine's hair in his mouth.</p>

<p>Since neither cat seems very affected by the fights, my girlfriend usually doesn't interrupt them. That being said, we'd rather stop this behavior or at least understand it better.</p>

<p>Is this actually just normal play-fighting (and the time Napoleon got a mouthful of hair was then just a one-off accident/escalation) to be shrugged off? Is our interpretation of Josefine's behavior incorrect, and she isn't play-fighting at all? Or, if we are correct in our diagnosis that Napoleon simply doesn't know how to play-fight, is there some way to teach him to turn it down a notch?</p>

<p>For some further context into our cats' recent history and how their behaviors changed (quite significantly) after I left to study, please see <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/18761/6462"">this other question I asked 7 months ago</a>. This type of fighting also only started after I left, so that context might be relevant. (Also note that the issue raised in that question has passed)</p>

"Leaving an American Eskimo dog at home regularly","<p>I am thinking of getting an American Eskimo dog (most likely toy size). I live in an apartment (in Stuyvesant Town, New York City, New York, U.S.A.). </p>

<p>In the usual weekday, all 4 people in the family go to work or to school. The earliest leaves at 6:45 a.m. (or, will, next school year), and the latest leaves at 7:50 a.m. The earliest comes back around 3:00 to 3:40, with the latest coming back later than 7:30 p.m. </p>

<p>This means that the dog would most likely be alone for 7 hours a day, and would only be walked twice a day [at 6:30 am and 6:30 p.m.] for half an hour at a time (the hour a day part seems ok for this breed by what I've read). Is this ok for an American Eskimo? If not, why not, and if not, is there any easy way for me to make this better without letting an outside person become attached to the dog?</p>

<p>I read somewhere that if a dog (no matter what breed) is used to a schedule like this from puppyhood, then it will do fine. Is this true?</p>

"Leaving an American Eskimo dog at home with another person while on vacation","<p>I am thinking of purchasing an American Eskimo dog. My family and I travel a lot (especially during the summer), and I'm sure there will be times when we will not be able to take the dog with us.

The new dog has her own bed inside, but spends most of the day outside. The chihuahua pretty much has his own couch to lay on. If we mop the whole floor, he will pee several times, in different places. I woke up to 4 pee spots this AM, after mopping yesterday. It's like he's trying to mark territory.</p>

<p>When the chihuahua pees inside, sometimes we put down paper towels to soak it up before cleaning, and sometimes he will pee again on the paper towels. If we can't get him to use the doggy door, what can we do to get him to at least pee in the same place? Possibly on the ""go here"" pads?</p>

"Male cats attacking female after 1.5 years of relative calmness","<p>Background:</p>

<p>I have had a cat since he was a kitten about 8 years ago, about 4 years ago I adopted another male cat of similar age hoping they would play together and be friends when I started my job. They largely ignored each otter but do sleep near each other and seem to in general just exist in the same space. About 3 years ago I moved from a 2000 sq ft house into a 800 sq ft apartment and then 2 years ago I moved into a 800 sq ft condo. Through all of this my two cats seem to have been fine with me and each other. About a year and a half ago my girlfriend moved into my condo with her much smaller younger female (2 years). Things went OK, mostly the small female stays up on a network of shelves we built for the cats, but she can come down to eat, drink and use the litter. </p>

<p>We have been using Feliway since the small female moved in. </p>

<p>About a month ago things have gotten significantly worse, with my cat's attacking the small female when she tries to go to the litter on her own. We recently went on a trip and when we got there were a large number of fur piles from one of the males and the female and one of the shelves where the female hangs out had both urine and poop on it (it seems like she wasn't able go down to the litter).</p>

"Is it easier on my dog to move in a single day or take 2 weeks to get used to the new place?","<p>I've recently found out that I'll likely be moving in about 4 weeks to a new home in the same neighborhood (8 city blocks from my current building), thanks to ever increasing rents in NYC.</p>

<p>I'd like to make the move as painless as possible for my 1 year old Keeshond. Luckily, we'll be in the same neighborhood, so we'll still go to the same parks and we'll be close enough to walk around the same general area (i.e. it won't be a completely new area that she's never been to).  Aside from moving I don't anticipate anything else changing (same dog walker, same vet, same schedule, etc).</p>

<p>My question is whether I should move fast or slow - I have the option to move in early to the new place and have an overlap of 2 weeks, so I'd be able to move all my things slowly and bring the dog over to the new place to hang out and hopefully get used to it. I've read that I should just send the dog to daycare, move everything into the new place in a single day and then never bring the dog back to the old apartment - in essence a ""clean"" break.</p>

"Did I damage my kitten by accidentally forcefully opening her eyes?","<p>I might have accidentally opened the right eye of a week old kitten. I was holding her head in order to place the feeding bottle in her mouth. She then squirmed (like she always does when trying to find the feeding bottle) and this stretched her face enough for her right eyelid to open. Her exact age should be 8-9 days, and the force applied to her face wasn't really different to how I've been holding her all the time when I feed her (since 1-2 days old); this makes me think that the eyelid was actually ready to open (because they should be sealed really tight when they're not ready yet, right?) and then it just happened when she rubbed against my hand.</p>

Now he bites a lot, even when I'm just petting him and he becomes tired, or when I'm on the sofa with the hand hanging.</p>

<p>If i were to get two rabbits that had already bonded, i.e from the same family, would i need to get them spayed/neutered or will they not fight as they get older? If they are spayed/neutered how would i look after them when they got home (for ex. would i split them up for a few days?)</p>

"Dog vomiting yellow/white foam since being fed vegan food","<p><strong><em>UPDATE:</strong> Must have been something else. Vet gave an oral medicine and everything was back to normal in 2 days. I still feed him vegan food 6 days a week.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>A few days ago, I decided to feed my dog vegetables (&amp; some fruits) more often than animal sources like meat, eggs, milk, etc. (He is a 4-year old golden retriever.)</p>

<p>This is what I fed him for a few days: <strong>[Whole rice, soybeans, red lentils, sweet potatoes, carrots, tomato, beans, cabbage, spinach, coriander]</strong> in the morning and <strong>[1/2 apple, banana, 1/4 pomegranate, 1/4 beetroot, oatmeal (with water)]</strong> in the evening.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzIn4.jpg"" alt=""Vegan dog food"" title=""Vegan dog food""></p>

<p>The 1st day on which I fed him the diet went fine. I checked his stools in the evening as a precautionary measure and It seemed fine, I think I saw some undigested soybeans in there, otherwise it was fine, but he sh*t a ton.</p>

<p>I checked his stools in the morning on the second day, and I could still see more soybeans (which I fed the previous morning). I fed him the same diet on the 2nd day as well and checked his stools in the evening. Same story.</p>

<p>On the 3rd day, early in the morning, he <strong>vomited what looked like yellowish foam</strong>; not a lot, more like 3-4 tablespoons. And from the stools it was clear that he's unable to digest soybeans.</p>

<p>He vomited on the 4th day (early morning like before) as well. Bad stools and vomiting got me worried. So I had the soy and lentils ground and cooked instead of cooking whole. This following evening, his stools are fine and it's no longer a ton. Then he slept as usual and all of a sudden woke up only to <strong>vomit some white foam/liquid</strong> (could be oats, could be bad stuff happening inside, I don't know).</p>

<p>The same happened on the 5th day. Today he vomited (yellow again) while we were out for the morning walk.</p>

<p><strong>What could be causing this?</strong> Could it be because of indigestion (soybeans)?</p>

<p>He's hopping and running around as usual, and I couldn't find indigestion causing yellow foamy vomiting. As of now I've removed soybeans and lentils from his food.</p>

<hr>

<p>.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Like I initially thought, my dog is doing great since removing soy and lentils from his diet. So, it's most probably due to indigestion caused by soybeans. I'll add back lentils soon; so this is what I plan to feed him now (5 days a week):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Morning:</strong> whole rice/ground quinoa, red lentils, sweet potatoes, carrots, green beans, cabbage, spinach, olive/sunflower oil, coriander/turmeric</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evening:</strong> 1/2 apple, banana, 1/4 pomegranate, 1/4 beetroot, oatmeal (with water), honey</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Answers to your questions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Before you ask:</strong> Feeding him veggies and fruits only isn't very healthy. Give him meat; dogs thrive on it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feed him meat, eggs and milk 2 days a week. The rest of the days he gets cooked veggies, and in small amounts, raw fruits, and some grains (whole rice, oats, quinoa)—to provide all the nutrients he needs to have a perfectly healthy body.</p>

<p>As for formulating my dog's diet, we all have our understanding. Just to state what I think——I don't believe that diet is rocket science; except that you should know what you are feeding is nutritious and not harmful in any manner. Then if you vary the diet enough, the dog would be healthy and fine. Meat, poultry, eggs, and milk aren't as nutritious as they once were, and can even be less nutritious or outright harmful in the long-term (due to steroids or bad diet given to source animals, among other reasons). There's no one right way. And I am not arguing. I am sure you all have your opinion.</p>

<p>I'll of course be monitoring my dog's health closely. :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm also concerned about other elements of the diet, raw egg can lead to skin and coat issues as well as running a salmonella risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I should have been more clear earlier. None of the ingredients in my dog's diet, except fruits, are served uncooked. Hopefully explained well in the question now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...] Nevertheless, I'm not convinced that this diet is healthy.</p>
  
  <p>[...] What's the source of this diet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've made a list of the most essential nutrients for dogs, and their sources. Then I made sure that all bases are covered in the diet I feed my dog. The 'diet' on the whole is healthy. If you have more questions, as to whether a dog can be fed mostly-vegan diet at all, you may want to google 'vegan food for dogs'. There IS some credible information.</p>

<p><strong>READ: <a href=""http://aahan.me/homemade-dog-food-essentials/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Homemade dog food: Essential nutrients &amp; their sources</a></strong></p>

<p>Also, I have cross-checked the ingredients of some of the top pet-food brands.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you give the dog the core of the apple to eat? Apple pips contain cyanide, not dangerous in small doeses but if he's having them regularly...</p>

"Dog won't eat or drink or come to me on his own? How do I regain his trust?","<p>Yesterday night I was foolish and kept trying to coax my dog to drink water because he hadn't drunk any water for hours even after his walk. I got frustrated and picked him up to put him in the room he stays in (he got excited at first because he thought I was going to put him on my bed but started whimpering on the way to his room). I didn't yell at him, hit him, or put him down violently on his bed, but it was probably the irritated manner in which I carried him there.. After I took him out this morning (7AM) he was whimpering when I petted him and then he walked away and sat a distance from me and continued to whimper. He also would not eat his food, so I had to hand feed him. Afterwards, I went back to bed and allowed him to sleep with me this time and he was fine but when I picked him up to put him on the floor when I woke again (the bed is high) he was shrieking and yelping although I was definitely not hurting him and I'm sure he has no injuries as he was perfectly fine before I acted so terribly. He has always been a timid dog ever since I've had him because he was abused at his previous home.
He usually eats again at about 5PM but now he won't even eat from my hand, let alone his bowl. He puts it in his mouth and spits it back out and has not drunk any water so far today. I left the room where he usually stays but now he also has not moved from his bed whereas this morning he still followed me to my room even if he did not sit by me...</p>

<p>I apologize for rambling I just wanted to give some background. I have never EVER hit him, I have never hurt him (until now I guess) I love this dog more than anything in this world, more than myself.</p>

<p>Also, if I tell him to come to me he will come but whimpers when I pet him and then leaves to sit a distance from me again. I feel terrible even though I did not physically harm him. I just want him to eat and return to his former happy self, even his trot seems so slow and depressed now and I know I'm to blame. I know I should not have acted this way knowing how sensitive he is.. </p>

<p>My main question is how do I make him eat and drink again? And how do I let him know that I'm sorry for acting how I did and that I would never hurt him? Please help me.</p>

"New roommate's dog tried to bite me. How do I establish that I now belong there?","<p>I'm currently in the process of moving into a new apartment. My roommate is a stranger who I met on Craigslist, and she has been living in the apartment for the past two years. She has a 6 year old Jack Russell mix. </p>

<p>The first time I came to the apartment to take a look, my roommate-to-be was already outside walking the dog when she greeted me at the parking lot. The dog seemed totally fine. </p>

<p>Today was a different story. I came to the apartment to unload a few boxes. When I walked in, the dog ran up and barked at me like crazy. I basically ignored him, and as my roommate and I started talking, he calmed down a little bit. I noticed him apprehensively giving me the side eye once in awhile. After chitchatting, I went back outside to grab more things. After about 20 minutes, I walked through the door again. The dog runs up and barks again. This time, as I'm carrying a box into my room, he bites my calf. I was wearing stretchy gym pants and mid-walk when he did this, so he got a better grip of my pants than my actual leg (Thank God). I am not sure if he was actually going to bite down. My roommate yelled, ""NO! Go back to mommy's room."" As she apologized, she said that he's normally not like this when she's not home and mentioned that he's a rescue, so his past could potentially be contributing to his behavior. </p>

<p>Several years ago, I lived with another roommate (also a stranger from Craigslist) who also had a dog. This dog would also bark whenever I came home, but ONLY if my roommate was already home. If she wasn't home, the dog would pay me no attention to coming in. During this time, I spent the majority of my time at my boyfriend's house, so it makes sense that this dog never got ""used to me."" I get the sense that my new roommate's dog will also be like this, based on what the roommate said today. </p>

<p>These dogs are obviously territorial and are trying to protect their owners. 
I officially move in in two days, and this incident is sort of making me worried. The last thing I want is to live in an environment where I'll be stressed out about coming home because of my roommate's pet. </p>

<p>How do I establish to the dog that I belong there? Will he eventually calm down after he gets used to my presence? My friend, who fosters dogs regularly, said to do so by taking him on long walks a few times, never reward him or acknowledge him when he's behaving that way but instead push him away from me and ignore him. And when he does behave, reward him with a treat. Any other ideas?</p>

We thought it would sort itself out. By late February, we started being concerned. These episodes got worse,instead of stumbling, she would fall. When she seized, her right side paws would be yanked tightly against her torso. At this point, there was no affect on her left side. She would fall, two seconds later, she gets up without acknowledging anything happened. In early March, we took her to the vet. He didn't witness any episodes, said it wasn't seizures, and that she was very healthy. By late April, the intensity of the episodes plateaued. They only last 3 or 4 seconds. Her right legs are pulled against her torso, her left legs forcibly extended straight down, and her face clenches. Unfortunately the frequency has increased from 5 per week (Feb) to 1 per hour now (May). I know cats are tough and don't show pain, so I'm not sure how much these episodes hurt. What is really bad is the falling. She falls off of stuff all the time (less than 4 ft high) and hits the ground like a rock because she is in an episode. She has a scab above her eye from one of these falls. Right now we don't have stairs, but we are moving soon to a house with 2 flights. <strong>What can I do to fix/alleviate this?</strong> If I can't fix it, what would be a sign that I should put her to sleep?</p>

<h1>Problem Description</h1>

<p>My cat, Polar, goes through episodes where her muscles seize, however they are not seizures. Here is what I can discern about them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong>: When she wakes up, when she gets up to fast, when she is startled, when she goes from walking to running, when she jumps onto something</li>
<li><strong>Duration</strong>: 3-4 seconds of where the muscles are taut, then 1-2 seconds before she gets up and moves on</li>
<li><strong>Characteristics</strong>: She is consistently contorted in the same way, she does not try to avoid the triggers, she is not defensive afterwards, </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>Here are some details about Polar and her life that may or may not be relevant:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Videos</strong> of two episodes are <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35YhwcdeW8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdGHZbIp088"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></li>
<li><strong>Age</strong> is at least 9 years. We found her under a shed in the middle of a snow storm 9 years ago, she looked like an older kitten.</li>
<li><strong>Desexed</strong>, front paws are <strong>Declawed</strong>, lives strictly <strong>Indoors</strong> and for the past 3 years she has been our only cat (she hates other cats)</li>
<li><strong>Diet</strong> is heathly dry cat food (we switch to a different brand in March to see if that helped) and filtered water</li>
<li><strong>Medical History</strong> is minimal she is probably not up-to-date with shots or anything like that. We've never had any problems with her besides last summer (2015). She would get a scab on her chest from scratching or something and would proceed to go full-on OCD grooming herself trying to get her fur smooth, which would enlarged the wound. She did this several (more than 10 less than 20) times. She also caught a bat in our house (Fall 2014) once. Also the knobs on the back of her ankles on her rear legs are bald because she chews that them regularly.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What I've tried</strong>
Here is everything we've tried so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vet</strong>: Took her to the vet. She is healthy and not having seizures.</li>
<li><strong>Diet Change</strong>: We changed food brands to see if it would fix it, no discernible effect</li>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: We've tried researching what the problem could be, could not find anything. Every search with muscles/seizing turns up seizures. I'm at the end of my rope on what to look into.</li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong>: We've talked to long-time cat owners, vets/vet assistants that we know and they didn't have any ideas.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We are concerned that when we move next week to a house with stairs, that she could seriously injure herself (we can't block off the stairs from her). Another worry is that this condition could escalate to a point where she would have to be put down for her own good. Any ideas on how to fix/alleviate these episodes? How do I discern when to we should put her to sleep?</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>On January 24th 2017, we put Polar to sleep. Within a year of first showing symptoms, she would have episodes as frequently as 10/hour and started having them while sleeping. </p>

"Does the cat know it's a game?","<p>My cat particularly likes it when I bring out the cat-teaser (essentially a fake 'bird' on a stick). He makes a great deal of effort in catching it, and I assume he's enjoying himself.</p>

<p>Now my question is, what's going through the cat's mind? Does he know it's a game/practice for hunting, and is enjoying himself, or does he actually think he's hunting something he can't really eat - and therefore a disappointing waste of time?</p>

<p>I sometimes consider whether I should feed him a treat or something after playing with him to give him the whole experience of the hunt - if it's the latter case.</p>

"Are loud sounds/music more dangerous for a dog's hearing than a humans?","<p>I have a pretty good stereo system at the house, and I like to listen to my music and movies at a loud volume, but one not particularly dangerous for humans: typically 80-90dB, possibly with peaks around 95-105dB for gunshots/explosions in movies. I'm well versed in OSHA's hearing duration recommendations, and as someone suffering from some high-frequency hearing loss due to loud concerts 20 years ago, I make very sure not to do further damage to myself.</p>

<p><em>OSHA guidelines for max listening time without causing damage:</em>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bpd2R.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bpd2R.png"" alt=""OSHA volume duration""></a></p>

<p>I have a dog who loves to lay near my feet while I'm listening to music, or watching movies. My wife is concerned that ""the music is too loud for the dog!"" and constantly asking me to turn it down.</p>

<p>Obviously dogs have more sensitive hearing than humans, but from my understanding of how sound and hearing works, all that means is that they've got a greater High Freq. range and can hear softer sounds than humans can. It doesn't seem to mean that sounds feel/are twice as loud for dogs than humans. Unfortunately trying to find information about this online seems to conclude that this is the general consensus... but of course no one has any proof, just repeating the rote ""dogs hearing is more sensitive"" line with no explanation of why that would be bad. To me that's argument makes as much sense as saying that dogs/cats have more sensitive eyesight so we ought to dim the lights so we don't hurt their eyes... which obviously isn't the case.</p>

<p>My dog doesn't seem to mind and happily goes to sleep right beside me during a movie at loud volume, while still going crazy when he hears a neighbor talking in their yard across the street (i.e. his hearing is fine). I'm of the opinion that if it was actually causing damage to him, he'd move to a different room.</p>

<p>Have there been any actual studies on this? Is loud music more dangerous for a dog than a human? Could the fatigue contribute to future deafness in my dog? Should I turn the volume down or is everything fine?</p>

Maybe there was another reason as well. The female was impregnated by him and still hasn't given birth more than a month later. She looks pregnant, but not ready yet. She also attacks the other female guppy and chases her away from food. They are in a well-planted 5 gallon take. I recently put the female in a separate tank so that there is less stress.

"When is coronavirus leading to FIP contagious?","<p>I adopted two middle-aged (or older?) cats from the same shelter 3.5 years ago.  Both were healthy until recently when one developed FIP.  Since I adopted them they have had no contact with other cats, aside from whatever happens behind the scenes at the vet's office.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.vet.cornell.edu/fhc/Health_Information/brochure_ftp.cfm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article from the Cornell Veterinary School</a>, a cat can be exposed to the virus (with no symptoms) and develop FIP years later.  So it sounds like it's possible that my cat came to me already infected and the disease only manifested now.  (It's also possible that the other cat is a carrier who transmitted it to him without getting sick himself.)</p>

<p>When is a cat with future-FIP infectious?  Only during an initial exposure to coronavirus (when my cat caught this), or from that time onward?  Only after developing FIP?  If a cat has been exposed to coronavirus in the past but has never shown symptoms of FIP, can he transmit that coronavirus to other cats?</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out the effect of this on my remaining cat, and whether I can safely adopt another cat to join him.  There is no reliable test for FIP other than biopsies, so at best testing can tell us if he's been exposed to coronavirus (the test looks for the antibodies). But my biggest concern is whether he could be <em>infectious</em>.  (If he's also <em>infected</em> then, sadly, there's nothing we can do about that.  We can only test for coronavirus and coronavirus doesn't always lead to FIP from what I've read.)</p>

"How to treat grass to prevent brown spots","<p>We have 3 small dogs and live in a rental home.  We recently built a dog run on the side of our house, to keep the dogs safe when they go out to pee at night and in the morning.  We have coyotes in the neighborhood and several neighborhood pets have become victims.  Unfortunately, this means that all their pee is being concentrated in a relatively small area (about 10x6 feet).  The grass is all dying due to the concentrated urine.</p>

<p>What's the best method to keep the grass alive?  Is there anything i can put on the grass that's not harmful to the dogs that will prevent it from dying?  The grass gets a bit of water from the sprinkler system but it doesn't seem to be enough.  Unfortunately, the area where the dog run is located is very far from the nearest hose.  If more water to dilute the urine is really the only method then I suppose I can invest in a long hose.</p>

"Integrating a Kitten - Miaoing back","<p>We've recently gotten a (10 week old) kitten and we're trying to integrate her into the household. There is already an adult cat in the house, but we haven't arrived at the point of introducing them yet - we're just trying to get the kitten to get used to her new environment.</p>

<p>She's currently locked in her own room, with food, water, toys, litter, and a ton of hiding spaces.</p>

<p>On the first day she didn't even move from her hiding place - not even if we were in the room. She didn't eat or drink anything.</p>

<p>Second day, she started moving between hiding places when we weren't in the room, and the food (we've given her 5 different kinds, it looks like a buffet in there) appears to have been touched - so I think she's eating.</p>

<p>It's the mid of the third day, and from time to time she does long and consistent miaoing sprees. At this point we're trying to leave her mostly alone and talking to her only when when we feed her.</p>

<p>Now today, during feeding time she started miaoing from her hiding place. As an experiment we miaoed back and she looked interested. As the miaoing continued back and forth she abandoned her hiding place, took a sniff and lay down on my wife's lap.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what to make of this. Is this good for her - we're making her feel more comfortable? Or are we confusing/taunting her and it'll be worse for her in the long term?</p>

<p>So the question is - should we continue miaoing back or should we just ignore her? Should we be doing anything in response to her miaoing? </p>

"Cockatiel's lack of body feathers under the wings","<p>So, I recently got a 10-month male cockatiel, which is very happy and has very healthy feathers.</p>

<p>My cockatiels are not in a cage. They are free in their own room with lots of food, drinking water, and bathing water.</p>

<p>Anyway. A few days after I purchased the male cockatiel, I noticed something strange when he was preening: he has very little feathers on <strong>his body</strong> under his wings. I didn't check his body feathers when I was in the shop, as he had quite healthy feathers everywhere else.</p>

<p>So, I watched him carefully for over a week, to make sure that he does not pluck his feathers. I also noticed that there are no plucked feathers on the floor; at least nothing beyond what's usually left from preening.</p>

<li>The cats are indoor only</li>
<li>We live at fifth floor and going outside is dangerous but we could give them about 60m² outside (but they could go everywhere on the roofs around, included in other apartments, so they could be trapped or they could fall)</li>
<li>Everyday, we (my wife and I) spend about an hour and half dedicated to the cats</li>

"What was my dog trying to communicate with this part-howl while meeting new people on a walk?","<p>I'm guessing that's a tricky question to answer, so I'm going to provide lots of details.  Thanks for your patience!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>tl/dr</strong>: I was out for a walk with all of my kids.  My dog does well
  with kids (small children in large numbers visit us frequently)
  but less well with grown men.  While walking by a yard full of kids, a
  2 year old came up quickly and gave him a friendly scratch on the neck.  My dog
  didn't seem to mind (or at least didn't react strongly).  The child's
  father came up a moment later and picked up the child.  A few moments
  later my dog gave out two short and low ""howls"" (I'm not sure exactly what
  sound he was making).  I didn't notice anything off in his body
  language during the encounter.  Any guesses what he might have been
  communicating?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>My dog and people</h3>

<p>My dog is effectively my first dog, so I'm not a dog whisperer by any means, and I'm trying to understand him here.  He's an elderly (~10 years old) rescue, weighs about 75 pounds, he seems to mainly be American Bulldog, he's been with us for not quite a year, and he seems to have otherwise spent his whole life chained up in someone's back yard.</p>

<p>Despite that last fact, he is actually fairly well adjusted to people and does very well with small children.  The ""incident"" in question happened on a walk, but he mainly meets new people while at home (he definitely has a ""guard dog"" aspect to his personality) so I figured I'd explain how that usually goes.</p>

<p>We're a larger family (5 kids, aged 0-11) and especially with the recent birth of our youngest, have had lots of people over in recent months, including many families that also have 4 or 5 young children.  He does great with our kids, and has never shown any hints of aggression towards them, even when they accidentally hurt him (which doesn't happen much).  He's always been very friendly with women and children visiting our house, although in the early days he would sometimes let out a low growl when first meeting new people in our home (typically while wagging his tail, sniffing them, and otherwise displaying a curious/excited body language).  I would scold him for the growling, he would stop (or I would put him up if he didn't), and (in my non-expert opinion) he was never considering hurting everyone.  Even during visits which started with a growl, he would be perfectly fine after a few minutes and would play with everyone - happily accepting pets and scratches from the new people just like our kids.</p>

<p>Over the past few months especially we have had even more people over (mainly because of people coming over to help with the baby), and during this time he's stopped growling at new people all together.  The only time we have problems is with guys, which doesn't happen very often.  I had someone come over to do some work on the house and the guy's son came in first (he was probably 18-20).  For a minute our dog was fine like always, but suddenly started barking at him (I think the worker walked by one of our kids and might have made the dog uncomfortable).  I put the dog up until everyone was done so that the workers didn't have to worry.</p>

<h3>Out for a walk</h3>

<p>The other day all the kids, the dog, and I were out for a walk and passed a family playing in their yard.  This happens often in our neighborhood.  Sometimes I cross the street in case I think our dog might make someone nervous (since he's on the larger side), but we're typically ignored by whoever is outside, and our dog is usually more interested in sniffing the grass, so I don't always.</p>

<p>This time there were about 4 kids, mainly playing on the sidewalk.  They went back into their yard as we slowly came up, and I didn't think to cross the street (my kids had run a bit ahead, so mainly I was just following them)  These new kids were in the grass just to the right of the sidewalk, and my dog was on the left side sniffing as he went along.  There was a very young kid (maybe not even quite 2 years old) that I didn't notice, and he ""broke away"" from his family and toddled up to my dog quite quickly.  The father was standing near by and told his son to stop, but of course he kept walking.</p>

<p>Little ones can be surprisingly quick, and a moment later he walked right up to my dog, reached up, and scratched him on the neck.  The father came up a moment later and swooped up his son.  I don't think I would have had time to do anything if I had thought to, although I wouldn't have been worried even if I had time to think about it.  My dog just stood there calmly while the boy scratched him.  The encounter was very quick, but I didn't notice any change in my dog's body language to suggest he was upset.</p>

<p>The father looked mildly panicked so I stopped for a moment to let him know that our dog is very used to little children, and that his youngest son was never in any danger.  While I was talking my dog let out a low ""howl"" sound.  I'm not actually sure how to describe it.  It definitely wasn't a bark or a growl.  He did it twice.  Sort of a deep ""how how"" sound while tilting his head up a bit.  A moment later we continued our walk.</p>

<p>I have never heard him do this before, so I'm not sure what he was trying to say.  I'm guessing it was an expression of mild dislike about something in the encounter, whether it was the crowd of kids, being scratched without warning, or the father coming near him suddenly.  I figure it's hard to say for sure, but I'd like to have a good guess so I know how to act in such situations in the future (aka just cross the street and avoid them).  Any thoughts as to what my dog might have been saying?</p>

"Cat siblings suddenly fallen out with each other","<p>We have a couple of two year old male neutered cats, Ed and George, who have lived with us since they were kittens. Until yesterday, they were on exceptionally good terms, and would play, groom, and sleep together, and generally do things as a pair.</p>

<p>They are house cats, but we do give them a couple of hours of supervised time in the garden each day. It was during one of these outdoor sessions yesterday that the problems started: Ed suddenly became aggressive, and decided to chase George into the house out of our sight. From this point on, George has barely appeared from under the bed, and whenever Ed approaches, he hisses and growls. On the other hand, shortly after the initial attack, Ed returned to his normal self, and appears to be unfazed by George. He keeps attempting to make contact with his brother under the bed, but is constantly rejected.</p>

<p>To assign human emotions to them, it looks like George is now scared, and Ed is confused about his brother's behaviour. However, I know that this might not be a true reading of their 'thought processes'.</p>

<p>This situation has now been ongoing for around 24 hours.</p>

<p>A theory we have as to why Ed initially became aggressive is that it was a case of mistaken identity: there are other cats on the street, and we wonder if he detected the smell or sound of another cat nearby, but then mistook his brother for a rival. We think this has happened once before, but without lasting consequences. However, it is a guess on this occasion as we never saw any other cats during the incident.</p>

<p>Why would two otherwise loving cats suddenly turn on each other? Is it possible that George is now too scared of Ed to be around him? Or is it more likely that Ed is trying to obtain a dominant position? And how can we return back to the status quo in this sort of situation?</p>

"How should I handle a dog when I catch it chewing a shoe?","<p>When I hear my dog(s) chewing something in another room, I sometimes go to take a look at what it is they are working on.

<p>The answers to remedy <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/2307/278"">this sock-stealing dog</a> explain how the dog may perceive a response as a reward/attention, especially if you start chasing after the sock.

<p>My cat is 22m and has been drooling for the last couple weeks.  His vet has prescribed antibiotics and pain reliever, but the drooling has not stopped.  I try to clean his face using soft tissues whenever I see him drool, but I realize that his skin may be very irritated and painful from the drooling.  I'm looking for any kind of relief for my baby.</p>

<p>Because his appetite has slowed, I have been supplementing feeding him via a syringe.  While this seems to eliminate some of the drooling, he has also been making a swallowing action (kind of the way I feel when my allergies and post nasal drip run amok).  Feeding him via a syringe seems to make this worse.  </p>

<p>I have started cleaning his face daily with water, and then dabbing a bit of antiseptic / anesthetic wash to help kill any germs and numb the pain.  I have a followup with his vet for Saturday, but in the meantime, what is the best way to clean drool from my cat's chin and face, and how frequently?</p>

"Is it healthy for newborn puppies to live on direct land?","<p>My dog Jamie (no breed) had 4 puppies on July 8th. They haven't opened their eyes as of yet.</p>

<p>Prior to this,
Jamie dug a hole in the ground in the yard and there she gave birth to her puppies.</p>

<p>While it's true that in the hole they are 'safe' so that my other dog (boxer of 5 years) can not hurt them, I think it is not healthy for the puppies that live there. </p>

<p>Today I took one of them out of the hole and I realized that the puppy had 3 pebbles in its mouth, and I took them out. The puppies are directly in contact with the land and hence they practically breathe nothing but dirt, I mean they get no fresh air.</p>

<p>My question is: Is it healthy that puppies live there? Could puppies get an allergy because of being in the dirt constantly?</p>

<p>Should I leave them in the hole?</p>

"Male cat harassing his sister, causing her to hiss","<p>We adopted two cats together, a brother and a sister, about a year and a half ago from a rescue organization. They are both spayed / neutered and are probably about 1 year 8 months old. The sister is ~ 2lbs lighter than her brother</p>

<p>About six months ago we noticed that when they would play the female cat would begin hissing, yowling, and taking swipes at him. Sometimes this happens because the male cat is harassing her - chasing her around, biting at her heels a bit when she runs away until we separate them.  But it also happens when she instigates and it seems like they're playing normally.</p>

<p>There's never any 'puffing up' or back arching, but she's clearly upset and claws at him to get him to back off.</p>

<p>Recently we came home after about four days away (we had a cat sitter visit daily for a couple hours, but they obviously weren't getting as much attention as when we're home full time) and found that the male cat had a small scratch by his ear, so it seems like it has escalated. </p>

<p>Does anyone know why she's getting so upset? Is hissing normal during play?</p>

<p>Also, is our stopping the male cat from chasing his sister inadvertently encouraging him to continue doing it, since he gets attention for it? If so, how can we make sure she feels safe without giving him attention? </p>

<p>I've had mice before and know that they can bite strong enough to draw blood.

"I don't understand crate training. What am I missing?","<p>Kennel training is driving me crazy. I have read article after article on the subject and I have a few unanswered questions. For example, I see a LOT of people saying that you need to take your puppy outside after playing, eating, napping, ect... so when exactly are they NOT outside?</p>

<p>It seems like everyone's answers are to have your puppy outside to pee 24/7 so that is really confusing to me. Also, my 8 week old puppy (who I have been trying to kennel train for a little over a week) does go to the bathroom in her kennel. She pees in it. By the way she is a chiweenie pup... very clingy and in my face.</p>

<p>At first I put her in the kennel with a blanket over it and she cried a lot but eventually fell asleep. So when she woke up whining I figured I should take her to potty since she had just been sleeping and that's a suggestion for when to take them out, right? It seemed ok, but she was also peeing in her kennel even though she would go outside too.</p>

<p>Now she seems to have learned that if she cries I'll take her outside and she cries every hour. How am I supposed to know when to take her out and when she is just trying to get out of her kennel?</p>

<p>Next thing I'm really frustrated about is that I HAVE to be outside with her. She wont eat or drink or use the bathroom or play if I'm not out there with her. When will she (if ever) feel comfortable enough with being outside alone to do these things? Even when I sit outside with her while she runs around, mostly she just wants to sit on my lap instead of doing her business. She is SOOO clingy.</p>

<p>Is there some particular training I should do with her? Change some things that will make it easier further down the line?</p>

<p>I'm conscious that dogs have different personalities, and I don't want to force her to be around other dogs if she doesn't like it, but at the same time, I don't want her pulling me or my girlfriend towards other dogs when we're walking her, or worse yet, launch herself at other dogs when she's off lead in the park playing with the ball.</p>

<p>I should note that she's never bitten anything or anyone, though she does look like she's trying when she gets aggressive towards other dogs.</p>

<p>I would really, really appreciate any guidance you may be able to give me in this matter.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"Are there sure signs I can see my cat might have arthritis?","<p>So I've been having some <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/17918/my-cat-is-peeing-around-the-litter-box"">issues</a> with my 16 years old cat peeing on the floor around her litter and it has been suggested that she might be having arthritis problems. Hence my question, </p>

<p>Are there sure signs I can see she might have arthritis?
Also, is arthritis something that would normally come up in a full check-up exam at the vet?</p>

"Is it okay to let my dog run when she's scared?","<p>When I take my dog on walks, sometimes there will be loud noises that scare her (e.g. thunder, construction, large vehicles driving by). When this happens her flight response kicks in and she wants to take off running. She's securely on leash and won't get away, but I often will just start running with her. I usually try to jog with her anyway, and it's more often that I'm going too fast for her than the opposite, so I don't mind running for a little while when she gets scared like this.</p>

<p>She also likes to run, more often when she's off-leash at the dog park or the beach, so it's not something she only does when she's scared. I partially hope that by running with her when she's scared she might forget she's scared and just be happy running.</p>

<p>I'm wondering, <strong>is it okay to let her run when she's scared? Would it be better to not move and try to calm her down?</strong> On the one hand, I think it might be good to let her get out that energy to help calm her down some. On the other hand, I could see the argument that it encourages the fear response and might make her more likely to run away at loud noises in the future. I'm not worried about owner/pet dominance and her being in control of the pace - we only go as fast as I want, and I don't always let her run when she wants.</p>

"Why are my old cat's pupils always dilated?","<p>My cat is probably around 25 years old.  She still has decent vision, hearing, jumps up onto my chair, no apparent arthritis or any other health issues. The vet said she's fine.  The only odd thing is here eyes are always dilated.  My apartment tends to be dark, but even if I take her outside during the day, her pupils do not make the familiar cat-slit shapes but stay wide open round.  She still seems to see well enough to not bump into walls or plants, but I imagine her view of the world is like an overexposed photograph.  She'e mostly indoors anyway.  </p>

<p>The vet said this sometimes happens for older cats. I am curious to know more.</p>

"Snapping fingers in place of a clicker","<p>I don't own any pet but I was considering getting a dog pretty soon. (A Basset Hound to be exact, gosh these guys are cute.)</p>

<p>I'd like to teach my future companion a lot of things, from the basic ""Come here"" to the more advanced ""Roll over"".</p>

<p>Clicker training seemed promising as a way to teach those activities but having to carry a tool each time I want to play with him or teach him things seems unnecessarily troublesome.</p>

<p>As I've understood it, the main idea of clicker training is to have a distinct sound be played as a way to say ""Good"" to your dog. If that is the case, <strong>couldn't we replace the ""clicker"" by a good old fingersnap ?</strong> </p>

"Accidentally scared dog last night and he has been aggressive/scared of me since","<p>So my girlfriend and I adopted a rescue dog like 4-5 months ago, we don't know the breed for sure, but we think he is a Treeing Walker Coonhound based on his looks, and the vet thinks he's like 5-7 years old...she said he looked like he had a rough go at it as he was malnourished, a bit mangy, and has a couple small scars/bald spots, but he has been sweet as can be since we've had him.  We play together a lot, rough house, I made weird sounds at him, and he always loves it.  Last night, we were playing and I was scratching his belly, and then I did a little raspberry type thing (like when you vibrate your lips on a baby's stomach or something like that, I hadn't heard that term before my girlfriend said it), but didn't blow hard or anything, just made a weird sound and vibrated my lips.  He aggressively snapped at me when I did that, and I backed away.  When I re-approached, he started growling very aggressively.  The hair on his back was standing straight-up, and he was just petrified of me after that - hair was straight up and he was shaking for hours.  He is fine with my girlfriend, but so uncomfortable with me.  He has taken treats out of my hand, but goes back to being very aggressive and growling after that just towards me.  My girlfriend and I walked him this morning, and if I was ahead of him, he wouldn't follow me.</p>

<p>I've been trying to act normal today, and to kind of ignore him - not in a mean way, just a ""going about my day"" type of thing, and not petting him or getting super close.  He still is just eyeing me with this piercing suspicion.  Anyone have any suggestions/thoughts?  He has always slept in our bed, and did so last night, but stayed on my girlfriend's side, and I had a pillow between me and him so I wouldn't accidentally jostle him with my foot or anything.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?  Was considering going to a behavior specialist or something like that?  But I'd be curious if anyone has some thoughts or has gone through a similar experience with a dog.  Will he hate me forever?  He does seem a bit better today - i.e., hair isn't standing up and I'm in the same room as him without getting growls, but he still does NOT enjoy my presence.</p>

"Are commercial cat foods addictive?","<p>I have been feeding my cat (3 years old neutered male British shorthair) with dry and occasionally wet (but I prefer mostly dry food according to the vet's advice to keep his teeth healthy) food from one of the most expensive cat food brand since he was 2 months old.</p>

<p>I feel that to eat the same food all the time might not be healthy and try to give him some fresh cooked meal. What surprises me is that he shows almost no interest in trying fresh cooked food, chicken, beef or fish which a normal stray cat would love to have. He just smells the food I offer him and look at my face like “Are you kidding me? Do you really think that I eat this crap?”. I have also tried cooking meat without any salt and spices but still didn’t work with him. </p>

<p>According to some <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Is-there-an-additive-in-commercial-cat-food-that-cats-find-addictive/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""websites"">websites</a>, fabricated foods “are sprayed with proprietary mixtures of palatability enhancers”. I have no problem with that as long as they are not unhealthy. However, I really wonder if commercial foods have all the nutrition and vitamins my cat needs. </p>

<p>Now the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I change my cat's eating habit that he eats also fresh cooked meats? According to some cat owners, cat will eat anything if you don’t feed him a day (or two) long but I can’t do that.</li>
<li>Or is it completely ok if cat eats fabricated food all the time?</li>

Anyways he dropped it and it was a newborn baby bunny. I put on gloves and put it in an open plastic container, putting the fluff surrounding the nest in it, and what do i find? 7 more newborn bunnies. when I say newborn I mean they were born at the very least on Friday or Saturday, if not yesterday. The nest was in my yard, which is fenced, and with my dog being an avid hunter I decided I would dig them another little nest nearby. Just as I was picking up the container, the mom was a few feet away and darted under the fence. I dug them a little burrow on the other side of my fence so my mean dog wouldn't kill them. I would say a few yards away. The entire time the mom was watching me, I put them in the nest, I checked on them this morning and they were all still in there and burrowed together (so adorable) but I was wandering a few things.</p>

"My rabbit just died but she leaves behind a bonded sister of 7 years. How can I help her cope?","<p>My rabbit just died but she leaves behind a bonded sister of 7 years. The rabbit who died has always been interested and friendly with us but her sister has always been very tentative and shy with people.

"How long before my redeared slider she lays eggs? Should I force her onto land?","<p>I have 4 adult redeared sliders, two male and two female.  One of my females is definately carrying eggs.  </p>

<p>They are in a wonderful outdoor habitat. We did all the research before we built it two years ago.  The reason we moved them from the tank they were in that was inside the house is because the female layed eggs in the water and they had gotten to big.  </p>

"Is it safe to leave a Sheltie puppy with access to a doggy door?","<p>I have to go to work during the day and I'm struggling to find a system that works well for making my Sheltie comfortable when I'm gone. I leave her in the house with plenty of food and water, check on her during my lunch break if I can, etc, but potty training is <strong>NOT</strong> going well. </p>

<p>So, what I'd like to do is install a doggy door this weekend. That way she'd have a lot more space to play in and it would make it infinitely easier to potty train her. Asides from the fact that I find training pads to be gross, she doesn't get what they're for anyway, despite my many attempts to follow tutorials on training her.</p>

<p>She likes to go outside (""go"" in both senses of the word). So that's great.</p>

<p>But there's 1 problem. While my yard <strong>is</strong> fully fenced, at 3 months she's still skinny enough to squeeze between the gaps in my fence when she wants to. This is kind of what the fence looks like (more or less):</p>

But if you wash them down the drain they are gone forever. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are multiple online reports of ""drowning fleas"" and killing them with soapy water.  After looking for the science there does not seem to be much support for these fatal claims. There is little doubt that giving your pet a soapy bath in the tub will help remove the fleas, they may even appear dead.  But in all likelihood these fleas are just waiting to dry out and be revived, hopefully in the city sewer.  If you bath your pet in the yard, and than let the dry pet in the yard again the next day the clean pet and clean revived fleas will likely reunite. Soapy water is more likely to facilitate removal of the comatose flea from the pet and carry it down the drain. So it is reasonable to have noticeable decrease in the flea population after a bath.  But <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/196/"">excessive bathing has it's own risks</a> and given the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea#Life_cycle_and_habitat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">life cycle of a flea</a> soapy baths alone are unlikely to be a final solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe some insects, like spiders if flushed or washed down the drain will often climb back up into the home.  </p>

<ul>
<li>A reliability rate of about 80%... I don't want more than this because I think it makes the rules to stiff and doesn't encourage a guessing/edgy dog. I don't want less than that because when we are in the exciting trial environment I want them to hold up.</li>
<li>Smooth stride up the up side. I don't want them to hit the A-frame hard on the way up because I think that causes to much stress on their shoulders, front legs, and feet over time and certainly doesn't help the speed of the rest of the a-frame.</li>
<li>Speed over the top</li>
<li>Striding nicely on the down side. I don't want a stutter step because it eats up time and also seems hard on their shoulders over time</li>
<li>Striding deep into the down-side yellow. I don't want a jump to the bottom because if they miss the bottom and the yellow altogether it is a fault. And jumping from that height can be hard on their front end over time.</li>
<li>A stop at the bottom with both front feet pretty far into the dirt and both back feet on the obstacle. I want the front feet far into the dirt on average so that the range in the performance doesn't ever include the dog stopped with either front foot still on the obstacle.

<li>An instant release on cue.</li>

<ul>
<li>having a specific foot forward so that the weight shift on take off is most efficient but I'm not that technical yet. :-)</li>
<li>having the dog sit at the bottom instead of standing. I think they do this so that they are loaded to ""spring"" off... or maybe it is just to help encourage the weight on the back end to reduce wear on the shoulders?</li>

<p>However, until a few days ago, all behavior changes were traditional territorial cues.</p>

<p>Two days ago, my female rabbit (who seems bonded to me slightly more than her bond mate) started acting very quirky.  Rather than hanging and following me around, she seemed to actively try to avoid me aside from a few  minutes per day.  At one point I came into the room she was in, sat down, and said her name, which caused her to get up from her flopped out position and move to the room on the opposite side of the house!  ... I just figured she was feeling poorly.</p>

<p>However, when she started chasing her bond mate, I decided to hold her for a bit to distract her, and she immediately started purring (not out of the question, but usually I have to have her in my arms for at least 20 seconds). She's currently moulting, so I also began to pluck her.  After about 5 minutes I hit a sore spot and she started to strugle like she would like to be put back down. However, once I got a better grip on her she'd continue to purr, even while I only plucked instead of petting.</p>

<p>She also seemed to be actively looking for mischief: chewing on things she normally has no interest in; taking large chunks of paint off the book shelf and trying to eat them; eating the strips off the sides of my shoes; etc.  I gave her a Timothy cube and the destructive behavior stopped.  However as I'm writing this she's trying to climb out of the condo into the storage area next to it, and this reminds me that she's been climbing the furniture all day (waiting for me on the arm of the couch closest to the door while I was out).</p>

<p>About a week ago she started becoming more aggressive about making it to the right food bowl first (we have 3 scattered throughout the house to keep them guessing), and somehow is able to get to the top of a 4 floor condo that I built for them faster than I can dispense them (making it very difficult to place kibble in the bowl).  However, as of 32 hrs ago, both rabbits have been extremely kibble focused, and the female is now standing on top of the food bowl and prairie dogging over the top of the condo.  Even stranger, and what spurred me to post was that <strong>10 minutes ago she tried to leap over the top floor barrier at the small cup of kibble I was carrying.</strong>   Fortunately, she got her back legs hooked in the barrier and fell back to the top floor.</p>

"If you want both a stopped and a running contact how do you train it?","<p>If you want both a <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/a/2454/884"">stopped and a running contact</a> how do you train it? I have trained a stopped contact before and I have a dog who is small and training a running contact was not an issue because she doesn't jump over the yellow. But what if you want the choice to use both with the same dog? Also, what if I want a running A-frame but always a stopped dog-walk? Any special issues I'd run into there?</p>

"Can an 11 year old dog be castrated?","<p>Five and a half months ago I took home from a dog refuge a cross-bred Britanny Spaniel to be company for our Border Collie (who at the time was 7 months old). So today the Border is one year old and the Britanny (Jake) is eleven.</p>

<p>Generally, they get on well, and if the young border wants to play too much (he loves chewing the other's ear) the older dog bears his teeth and snarls, and will even chase the younger around the garden to get him stop.</p>

<p>At the beginning, Jake was very quiet and calm, but has opened up and now dashes to me when I get home from work, and will follow me around the garden and all around the house - my wife says that he now lives only for me! Just recently though, he has started to dry hump the Border, and now follows him about like a love-sick suitor! What is strange is that the Border was castrated five months ago.</p>

<p>I know that dry humping can be a sign of  dominance, but between the two it has always been the Border who is dominant - for example, if the Border has finished eating and Jake hasn't, the Border just pushes him away and finishes the bowl (in practise either I am there to stop this or one eats outside and the other inside).</p>

<p>So, finally, my question is <strong>should I have him castrated or is he too old? What alternative solutions are there?</strong> At the moment, when he does it we say ""No"" and he usually stops, otherwise we push him away and repeat ""No"" until he stops (usually for about 10 minutes max!).</p>

"Training a dog walking handstands","<p>There are many cool tricks but I really like the walking handstand, so I started investigating how to efficiently train this to my dog.</p>

<p>A watched this clicker-training video (Youtube, ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Lb9b9sGw0"" rel=""nofollow"">Train your dog the walking handstand!</a>""). It mentions progressing slowly: the dog puts his hind paws on something progressively higher (e.g. one or more books). That makes sense to me and the dog needs time to get his balance right and to have enough strength on the muscles he need.</p>

<p>So my idea was to start as early as possible (my puppy is 5 months old), that would be a fun exercise for him.</p>

<p>However the video advices <em>not to train that to puppies or before the dog is well over a year old</em>.</p>

<p>Is this a good advice and could this be detrimental to the growth of the dog ?</p>

"Dog with Congestive Heart Failure - Rapid Heart Beat","<p>My dog was diagnosed with congestive heart failure roughly 8 months ago. Though her breathing has been the thing we have noticed and discussed primarily with the vets, that seems to be under control with her current medication.  Her heart rate, however, has become concerning.  Her heart rate is rapid even when resting, and very pronounced when you feel her chest. It also seems quite irregular, I tried to measure her beats per minute but I couldn't tell, and my wife and I had wildly different estimates. </p>

<p>Is this normal with congestive heart failure?  My main concern is that she not suffer. Could she be suffering with a rapid, seemingly irregular heart beat?  </p>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>She is slowing down significantly on walks (likely compounded by summer heat). She's overall less active.</li>
<li>She is becoming a more finicky eater, though still eating as we are putting things like chicken / fish in her dinner now.</li>
<li>She hasn't lost all her spunk, there are moments where she shows some playfulness, and still some moments where she'll be a guard dog, but it is definitely reduced.</li>
<li>She saw a vet &amp; cardiologist 2 months ago, they told us to come back in 6 months.  While I understand I'll get the best information by bringing her back, it's both expensive and traumatic for her!  So I really do appreciate any advice that can be offered.</li>

"Senior Cat limping on hind leg (putting weight on it) sudden onset 3 days ago - see vet or wait? Possible causes? No signs of abnormality","<p>This question is about a senior-age cat (10-11, not sure of exact age as she was a stray) with no relevant medical history. She had a ""fall from height"" ~3 years ago with fractured (?) roof of mouth but has been fine since receiving treatment then.</p>

<p>She does seem to be thinner these days despite eating enough, but this has been going on for a while.</p>

<p><strong>3 days ago</strong> she was fine when we came home from work. We went out again to do other stuff and when we came back in the evening, noticed that she was limping on the right back leg.</p>

<p>She is putting weight on it (not holding it up off the ground) on every step, it isn't ""floppy"". We have examined the paw, claws, pads etc and found nothing - there isn't anything inflamed, sores, bites, abscesses, lumps or anything like that either. She is still climbing stairs (a bit more awkwardly than usual though) etc.</p>

<p>From what I can tell she isn't in particular pain with it from any of the ""poking"" I tried (paw pads etc), she didn't pull the leg away or anything like that. But it must be painful to put full weight on it since she isn't doing that...</p>

<p>She is eating, toileting, interacting with our other cats normally.</p>

<p>I'm sure it is something physical rather than e.g. acting out ""behaviourally"".</p>

<p>It seems to come and go a bit in that sometimes she is limping more than others so I think it's ""better"" and then later she is limping a bit more etc.</p>

<p>My questions:
- would you advise taking her to the vet at this point or wait a bit longer and see if it resolves?
- what are possible causes of this given that we've ruled out the usual ""injury to paw pads"" etc. ?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> </p>

<p>I waited another day and then made an appointment at the vet for the next day, so about 5 days total since the limping started. During this time it didn't change in any way and her habits (eating, toileting, amount of activity etc) were still normal.</p>

<p>The vet did a physical exam (but no x ray at this point) and didn't find anything so it could be arthritis or just ""pulled something"" etc.</p>

<p>We now have a Metacam anti-inflammatory to give her daily and instructions to go back after this is finished if it still continues (at which point they will probably do x rays etc)</p>

<p>The vet also recommended some blood tests to check for various conditions, which I'm pleased to say have come back normal!</p>

"How to introduce new cats with my only cat?","<p>I live in a 2 bedroom apartment with a roommate. I have a male cat (who I'm about to get fixed soon). He's been the only animal around since I got him, and it's about a year old. He's starting to show signs of, well, mating. I'm on a second floor apartment, and I've never let him outside. Although he was originally found outside as a kitten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I have a girlfriend who's considering moving in with me. She has 2 cats, male and female, both fixed. She plans on bringing these cats with her.</p>

<p>My cat Butters is free to roam anywhere he wants, and his litter box is in the laundry room, and food/water is in the kitchen. And he sleeps in my bedroom. I keep all the doors open for him, except for my roommate's bedroom.</p>

<p>See where I'm getting at?</p>

<p>The only way I see this possible is to keep Butters constrained to my bedroom, move the litter box, food, and water into there, and let the 2 new cats roam the rest of the apartment. Since Butters spends most of his time in my bedroom anyway.</p>

<p>But then what? How should I introduce them without a fight?</p>

<p>Months ago, a friend brought their female cat over to visit. He didn't like her at all, and hissed and groaned and almost started a big fight. He's territorial. </p>

<p>The 2 new cats get along together great, and come from a place with other cats. They're used to the outdoors, too.</p>

<p>So that's 2 domestically-born fixed male/female cats used to other cats and the outdoors, being introduced to my un-fixed cat which was originally born in the wild but then domesticated and kept indoors. </p>

<p>I feel Butters needs these 2 cats to keep him company and to learn from. But I'm afraid he'll become hostile, since he doesn't know how to be around other cats. </p>

<p>How should I approach this? </p>

"3 mo. old dachshund puppy is quiet in crate for an hour, then starts barking","<p>Our 3 mo. old dachshund puppy has gotten pretty good at being in his crate for about an hour to an hour and a half during the day. We've never had any trouble at night. He'll sleep 8+ hours and doesn't whine in the morning, he just waits until we let him out. During the day I've recorded him many times while away to see how he gets on. He'll sometimes whine/bark within the first 5-10 minutes of me putting him in the kennel and leaving, but then he quiets down for at least an hour. Then he'll start whining and barking, and will continue until let out(as long as 40 minutes of barking based on my recordings). I know I've accidentally rewarded it before by thinking he was being quiet when I came home, and then realizing from hearing the recording that he was barking/whining until he heard me coming.  It's frustrating because he's so good for up to an hour and a half. I suspect he sleeps for that first hour to an hour and a half, and then starts barking and whining when he wakes up. What should I do? If I can approach quietly and hear him barking should I wait it out even if he goes on for at least an hour? I don't know yet how long before he'll stop again, or if he even will.</p>

"Active wildlife outside the window- Good or Bad for Cat psychology?","<p>At my current house, there is an active community of wild creatures in the backyard, including a variety of birds, chipmunks and squirrels, rabbits, a groundhog, and butterflies by day and lightning bugs by night.</p>

<p>My little 2yo tortie female DSH has two towers near windows, and two glass sliding doors to look out of and observe this community going about its business in all weather, all seasons, and all times of day.</p>

<p>A clear benefit of this is entertainment, something to see and do that isn't lying on the floor being bored.  There's also an exercise element as she runs from one vantage point to the next to follow a rabbit across the yard, for example.</p>

<p>But a potential down side is the frustration of the solid glass barrier.  I have seen her clearly attempting to get to a bird or a chipmunk by pawing at the edges, trying to climb onto the window border, and things like that.  Her hunting instinct has kicked in, but is being thwarted.</p>

<p>So in the balance, is this situation good or bad for the cat's overall mental and emotional well-being?  In other words, do the benefits outweigh the risks?</p>

<p>As a follow-up, if the conclusion is negative, what can I do about it?  Note that closing curtains is <em>not</em> viable, as that would first of all be bad for <em>my</em> emotional well-being (making my house feel like a dark dungeon) but also, the cat can simply slide behind the curtain.  This cat does have a handful of toys, and does play with them both independently and interactively with me.</p>

"Should I give my pets vitamins or other supplements?","<p>I want my cat to live long and I'm thinking of giving her human vitamins and supplements.  Sadly, all cat foods like Meow Mix and Fancy Feast don't have vitamins added, and considering that <em>in nature processed foods don't exist and animals get a lot of sunlight</em>, I think that most human pets are vitamin deprived unknowing to their owner, even if they appear healthy.</p>

<p>I think I should like give my pets fish oil (like those omega 6 acids that are fat) and vitamins to help them have them live long and healthy lives.</p>

<p>I want to know if its safe to give these vitamins:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Vitamin D</strong> and here's why: guess where Vitamin D is found in nature?  In meat?  Nope... actually it is found <strong>in fish</strong>, and also (you can google it if you don't believe me), sunlight exposure.  People who are indoors are usually deprived of vitamin d.  And what do cats eat in nature: <em>vitamins and sunlight</em>... they don't sit indoors all day long eating vitamin deprived processed meat</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fish oil</strong>, and according to google it is called ""Omega-6 Fatty Acids"", and in the wild cats get lots of fish oil, since wild cats eat fish and that's their favorite food.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vitamin B6</strong>, my cat was smart but I believe that giving her vitamins that are neuroprotective is very good for her and can make her EVEN SMARTER.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>5-htp</strong> my cat isn't aggressive but just so she was less stressed... </p></li>
</ul>

<p>My cat was always healthy but I believe that if i give vitamins and fish oil and drugs like 5-htp it will live to be like 40 years old... because <strong>if a human child only survived on processed meat all their lives starting from being a kid</strong>... do u think they wood die at age 8 or at age 80? i think at age 8. and not to mention that processed cat food is probably much worse then chicken McNuggets since i think they would be investing less in animal safety then into human safety.</p>

<p>Sadly they don't sell vitamins and supplements for pets, so I'm considering products sold for humans.</p>

<p>One of the attacks had the cat chasing me down the street with my dog in my arms (he's a large Staffordshire bull terrier so not the easiest to carry as I am a small built female) and was only resolved when a kind man trapped the cat under a car with a broom so I could escape. He informed me that the cat has attacked many passing dogs.

"Fence aggression - guard dog or poorly trained dog?","<p>I am puzzled by the behavior of certain dogs, each of them living in a yard or a garden across a fence from a somewhat busy road with frequent pedestrian/runner/cycling etc. traffic (for example, a marked hiking trail).  Once a human appears on the road, which is no rare occurrence there, the dog starts running the full length of the fence back and forth or closely following the passer by, constantly barking at the ""intruder"", showing his teeth, often bumping into the fence.  The whole scenario looks like it can hardly be very healthy/enjoyable for the passer by or for the dog.  I wonder what the owner typically thinks; I don't know any of them personally.  If this is meant to be ""watching"", then it feels to me like a house alarm that goes off fifty times a day.</p>

<p>I'm torn about what to think about these situations.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_dog"" rel=""nofollow"">Some resources</a> indicate that this is desired, specifically trained behavior that is employed for protection of the property.  <a href=""http://www.dogforums.com/dog-training-forum/76838-what-fence-fighting-barrier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Other resources</a> discuss barrier aggression as territorial behavior automatic to dogs, and yet others (usually discussing a scenario with another dog, not a human, on the other side of the fence), are discussing it more as a bad habit to be untrained.  Of course it's quite possible that each of such dogs on my map falls into a different category but I can't tell the difference.</p>

<p>My question is: <strong>How much of such dog behavior is under control of its owner/trainer, how much is determined by its breed and the environment?</strong>  Would a carefully trained ""watch dog"" (trained to watch the property, not the road) do more of this, or less of this?</p>

<p>I'm not asking about unrestrained dogs attacking people in public places, and I am also not asking about a normally calm dog in a one off situation caught by surprise.</p>

<p>I am not asking this question about my own pet; I don't have a dog although I'm on first name terms with several dogs.</p>

"How to make dog listen around wild animals","<p>My Belgian shepherd listens very well. She pays attention to me and she will come when I call her, without hesitation. She will walk right next to me without a leash. I could go on, but to summarise: she's a very good dog and we've both worked hard to get there.</p>

<p>However, when she spots sheep, cows, horses, pheasants, wild cats (cats she knows are fine), you name it, she totally changes. All she can focus on is the wild animal. If she's on the leash, she will just keep pulling like a 'mad dog' in that direction. Any kind of correction is totally ignored. It's tunnel vision and I am like air to her. Whatever I may do, pull on leash, 'shout', try to get to her with her favourite food, she ignores me like I'm air. I'm simply not there to her; all there is, is the wild animal. </p>

<p>If she's off the leash, she will just chase the animal until she's lost it, and then eventually she will come back. Obviously, I'm quite hesitant to let her off the leash now.</p>

<p>How can I start working towards better behaviour around wild animals with her? The main problem that I'm facing is that she ignores me totally when she spots a wild animal, whereas normally she's very attentive. It's hard to do any training, since I can't even get her attention to begin with.  So perhaps I should rephrase my question: how can I get my dog's attention in such a situation? I know what to do once I have her attention, but I simply can't get it in these situations. </p>

<p>The only suggestion I've gotten so far, is to use a remote electric collar, but I'm very hesitant to use these, because they seem rather cruel and I have no experience whatsoever with these. I have always used positive reinforcement training methods, so I simply don't feel comfortable with these devices. She was adopted from an animal shelter, had been through a lot and was a very insecure and even traumatised dog, and now she's a confident, happy, and well-behaved dog (except when around wild animals, of course), thanks to positive reinforcement training, and I simply don't want one of these E-collar to traumatise her again. On the other hand, the E-collars seem like a perfect fit for these kinds of situations and perhaps the only thing that may be able to get her attention when she spots a wild animal, so I would be willing to try this, but only as a last resort.</p>

I don't want to do anything wrong or cruel that's why im asking.. I know you cant tell for years but I am convinced that Tiffany is a little girl ( only a guess but she has a tiny tail where by Shermans tail is long and fat and clearly visable).

"Sometimes my dog refuses to eat, just sits next to his bowls and does nothing","<p>I've got a 2 year old parsons russell terrier, Bentley. He works with me - we do dog boarding and dog sitting from my home and we always have at least one other dog over. Therefore I can never leave his food bowl like i would otherwise because the other dogs will steal it. Most of the time when I put his bowl in front of him he would just sit and stare at me. He doesn't look scared, he just stares and refuses to sometimes even sniff the food. I try to leave him in the kitchen alone to eat but when I come back he hasn't moved at all. </p>

<p>When we don't have any dogs over I leave his bowl on the floor and he will come by himself and eat when he wants to. But that rarely happens, we have dogs over 99% of the time and I can't risk the other dogs getting an upset tummy because of Bentley's food. </p>

<p>All other dogs would eat their meals so nicely, and Bentley would watch them eat but wouldn't touch his own food. I mix some delicious wet food with his dry food and at times I have to put pieces of cheese in it so he will even agree to eat it.</p>

<p>I know he's not THAT picky because he eats his dry food without anything else in it without issues when it's left on the ground. I need an advice on how to teach him to eat what I give him? Because he THROWS UP when he doesn't eat! After having breakfast and skipping lunch he would throw up yellow foam just an hour before dinner! As far as I know it's his stomach telling me it's empty. I know in the wild they can go days without eating, but I'm tired of cleaning throw up that sometimes ends on the carpet or bed, and I'm tired of running through the flat when I hear him about to throw up so I can move him to a hard floor.</p>

<p>I also must say that I myself is a very anxious and problematic person - my family slowly drove me insane in my childhood and I ended up with many psychological issues. Nevertheless I'm 20 and my family still is driving me insane. I get mad (mostly at myself) a lot and I think Bentley can feel it, but there is nothing I can do about it as my family refuses to believe I have any issues at all. Until I make enough money to pay for my own therapy, I'm stuck with anger and anxiety issues.</p>

<p>Also Bentley goes to hide whenever anyone around talks too loudly or yells, like if anyone plays a ps3 game and gets mad at the character dying, he would run away. Even if the other dogs around will see the yelling as play and fun and would jump on me to play!  I need him to feel relaxed no matter what's going on around. He is such a perfect dog other than these 2 issues. Please help?</p>

"Culural and inter-cat problems with adopting two kittens","<p>I know this is broad question but I am thinking about adopting a kitten soon. However I started thinking about two for their welfare. However my parents, who live on another side of the world, are a bit terrified:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their experience with two cats in single household is that it ends with violence, including sexual, between cats when they grow up even when they were fine as kittens.</li>
<li>They are a little bit worried about problems with travelling (I don't want to tell them that but I <em>hate</em> travelling and even with one cat I planned to ask a friend to see him/her rather then introduce a cat to stress of international travel).</li>
<li>They are also worried that, as I am single at this moment, I may have a trouble finding significant other.</li>
<li>They don't buy the argument about kittens playing with each other when I'm away at work as they think that a single one will just sleep through the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>What should I do? Are they right? Is there any negative stereotype about singles with two cats (I'm currently in Western US)? Is my rented flat (&lt;900 ft sq) too small for 2 cats?</p>

So does large fish require water replacement in short priod with filter attached? what devices i need to keep them alive? and what's their priority. when should a water change? do i need a live plant environment, and if so, then how should the water get replaced?
I think my snail are of the <code>Pomacea canaliculata</code> type, should i raise the level of stone at some point so they can go out side water as i want them to increase? and can it happen in middle of tank so it will split the tank in two section, cause the snail don't become a bait?</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>Recently I started leaving him some food or even feeding him by throwing some food out the window (He refuses to come close). He does seem to be hungry all the time, however he does have a necklace and doesn't seem to be weak (He has to do quite a big jump to get to my windows)</p>

<p>So <code>contact</code> means that at least one paw is in the yellow zone, right ?</p>

<p>From there you could train stopped contact or running contact. What is the point of a stopped contact ? Is it required for some obstacles ? Or is it just a way to ensure a proper contact ?</p>

<p>Now about the training: is the contact just part of the training of a specific obstacle ? Do you re-train it for every one ? Once it is trained ""in general"", do you have a cue, to help the dog understand that you want that for a specific obstacle ?</p>

<p>What about 2-on 2-off contacts ? Is it just a way to make the training more systematic (the dog will eventually understand that he's asked something specific, and then is able to reproduce it on different obstacles more easily) ? How do you train this ? Is it useful to train it ""at home"" first (like on a book) ? If so, do you add a cue ? With a clicker, would you just capture the behaviour ?</p>

"Should dogs be allowed to greet each other?","<p>This weekend has been rich in experiences, both for me and for my dog (who is a puppy). As the weather finally improved, we met many more dogs at the park. </p>

<p><strong>Experience 1</strong><br>
My dog was unleashed. I spotted another dog on the other side of the park that I had to cross and I put my dog back on leash. The other was unleashed. I came closer to the owner and I asked if I could let my dog approach his dog (the other dog was an adult and was not showing obvious fear or anger at that point). The guy said I should not and even asked me to move quickly as his ""dog doesn't like other dogs"". Apart from the fact that this doesn't make sense as he should then be the one putting his dog on leash, do you think we should not at least start approaching, and back off in case one of the dogs show signs of fear?</p>

<p><strong>Experience 2</strong><br>
My dog and the other dog were leashed. My dog is always excited when he sees other dogs but then usually calms down when given the possibility to sniff the other dog (I think this is normal behaviour, especially with a young dog). There was a third dog around. I let him sniff him and at that point both owners could conclude that my dog should be OK. I then asked the other owner if I could approach, but the answer was, ""no, they're on leash so they could get hurt"". I don't think the leash is a real problem here: if they meet in a friendly manner, that's no problem; if they start fighting the leash could be of great help. Of course I agree that we should not let dogs play and get too excited when on leash as it could hurt their legs.</p>

"What should I do about a mysterious hole found in one of my cockatiel's beaks?","<p><strong>First, Some Details:</strong></p>

<p>I have two young adorable little cockatiels named Schala and Janus. They are very sweet and ridiculously human friendly.</p>

<p>They are less than a year old and only 5 days difference in age (they will be 1 in 5 months).</p>

<p>They are born from the same breeder and have the same mother and father.</p>

<p>When they were born, they each shared a cage with many multiple other cockatiels (all siblings of about the same age), but not each other (there were two cages both with multiple other 'tiels. Schala was in one, and Janus in the other).</p>

<p>They have always shared a cage together since I have had them (they were little more than one month old when I got them).</p>

<p>Schala is your traditional yellow and grey 'tiel while Janus is grey and white (his face will eventually turn white, I am told).</p>

<p>I am not sure of the true gender of either bird.</p>

<p>They do vie for my attention almost exclusively, despite spending most of their time together.</p>

<p>They get frustrated with each other sometimes, when one tries to take the other's spot on their perch or my shoulder. By frustrated, I mean that they will squawk a bit and clash beaks with their mouths open. They do this to try to be intimidating to the other one, but I have never seen either one of them try to do the other one any serious harm.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I came home one day and noticed that Schala had a small hole on her beak (about halfway between the sizes of an ant and a ladybug [sorry struggling with something to compare the size to]). It's on her right side, just under the cere, and my first thought was that they fought and Janus got the best of her.</p>

<p>Schala shows no sign of pain, she doesn't favor it or shy away if you try to touch it. Her behavior has been perfectly normal since we have been watching it (it has been about 3 days). It hasn't gotten any worse, any bigger, or changed any color (there is no red or anything, just a small dark hole). Other than the hole itself, there are no other negative signs. She has no trouble getting around, drinking, or eating. I don't <em>think</em> the hole goes all the way through, but it's very hard to tell because it is dark and she doesn't like holding her head still for very long.</p>

"What should I do if my cat stops eating and starts hiding more?","<p>My cat is usually really social. Loves to be cuddled, loves being around people, always crawls in my lap. Today, though, he spent the day hiding in my closet and in his cat tree. He didn't really eat a lot of his wet food breakfast, which is usually a big event in this house. He did eat some treats I brought to him, and cuddles when I come to him, but he doesn't really come out much. His eyes are clear, his nose feels the same as always,and he doesn't appear to react at all to me checking his belly and limbs and such for abnormalities (I didn't notice any but I am also not a vet). </p>

<p>For reference, he is about three years old, an indoor cat, and the only pet in my house. I don't have any plants or anything in my house that he could have eaten. </p>

"How can I help my sick leopard gecko?","<p>Two years ago my brother got a pet leopard gecko. We still don't know it's gender but I will say him. </p>

<p>For two years he was fine and looked healthy had a fat tail and ate fine. The only problem was that his cage was missing a cool moist hide and only had a warm dry hide, and we rarely even put calcium on his food and mostly fed him mealworms. Besides that everything else was fine. At the time I had no idea his cage was not set up properly and he had to have supplemented crickets because he was perfectly healthy so I didn't do the research, also he was my brothers pet not mine and I was only 13 so it was really my Dad's job not mine. Anyway for the past few months he has started to scab up, get sores, lose weight, stop eating, instead of shedding all at once he is just constantly shedding parts of skin, it looks like some of his bones might be broken, or the tips of some of his fingers might be missing it is hard to tell. My dad took him to the vet and all they did was give him vitamin shots and tell us to bathe him twice a day. I also started doing my own research and made some adjustments that should help him. I built a temporary moist and cool hide for him to go in that he likes more than his warm hide, I give him a bath in warm water daily, I put a wet cloth over part of his tank to increase humidity, and since he is not eating I started to feed him this medicine that as all the nutrition and calories he needs and an appetite stimulant so he will start to eat live insects again.</p>

<p>Even after these adjustments he still shows no sign of getting better and I have no idea what to do. Should I get him euthanized because I think he is in pain or what? Also my Dad is cheap and won't take him to the vet again or buy anything extra. </p>

"Confusion over the term pit bull/terrier","<p>I understand that in a lot of people's minds, including my own, there is confusion over the term ""pit bull"". I've read the Wikipedia article on ""Pit bull"" and it explains that it's not a a dog breed, but a generic name that encompasses a number of different breeds. Quoting the introductory paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pit bull is the common name for a type of dog descended from bulldogs and terriers. The pit bull-type is particularly ambiguous, as it encompasses a range of pedigree breeds, informal types and appearances that cannot be reliably identified.<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href=""http://dogbreedportal.blogspot.com/2012/02/summarypit-bull-dog-is-dog-from.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this blog</a> there are two photos of dogs that the blogger has labelled the ""Pit Bull Dog"", however after searching there is no officially recognized name of this type. In the blog it is mentioned that this ""Pit Bull Dog"" is also known as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pit_Bull_Terrier"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">American Pit Bull Terrier</a>, which indeed is a recognized breed of dog.</p>

<p>I'm particularly confused because of the differences in appearance between the dogs in photos purportedly of American Pit Bull Terriers. On this blog site we have these two:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K94Uq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K94Uq.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

<p>And in other places these are also American Pit Bull Terriers:
From Wikipedia:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4eOf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/T4eOf.jpg"" alt=""""></a>
Top left: American Pit Bull Terrier<br>
Top right: American Staffordshire Terrier<br>
Bottom left: Staffordshire Bull Terrier<br>
Bottom right: American Bulldog<br></p>

<p>From what I can see there is quite a large difference between the first two photos and the photo at the topleft of the last picture. </p>

<p>Similarly, the following photo is the main photo at the beginning of the American Pit Bull Terrier article on Wikipedia, and although in this case I see more of a resemblance to the first two photos I posted, to me it seems there are quite significant differences. The first two photos show dogs that are much more short-legged and stocky. Also the faces looks quite different to me. And how about the ears?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbIxM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BbIxM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Assuming these are all photos of the American Pit Bull Terrier (for the montage image I'm referring to the topleft photo only), is it my imagination that there are massive differences between each individual of the American Pit Bull Terrier, even greater differences than one would see between individuals of most other breeds of dog? </p>

<p>And I also found these images in an image search. Essentially they distinguish an American Pit Bull Terrier and an ""American Bully"":</p>

"How do I make my cat accept the new vacuum robot?","<h1>The situation</h1>

<p>I recently bought one of those vacuum robots that wander around the house to clean it.</p>

<p>I set it to clean the flat twice a day (it takes ~1 hour to clean the whole flat), and I'm having a problem with my cats.</p>

<p>I have an european/domestic cat and a Maine Coon (both approx 3 years old), male and one female.</p>

<p>The first time I turned on the vacuum, the european followed it a bit scared around all the flat and after few hours it stopped caring too much about it. It simply tries to stay away from it the minimum necessary to feel ""comfortably safe"".</p>

<p>The Maine Coon was on top of the scratch post when I started the first time the robot, and she followed it with the sight all the time without getting down from it.</p>

<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>I noticed she's very scared of it and she always tries to be in a different room from the one of the robot, but still she always try to keep an eye on it to see where it is.</p>

<p>The real problem is that she isn't scared of it only while it's wandering around, she act weirdly all the day, taking glances at the robot by time in time and walking ""flattened"" when she's near it.</p>

<h1>About her</h1>

<p>She's usually very social and isn't scared by visitors or anything, she's genuinely curious and never scared. So I'm wondering why she's so scared by this vacuum robot?<br>

<h1>Attempts to fix the problem</h1>

<li>shut the door right when we see her approach the door</li>

"Social component to grass eating","<p>I am aware that pretty much all dogs eat grass. Some say they puke from it, while mine eats it to soothe her belly when she feels sick. It actually prevents her from puking.

"Mystery Snail laid eggs in a terrible location-, hatchling health help","<p>I recently put two of my mystery snails together (originally separated between 2 tanks). They spent almost an entire day together ""piggy backing"" each other. Woke up and feed my fish this morning and found an egg sac on my filter (pictured). I'm worried because snails usually lay eggs right above the water line, and the condensation from the tank keeps them moist.... But this will not happen in the position she laid them. I've propped my hood in a manner that might help, but being that far from the surface, will the babies still drop into the water safely? And I'm concerned about them drying up there. I'm trying to avoid removing them to put them in a ""paper towel incubator"" because it can do alot of damage. What should I do? Will propping the hood (like pictured) be sufficient? If not, what's the best way to remove it without damaging the eggs?</p>

<p>Sidenote: I moved the female into this tank because she had shell damage due to soft water, and I wanted to get her into harder water for her she'll as quickly as possible without further malnutrition while I slowly increased gh, so fish weren't shocked. It's only been a week and it's showing improvement, but I'm curious if this will negativity effect the baby snails (if they hatch), or if water quality - not mother's health, is what effects their development? I also cannot increase water level because I have babies in a hang off nursery that hangs low, and they'd have no air at the top if I add water.

"Exercising a Rottweiler","<p>I'm new to the ownership of a rottweiler and am wondering about how much exercise a young Rottweiler should partake in. I've read a couple of articles saying too much exercise is unhealthy for the joints and muscles of a rottie.</p>

<p><em>By exercise I mean <strong>running</em></strong> which I do a lot of. I am wondering how far or long makes it unhealthy because there are miles of trails I usually go to, so could I rest for a while and then continue further?</p>

<p>Basically what I'm asking:</p>

<ul>
<li>How far of running(light jog) is unhealthy for a rottweiler specifically?</li>
<li>Could I rest with my rottweiler for 15-20 mins and run more?</li>
<li>Is running even an effective way of keeping a rottweiler (physically)healthy?</li>
<li>[Extra] At around what age should I lessen the amount of exercise</li>

"Can a grizzly bear be kept as a pet?","<p>I saw that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVMBdi4dgME"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">video</a> a few time ago. It shows the story of Brutus the Grizzly which is living as a pet with his owner.</p>

<p>I take grizzlies as dangerous animals and so I think the grizzly must have been castrated, had his fangs and claws removed ( and so this makes the whole thing quite cruel ).</p>

"Will our cat try and hurt the new kittens he is related to?","<p>We have a 7 month old male kitten/cat. His mother lives in the same apartment block and she and he have access to eachother's homes. My neighbour who owns the mother watches over our boy while we are at work which helps keep our minds at ease specially as we were easing him into the outside world.</p>

<p>Mummy cat was pregnant with her second litter (she will be spayed soon) when the neighbours left for an overseas trip a few days ago - we gladly agreed to cat-sit as we have done in the past. I didn't put too much thought into the fact that she would give birth while they were away, as the neighbours seemed to handle the first birth so effortlessly. </p>

<p>The 3 babies were born today (Sunday), and I just realised when we are away at work all day, our boy will be in the house with her and the babies. What are the chances he does not understand what the kittens are and will try and play with them? Alternatively, he understands what they are and will try and kill them to claim territory? Looking at the new babies colouring I am confident that they have been fathered by the same Tom that hangs around our area that fathered our boy, so our boy is 100% related to this new litter.</p>

<p>Our boy has not been neutered  - I will be organising soon as soon as time and finances permit. His reaction to them so far has just been to slowly/timidly approach the box, peer over the edge, and then just as slowly retreat. He does this about once an hour, the rest of the time going about his usual business in other areas of the house - playing, napping, eating  - without us even having to encourage him to be away from them. Is this a sign that he has no hostility towards them? I had always thought if a male cat were to kill kittens they would attempt to do it at first sight. </p>

"How to deal with a big change in a dogs environment?","<p>I know similar questions have been asked, so I'm going to be more specific about my problem.</p>

<p>My parents have 2 friendly dogs, a beagle and a rottweiler, of 12 and 10 years old respectively. They have lived all their life in a house with a 150 m2 yard, in a city which is fairly dry (350 mm/yr of rainfall). They are used to live outdoors only, and have problems behaving indoors. Out of necessity, my parents are now moving to an apartment and have to give away the dogs, therefore, I am going to take them.</p>

<p>Since I lived with the dogs almost all their life, and I'm still the only one to take them out for a walk whenever I visit, they have a strong feeling for me. The problem is right now I live in a town which has a lot more rain (1910 mm/yr) and a yard which is about 50 m2 with no roof. Plus, my neighbors have 2 female fox-terriers and the yard division is a fence. Me and my wife both work, so the dogs will be alone most of the day and I can't leave them inside.</p>

<p>My question is, what recommendations can you give me to manage this big change? Is this new environment suitable for the dogs or should I find another solution? Is it possible to deal with the rainy environment while keeping them outdoors?</p>

<p>My idea was that my father stayed at my house with the dogs to give them company and watch their behavior until they got used to the new environment. I'm also thinking of building a small roof area for them in the yard.</p>

"Is it okay to swear at my pet, as long as I do it nicely?","<p>I don't have kids, so I don't have to set any sort of example when I'm at home. So when I'm talking to my pets I will sometimes use swear words towards them.</p>

<p>Like if they run into a wall while they're playing with a toy, I'll call them dumb, or if I'm holding out a treat for them and they act like they want me to bring it to them, I'll usually say something like: ""come here you little [explicitive]"".</p>

<p>I know non-human animals don't speak our language, so they rely on the tone of our voice to understand what we mean.</p>

"Are annual booster vaccinations necessary for dogs and cats that are no longer in contact with communicable diseases they're preventing?","<p>I have 2 pets (a cat and a dog) that receive booster vaccines every year for communicable diseases they're no longer in contact with. They have been adopted from a shelter in non-Schengen area EU country where they had contact with many sick animals with canine distemper, canine hepatitis, etc., but for the last 2 years that I have them within the Schengen area EU, they have been out of that environment, and in no contact with any communicable diseases these booster vaccinations are helping to prevent.</p>

"
"How can I train my cat to stop ""demand meowing"", but not ""request meowing""?","<p>By demand meowing, I of course mean that loud, aggressive, nonstop meowing.</p>

<p>I understand that you can positively reinforce silence by rewarding a cat when it stops meowing (eg, ""<a href=""http://www.catbehaviorassociates.com/training-your-cat-to-be-quiet/"">Training your cat to be quiet</a>""), but I don't understand what amount of time to allow after a meow for the reward - if she gets a reward as soon as she is silent for one second, doesn't that still reward the meowing? I'm also not sure whether responding to a ""polite request"" reinforces demanding requests, or if these different meows can be treated differently in training.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, we give her dry food throughout the day, but if we just
  top it up at various times, it may sit too long and not get eaten. If
  she tells us that she wants some biscuits, that is helpful. She also
  gets canned meat once a day, but lately she's started to become very
  demanding up to 2 hours before the usual feeding time. We always wait
  it out, and make sure to give her the food once there is a gap in the
  meowing, but it is a great distraction up to that point and so far
  hasn't diminished the behaviour.</p>
  
  <p>Similarly, we don't want to leave the door open all day; if she wants
  to go out, it's helpful for her to tell us. But if it is not
  convenient for us to let her out, because we're going out or to bed,
  she starts to get very loud and demanding. We do keep a clean litter
  box inside for her, and sometimes we'll place her in it in this
  situation, but it has never proven effective (maybe because she
  doesn't actually want to go to the toilet!). (NB she has never had any issue
  with using a litter box, and will use it no problem when it is the
  only option [after moving to a new house, for example], but she does
  strongly prefer doing her business outside).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a way to stop her from vocally demanding something without dissuading her from politely asking, or is this just too confusing for her? Will us waiting out the nonstop meowing eventually get her to stop doing it in general? Or is there perhaps a way to distract the cat into forgetting about what she so adamantly wants in the first place?</p>

"How to improve the condition of a very fearful dog?","<p>The dog of one my relatives suffer from extreme fear reactions and his life is about finding ways to hide in a dark corner of the house and spend half a day there.</p>

<p>I'll try to describe the dog's behaviour and give my understanding of the problem. In short: <strong>how can we help the dog overcome his general fearful state of mind ?</strong></p>

<h2>About the dog</h2>

<p>From time to time he just ""shuts down"" when noticing that the owner wants to go for a walk. He'll either hide or just ""act dead"". He often does that while on walk too, for no obvious reason. It doesn't to be related to a specific thing (like cars or other dogs). He think he's in such a general fearful state that with time he associated many neutral situations with things that were initially starting his fear reactions.</p>

<p>He is clearly afraid of fireworks.</p>

<p>The dog was (in my view) not properly socialised and/or exposed to enough stimuli (cars, people, other dogs, loud noises, etc.) in his early life (from 8 weeks to his final shots, probably around 16 weeks). The reason was that the vet advised to keep him in the house for that period to avoid any potential problem before his first shots. Now that I know how important early socialisation is, this seems a bit crazy to me but that's what happened.</p>

<p>The dog is not showing signs of agression. When facing a ""fight or flight"" situation he definitely chose the second option.</p>

<p>The dog is a two and half years old Border Collie, pure breed. I don't have much information about the breeder. The family of the owner reports that the mother was <em>fearful</em>.</p>

<p>So all of that is far from perfect and it is quite sad to see the dog in that state of mind.</p>

<p>I don't have detailed explanation but apparently the vet tried to help the dog reach a more relaxed state with <em>micro massaging</em>. I think he was referring to the <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/2572/what-is-the-tellington-ttouch-method-and-what-are-the-benefits-for-dogs"">Tellington TTouch method</a> (see the related question, the picture there is not the dog I'm talking about here).  </p>

<h2>Potential solutions and questions</h2>

<p>For dogs with specific fear-related problems I think the way to treat the dog is with <em>classical counter-conditioning</em> and <em>desensitisation</em>. However I think the difficult part is that it is too easy to go too far too quickly and to actually <em>flood</em> the dog. <a href=""http://beyondcesarmillan.weebly.com/andrew-luescher.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">There have been many criticism that it is what Cesar Milan does quite often in the presence of fearful dogs</a> (not my goal to start a debate here but in this case it is my main concern).</p>

<p>So as in this case we have a generally fearful dog, how should we proceed ? I don't know if the best strategy is to <strong>work on each fear reaction individually</strong>, gradually exposing the dog to them. Or if it is better to <strong>treat the problem as a whole</strong>. If so, I don't know how and I don't know what the techniques are. <strong>This is my main question</strong>. What is the clinical definition of the situation ?</p>

"How important is bloodwork before anesthesia?","<p>Our 5.5y pug had died after his anesthesia started taking effect. He was there for Brachycephalic Airway Syndrome, and seemed healthy otherwise. He had removed few bad teeth 4 months ago with all the blood test being perfectly normal.
On clinic, they did ""full workout"" testing and x-rayed his chest. All fine.
The theory is, he was living with heavy oxygen debt and anesthesia slowing him down was simply too much. But looking at the invoice and quick call back there, the clinic didn't do any blood tests. They claim it's not a standard procedure and while I understand my knowledge is limited, it's killing me that could perhaps show something and prevent him undergoing the anesthesia.</p>

<p>How important a blood work is? Could it warn about low oxygenation?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Clinic has explained a blood testing was deemed not needed according to their extensive practice and what they learned about him from other tests. Their original ""he seemed healthy"" was indeed backed up strongly when described in detail.
They did experience a few similar cases but there's still no clue what are the indicators to look for, except all were brachycephalic dog breeds.  Blood test wouldn't help with oxygen level. (see the accepted answer)</p>

<p>We have woken up this morning to find all the fish dead, overnight. There were several tiny fish which we hadn't noticed (they look like recently hatched eggs) which are also dead - around 7 total in all.</p>

<p>What could have caused this? Reading around, it looks as though we may have had an issue with oxygen in the water - my intuition tells me that topping the pond up and pulling out (admittedly a lot of) pond weed shouldn't have caused a problem like that, but is that right?</p>

<p>It looks almost as if the fish were all electrocuted, but our pond also contains rather a lot of water snails, and they're all fine. We have in the past had several frogs residing in the pond, and there's no sign of them (either dead or alive). </p>

<p>The pond also has a lily in it, the flowers of which were pushed under water by the filling up of the pond last night. The pond is about 1 by 2 metres. </p>

<p>We also have two cats (it seems clear that the cats didn't do this, on the basis that all the tiny fish are also dead, and the bigger fish don't look damaged physically on the outside), and whilst I don't think that they drink from the pond, I'd like to confirm that we shouldn't panic and drain the pond or anything right now?</p>

"How to socialize unneutered female and male rabbit, before or after neutering?","<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>

<p>We own an unneutered female rabbit, since one week she is alone because her partner died. The search for a new partner is difficult, because we want an adult neutered rabbit-man for her, dwarf, no teddy fur and no lop ears.
We have found one male rabbit, but he is unneutered.
(Searched in animal shelters and small ad) </p>

<p><strong>Aim:</strong></p>

<p>We want to exclude the cause, that they absolute dislike each other, before we neuter the male. But we do not want the female to become pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>Question(s)</strong></p>

<p>Is there the chance to do so? </p>

<p>Can neutering change something, so it works before, but not after it? </p>

<p>How big is the risk, they see and at once start to mate?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The actual owner of the male would take him back, if the socializing do not work well. I assume neutering is not part of this. Additional I want to spare the male the neutering, if we can not keep him with our female.</p>

"Cat eye infection","<p>The mother cat gave birth to three kittens in our backyard, after the first month i noticed one of the kittens eyes have some ""rheum"" and is semi closed. i thought maybe go away by it self (bad mistake)...</p>

<p>In second month when they started walking outside the kitten both eyes was completely closed so i take him to a vet.</p>

<p><em>(a side note about vet; in the small city where I'm living there is not an ""experienced"" vet which is expert in cats or dogs. they just do cows and sheep vaccinations etc...)</em></p>

<p>Vet injected a dose of an antibiotic and another dose of dexamethasone and prescribed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Si fixim syrup 5ml a day</li>
<li>Prednisolone 5mg 1/10 every 12 hours</li>
<li>Chloramphenicol 0.5% one drop every 12 hours</li>
<li>Sterile eye drop every 8 hours</li>
<li>B-complex vitamin syrup 5ml a day</li>

<p>It's the third day that I'm using those medications for this poor kitty and even though the ""rheum"" is reduced but his eyes still closed (until i clean it using eye-drops) and still have inflammation. his eyes outside corners is PURE RED(is not visible in the picture) and when i use eye drops kitten is in pain... :(</p>

<p>Other than that he's playful and eats well.</p>

<p>I changed their ""nest"" and cleaned the whole backyard so they can live in an clean environment. don't know what else to do to cure him, he's too young to become blind!</p>

"How quickly do Belgian Tervurens grow?","<p>I recently got a Belgian Terv puppy. At just shy of nine weeks, he weighed 9 pounds 5 oz. Three weeks later, he weighed 10 pounds 8 oz, a net gain of only 1 pound 3 oz. I was surprised, the vet was 'meh'.</p>

<p>He is eating a 5 star rated puppy food (dogfoodadvisor.com), was one cup 3x/d. Good energy, normal stool, looks healthy, but so furry, hard to tell if he's too thin or not.</p>

<p>I started adding toppers to his feeding and added an extra feeding/day to get him to eat more. Plus, for training treats, I'm giving boiled chicken, beef or other high-quality treats (freeze-dried liver, etc.).</p>

<p>I've looked for growth charts for the breed and I can't find any.</p>

<p>Because of intermittent regurgitation and vomitting, there's a small chance that the pup can have an esophageal or pyloric problem. The pup is scheduled for a visit next week, and if inadequate weight gain, this will be followed by a barium swallow study.</p>

<p>I spoke with the breeder (450 miles away, mind you) who at first wanted to switch out the puppy for another one (what? No, I've bonded to this puppy) and when I ran the possibility of a medical problem by her, she literally screamed at me not to get the puppy tested, not to trust the vet (""They don't know what they're doing! They know nothing about this breed! They're only in it for the money!""), and when I said I would trust the vet, she threatened to reclaim the dog because of abuse, so I think she's out of the picture.</p>

"How can I reduce feeding my fish to keep my snail population under control?","<p>I <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/18116/are-underwater-snails-strictly-bound-to-under-the-water"">posted</a> the other week about some snails I had noticed in my relatively new tank; where I was warned that it would be wise to get the snail population under control while I can. Sure enough, the snail population has increased - not to the point where they're out of control - but if they continue to reproduce at the rate they have, I'd give it a few weeks before I've got myself a ""problem"". </p>

<p>I'm fairly positive that they're <a href=""http://www.molluscs.at/gastropoda/index.html?/gastropoda/freshwater/physidae.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bladder snails</a>, and I have since purchased two assassin snails in an attempt to keep their population under control - though these guys seem fairly chilled out so I'm not sure how helpful they've actually been so far (FYI, they've been in the tank for four days). </p>

<p>I've <a href=""https://www.thespruce.com/removing-aquarium-snails-1381275"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">read</a> time and time again about reducing the amount of food that you feed your fish, as ""less food = fewer snails"". However, I'm completely unsure of how much <em>less</em> I need to feed my fish to have an impact upon reducing my snail population. My fish supplier suggested to feed twice a day but I'm wondering if once a day may be more helpful to nip this in the bud? Or whether I should carry on feeding twice, and just use less food both times? </p>

<p><strong>Additional info:</strong> I have 9 tetra, 3 guppies, 1 bristlenose catfish and 3 amano shrimp. I feed them twice a day (morning and evening), a combination of flakes for the tetra/guppies and pellets for the shrimp/catfish. Once or twice a week I will use a daphnia or an algae wafer alternative for example, to create a more varied diet. I remove any left-over food which is visible to me but I <em>know</em> there will be some which sinks into the gravel and slips through my radar. I siphon my gravel relatively regularly to remove this and there isn't a clear abundance of algae as of yet - but my snail population is still increasing? </p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that the unseen food is the issue and that I need to reduce the amount I feed my fish to minimise this. And so, my question is:</p>

<p><strong>How can I reduce the amount I feed my fish, to effectively minimise the reproduction of pest snails, without harming the fish?</strong></p>

"What might be a typical stomach ulcer healing process and timeline?","<p>Sadly, my cat (11yr, male neutered) was recently diagnosed with moderate inflammation of his intestines (IBD) and a stomach ulcer.  Which explains his occasional vomiting over the last couple of months, which suddenly increased to the point where he refuses all food and is on a feeding tube.  The longer-term vomiting is likely due to the IBD, but the food aversion and severe vomiting is likely due to the ulcer (according to the vet who did the endoscopy). At least it wasn't cancer, it seems like?</p>

<p>My cat is now on a number of anti-nausea drugs (metoclopramide, cerenia, and ondansetron) and also ulcer medication (sucralfate).  Of all the nausea things, only metoclopramide seems to actually do much, which makes its 4-5h duration rather unfortunate (he'll vomit up to dry heaves despite the other two, though only done 2 doses of ondansatron so far). Mostly, he just hides himself away feeling sick and his only enjoyment is chin scratches.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had a cat with a stomach ulcer and have insights on the typical healing process?  I am particularly wondering how long the healing process is likely to be.  I should ideally be introducing foods to eat, but there is really no point right now when his primary mission in life is currently ""Hide behind the couch and try not to vomit on myself."" However, it is my understanding that his appetite should probably return once the ulcer is resolved. Anyone have insight or tips about a typical successful treatment process (e.g., medication issues, dietary, how long it takes a stomach ulcer to heal)?</p>

<p>Update Note: It might actually be the sucralfate that is the only one that does much, rather than the metoclopramide.  I tend to deliver their doses close together, and their durations are similar. When I recently gave the sucralate a bit later, he tossed his cookies despite a metoclopramide dose.</p>

<p>Update 2: Unfortunately, the poor boy did not make it. The ulcer would not heal for some reason, leading to persistent anemia and death.  Lack of B12 due to his earlier vomiting might have been a contributing factor (he got a shot, but probably too late). As a note, switching from Hills a/d to Royal Canin Pea-Duck did help him stop vomiting and keep food down, but he was just too weak couldn't recover. If I could re-do this in a similar situation (ulcer caused by IBD), it would be to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Switch immediately to a high-calorie rare-protein diet (pea-duck is good, about 190/can, while venison and rabbit are lower-calorie, at least for Royal Canin)</li>
<li>Start on weekly B12 shots as a preventative measure (they're cheap and shouldn't hurt anything even if unneeded), and</li>
<li>Get regular bloodwork done so you can track trends for healing of the ulcer (at least once per week).</li>
<li>Drooling - Be aware that excessive drooling may not be due to nausea, but might be due to anemia also.</li>
<li>Hind leg weakness - Be aware that weak hind legs is often related to nervous system issues, such as those associated with B12 deficiency (which can be caused by vomiting, diarrhea, or lack of absorption due to bad IBD).</li>
<li>Consider switching food as soon as bile vomiting starts to increase (e.g., vomiting on a mostly-empty stomach, rather than during or directly after feeding), since kitty's immune system might have started rejecting that type of food (seems to be what might have happened with Hills a/d, which worked great for 2 days and then went rapidly downhill). IBD sometimes means the cat's gut will learn to reject certain foods, so just because a food worked well at one point doesn't mean it will be good even a few days later.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these in addition to the standard of care (e.g., sucralfate).  All of these eventually were used for my cat, but not all of them were immediate (and they could have in theory all been started up-front). There's still a pretty good chance my cat would not have made it, since the ulcer was not healing well, but it might give a bit more of a fighting chance.</p>

I'll play with her, take her on walks, let her go to the bathroom regularly...but she just jumps on me and whines like she needs something, then when I pay attention it's more play.

"Can cats release faeces from getting scared?","<p>Yesterday, I was taking care of the trash. I took out the regular black trash bag and opened it through swinging it around (I hope you get what I mean). I was in the kitchen, which is right next to the stairs. </p>

<p>When I started 'swinging' the trash bag, one of my cats started running down the stairs like she was being chased by a dog. Long story short, she ran down the stairs so quickly, and then she dashed right under the trash bag and ran for the living room.</p>

<p>From my understanding, she must have been on the stairs, because I expected her to run as far away from the sound of the bag (she should have ran upstairs in this case), yet she went downstairs. </p>

<p>Now, here's the dilemma. Around 5 minutes after my cat dashed to the living room, I went upstairs and found something dark on the floor right on top of the stairs. The room wasn't lit up at the time so I touched it to verify what it is. It was poop, and it could be easily said that it was recent. This is the first time it happened. I mean, my cats already heard the bag and so I already know that they are terrified of the sound it makes. They have never had an accident with releasing faeces or peeing anywhere other than the litter box. </p>

<p>The thing I am confused about is whether that bag really scared her. I mean, the poop is there and that's a clear sign that it all happened at the same time, but my cat was at the top of a fairly long staircase. It's so long that I really doubt she would have ran down the whole set of stairs, and if anything she would have ran to a room upstairs.</p>

<p>What do you think? Is it likely that she released faeces due to getting scared?</p>

"Why does my rabbit try and make my bed wrinkle free?","<p>Ruby is a 3 year old English spot, she lives in our bedroom.  I don't have video but I did find a couple of videos online, they show a little of the behavior. I have talked to others who's bunnies have the same habit, so it seems pretty common.  It is hard to get good video because once I get the camera out she gets distracted.   </p>

</ul>

<p>It will often happen just as I climb into bed, which makes wrinkles.  She jumps up on the bed, gives me kiss, then starts pushing the wrinkles out of the bed.  Her hind feet placed firmly and she pushes out with her front feet.  She moves forward and pushes some more.  After a couple of minutes she stops and snuggles in for bed time petting and snuggles.</p>

<p>The other time it happens is shortly after my wife makes the bed.  Ruby will jump up on the bed and make sure all the wrinkles are pushed out.  She will occasionally dig a bit like you see in the videos, but it is 90% pushing.  Some times she pushes so far ahead that her back feet slip out behind her and she is stretched out in superman position (<em>arms straight ahead, feet straight back, and on her belly</em>).</p>

<p>I can understand the digging behavior, but what is it that causes a rabbit to push wrinkles out of the bed? </p>

"How can I stop my neighbor's dog from jumping the fence?","<p>I have two dogs and a big back yard, and my neighbor also has two dogs.  For a long time, when ever I've been playing with my dogs in the back yard, one of their dogs whines because it wants to play.  Several months ago, she dug under the fence in various places along the fence line.  My neighbor is lazy and did nothing to prevent it (he does not train her or even take her on walks, so naturally she wants to come over to my yard because she is bored).  To remedy the digging, I put cinder blocks along most of the fence where she was digging under.  It worked for a while, but then last week she managed to jump over the fence while I was playing.  My two dogs were out with me, and she got in a fight with one of mine and injured her.  Since then, the dog is very determined to come over now that she knows she can jump the fence.  My neighbor is in denial that she is jumping, even though I have personally witnessed it two times now.  I told him several times that she needs to be taken out on walks so she is not so bored.  Anyways, it's gotten so bad now that I can not let my dogs out in the yard without their dog coming over.  Just now, I let my male dog out and was playing fetch, and within one minute I saw their dog jump over the fence.  She got in a fight with my dog, but luckily my male is a bigger and he put their dog in its place and I was then able to tie her up.  My other female dog is still recovering from her injury.  I am afraid to let her outside because of their dog, but she is very depressed from sitting inside.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what kind of legal action I can take (in California) to resolve this?  Talking with him has gotten nowhere - he clearly does not care and won't listen to my suggestion to either put her on a long leash in the backyard or to keep her in the house.  <strong>Am I allowed to take their dog to animal control if she comes into my yard?</strong>  <strong>Can I get their dog taken away from them?</strong>  I feel sorry for their dog because it's not her fault - she is bored and neglected and her owner is irresponsible.  She also has behavioral issues which will only get worse.  She is young still so with training she could be a great dog, but her owners are setting her up for failure.  What can I do?</p>

"Why are my goldfish acting this way, and how can I remedy it?","<p>So I bought two goldfish on Wednesday, and the shopkeeper did not tell me to cycle the tank or anything. I bought the gravel and tree on Thursday and my auntie gave me an air pump and filter around Thursday tea time.</p>

<p>Today (friday), I bought some weekly cleaner to kill ammonia and nitrates. I washed the gravel and tree using fish tank water. This morning they looked okay, swimming around, but I had to move my 10 liter tank as the wires are tripping hazards.</p>

<p>Before putting them in the tank I left them in a bag to get used to the water, after adding the weekly cleaner and changing some of the water, it still looks cloudy even with the air pump and filter.</p>

<p>Now they are going to the side of the tank and trying to swim to the top but floating back down and swimming backwards so I turned the air pump off, and they are barely moving now, just sitting on the bottom behind the tree.

I'm concerned with negligent/irresponsible cat owners.  For example, what if I see my neighbor's cat everyday on an open window of a high rising building, and I warn the owner about the risks, and one day the cat falls.  So my question is: Are you aware of cases in which owners were held legally responsible in those situations? Or do you know of a SPCA chapter lobbying for passing local laws requiring cat owners living in apartments above, say, fourth floor to install screen (safety nets) on windows? I know of apartments where different tenants have had multiple cats injured and die over the years. Unfortunately it seems acceptable for well-meaning though inexperienced cat owners to dismiss such real risks.</p>

"Why does my cat have an upset stomach?","<p>I typically feed my cat a boiled fish fillet, ""Hoki"" ... (<a href=""http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-hoki.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-hoki.htm</a> ) we switched him to this after a one-week bout of diarrhea one month ago... it healed it within 2 days. We also have a bowl of dry food going for him at all times but I barely see him eat it.</p>

<p>This week we ran out of the Hoki and it was over a day before I could get back to the store to get some, so was feeding my cat canned tuna in the meantime. When I reached the store I discovered they were out of it, so settled for mackerel pieces instead... I boiled these up last night, removed all the bones, and tested him on a handful of it. He loved it initially, enthusiastically chomping away... and then I was shocked to see him walk away from it leaving 50% of it untouched. </p>

<p>After 15minutes he had a burst of diarrhea in his litter-box. I threw the rest of the mackerel away.  Half an hour later he had another burst, after which he was licking/cleaning his genetalia incessantly, and hissing at me if I tried to go near him (he wasn't like this with his previous diarrhea attack a month ago). I went to bed and woke up several times in the night to see him sitting in my bedroom, yet again cleaning his private parts each time. </p>

<p>This morning I inspected the house for any more diarrhea bursts, I could only find what looked like some streaking on the rug, but not sure how that would come about if he was cleaning himself so diligently. Was it a case of 'leakage' that he was trying to deal with, and what happened on the rug was him momentarily giving up on cleaning it away? </p>

<p>There was also a small pool of vomit with  large chunk of undigested mackerel in it. This morning he was still cleaning himself, and hissed at me again when I tried to go near him. He also refused to eat any tuna and curled up in the dining room to sleep at a time that he does not usually go to sleep. I noticed he was also working his mouth a lot, licking his chops as if he had just had a large meal. I did manage to pick him up for a while to hold him up to some running water as I was afraid he wasn't being proactive with his water bowl. He drank a lot of the running water.</p>

<p>He woke up again when he heard me going outside to put out the trash and came out to play in the garden momentarily... he seemed his old self for a bit, but is back inside curled up asleep again.  </p>

<p>Do you think it was the mackeral that is causing this, or the 1.5 days of canned tuna? </p>

"Preferable flows in aquarium?","<p>I am in the process of setting up an aquarium, and experimenting with the water flow.</p>

<p>It's 100x40x60cm (60cm high). I employ an HMF in one of the back corners, so there is no well defined ""inflow"" - water is entering the HMF over a large surface area.</p>

<p>The output is currently a relatively tight beam on the top edge of the HMF, blowing diagonally horizontally  across the water surface, then finding its way downward at the opposite side of the aquarium, while the side nearer to the HMF sees only very little movement. There is quite some motion going on at the surface, in a relatively tight stream originating at the outlet.</p>

<p>Is this generally an OK approach? How would I know whether everything is fine or not? I see no immediate problems, maybe except for the fact that larger plants near the ""hard"" part of the stream will be quite impossible (which in fact could be a problem for me; I'd like to have plenty of plants in the background...). </p>

<p>My question is, when do their bonds primarily form? How old would be considered too old to bring a genet kitten into my home?</p>

"Dog new at the office; should I force walks to stimulate him more?","<p>I am dogsitting my parents dog for a period of 2 weeks (he is used to staying 1-2 days, 2 weeks is new to him) and he goes with me to the office during the day. He is a 9 year old chichuahua mix, on the 'large' side of the chihuahua scale.</p>

<p>Normally he would go on 2 walks a day and spend the rest of the day around the house, in the garden, interacting with my parents or their cats.</p>

<ul>
<li>8:00 - A 15-20 min walk</li>
<li>15:00 - A 15-20 min walk</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently this is our schedule:</p>

<ul>
<li>8:00 - Garden time for 15 mins</li>
<li>9:00 - 10 min walk</li>
<li>12:00 - 10 min walk</li>
<li>15:30 - 10 min walk</li>
<li>18:00 - 10 min walk </li>
<li>19:00-22:00 as much garden time as he pleases</li>
</ul>

<p>And ofcourse I play with him during the day whenever he offers me a toy or looks bored to me. </p>

<p>However, he seems to not enjoy the walks at all. He doesn't with my parents and he does so even less in this unknown environment.</p>

<p><strong>Should I wake him during his naps to go for a walk he seems to not really enjoy?</strong>
Or does him saying no to the walks suggest he is stimulated enough?</p>

"Is a 3-4 Month Puppy Too Young to Start Using a Gentle Leader?","<p>I have a 14-week old Shepherd mix puppy who definitely pulls on his leash when we walk, but that's as to be expected at this age, so that's actually not why I was thinking about getting him a <a href=""https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00074L4O0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gentle leader</a>.</p>

<p>He's got a bigger problem of eating literally anything loose on the ground; I'm attempting to train him out of it but that's obviously going to take some time. While that's happening, I was thinking about getting a gentle leader attached to a harness just to gently keep his head up. But I obviously don't want to do anything that would hurt him or cause any future problems so I wanted to see if this was a good idea in general -- and if it's not, if it's something with regards to his young age or not?</p>

"What is wrong with my betta fish? Fin rot? Velvet?","<p>In the picture submitted you can clearly see a healthy betta fish in the top 3 pictures. Those pictures are from May 2017 when he was first brought home from the pet store. The bottom 3 pictures are from last night.</p>

<p>This is a betta fish. I wasn't aware of the type of care that these fish truly need. I did however do weekly 100% water changes adding conditioner to the water each time. I fed him 2x every day. He was active sometimes but preferred to stay in some artificial plants found in the tank. Last night I changed the water and that's when I noticed something was truly wrong. After I put him in the tank it stayed at the surface and I could see a clear struggle to breathe. Or as you can see in the pictures, it sunk to the bottom and stayed there for a while. I tried feeding it but it would not move. It did not even acknowledge the food.
I am ashamed to admit that I have yet to get a kit to test these values so I am unaware.</p>

<p>Currently it is in a 1.5 gallon tank. This tank has been set up since May 14 2017. I do not have a filter. Again, I've been misinformed about the care that these fish need. I read online that if you do weekly 100% water changes you do not need a filter.</p>

<p>There is only 1 fish in the tank. I've had this fish for about 4 months</p>

<p>I have added a new betta hammock last night. Also, I added a heater about a week ago. I also noticed that <a href=""https://www.chewy.com/aqueon-betta-bowl-plus-water/dp/130982?utm_source=google-product&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=f&amp;utm_content=Aqueon&amp;utm_term=&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8suZoZmT1gIVm7XACh2R3wpYEAQYAyABEgIhM_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this new conditioner</a> that I bought has white flakes in it?

"What's the Difference Between Pulling Back on Leash and Stopping?","<p>There's one thing about leash training that I can't quite wrap my head around regardless of how many of these I read:</p>

<p>If your dog is pulling ahead of you on their leash, the advice is always never to pull back, which makes sense. But does this include just stopping in your tracks? Isn't that automatically creating tension even though I'm not moving/pulling that will still cause him to instinctually pull against?</p>

<p>My puppy definitely walks with the leash pulled tight especially if he sees something and I'd like to have him walk with slack but don't want to stop walking if that's not what I'm supposed to do because it obviously still creates leash tension.</p>

I was looking for its mother but I wasn't able to find her. It was getting late so (this was probably a bad idea but I really had no idea what to do) I took her to my house and took care of her for a bit.

"Should I get my baby cottontail rabbit who is extremely domesticated neutered?","<p>I know it is very risky to get a rabbit neutered.  My baby is wild but acts very domesticated.   He has his own bedroom and it is right next to my bedroom. He gets loads of attention and lots of handling. I love him very very very much and he knows this. He is given many treats, much talking to, much brushing and very very very much love . He does not spray, he very rarely bites and he allows me to handle him as much as any other rabbit woman. He is extremely loving and friendly and very comical. I don't see a reason to get him neutered since his behavior is wonderful just the way it is.  I am nervous that the risk involved in getting him neutered is not worth it since I have no behavioral problems with him. If I do not have him neutered will this greatly increase his chances of getting cancer?  I know that is that way in dogs and cats because I am very experienced in having all different types of animals and I have my whole life. I believe in neutering all of my animals but I know is extremely risky in neutering rabbits, especially a wild rabbit and I'm not comfortable taking the risk. What are your thoughts? </p>

  <p>Additionally, cats living with someone who vapes are exposed to the second-hand aerosols from the vapor that is exhaled into the air. These particles may also settle into household dust. As cats come in contact with the particles, they will ingest them via grooming themselves.</p>

"How do you socialize a bunny that has been locked in a cage for many years with very little socialization?","<p>My grandma has had an unwanted bunny for about 4 years now. He is very skittish and not friendly because he has never been socialized. I was wondering if there's still hope for him and if he can be socialized so he can be let out of his cage more often and actually be able to enjoy it. Currently, my grandma says she only lets him out when she cleans his cage and she puts him into a hallway that is blocked off with a gate so he can't get out. When he is put into the blocked off hallway he often just sits in the corner regardless of someone is in there with him or not. He also kicks a lot if you try to pick him up to be put back into his cage. Is there anyway we can try to socialize him? Does anyone know any rescues that may take him if we can't?</p>

"Dog charges at other dogs","<p>I have a Boston terrier, female, 2 years old. We've been socializing her ever since she's been a puppy and she's generally well behaved. She sometimes tends to be stubborn, but is a good dog overall.</p>

<p>However, there is one type of behavior that I would really like to correct with her: when we are outside, leashed or not, and she sees another dog, regardless of the sex, size, or breed, at first she freezes and looks at a dog for about 10 seconds, and then charges like mad (she is really, I mean really, fast dog). If the other dog is big, it let's her come and she usually just runs past it and then makes a full circle only to make another go. But, if the other dog is small or has low confidence, it reads it as an attack and gets defensive, and the dog owner almost always reads it as my dog being aggressive.</p>

<p>It feels like she is <strong>super</strong> excited when she sees another dog. And whilst this may appear as an cheerful character, it is actually quite burdening. Has anyone had any experience on this subject? How do I explain my dog to take it down a notch?</p>

"What are the ways to help my cats feel better during a heatwave?","<p>Recently, the majority of UK was hit with heatwaves, and as I am writing this, it's a flaming 90 F/ 32 C. Comparisons aside, it is the hottest it has been in the past few years, for London.</p>

Overall, my cats seem to be slightly affected by the heat, as seen from them constantly lying down stretched out as much as it's possible for them, in shady areas. We don't let them go outside due to living next to an active road.</p>

<p>Last night, my mother gave us wet mini towels to cool our bodies down during the night, so that we can sleep comfortably etc etc (she didn't give the towels to cats, to clarify. We have other family members as well). Today, I came up with an idea to put a moist towel on my cat's belly, while she was 'sunbathing' in front of the window. She seemed very grateful, started purring, nudging my hand with her nose, so I assumed I did a good thing for her. She then fell asleep. She is currently still sleeping.</p>

I have 90WX30dX40h tank, which is filled with semi small and big grit, with height of around 2 or 3 centimeter. small filter inside tank that contains nothing special, soon will add a hanging on small filter, which may fill some part of it with bacterial things(which i don't now about), and remove one sheet of active coil due to that.</p>

<p>Ok back to aquarium soil... first... is this alone enough for aquarium? i didn't find any tutorial, or one that i find and randomly it was also in stackexchange, it used too many special word, which is unknown for me, made it very hard, second, i have very low budget and aquarium stuff are very expensive toward my earning.
Ok so the question are:
1. It says for typical 60CM tank (57L) recommanded usage is 8~11, so my tank recommendation should be around 15~20, but the package says it's one litre (first i filled most of the tank with grit and i have low budget), so does this enough for not too many plant (i mean buy providing requirment, not keeping the root of plants)?
2.can it fill the cover the floor(90X30) how many more do i need to reach the need(due low budget), not recommendation? 
3.do i need to use any thing else beside it (hope fully non expensive stuff)? 
4.does it hurt for fish or snail?
5.where should it be? below or top of grit?
6.it says it help bacteries, but does it provide a place for them to live or i still need other things for that(and again below or on top?)
7.i have two big and a very small air stone, which i put them at the very buttom, and i like to hide them, does they hurt these soil? the package seem to be wet inside and have steam on it.</p>

"Are Shiba Inus a good first dog?","<p>I realize that this question may be a bit open ended, but the follow up question is not. </p>

<p>I have never owned a dog before, but almost everyone I know has one. Until recently I've had no desire to get one until I saw a Shiba Inu a while back. With further research about the breed, I've quickly found out that they cannot be off leash (for the most part), are somewhat independent, and issuing commands to them may be difficult. These seem like deal breakers, but are they?</p>

<p>I want a dog in which will be my buddy instead of getting easily bored, and one in which will not attempt to compete for leader/not listen to me, as they are very intelligent. I've also seen that they are much like cats (one of which I own), and can be independent. The also don't like being touched which may become difficult. Despite the fact that I'd follow all leash laws, it remains that I'd want to have some time with it off to play/fetch. As I live in an apartment building with no enclosed yard, this seems difficult.</p>

<p>With more research I believe that I like Spitz dogs, such as <a href=""http://www.shikoku-ken.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/sesame_shikoku_ken3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, <a href=""http://petmapz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kishu-Ken.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> and <a href=""http://animalia-life.com/image.php?pic=/data_images/finnish-spitz/finnish-spitz7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, however, many of the dogs I've looked at seem to be difficult to handle.

"Why is my new adult male dog compulsively marking and humping the air?","<p>Background: Got this guy today from a local shelter. A 6 year old un-neutered male teacup chihuahua mix (I think a Jack-chi). Adding him to a household with two other dogs, a 1-2 year old female teacup chihuahua, and a 4 month old male teacup Chi-winnie. All being crate-trained.</p>

<p>The problem: </p>

<p>1) Whenever the new guy is handled, urine leaks out of his penis, he gets an erection, and starts an involuntary-looking humping/masturbating motion. Even petting his back.</p>

<p>2) Whenever he's outside, he compulsively lifts each leg, one after another, urinating until nothing comes out, then keeps on doing it, and keeps on doing it, etc. On a walk around the block he wanted to stop every two feet to do it. And something about it seems involuntary, certainly not aggressive, as he's the most timid little guy. </p>

<p>The two things above really amount to the guy being totally disfunctional. What's going on, and will having him neutered next week fix this?</p>

<p>Note - We haven't had him meet the female yet, though their crates are nearby. We had the two males meet outside the house and surprisingly they got on well. But within a minute, the new guy was lifting his leg dripping everywhere, and then came the erection and the contortions/humping.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Forgot to add this possibly important detail. It seems he's been living the last year at the shelter...underneath the friggin' front desk with a bunch other little dogs. (?!)</p>

The adoption period of waiting the 12 weeks for her (to come of 12-weeks of age) was absolute hell in anticipation and but it was definitely worth it.</p>

<p>I've had her for three weeks and she's amazing. We go on car trips together, to the park, I play with her constantly, etc. And of course, other than the money, vet fees, and playing with her at least 2-3 hours a day after work (she has so much energy!), I've spent an earnest 50+ hours from before I had adopted her (in making my decision), waiting for her to come of age, and even once I got her in research. From dieting to play, to psychology and positive reinforcement- I've researched it all to be the best pet-parent possible.</p>

<p>A few days ago, I dropped her off at my grandparents so that they could take care of her while I pack my apartment up. There's going to be a lot of heavy lifting and coming in-and-out of the apartment, so it really wasn't the best place for a playful kitten to be around. Now, I've taken her to the house a few times already so she's familiar with them and my family. I also wanted her to get adjusted because I'm actually going to rent a room from my grandparents because it's mutually beneficial (I save money to pay off school loans and they get a sizable rent check for one room); just for a year or so.</p>

<p>Well, in the few days that I've been away, my grandparents have absolutely fallen in love with her. Which I'm glad! Except... it's been all fine-and-dandy but I'm a bit taken back by some of the things my grandmother has said. </p>

<p>First, let me preface that one should get the stereotype of typical old people out of their mind ASAP. These are young folks who play Pokemon Go, watch my nephew on the daily, and are always out and about. So it's not like they sit at home ""bored"". My grandmother has wanted a pet for YEARS and my grandfather has sternly said no because he didn't want to clean up after it. My cat is okay in his book because it's not his problem (aka mess). Additionally, while my grandmother is the sweetest person I've ever met, she's also very... manipulative? cunning? She convinces my grandfather year after year to spend thousands on new iPads, iPhones, fancy vacations, etc. She get's what she wants and I've seen her pull some shady tactics to do so. A pet is the <em>only</em> thing she's wanted over the years that she hasn't gotten.</p>

<p>So, here's where my story comes in: in the few days that I've been gone, she's sent me tons of texts about how much my grandfather loves the cat and how much bonding time they've had. She's sent me 18 pictures and only <em>one</em> has been of my cat alone. The rest are of my kitten cuddling on my grandfather's bare chest in bed in the morning or my kitten cuddling with my grandmother.</p>

<p>Then today, as my grandparents are leaving for vacation and I'm heading back home, my grandmother and I have this texting conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grandma: I will miss her. Ha</p>
  
  <p>Me: Yeah, she's such a cuddle bug.</p>
  
  <p>Grandma: She likes to join you when going to the bathroom. Ha.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I'm thinking in my head uhhhh TMI? I don't want to think of my precious, innocent kitten sitting with my grandma while she takes a dump lol)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Is grandpa all packed yet?</p>
  
  <p>Grandma: Ha yep</p>
  
  <p>Me: He just didn't want to leave the kitty :P</p>
  
  <p>Grandma: Probably. He is pretty smitten by her</p>
  
  <p>Me: Poor guy is gonna have his heart broken when I take move out :P</p>
  
  <p>Grandma: No cause she is staying. Ha ha</p>
  
  <p>Me: Haha nooooope. She was too expensive lol</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(As a male, I can't admit that I love her to death so I make a financial joke instead)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grandma: No, she's our Christmas give from you. ha ha</p>
  
  <p>Me: Maybe I'll get you one of your own but she's mine! lol</p>
  
  <p>Grandma: But we love her!</p>
  
  <p>Me: So do I!</p>
  
  <p>Grandma: But you left her. Ha</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(This is where I felt I was either being jealous or sensitive. This isn't a funny joke to me. I left her for a FEW days so I could pack my apartment without my kitten getting hurt/in the way and I had mentioned a few times to my grandmother that I felt so guilty for leaving my kitten and really missed her. ""But you left her"".. I just don't find that funny but actually mean)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Me: Well she goes back in my room when I get back :O</p>
  
  <p>Grandma: We will see... Ha ha</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I being too sensitive? I feel like she is passively aggressively trying to take my cat or implying that they she wants my cat. I have a feeling this may present issues when I move in, such as them feeding my cat treats whenever or acting like she's theirs. I understand a good argument is ""their house, their rules"" so to suck it up, except I paying good money for rent.</p>

<p>Am I okay feeling like the ""But you left her"" and ""We will see"" line is a bit too much?</p>

"Why would a pet run away?","<p>A few hours ago Diamond, my pet parrot (Bronze Winged Pionus, nearly 2 years old) bolted out the front door.  I say ""ran away"" because he wasn't lost or spooked, but appears to have deliberately <em>left</em> in a very uncharacteristic action.</p>

<p>I know intelligent pets, of any species, can do that. Cats are nomadic by nature and it's no mystery that one might just feel like moving on. Dogs are territorial and strongly attached to the home and the family. When I was a child my dog sometimes got loose but it's more like she just wanted to stay out or run around more than I did, not ever going <em>away</em>.  My sister had one dog that would get loose at any opportunity but was interested in roaming the neighborhood and was once caught (by the pound dog catcher) next door.  Hey, the fact that a job called ""dog catcher"" even exists is suggestive.</p>

<p>Diamond, a parrot, lives in the house and never goes outside. He tends to keep to a few comfortable areas and doesn't just hang out or explore just anywhere: his habitat in the kitchen, the back of one couch, and a laundry drying rack (also in the kitchen). He'll sit on my shoulder, but doesn't like to join me upstairs in my home office.  He never mooches or grabs food from somewhere even if plainly visible.  But, flying a lap around the connected rooms downstairs is how he indicates that he wants food (or something different from what's already in his dish). I thought maybe it's instinctive in meaning that flying away from a food-depleted area to some fresh ground is a natural meaning to coordinate the flock.  But, he only does that in front of me (or my wife), not whe I'm upstairs. He is getting attention by buzzing us, not getting the urge to go somewhere.  (When we're not downstairs he will <em>call</em> for attention).</p>

<p>So what would posess him to just fly out the door? That is so not like him!  My wife was coming upmthe walk with groceries and I opened it just as she got on the porch. Diamond was in his ""castle"", his primary safe place, and he just up and <em>whoosh</em>.  I thought he must be coming to one of us, but he flew over and past her, not targeting her.  Then I thought he must be <em>just</em> outside, scared of a strange situation: but he was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Why would a in-house pet just up and leave, against everything in his usual behavioral patterns?</p>

"How to react to dog on dog violence?","<p>We have 2 dogs at home: a small 35 lb 6 year-old female hound mix and a 75 lb 4 year-old female pit bull mix. The pit will lash out at the hound so violently that she will force the hound to gasp for air, yelp in pain and often rips away parts of the hound's skin around the neck.</p>

<p>The pit was never mistreated as we got her from a loving home when she was about 6 months old. The hound was a shelter rescue, but has always been very friendly and highly social.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>How should my wife and I respond to this? I used to just let it go, but there was frequently blood drawn and I began to fear for the safety of the hound. It's gotten to the point where it is obvious that the pit means to inflict damage to the hound and I have to physically separate them. It usually takes putting the pit in a chokehold, wrapping my legs around her body and putting enough of my body weight on top of her to force her flat and prevent her from being able to rip away the hound.</p>

<p>When she's not being aggressive, she's very playful and sweet. I have noticed that she responds negatively towards the hound upon waking the pit up, the pit being accidentally injured at play - stepping on a foot or tail, if they happen to cross paths near the garbage can, if we pet the pit while she's eating and after she gets verbally scolded.</p>

<p>We are planning on having children soon and are worried about how the pit will respond to a baby. We don't want to give the pit away, but maybe she needs a different environment to thrive?</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, but thanks for your time.</p>

"How do I get my cats to stop being territorial towards my rabbit?","<p>I've had two indoor cats for years and a few months ago I adopted a Holland lop rabbit. The transition for the cats has been fairly easy because we kept the bunny penned up unless we were around to keep an eye on things. About a week ago, the cats started to misbehave, and I realized that all of the events have been happening around the bunny's pen. They've started peeing in things around the bunny's cage (like their cat bed, my schoolbag, any shoes we keep lying around), and last night when we opened up the bunny's pen I caught one of them trying to use the bunny's litter box.</p>

<p>I know that change is difficult for cats, but we didn't have any problems until about a week ago. The cats haven't acted aggressive towards the rabbit at all (in fact, one of the cats runs away from the bunny), but I think they feel like the bunny is invading their territory which is why they think they need to mark the house around the bunny cage. How can I get them to stop?? I can't keep the rabbit penned up all day, but I don't want the cats to feel like I'm replacing them. Any advice would be appreciated.</p>

"Laser pointer: does a no-win situation risk psychological harm to cats?","<p>When using a laser pointer to play with the cats, I've always been careful to end the session by giving them a physical toy to play with.  I've assumed, without any actual basis, that putting them in a no-win situation where they could never actually catch the bait would lead to frustration or possibly aggression.</p>

<p>But I've noticed something: my cats are <em>on</em> to this trick, and they love it anyway.  When it's time for play, one of them in particular will run to the table where I keep the laser pointer and look at me expectantly.  He watches me pick it up and turn it on, and he switches between watching the dot and watching my hand.  When the session ends he's become less and less interested in a physical toy to replace the red dot.</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with pure laser-pointer play?  If I skip the part where I try to transition to a physical toy, am I likely to have behavioral problems later?</p>

<p>The cats are middle-aged indoor-only neutered males.  They also enjoy thing-on-a-string toys but lose interest more quickly than with the laser pointer.  They run away from the battery-powered ball.  All other toys are cat-powered (e.g. batting a toy around the floor).</p>

"A Kitty fell down to a hole in alley, Please help me with your ideas to get him out!","<p>I was just sitting in my room and my aunt told me there's a kitty cat right on a small hole in the middle of the alley trying to get out but when i went to get him out a car was just passed and it made him fall in there...</p>

<p>I really hurried but the damn car was already passed and the cat was fallen, i looked in the hole with my phone's flashlight and it seems like maybe 6~10meters under ground and i think its dry in there. (but i think its wastewater, i don't know!)</p>

<p>I don't know the right english word for it but there's a door to the ground (!) like a round circle disk... it looks kind of plumbed and clunged, i don't know if these are the right words i'm just searching them from the dictionary!</p>

<p>So what should i do? i really feel bad!
I know my aunt should've get him out herself, but ""she's afraid of cats"" ! what's there to be afraid of especially when he's life is in danger!?
And trust me, in a city/country where there's no animal control and there are holes in the middle of ground; the 911/fire departement don't care about a cat! so no hopes from them!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I just looked in the hole again with my phone's light and i saw him standing looking at the ground like the how most animal do when they're looking for food i guess! he wasn't that much small but he wasn't an adult cat either.</p>

<p>So now i'm sure that its dry down there and there was some garbage...</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I called the fire departement and the person who answered said call tommorow morning in daylight we can't come now for such problem and its dark now... (its 12:40 PM here) i just hope he survives it down there and they come tommorow.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> I called them again and they said this kind of problem isn't something we can do something about! and if you're really feeling bad and pity about him you can try sending a cotton rope in there and when he grabed it pull him up... I think i'm gonna try this!</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:</strong> I just used a Laser and a flashlight again and i saw him again so i rushed back in to home and told people to come and see him but when they came he wasn't there! maybe the laser light scared him away! Are they scared of laser light? should i not use the laser again? </p>

<p>I read in an article in wikihow that a laser light (dot) can make a cat on a tree to follow the dot and get out of the tree thats why i used the laser... </p>

<p>Fortunately even though they didn't see the cat it made them believe me and understand the cat is really down there, so my aunt called a pet doctor she knew and he said if you're really sure the cat is down there alive, I know a group that will risk their life to come and save him. I'll keep this topic updated...</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:</strong> So two man came and they really looked in the hole with a better flashlight they had and the other one even tied his phone to a wire and wraped it with a tape... and send his phone down there while it was recording and it's flashlight was on, but the recorded video didn't really had a perfect quality (it wasn't bad though, just not perfect) and we didn't see the cat in the video but we saw that it seems like this hole was connected to another one like this was a stair to another level of ground... </p>

<p>But before they came my cousin said he saw the cat! so thankfully there's lower doubts and we know he's still alive. The man tried talking to the cat i don't know how to say this in english, he was like making kissing sounds and stuff like that to make the cat come to us... He said the cat can't grab this rope and we need fabric so we clew some old clothes and send them down there and he said let this be in there so if he sees it he grabs it and climbs up... i'm not gonna sleep tonight to keep checking... wish/pray us luck guys!</p>

"Economics of single-parenting a dog (i.e. daycare options)","<p>A few months ago I got an Alaskan Husky puppy with my girlfriend, which we were planning to raise in part as a test of our ability to have a child together.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, things didn't pan out the way we planned. We broke up, and while the ex-girlfriend initially took the puppy with her, after several weeks she determined that she can't keep up with the puppy's energy and the puppy and I get along together way better than she did with it anyway.</p>

<p>I love the puppy to death and there'd be no problem, except that: </p>

<ol>
<li>I work from 8am - 6pm every weekday</li>
<li>My home is small and I do not have a fenced in yard</li>
</ol>

<p>This is only an issue in terms of daycare -- meaning <a href=""https://app.whistle.com/s/boor0e"">I have no problem getting her the exercise she needs</a> and whenever I'm not at work I greatly enjoy watching her. However, daycare seems to be an impossible-to-solve issue.</p>

<p>I've been asking around at the dog park and is seems that the major dog daycare facility in my area (which is Baltimore, MD and Columbia, MD) is called ""<a href=""http://staypetresort.com"">Stay Pet Resort</a>"". They open early enough and close late enough that it work work for me, and I could get over the extra hour a day I'd spend commuting, however the cost of a monthly pass is <strong><a href=""http://staypetresort.com/daycare/"">$550/mo</a></strong>.

<ol>

<li><code>Is this a normal/reasonable cost of daycare per month?</code></li>

<p>The problem is that the younger cat likes to hunt the older one and corner her.  He sometimes slaps her when she's walking near him.  When she's cornered, she starts to hiss and growl.  Frequently, this ""game"" becomes dangerous if I do not stop them.  When I come back home from work, I often see scratches on the noses or eyelids of both cats.  They fight this way several times a day.</p>

<p>We've already tried Feliway (more than once), spray water, and confinement. Nothing works.  It's been a year since this started, and the behavior is the same.  I read ""<a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/266/how-to-get-cats-to-coexist-in-peace?lq=1"">How to get cats to coexist in peace?</a>"", and tried the suggestions.  When I leave home in the morning, I move each cat to a separate room, with a door separating them.  We've been doing this for two months, and still no success: when we leave them free with minor supervision, they eventually start ""playing"" again.</p>

<p>They have a lot of toys in the house. They have cardboard castles with holes, and I play with them every day, with toys (including a kinder surprise inside egg); we try to give them variety.</p>

<p>I do not know if the younger cat is acting aggressively due to jealousy, a mean streak, or is just simply being playful.  I'm scared because of the scratches, and I fear that any day one of the cats will lose an eye or worse.  </p>

<p>How can we handle this situation?</p>

"How to rescue cat from high perch","<p>I have two cats that can't seem to come down from their high (~20') perches inside a wooden barn.  How can I get them down?</p>

<p>The frame of the barn consists of large (~12x12 inch) vertical and horizontal beams.  The vertical beams are spaced at about four feet.  Over the last few days, they've worked their way up near the top.</p>

<p>I'm not certain they haven't been down, since I have another (ground based) cat running around, but the overall food consumption indicates they have not been eating and their positions haven't changed for over 24 hours now.</p>

<p>Recently, I put boards near their perches that lead to a lower levels.  And I've put food on those boards, about 1-3 feet below their current positions.</p>

<p>My ladders will reach anywhere but I'm afraid I could knock them down if I try to grab them.  I've recently put food about one foot below one of them and about three feet below the other.</p>

<p>Background:
I recently adopted/rescued/?? three feral cats from a county sponsored program (chipped/snipped/clipped).  I didn't expect them to be very friendly, but two are terrified of people.  The terrestrial cat is quite social as long as you don't try to touch him.  After the prescribed three weeks in crates in the barn, I released them.  The two immediately started climbing the walls.  The other tries desperately to get stepped on.</p>

<p>Update:  I placed food and water right next to them and they have both eaten a little.  One is looking better and getting around some (still staying 12+ feet up).  The other still seems a little lethargic but has moved to a less precarious position.  I feel like can manage it now.  I think they went about three days without food or water.
So in the end, I think both answers I received were important.  I gave them an easy way to get down via boards at a reasonable slope, and I put food right next to them, which I've subsequently moved a little further away.  It may be a while before they get to the ground again, but I think we'll get there eventually.</p>

<p>Another Update: It turns out that the terrestrial cat is quite territorial and would not allow the others near the ground.  Moved him to a different part of the barn and one of the high-up cats started coming down to visit.  But he would chase the other high-up if she came down lower.  It's a mess.</p>

<p>I noticed more than once that when listening to music on a computer with speakers, my cat approached and stayed close to the speakers.

"guppie male harassing females","<p><em>Background</em></p>

<p>I have 2 female guppies in a ~60 L planted aquarium, temperature ~25 deg C, internal filter, relatively hard (but not too hard) water. They've been on a diet of standard flakes. Change about 1/3 water every 1-2 weeks. Until recently they shared the aquarium with a male, all adults. There were another 3 females and another male prior to that. The females were placed into the aquarium about 2 months ago, the males maybe a month after that. One by one fish have been dying. The first to die was a female which looked to have a small white blotch, something I did not notice at the store. Another two females and one of the males died shortly after after losing weight, not always showing clear signs of the culprit disease ( I assume water conditions and food were ok). I don't know the age of the fish, but the females are/were pregnant when purchased. </p>

<p><em>Question</em> </p>

<p>Despite his small size, the surviving male had been harassing the females, following them and biting them at every opportunity. After the latest casualty of unknown cause I concluded that the stress of being chased may have been a contributing factor to the deterioration of the other fishes health, so I decided to remove the male to another container. Because some of the fish clearly suffered of some disease I presumably cannot blame the male entirely. In addition, I noticed that a fry had been born, and wished to minimize the chance of cannibalism. </p>

<p>What has me a bit puzzled is that now that the females are not engaged in flight behavior, as they are not being chased, they seem to forage more, and I fear that they might instead now cannibalize the fry. This has left me wondering what strategy the male was pursuing in chasing the females? Might the harrasment actually serve to protect the fry? I doubt that this is the males progeny as the females were already pregnant, so I am assuming the male was simply attempting to destroy the pregnant females together with any eggs or fry within, but I am not entirely sure.</p>

"Resident cat not staying in the house when new kitten is out of safe room","<p>So, we rescued our cat in February and decided to get a kitten 2 weeks ago. We have done everything the internet suggest and kept them separate. The kitten has his own room and our cat the rest of the house. At first our cat reacted badly to his scent and hated going upstairs where he was shut away. She didn't even come up to bed with us, which was unusual because she loves bed time. Over the course of the week she started coming up and stopped reacting badly to his scent and was instead rubbing her cheeks in our hands and started to come to bed again. </p>

<p>We bought a dog cage to put in our living room to put the kitten in to get the cat used to seeing and hearing him. The first couple of times we only left him in with her (under our supervision) for 15mins- half an hour. At first the cat didnt stop growling the whole time the kitten was in the room. We read online that we should show the cat lots of love when the kitten was in sight but we couldnt as she would start to growl more and hiss at us instead. After a week of doing this she got a bit better and could be in the room without growling unless the kitting started meowing. The kitten started to hate the cage so we got a baby gate and did the same thing but through the baby gate. Things started to look better but now our cat will not stay in the house at all. She will come in at night and come to bed when she knows the kitten is shut in his room. But if we are downstairs, even without the kitten she will not stay in.</p>

<p>We aren't too sure how old our female cat is as she was found as a stray - we estimate around 3-5 and she is neutured. The reason we got a kitten was because we had seen her acting nicely with some cats in the street. We understand that taking it slow and going back steps is good. But we can't even get our cat to stay in the house unless it's bedtime. I also understand that it has only been 2 weeks and these things take time however i am just after further advice to see if there is anything we could do to help her. We have also bought some pheromones one upstairs and one downstairs but they dont seem to do much</p>

<p>Is this normal behaviour? Will she ever accept the kitten? Is there anything else we can try? </p>

"Chicken overfeeding therapy for cat?","<p>My cat keeps craving chicken and human food generally. I thought I'd just cook for more people but I read feeding human food to cats is not healthy long term. I don't have time to prepare well balanced meals for cats. </p>

<p>So I thought maybe I could try out a psychological trick, of overfeeding the cat with chicken until she gets sick of it and maybe willingly goes back to cat food after 2 weeks or so. If, as I read, chicken doesn't contain the nutrient the cats need, her organism probably automatically makes her like cat food (I give her usually wet food) more again?</p>

<p>I read also many people say ""don't spoil the cat"", ""teach the cat this and that"" but I feel bad for her, since I myself also can eat what I want, when I want, and if the cat wants to eat chicken why not give her chicken until she doesn't want it anymore? Nature is wise and if this is not enough, the cat should soon want to eat something else.</p>

"Am I feeding my rabbits a balanced diet? If not, how to get there?","<h1>Does feeding need to be corrected? And in which direction(s)?</h1>

<h2>Where I am now:</h2>

<p>I have two rabbits born end of Feb 2016. Siblings, one male (castrated) and one female. They are both small for their age. I got them from a rescue place. The person I got them from said they have a genetic defect whereby they will grow slowly.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks I owned them I learned the muesli style pellets (muesli plus pellets) was not good for them, so I weaned them onto 100% pellets in a week. No problems there.</p>

<p>For the rabbits I provide the following daily amounts combined (not each).</p>

<p>Approx equal volumes of hay and greens. Total volume approx the same as the volume of the rabbits.</p>

<p>The greens comprise approximately equal amounts of nettles, young blackberry runners and dandelion leaves with some white clover in lesser amounts. Once a week I’ll go to the nearby fields and collect a large bag of these, mix them up and store them in the fridge.</p>

<p>70g pellets (recently increased from half that amount). Pellets are <a href=""https://shop.vitakraft.de/emotion-complete-adult-18717.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Vitakraft Emotion</a> - I just realised these are for dwarf rabbits.</p>

<p>4 blackberries - either fresh off the bush, else from the freezer as I froze this year´s glut of blackberries.</p>

<p>1 tablespoon ripe nectarine or apple - fresh or frozen.</p>

<p>A small cucumber cut into 4 pieces lengthwise (usually about 10cm long, diameter 3 - 4cm).</p>

<p>Occasional amounts of any of celery leaves and stalks, lemon basil, peppermint, broccoli leaves, radish tops (all taken from our garden).</p>

<p>They have a 7 square metre circular run I improvised by wrapping 10m of chicken wire round the garden trampoline. It provides both space and shade. I used to move food from their hay rack in their main hutch to this play area, but I have stopped that now. I want them to eat the grass. They will eat grass. But not much during the day. They seem to like grass more if I pull a few strands and feed them through the chicken wire.</p>

<p>They don´t seem to be addicted to the pellets. That is, they will nibble on them and move on but they are usually eaten in 24 hours.</p>

<p>They will eat everything, but the hay only sparingly. So that means everything I give them is eaten, except the hay. I drop in some food in the morning around 07:30, and replenish in the evening, 19:00 to 20:00. In the morning they seem hungry, and know they are going to get their breakfast, but overnight they only eat the greens.</p>

<p>I have tried hay I made myself from fresh meadow plants (which I think is superior to anything I have bought, but only because it is still green :P ), nameless hay from the local supermarket, and I just took delivery of some Timothy Hay, “meadow hay” and also some dried dandelion leaves (intended as a reserve for the winter, provided they eat these).</p>

"Foster dog suddenly violent","<p>We took a foster dog 4 days ago and he's been a bit depressed, not eating nearly enough, no matter what food we give him, but all in all he is very calm and quiet. He's trained and does tricks, not violent even to cats. Slowly he's started to play with us and get close to us.</p>

<p>Hes a mixed shepherd, about 40 kilos, 4 years old and was taken to the dog house a few days before we started to foster him.</p>

<p>Today we took him to a coffee hose (no the first time) and people came up to pet him (not the first time either) and suddenly out of nowhere he attacked them in a violent way we've never seen before. No damage was done but he bit the guy's pant's and made a little bit of a scene.</p>

<p>A few questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any idea why this might happen?</li>
<li>Are we to expect more reactions like this out of nowhere?</li>
<li>How to react to this behavior</li>
<li>Can we see this coming?</li>
<li>More importantly - we were considering adopting him after the foster
time is over and we're having second thoughts, is there any way we
can know if he is dangerous to us?</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now we're a bit scared of him, not because of the reaction itself but because it was so sudden and unexpected.</p>

It even happens during a flash of a camera. I've seen this on a cat and the dog and afterward both stared for a while.</p>

<p>I don't flash lights into my animal's eye on purpose but while finding my way in darkness I need to watch my step. Even when the light falls on their eye they do not turn away or move their head other way they simply stare on. Is it disturbing for them to have the light shine on their eyes? Does this have any effect on their vision or its just a temporary effect which fades (as in humans vision when exposed to a flash)?</p>

"Sit and down at a distance, should I ask someone to be my ""assistant""?","<p>Clicker training and positive reinforcement are my way to go and I think I have a proper understanding of these principles.</p>

<p>However, it is very rare to see tutorials, videos or live training with two people, one being the ""trainer"", the other one being the ""assistant"".</p>

<p>So for example, would we benefit from that while training for sit/down/up/etc. at a distance?</p>

<p>I can imagine letting my dog sniff around while someone keeps him on a loose leash, then I call his name, get his attention and ask him to sit. My dog will most probably come towards me before sitting. Then having someone next to him to prevent him from doing so could be a nice help. I would do that with a dog that already good training with sit/stay at a distance, so that the assistant would just need some gentle leash pressure to stop the dog and wait until he sits.</p>

"What if a cat seems annoyed by her whiskers?","<p>My cat has long whiskers. And she constantly rubs those whiskers on things, like they itch.  I read up a bit, and it says that's just their way of declaring ownership with scent glands and such.</p>

<p>Okay, case closed.  Except it really seems like she's frustrated with the sides of her face.  And if you physically grab her whiskers and just kind of pull on them, she seems more satisfied than annoyed.  Like she's happy you're pulling on them, and if you rub the base of the whiskers she seems even happier.</p>

<p>As a human who finds beards being itchy and wanting to shave, I am wondering about her point of view.  I've read about trimming whiskers being cruel because cats want to use them for knowing how wide their bodies are etc.  But she is clearly having issues with it and I can <em>literally</em> tug on the whiskers and she seems more relieved than annoyed.</p>

<p>Is there any record of overlong whiskers actually annoying a cat?  Has a cat ever seemed happier after a whisker trimming?  The cat hates nail clippings too, but foregoing that meant she cut up her ear scratching it.  Is there something foundational about whiskers where it is not something you should ever worry about because <em>""they are supposed to be as long as they are due to cat science""</em> ?</p>

He last saw the vet two months ago and all was in order then, and I haven't observed any other behavior changes or suspicious symptoms.  We've made no (known) changes in his environment (indoor cat) or diet.  He has toys to chew and otherwise play with (that he likes), and I try to make sure he gets enough interactive play time.</p>

He's been to the vet since I asked this question and the vet found no problems in his mouth or his bloodwork.

<p>I bought a new shag like carpet for the living room. It's beautiful. It adds color, my toddler loves it, it's soft...and my cat wants to pee on it. Not a specific corner, he's tried all over it (it's 5' x 7'). He looks right at me and squats down. I've only not stopped him once. I haven't seen him use the litter box since I first caught him, but there aren't other random places being used and it's not somewhere I would know for sure (I have two cats so it's been used but could just be my other kitty who I have seen). He hasn't tried to urinate on the carpet when the door is open to the outside, only when he's trapped in, but it's getting colder and I can't leave it open forever soon. </p>

<p>I took him to the vet - no medical issues they could find. </p>

<p>I don't want to get rid of this carpet. I love my cat more obviously but I also can't have him urinating in the middle of the living room where my two year old plays. </p>

<p>Is it the texture? We've never had a shaggy carpet before. Is there a way to get him to stop? Do I just need to give up my beautiful rug?</p>

"Is cheap human food for street dogs good for their health?","<p>I live in a place where there are lots of stray dogs. The number is quite high. I try to feed most of them but they are a lot in number.
I'm a minor and do not earn much, so I feed them some cheap food but it's not at all bad food and it's only one thing most of the time, <a href=""http://foodnetindia.in/parle-g/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">biscuits</a>. They can hardly get hold of food like this.</p>

<p>I have some friends that help but they are also minors and cannot afford quality food because their parents and ours don't agree. It's okay. They help us to get doctors when there's a serious problem but not for everyday food.</p>

<p>We collect money and buy these biscuits in bulk.</p>

<p>There's been a rumor going around too that these things damage the dog's liver system. I don't know if that's true or not.</p>

"Two pet cats suddenly fight","<p>I have had two cats, 4 years old, that I raised from kittens. One boy, one girl. They've tolerated each other and can sometimes be seen sitting on the same perch together. They have their moments of ""UGH I hate you!"" and bat at each other and yell, but what they did this morning was so different. </p>

<p>They puffed up, screamed, and fought light two absolutely feral cats on the street. I had to leave for work, but I'm not convinced I'll be going home to living cats. </p>

<p>Could a feral animal outside set one cat off? My girl cat was at the window when I heard the commotion. I went over to check it out and she had flown into a fit which, I assume, made my boy cat panic and then they went at it. I was definitely caught in the cross fire trying to pull them apart. I was definitely panicking, which I know doesn't help the situation, but I wasn't sure what to do. By the time I left for work, they were under different pieces of furniture yelling and hissing at each other. </p>

<p>I spoke to them calmly and could pet the boy cat, but the girl cat was still completely nuts. They were both wholly different cats I'd never seen before. I've seen cats fight. I've seen my cats fight. I have never seen aggression like this <em>ever</em>. </p>

<p>What would have caused this? Will they get over it? Is there anything I can do to help mitigate cat fights like this, without sacrificing my own skin? Would it be best to leave them alone for the day to figure things out? </p>

"Goldendoodle puppy outsmarting us for going outside / coming in?","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>So we have a Goldendoodle that is about 8 months old now and has learned many things so far. She knows that if she goes to our side door, we will open it, and she gets to go to our fenced in yard to goto the bathroom.  When she wants to come in she does the reverse, where she goes to the door and barks a few times to be let in. This is great so far!</p>

<p><strong>First Problem</strong></p>

<p>This part is good for bathroom training but she also realizes that outside = play as well so she will constantly go by the door and bark many times a day to go play outside. The actual play itself isn't really a bad thing but more of an annoyance that she will go there so often. We can usually tell based on when she eats or drinks if she truly needs to go out for bathroom or just wants to play. If ignored at the door she will eventually go find something else to do inside.  </p>

<p>So how can we curb this so she still goes to the door when needing to goto the bathroom but not constantly all the time? Is it bad that we ignore her whens he goes there if it is just for play?</p>

<p><strong>Second Problem</strong> </p>

<p>For the same process, if we want her to come inside (like if we are heading out or something else) we will call her name followed by ""Come"". She will come to the door and sit at the bottom (which drives me nuts). We have tried using high value treats to get her to come up the stairs which works about 50% of the time but now I think she may be waiting a the steps because she knows if she waits there, she will get a treat to come up. We do give her treats when she comes in by herself as well to try and show that she gets it either way for coming in. So I feel like she is a very smart dog here and am unsure how to get her to come in more consistently so does anybody have any suggestions?</p>

"training middle-aged cat to excrete outside","<p><strong>summary:</strong> ~10-year-old female has been venturing outside for several months, after (per unverified claim) having been an indoor-only cat. She will come inside to excrete (urinate, defecate), then go back outside. How to train her to excrete outside?</p>

<p><strong>details:</strong></p>

<p>I have lots cat experience, but have never hosted a cat who was able to go outside but would not also ""go"" outside.</p>

<p>In April 2018, my mother got a cat from the local pound. (I do most of the catcare as part of eldercare.) The pound folk said the cat was 9 years old, had been indoor-only, and been declawed (front only) by her previous owners (as well as spayed). She was also definitely box-trained (very quickly taking over the local box), but has some non-standard excretion behaviors:</p>

<ol>
<li>She will occasionally urinate (though not, fortunately, defecate) in the bathtub. This doesn't bother me--in fact, I prefer it, since it just goes down the drain without using up cat litter. (FWIW, she will not urinate in the adjacent shower stall, though she will go in there and look/sniff around.)</li>
<li>She will not excrete outside: in fact, she will go out (unfortunately requiring someone to hold the catdoor (or another door) open--but that's a topic for another question), then come back in (which she usually does herself--i.e., she readily opens the catdoor from the outside but not the inside), excrete in litterbox or bathtub, then go back outside.</li>
</ol>

<p>How to convince her to excrete outside?</p>

<p>Some additional data which may be relevant (or not):</p>

<ul>
<li>She's the only cat in the house, and possibly the only cat in the neighborhood, though I occasionally see/hear evidence of ferals.</li>
<li>Fear does not seem to be a factor, as she readily goes out and sniffs around, or sometimes just sits outside and watches. (She's not much of a hunter--having caught only 1 of the abundant local pocket mice, of which one of her predecessors caught at least 1 a day--but when one of the local rabbits ambles by, she and the rabbit will sit and stare at each other for amazingly extended periods.)</li>
<li>I currently let her go outside only during (or just before/after) daylight  due to her inability to climb. She very much likes to go out at daybreak and nightfall, and would probably go out later at night if allowed.</li>
<li>She has never, in my experience, gone farther than ~20 m from the house. This is not due to frailty--she's quite fast, and an excellent jumper, for a cat of her age and (rather small) size--but she's just not an exploring cat at present.</li>
</ul>

"Cat diet success vs unhealthy weight loss, how do I determine a healthy target weight?","<p>I have a cat, domestic long hair, ragamuffin mix, male, 15 years old and in good health (bloodwork last month was stellar, and he doesn't act a day over 8), but I am concerned about his weight.</p>

<p>His weight has always been in the 13-14 lb range. He is a relatively large cat and also was a bit chunky on his underside. For years I fed him 4/3 cup dry food per day split morning and night.</p>

<p>In August 2014 he weighed in at 14.7 lbs and I decided to put him on a bit of a diet and started feeding him for a 12lb target weight, 1 cup per day split, Iams pro health senior dry food.</p>

<p>In August 2015 he was at 13.1 and much more active, so I changed nothing.</p>

<p>This month, August 2016 he was at a startling 10.1 lbs. He is as active as ever and like I said clean bill of health but I am slightly concerned. Vet does not seem concerned, and 10.1 lbs is normal for a Cat (TM) so it's hard to judge. I can't tell if this is bad, or if it is healthy, because I'm used to him being heavy.</p>

<p>Also it's hard to judge because I just shaved him, so he looks about half the size he usually does. Fwiw he does not look boney to me, at least, I can't see his ribs at all. He's got a bit of loose skin on his belly where his fat used to be.</p>

<p>For now, I have added 2.5 oz wet food in the morning to his normal daily 1 cup of dry food (his stool was slightly dry, although he was not constipated, that was his only issue).</p>

<p>One of my mistakes is I don't own a scale, I'm going to start monitoring monthly. But my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>This seems sudden and was definitely unexpected, is it something I should be concerned about?</li>
<li><strong>How do I determine what a healthy target weight is for my cat?</strong> I mean Google gives a range for the ""average"" weight of ""a cat"" but there's too much variation to just pick a number. How can I judge what a stable healthy weight for a given specific cat should be? How do I know when to increase / decrease food portions?</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize this question may be all over the place, what I'm really asking about is how to figure out what weight is healthy for any cat, based on observations of their health and activity (I have another 2 year old too and I suspect I'm going to have to watch her weight as well some day).</p>

"Male cat keeps trying to mate with female kittens","<p>Our story starts around a few months ago when a female cat gave birth to a 4 kittens in our backyard. At the time we didn't know what to do so we called RSPCA and asked them what we should do and they told us ""the mother cat will take care of the kittens just leave them alone and they will go away"", however my mother didn't want to leave them alone because she thought they would starve and she started buying food for them and the mother. </p>

<p>When the cats started opening their eyes this orange tomcat that walks around our neighbourhood randomly started coming to us and eating the food, at the time we thought nothing of it. However one day he decided to take one of the kittens overnight, (we know he did it because he was trying to accomplish it all day but we kept stopping him). We ended up thinking that he had eaten the kitten and we thought we could do nothing about it. One month later he comes back and starts to do this thing where he goes on top of the mother cat and bites her neck (mating I assume) However the mother cat doesn't allow him to do this and she usually walks away or fights him off. </p>

<p>Fast forward another month and now he is trying to do the same thing with the KITTENS! WHERE HE BITES THEIR NECK AND JUMPS ON THEIR BACK (again I assume this is mating).Roughly about 2 weeks ago he took another one of the kittens overnight however this one ended up coming back on its own. We always shoo him away. Recently the mother cat has stopped spending less time with her kittens and going away more and sometimes doesn't come back for a few nights
We all assumed this was to get away from the male tomcat. </p>

<p>This morning he came back and started doing the thing where jumps on their back and starts biting the kittens necks again (one of the kittens has gotten to the point where the fur has started falling off and you can see some of his skin on his neck which is really disturbing and worrying). The mother cat has gotten to the point where she always runs away when she sees the tomcat and doesn't come back for a bit</p>

<p>We are really worried for the kittens and don't want them getting pregnant and having litter at such a young age. You are probably wondering why we haven't just brought the kittens into our house however when we do that they just hide behind the fridge or go into a really dark corner with wires which is really dangerous. What should we do? Is there people we can call to come take the cats away? We live in the UK so if you can give us any UK related homes or something to come take the kittens away. We are worried almost everyday. </p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<p>Should I replace all these filtration layers monthly, or just the pad? I am facing higher costs due to exchange rates when importing these supplies.</p>

<p>(The filter has a large net so that I can't put some of my media without a pad over it, otherwise they bypass the net, and go inside the aquarium.)</p>

"How to test if fish tank will break and flood my house?","<p>So in my city every year we have the council organised collection of large items for disposal, where people put the items out on the kerbside for collection. Mostly it really is just garbage, however sometime people just don't want it anymore.</p>

<p>I found an aquarium with a stand. I'm wanting to test to see if it can be a fish tank (not a half filled turtle tank), and want to know how to test if it is strong and sound enough and won't cause a flood or leak or the stand collapse when I bring it in to my house and fill it.</p>

<p>Assuming the test method is to take it outside, fill it up and see if it explodes</p>

<ul>
<li>how long should I leave it filled up for the test to show any leaks?</li>
<li>are there any other tests I should do?</li>
<li>after emptying it and moving it inside, what are the signs to look for when filling it again that would indicate imminent failure leading to it flooding my house.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tank is 120cm x 37cm x 45cm, LxWxH measured on the inside surface of the glass. That is 200L (52.8 gallons). The sides are 6mm and the base is 10mm thick glass. The stand provides support to the tank only around the perimeter of the tank on the 25mm box steel the stand is made from. There is no support under the middle of the tank.

<p>I have a solid pine plank that is the right size and 26mm thick that I could put foam sheets on top of to provide more even support if you think it would be better than relying on the 10mm thick glass bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: well it holds a full load of water as shown in the pictures, at least overnight, and I can't find any external wet spots..</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: I moved the tank inside about 1.5 years ago and it is still leak free. I even added a 1.2m long 100 mm diameter pipe 3/4 filled with gravel to the top of the tank for an aquaponics grow bed. The pipe is supported by a couple of planks resting on the front and back panes of glass. Note some decorative house plants may leech toxins to the water and kill your fish.

"How do I help my older cat maintain weight?","<p>We have a two cat household which includes a 16 year old skinny, spayed female and a 6 year old porky, spayed female. The older cat is a grazer, the younger eats everything in sight. </p>

<p>The old cat is healthy, but has gradually gone from about 7 1/2 lbs (her average adult weight) to 6 lbs. over the last 3 years. I am currently feeding her wet cat food every time she asks, about 9/10 times a day. She eats pretty much all I put down for her, leaving a crumb or two for ""porky"". Even with this feeding on demand, she continues to lose weight.</p>

<p>Is there a high calorie cat food that would be advisable for an older cat? Or any other advice for me to help her maintain, or even gain some weight?</p>

"Ourdoor cat attacked my dogs on a walk, what should I do?","<p>I have two small minpins, and as I was giving them their evening walk a cat darted out of the bushes and tried to attack them. My first reaction was to sling my dogs behind me, which forced the cat to overshoot and zip past us. As soon as it did, it stopped and came right back at us, so again I slang my (now yapping) dogs behind me, and it overshot. Again, it turned around and came back at us.</p>

<p>I was getting tired of playing matador and I didn't want to hurt my dogs by throwing them about by the neck, so on the cats next pass I managed to hook my foot under it and toss it away - not a kick, but as gentle a punt as I could manage to tell it to get lost. Again, as soon as it landed it came back, and as I was out of options I kicked it straight in the face, launching it right back into the bushes. I heard it scurry away and it never came back.</p>

<p>After we got home I checked my dogs to see if they'd been hurt, and thankfully there wasn't a scratch on them.</p>

<p><em>What should I have done in this situation?</em> I feel bad for hurting an animal (especially since I don't know if it was feral or not - I was too busy protecting my dogs to notice a collar) but I couldn't think of any other way to keep it away.</p>

<p><em>If it was somebodies pet, could they take legal action against me?</em> Or is it the owners responsibility since their pet was attacking mine?</p>

"Are stray cats dangerous to newborn kittens?","<p>A stray cat gave birth next to our building a few weeks ago. We check in on her almost every day. She has been taking care of her kittens well, and us, as well as other neighbors have been leaving cat food and bowls of water around where she's nesting with her kittens. Right now, the kittens are about 4 weeks old, are just starting to meow and explore around their nesting area, not yet able to stroll too far. </p>

<p>Gradually, more and more stray cats have been drawn to the area due to the opulence of food and water. Some of them were always around, but more and more of them have been starting to show up. Right now, around the building, there are about a dozen cats, where before there were around 7 or 8.</p>

<p>Some nights, I hear intense cat fights occur outside. I can't tell if the mother or the kittens are involved somehow in the fights because the area isn't well lit at nights, but when I check on them in the morning, they all seem well and healthy.</p>

<p>My question is - could stray cats pose any danger to the mother or the kittens? We are meaning to adopt the kittens, but want to wait for them to ween from their mother, ideally at around 10 weeks. I realize that separating a kitten from its mother earlier than this increases the risk of health or behavioral damage, but if the kittens could be in danger, what would be the right course of action?</p>

"Is my red eared slider eggbound?","<p>My female red eared slider has been showing signs that she wants to lay eggs for the past week, with a small appetite, wanting to leave her home, and is constantly digging with her legs. Because of this, I've moved her to the kitchen where she has laid a few eggs underneath a rack last year. However, a week has gone by and although she exhibits digging motion, she hasn't laid any eggs. </p>

<p>Yesterday (this is what worries me) she has completely stopped trying to leave her home, does not exhibit digging motions when she is let out, and has a large appetite. It's like she's given up on trying to lay eggs. On top of that she looks slightly depressed and bites people to try to touch her, which is irregular. I'm worried that she has failed to find a proper nest and has decided to keep them, in other words egg-binding which I've discovered whilst searching the net.</p>

"Getting a puppy to toilet outside?","<p>Ok so I read over... <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/94"" title=""this question"">this question</a> and there were some really good tips here, however... My 3 month old Shetland Sheepdog just won't go outside in the first place...</p>

<p>He is paper trained for inside, and in the day he has someone come see him to look after him, to let him out in the garden etc. Our aim is to give him treats when he toilets outside - at this point I'm not fussed about where in my garden he toilets so long as it IS in my garden, however he has stopped toileting outside and waits to go inside again. He used to toilet outside, and would receive plenty of fuss etc for doing so. He has a daily 20 minute walk - with a good 20 minute break in the middle where we sit and he can sniff around and relax - but he won't toilet on walks either, even when we walk with a friend and her dog goes.</p>

<p>Recently we spent 4 hours out with a friend, in her garden, on a walk etc and he held his bladder for the entire time and only went when we got home, which seems an incredible feat for a 3 month old small breed pup... </p>

<p><strong>What we are doing...</strong> is that when he starts to go to the toilet inside we open the back door and move him to some newspaper outside (this is linked to how my in laws toilet trained their Shelties) however he then just clams up and won't continue... Until he is allowed back inside. Often he will toilet inside and then sit at the back door and ask to go out, which is the wrong order!</p>

<p><strong>What can we do</strong> to improve this situation? Will moving him outside eventually click, if we use treat training, and as he becomes more controling of his ablutions?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> taking Cedrics advice we played ball in the garden for a good 10 minutes and got our first outdoor wee wee in three weeks. Duely rewarded too!</p>

"Are fatty cheeks on a cat indicative of a communicable disease?","<p>I live on a pretty big property and we've had all kinds of animals. We got our first cat about 10 years ago, when my dog ran off and brought him home. She hatched him and licked him to his annoyance for the rest of her life. Besides that, he's a little hellion. He beats the other dogs on a regular basis and seems to have a special hate for other cats. He is fixed, but he hisses and attacks other cats.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, a new cat has been coming around and my cat doesn't seem to mind him. He/she isn't exactly feral as I'm pretty sure he used to be the neighbor's and just ran off. He's usually pretty shy, but came up for me to pet him/her tonight. He seemed okay, with just a little scabbing on his body, which I assume is for fighting, as my cat has gotten similar ones in the past.</p>

<p>However, when I was running my hand down to scratch it's chin, I felt it's cheeks. They were very large and round. It was like that on both sides. It felt firm and fatty. The cat wasn't really fat anywhere else, not skinny, but not fat. What I'm worried about is it being a symptom of something wrong with it that could make my cat sick.</p>

<p>So does this sound like the cat could be sick or does it just have fat cheeks? I realize that no one on here is a vet and that you can't see the cat. My cat experience is fairly limited, but I've never run across one with fat cheeks like this one. I just want to know if there are any communicable cat diseases with swollen cheeks are a symptom? Thanks.</p>

"Affectionate Pawing & Meowing","<p>Why does my cat affectionately paw me on the face every time I sit on the toilet?</p>

<p>It is quite cute. Only on the toilet.</p>

<p>At other moments in the day, why does he meow as if he is talking to me too?</p>

<p>He is definitely not asking for the door, or something to eat. His bowl is never empty. He never goes out, unless it is an accident. I make a point of ignoring him just to be sure he doesn't learn a behaviour.</p>

<p>Often when he meows now, to test him, I pick him up and cuddle him and bounce him in my arms like a baby. He enjoys that, especially the scratches I give him. I think he is just lonely, especially when I come home after a long day - so he vocalises.</p>

<p>These are both new behaviours. </p>

<p>To put my question in context, he is two years old. Was castrated at 8 weeks. But was born very wild - a real gutter, rescue cat. The mother was fixed and then permitted to live outdoors. She was not rescue-able - a real savage. She was too distressed in captivity. She even looked like a very small mountain lion from her colours. :)</p>

<p>It makes me wonder because her son, my tabby can also display quite aggressive, wild behaviour too. He will on other occasions arrive out of nowhere and throw his front paws around my leg, as if - I learned - he was practising taking down prey. My other cats never tried to kill me! </p>

<p>He also bites, for no reason, my daughter - out of the blue. I think this might be a pack order thing. He won't do that to me.</p>

<p>Until this cat, my Caesar Milan methods have worked on my former cats - a good bite and take-down made them calm submissive :P Not so much this cat. Although right now he is cuddled next to my leg, very subordinate :) very much a member of my pack.</p>

<p>So the ""affectionate"" pawing thing I read on the post below is quite the opposite answer I was expecting.</p>

<p>All the same, I learned from other cats that after you have them shaved for the first time, they spend more time on your legs or lap just to get warmth. I believe the warmth helps tame them and reduce anxiety. Good training-bonding idea?</p>

<p>So I'm confused. He paws my face to be affectionate. He vocalises because he is lonely? At other moments he stalks me like prey? And he puts my daughter in her place?</p>

I'm a bit uncertain on how i'm going to do this, I've crawled the net to find resources but they're too general and I believe this is the best place still to ask this specific question to pet owners who have done similar based on knowledge and experience. </p>

<p>I will try to be as objective as possible and will also accept the most objective answer.  Here goes :</p>

<p><strong>Trip Details</strong></p>

<p>1) I live in the Philippines, it's tropical country, but so far most huskies living here have adapted to the kind of climate. (But not direct sunlight of course).</p>

<p>2) The road is 330 kilometers (about 205 miles). Partly dirt road, partly asphalt. A little climb from here and there.</p>

<p>3) Trip usually takes about 8-9 hours at an average of 50-60kph with moderate traffic.</p>

<p>4) I ride a toyota Avanza, a mini SUV (about 7 seats), A little cramped up but good.</p>

<p>5) I drive alone, no one will be with me. (that kind of makes it a problem)</p>

<p><strong>Question :</strong></p>

<p>I'm a little paranoid but I really want to do this correctly and safely (both for me and the puppy). <strong>So, how do we survive this kind of trip?</strong> Some questions I would like to ask would be :</p>

<p>1) Pet crate or should I fold the seats and let her roam free inside the car? Or should she be in the front seat, or maybe on top of my lap while I drive?</p>

<p>2) Medications? Do they ever get dizzy? or something similar perhaps?</p>

<p>3) Food? should I feed her before the trip? if then how long before the trip? Should or shouldn't I feed her along the way? at how much time intervals?</p>

<p>4) How often should we go for stops?</p>

<p>5) Other details I might miss?</p>

<p>Well first, violence is not an option since it's usually a big turnoff to company. Separating the dog from us with a baby gate makes it cry and whine. Acknowledging the dog makes it worse, and he doesn't do it unless I have someone relatively new, thus making it hard to reproduce and ergo train.</p>

<p>My dog goes and finds a place to sleep when I have someone over, but from the very beginning as a puppy I taught him that he's not the center of attention and should not be around unless there's a reason. So this good behavior is just a side effect of proper training from the start.</p>

"My dog killed a bunny in my yard","<p>I adopted a lab from the local shelter about a week ago, he is about 1 year old. I have a cat at home the dog is playful by his demeanor with his interaction with my cat. I have adopted this dog for a week and just watching him closely with my cat due to his playful nature.  I let him outside my yard and my neighbor's bunny got in and my dog killed it. Should I be concerned for my cat and will this trigger some sort of change in his behavior?

"Former stray - LOVES pets, hates seeing hands","<p>About a year ago, my parents adopted a stray female tortie who used to hang around our backyard. She would wait at the door and beg to be let in so they finally gave up. She's been to the vet, she was someone's pet at some point (not feral and litter trained) but had been out on her own for years.</p>

<p>She loves attention and will scream meow at you until you pet her. She jumps on our laps and motor boat purrs while you pet her. But if she sees your hand, she flips out, jumps up, hisses and swipes.</p>

<p>Then she immediately throws her butt on the ground next to us and side swims (not sure how to describe it, she uses her paws and claws to push herself around on the floor in circles?) while you scratch her back. She purrs, loves it, asks for chin scratches - and then again, catches sight of our hand or even wrist and loses her sh*t.</p>

<p>She never really gets us and her claws aren't even out when she swipes, but it's definitely a fear based reaction. We don't know much about her history but think she was mistreated somehow. It's the quick switch back to wanting pets and the randomness of her getting set off that confuses me.</p>

<p>We board her at a vet when we're on vacation and they love her, she has no health issues and is definitely not feral. Any thoughts on how to pinpoint what causes this, or how to get her used to seeing our hands? I don't know what she thinks we're petting her with!!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

"Can dogs become lovesick?","<p>Our dog (male, a bit less than 2 years old, not neutered) has changed his behavior for a few days now:</p>

<ul>
<li>He whines quite often, a lot more than he did before</li>
<li>he eats only half of his bowl of food, and isn't interested in treats like he used to be</li>
<li>he seems to want to cuddle all the time - he used to like that previously, but much less than now.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're considering taking him to the vet, however</p>

<ul>
<li>his nose, tongue, and eyes are just like they've always been, no fever, dry nose or teary eyes or anything</li>
<li>he likes his walks like he always did</li>
<li>when we let him off the leash, he loves running around, chasing birds, anything, and doesn't seem the slightest bit exhausted</li>
</ul>

<p>so he doesn't seem to us like he was sick.
He had gut worms about 4 weeks ago, got a pill from the vet, and there haven't been any signs of worms or eggs in his poop ever since, so we can rule this out.
Also, he gets about 2 hours of exercise per day, plus time in the garden, so we don't think he's bored (and he doesn't show any signs of boredom like chasing his tail e.g.).</p>

<p>Our neighbor said we shouldn't worry, he just wants to have sex, and the whole episode should be over in 2 weeks. I know that female dogs are in heat for a while every now and then, but males? Could this explain his behavior? Or should we take him to the vet, just to make sure?</p>

"How does my dog know we're almost home?","<p>When I'm driving home from some place and my dog is in the car, he always knows when we're close to home (say, a minute from home) as he gets all excited. My question is: how does he know we're almost there? </p>

<ul>
<li>He's a very small dog on the car floor, so he doesn't see out of the windows.</li>
<li><p>I think smells are to rule out too because this happens with all the windows closed and even if there's food in the car, the smell of which should cover any subtle hints. And I don't see how the vicinity of my house should smell differently than the rest of the small village I live in.</p></li>

"Can a red belly black snake kill a horse? How would I know if my horse has been bitten?","<p>My horse was eating and jumped back from her feed bowl and wouldn't go back to it.

<p>So I took some feed in to put in a tyre feeder that was on the ground and I could move it away from the fence. She wouldn't come near it. So I pulled the tyre feeder away from the fence (only a foot it was heavy) and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQZFKfWuPjs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">found a red belly black snake curled up under it</a>. </p>

<p>The horse knew the snake was there. </p>

<p>Someone told me they thought their horses were being killed by red belly black snakes and it got me thinking. Red belly black snakes are venomous, but they're not aggressive, they avoid people. I don't know much about their interactions with horses. Interestingly the snake moved very slowly. It was something my son and I commented on. It was later in the day and there had been plenty of warmth and sun (it's Spring), so either the snake was scared or possibly injured, although I could not see any visible signs of injury.</p>

"How can I train cats to have consistent behaviors with minimal reinforcement?","<p>My parents have two cats, who are great cats, but have learned some slightly annoying habits since I left for college.  My parents don't maintain reinforcement of what I taught the cats.  </p>

<p>I will have the cats for 2-3 weeks, and plan to use that time to teach them better habits for my parents.  Unfortunately, I know that whatever I teach the cats will not be consistently enforced once I return them to my parents.</p>

<p>The habit I'm most interested in addressing now is Silver's tendency to start meowing excessively, and get right underfoot when he thinks someone is about to get out the wet cat food (once a week).  I want to make him less of a nuisance when the food is being prepared.</p>

<p>His trained ""good"" behavior will be rewarded by only giving him his wet cat food if he behaves.  My parents will not enforce this rule; he will get wet cat food regardless of his behavior.  I plan to convince him that food is a reward for his ""good"" behavior, so he will maintain the ""good"" behavior longer.</p>

<p>I can handle the training; my question is, <strong>what exact training is most likely to stick, considering the teachings will not be properly enforced?</strong></p>

<p>Another example is if I teach him to sit on a vocal command until he is fed, my father won't use the command until Silver has annoyed him, at which point Silver may have already figured out food is incoming and he doesn't need to listen to get his food.  <strong>Should I train Silver by putting the can away when he starts begging for it, to try to teach him that begging means he doesn't get a reward; will that stick with him longer then the idea that sitting gets a reward?</strong></p>

<p>In a nutshell, <strong>how do I get the most idiot-proof training that will stick to the cats without anyone consistently reinforcing the habits?</strong>  I plan to continue reinforcements on my weekend visits.</p>

"Rabbit integration tips & tricks?","<p>I am currently trying (and failing miserably) to integrate my two outdoor rabbits.
My first rabbit (Diego) is a neutered male 1 year old Lionhead, he is very friendly, confident and usually very well behaved and has never bitten anyone (human!) ever.
My second rabbit (Yoda) is a neutered male 6 months old Netherland dwarf (he was given to me as a surprise gift) he is very timid and can be very shy but is also very friendly and is not a biter either.</p>

<p>Now I know the fact that a large difference in breeds/size and the fact they are both males is a factor here, before any of you jump to that.</p>

<p>Not integrating them is not the end of the world as I will simply have them live separately, however i thought it might be good for my rabbits to be able to be 'friends' and have the company. I have tried quite a few times to slowly introduce them to each other on neutral territory for 10 minutes at a time, the first few times were fine (lots of sniffing and grooming each other) however it has only gotten worse. Yoda is very inquisitive about Diego and will sniff, lick and sometimes he actually nuzzles into Diego's bottom region but Diego now refuses to get along with Yoda and will try to bite and (on one occasion) growls, once this happens they are immediately separated again and Yoda is checked over.
I have also tried putting Yoda into a large cage each day and putting him in Diego's run for Diego to see that Yoda is there and see how he feels about him, Diego would be inquisitive about Yoda and would sometimes lay, groom himself and eat next to cage with Yoda.</p>

<p>My main questions are they just too different? Could it ever work despite gender/size issues? Do any of you have any tips or tricks for integration? </p>

"High nitrate level in tap water","<p>I'm quite new to owing fish, we have a 65 litre (14g) tank with 6 minnow, 2 danni, 2 platy and a Hong Kong plec which has been running for around 1 month.</p>

<p>During this month I have learnt a lot about water chemistry and would like to ask some advice on how to move the water chemistry in the right direction.</p>

<p>The stats for our tank are:
PH: 8.2, Amonia: 0.25ppm, Nitrite: 0.25ppm, Nitrate: 40-60ppm</p>

<p>The stats for water directly out of our tap are:
PH: 7.2, Amonia: 0.25ppm, Nitrite: 0ppm, Nitrate: 40-60ppm</p>

<p>(Both test acquired using an API test kit)</p>

<p>I would like to know how if a PH of 8.2 is within a good range for the fish in our tank (if not what could be done to correct this)? What would be the best cause of action for reducing the nitrate levels in our water? I am guessing that regular water changes won't make much difference to the nitrate levels as they are so high straight from the tap.</p>

<p>So far I have added the following chemicals with water changes: Tetra AquaSafe, Tetra EasyBallance &amp; API Quick Start. The Tetra chemicals have been used since the tank was acquired, the API Quick Start was used during a 25% water change done yesterday.</p>

<p>I have also started replacing the fake aquarium plants with live plants as I have heard that they can help to reduce the nitrate levels in the water.</p>

"How do I make a cat understand something is wrong?","<p>I'm currently trying to sleep after my 3 month old kitten broke one of my favorite frames into pieces. He knows he's not supposed to be on that shelf. I've consistently forbidden him, never let him reach it, said ""no"" countless times, put him on the floor if he even reached with his front paws, which he did a couple times, after seeing a shiny bracelet that caught his attention, but he didn't show that much interest besides that. Yet, it didn't matter. And I saw him do it. It was not an accident, he didn't simply bumped it aside. He deliberately pushed it off the shelf with his paw and watched it fall and explode on the floor. He's been here for almost 2 months. This came out of the blue.</p>

<p>I've had a cat for 16 and a half years before. She never did such things, so I'm desperate. My aunt has 6 cats and they never do this sort of thing. I've listened to her advice about being firm, consistent, etc. Doesn't make a difference.</p>

<p>He also spent the whole day throwing a book and a pair of glasses on the floor from the bedside table every second I turned around. If I looked at him, he would sometimes run guilty, but sometimes he'd just completely ignore my warnings and keep conscientiously misbehaving.</p>

<p>He doesn't respond to blowing on his face, touching his nose, and even if I pick him up to put him on the floor, he bites so fast and hard, it barely gives me a chance. He often play bites, too, at least I think that's his point half the time I reach my hand to pet him. I take my hand away, tell him not to do it, even removed myself from his presence. It doesn't work. Many times I am not even interacting with him, and he runs to me or my boyfriend and bites. It's OK when I can get away, but when we're laying down to sleep and he runs at our arms and fingers, it hurts.</p>

"How can I help a cat who seems afraid of his harness?","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> My cat panics when I try to put him in a harness and I'm not sure if he's just afraid of his harness or if I'm doing something wrong. Are there any tips on buying cat harnesses? Is there something I can do to make him more comfortable with the harness?</p>

<p><strong>Some background:</strong></p>

<p>My aunt has a dog and a cat and, when she leaves on business trips, she brings them to my place and I look after them. I have a hedgehog and the dog is (rightfully) skeptical about bugging her after he got too close to her. The cat is curious, but knows not to bug her. So I'd say they all get along, essentially. I have to walk the dog every day, and the cat always tries to get out around the time that I go to take the dog out.</p>

<p>I can get the cat to come back (he's pretty obedient, despite being a troublemaker), but he seems to get lonely if the dog isn't around with him. He tends to misbehave when I leave to take the dog on walks (scratches furniture, meows a lot so the neighbors complain, disturbs my hedgehog to the n-th degree) whereas if I go to work and come back, he's usually pretty good (plays with toys, sleeps, leaves my hedgehog alone). My aunt is going away for a little longer than usual, and my apartment neighbors are normally lenient about the cat when my aunt leaves for a week or so, but I can't subject them to constant meowing for a month. </p>

<p>Furthermore, my hedgehog is used to quiet and dislikes when a shadow lurks overhead, like most hedgehogs do. The cat makes a lot of noise and jumps on her enclosure very often when left alone. If this were to happen continuously for a month, I think my hedgehog would get sick from stress. I do usually move her out of the living room and into the bedroom when the cat is around, but she still gets pretty stressed from the cat meowing more (and louder) than usual. Also the door doesn't lock, so the cat can still get into the bedroom. In my eyes, leaving the cat at home is not an option.</p>

<p>This summer, my aunt is leaving her cat and dog with me for a few months (she says it could extend into next year) and is going to be living out of the country, although not permanently. I'm pretty sure I should be dealing with this problem now, so I figured the best thing to do is learn to walk the cat. I'm looking after them now while my aunt is out of the state, and I've bought everything I need to start walking the cat.</p>

<p>I'm having difficulty, though, since I can't get him on a leash/harness. He does want to go outside, and if we're just in my yard he's pretty much safe, but he tends to get fussy when I use a leash/harness. Usually I can get him to do pretty much anything, but he <em>hates</em> this for some reason. He only put it on once without complaining and since then he's been a nightmare. I thought it might be too tight and brought him to the pet store to have them check, but they determined it was a good size and let me swap out for a set made of a different material after the ordeal we went through trying to get the harness on him. (They thought the material was itching him.) It isn't working. Surprisingly, he doesn't seem to be too upset with me even though I'm usually the one subjecting him to this.</p>

<p>Right now, I take the cat in a cat carrier while I walk the dog and I've been going to a park with fewer dogs in preparation for when the cat <em>is</em> ready to walk on a leash. I could probably keep that up, but he's miserable whenever he's in the cat carrier. How can I make him less frightened of his harness? Is there something I should be considering when looking for one outside of just the size and material?</p>

"Leg injury confusing the vet","<p>My doberman puppy (10 weeks) hurt his leg playing on the stairs a couple weeks ago. The vet said no hurry for bringing him in, since large dog breeds pull muscles all the time.</p>

<p>When we got him in, the vet took an x-ray and showed us what looked like a fracture, but with some weird swirling patterns around it that she has never seen before, and didn't know what to make of. We let her take another x-ray. She still has no clue. </p>

<p>Possibilities she has thrown at us go all the way from bone cyst that would require removal of the leg-bone to an old fracture (perhaps right around birth?) with the swirling indicating remodeling of the fracture, which my pup subsequently aggravated. It's been about a week since the visit, and he has a supportive wrap on his leg that lets him put pressure on it and walk around. </p>

<p>I swear I can't let him out to pee or eat without him doing his best to tear around the house. He doesn't appear to be sick or in any pain, and I think he is actually bouncier and more energetic than our great dane pup (1 year now) ever was. Nothing but nap-time is keeping him from playing.</p>

<p>If he had never gotten the xray, I wouldn't be concerned about him right now AT ALL, assuming he could use his leg without the cast. (He was starting to walk on it, gently, right before he went to the vet).</p>

<p>Now the vet wants to take a couple more xrays($$) send them off to a specialty service($$) test for valley fever($$), test for a bone infection($$) and some other stuff, too. We have spent close to $700 on this pup in the last month, a couple hundred more on the dane, had to put down a cat with an incurable virus infection, and we are raising 4 children. The money just isn't there for all of this.</p>

"Is it normal for dogs to have slightly congested breathing?","<p>For a little while now I have noticed that my (8 month old) puppy often doesn't breathe entirely cleanly.  It's most noticeable when she's relaxed and being petted (but not so much when she's asleep).</p>

<p>It isn't congested to the point that she's unable to breathe through her nose, but one can hear mucous being sucked down as she inhales.  Occasionally one can also see a small amount of nasal discharge.</p>

<p>I raised this with my vet, but predictably the puppy wasn't exhibiting any signs at the time: he listened to her lungs with a stethoscope and couldn't hear anything wrong, so was fairly unconcerned and dismissed my report as likely to be attributable to a canine cold or heyfever (reminding me in the process that puppies, like babies, are still acquiring immunity against common infections).</p>

<p>That all sounds plausible enough, but the fact that it has persevered for so long without any improvement is beginning to make me wonder whether something else could be to blame.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it normal for dogs to breathe like this when they're relaxed (and I've simply never before noticed it in other people's pets)?</p></li>

<li><p>If not normal and ""chronic"" (by virtue of not having cleared by the time that it should), does it warrant further investigation given that it doesn't appear to be causing her any particular harm?

"Would our indoor cat be less demanding if we could let her outside?","<p>We live together with a cat in a flat in the second floor (one above the ground). She has been an indoor cat all the time so far. When she was at my girlfriend's parent's house she could have gone outside, but did not want to.</p>

<p>Now in the flat, she tries to get onto the balcony when I am doing laundry or so. Once I am back in, she will sit in front of the glass balcony door and meow. I have the impression that she wants to go out. A couple of weeks ago, she started to go onto the balcony, and we watched her. She just sat under the dryer and looked around. A couple of days ago she slipped through the railing onto the neighbor's balcony and went a bit into their flat. Today, I was putting up clothes and she darted from the flat onto the balcony and through the railing. Luckily, the other door was closed, but it took a while until she came back.</p>

<p>My girlfriend is very worried that she might harm herself somewhere, and we are not really sure how the cat would get outside and inside from the second floor anyway. The ground is just some 2.50 meters down, so I guess she could get up with some sort of rope or ladder if she really wanted. We live rather close to the city, so there are some larger roads in reach.</p>

<p>She often wakes up from dozing in another room and meows continuously until she is in the other room and I pet her a bit. Often, she will come close to me and <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/2573/what-does-this-cat-want-from-me-when-meowing-accusingly"">meow in a demanding tone, then behave like “pet me, but don't touch me!”</a>. I do think that she might feel a little bored since there are no other cats around and she does not care for any toys, except a laser pointer which I do not want to use.</p>

<p>Would you think that it would be good for her to go outside on her own or on a leash? Or would that confuse her in a way that would be negative overall?</p>

"How do I stop my cat from peeing on rugs and linens?","<p>We have two cats who are litter trained, but one of them occasionally pees on rugs or linens instead. According to my fiancée, the cat was accidentally toilet trained on a towel as a kitten, and now she likes to pee on towels and similar things like rugs and blankets. While she did manage to re-train the cat to use litter, the cat will revert to peeing on linens occasionally, especially in times of stress. <strong>How can we reinforce the cat’s litter training and discourage peeing on rugs and linens?</strong></p>

<p>Note that we have already removed most of the rugs from the house, so the cat doesn’t have many opportunities to pee on them. However, the bathroom is becoming a problem, as we need towels or rugs on the floor while bathing, and the cat has peed on them twice this week. Strangely, the cat seems to leave the kitchen floor mats alone – I don’t know what’s different about those.</p>

<p>Likewise, we keep the bedroom door shut when we’re not in it, so that the cat can’t pee on the bed. Unfortunately, that’s getting to be a problem too, as the cats will sometimes hide in the bedroom so that we can’t shut them out of it. This all would be much easier if we could just trust the cats not to pee on fabric – especially because the whole house has hard floors, and it’s more comfortable with rugs.</p>

<p>I don’t know whether this is relevant, but the cat has done this right in front of me several times. Unfortunately, I know just enough to recognize when the cat is about to pee but now how to stop it. I grew up with dogs and know how to shoo them before they pee, but it doesn’t seem to faze this cat.</p>

It doesn't really hurt since his teeth are only just growing in, but should I be stopping him from doing this?

"As a cat person, how to coexist with a ""misbehaving"" dog?","<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> I've tried for a year to coexist with my girlfriend's dog, and things have gotten better, but it's still not liveable for me. Is there anything else I can do?</p>

<hr>

<p>My girlfriend and I moved in together a little under a year ago, and alongside her came her Pomeranian and two cats (in addition to my own cat). I've had a lot of difficulty adjusting to this dog over the past year - especially only ever having kept cats in the past - but we've put a lot of elbow grease into making things better, and have made a lot of progress.</p>

<p>The problem I'm facing now is that, even with remarkable behavior improvements and a year to get acclimated, I'm still having a lot of trouble coexisting with this dog - and I'm worried we're running out of options to make the situation any better.</p>

<p><strong>First, things that have gotten better:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>At first, he was an incorrigible barker (as Pomeranians are), <strong><em>literally</em></strong> setting off any time he heard a leaf drop outside. Daily chasing of cats, jumping on the table to steal food off plates, barking for attention whenever we leave the room, snapping at anyone that tried to touch his bed while he was laying in it. After some in-home training classes, a few months of positive reinforcement, and the purchase of a remote-controlled citronella collar, most of this behavior has subsided. Mostly.</p></li>
<li><p>Part of the problem was my own behavior as well; I learned quickly that you can't admonish a dog like you can a cat. A spritz from the squirt bottle doesn't deter them, it just makes them irritated and bark at you instead of that leaf. Training classes taught me how to get him to respond to me instead of just aggravating him.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now, things I'm still having trouble with:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>My girlfriend and I are sleeping in separate rooms because of the dog. He sets off anytime someone opens the door while he's sleeping and wakes him up, as a fear/alarm response. We've tried training him out of this, but he's overprotective of my girlfriend so we haven't had success - he's being stubborn about this one. We've tried putting him out in the hall, but he just ends up fighting with the cats, so this is the only peaceable solution for now.</p></li>
<li><p>There are times I'm watching TV and idly petting, not paying attention to where my hand is going. This is safe behavior with cats - if you hit a spot they don't like, they just squirm and walk away. With the dog, if you hit a spot he doesn't like, he suddenly nips at your hand. He's never drawn blood, but it's always a rude surprise nonetheless. We admonish him when it happens, and have been giving him positive reinforcement when we pet him and he doesn't nip - but it doesn't seem to be stopping. We've also taken him to the vet to make sure there's no injury or skin irritation - it's just his way of saying ""stoppit!"". These are really the only ""good moments"" we share otherwise, so this one might be getting under my skin the most.</p></li>
<li><p>Training commands can only go so far when they're reactive. He still chases the cats and snarls/barks at them, he just doesn't do it as frequently - and we can stop him a lot sooner. There's still the hackle-raising stress when he sets off. There are also still mornings that he barks when my girlfriend gets up to get ready for work - which is a problem because she gets up considerably earlier than me. He responds quickly when she uses his ""quiet"" command, but still - all it takes is one bark to wake me up. After months of a 6am wake-up call when my alarm is set for 8am, I'm going batty.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure what else to do. Neither of us are willing to get rid of him - for better or worse, he's a member of the family. We seem to have hit a wall in terms of how much we can fix, and none of the resources we've tried have been able to push us past it. The lack of further solutions over the past few months has me in despair - something has got to give, and as it stands it's going to be our relationship.</p>

<p>Is there anything else I can do, to improve his behavior (or mine)? I'm at the end of my rope.</p>

"Cat suddenly peeing inside, usually goes outside somewhere, and is skitterish around us","<p>Our 5 year old Female cat, Oreo, has suddenly become afraid of us and will run and hide behind the couch when we come into the room. She is normally friendly and wouldn't do this. She isn't aggressive when you try to pet her, she just tries hiding from, and avoiding your hand. I'm unaware of any of us accidentally hurting her or scaring her. </p>

<p>I've also noticed that she has started urinating inside when she would normally go toilet outside in the garden somewhere. She would scratch at the door to let us know she wants to go outside. She doesn't meow to be let in anymore either.</p>

"How can I make my barfy dog feel better? (Gross detail warning)","<p>Three times in the last week, our dog has vomited unexpectedly (ie. we weren't driving and he hadn't been eating grass) and each time it has been bright (bright) yellow and slightly liquid/foamy. I haven't changed his diet at all, and I'm definitely not embarking on any vegan diet experiments, but the answers to <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/7555/dog-vomiting-yellow-white-foam-since-being-fed-vegan-food"">Dog vomiting yellow/white foam since being fed vegan food</a> seem to suggest this is acid reflux. </p>

<p>Today, he was trying really hard to get my attention and I was trying really hard to work and eventually he deposited some diarrhea on the bathroom rug (not a bad place, cleanup was straightforward, if foul) and then when I realized what was up and took him out he threw up within a block of our house and then dragged me to a grassy median a few blocks away and worked really hard to squeeze out some more dribbles of diarrhea. </p>

<p>Since then, he hasn't been eating or drinking. His nose is dry and he looks miserable and he won't play with me. It's been a few hours.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what might be going on. The only thing that has changed in his diet is that we have been giving him some chicken hearts sometimes for treats. I think my husband gives him more than I do -- I chop them pretty small. But we've had them for several weeks (they're cooked and frozen, we thaw one or two at a time and chop them up) and he only started throwing up in the last few days. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do for him to make him feel better now? I've used pumpkin for soft stools in the past. I don't want to start giving him a bunch of new food that's just going to end up making him sicker, but if there's something I can do to help him feel better I'd like to do it. </p>

<p>Should I give him some squash? Or leave him be for now? </p>

<p>UPDATE: He's fine. He was so energetic on his night time walk that it didn't seem necessary to take him to the vet. I'd still be interested in knowing more about how to tell when vomiting is severe enough to warrant veterinary care, however, and whether there are foods that are better or worse for a dog with an upset digestive tract.</p>

<hr>

<p>He had another bout of diarrhea on July 8, and again this week, July 22. Two weeks apart to the day. The timing still seems bizarro, but on our vet's advice we took his food away for the night and gave him only rice. </p>

<p>Still seeing how this plays out. </p>

"How do I give a cat *with a cone* liquid medication, by myself?","<p>My cat just got spayed. She has a head cone on. She has fresh sutures on her belly. She is a fighter, and she is clearly mad about this whole thing. I have to give her 1cc of antibiotics (amoxicillin) in a syringe twice a day. Also I live alone, and I can't call somebody to come over to help me twice a day every day for the next two weeks, that's not feasible.</p>

<p>I can't do it. It's simply not happening. I struggled for an hour this morning and got nowhere.</p>

<p>I read <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/7883/how-do-i-give-my-cat-oral-liquid-medicine"">How do I give my cat oral (liquid) medicine?</a>. I watched <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFRf9PB17Wo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFRf9PB17Wo</a>. I read <a href=""http://www.wikihow.com/Give-Cats-Liquid-Medicine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.wikihow.com/Give-Cats-Liquid-Medicine</a>. I have a towel. I have treats. I have a work surface of comfortable height. Except none of these instructions take into account that <em>it's impossible to grab the head of a cat wearing a cone.</em></p>

<p>I tried wrapping her in a towel. Looks easy in pictures, except my body does not contort in the way necessary to keep her from moving. I tried wrapping her in a towel, then using my left hand I guess... I grabbed the front of the towel to keep it tight around her body then leaned in to trap her between my chest and my elbow, but then I can't keep her head still.</p>

<p>I tried tightening the towel then awkwardly leaning on the towel itself to hold it closed, while using one hand to sort of reach into the cone and grab her cheeks, but she backs up and my body isn't constraining enough to keep her from slipping into the towel.</p>

<p>She's the softest cat I have ever met and has zero friction against the towel, which is making this even more difficult.</p>

<p>No matter how tight I have the towel her front paws have a way of... almost squirting (lol) out the front of the towel and directly into my exposed skin. I put on a long sleeve shirt and tried again.</p>

<p>I can't grab her chin because she has a cone.</p>

<p>If I scruff her and hold her down I still can't keep her head still in the cone, and I can't use any spare fingers on my scruff hand to hold her head still because... the cone. And I don't have a third hand. </p>

<p>I tried holding her between my legs facing me, with one hand holding her down, and the other hand grabbing her head with thumb and index finger while somehow holding the syringe between pinky and ring finger, then using my chin to depress the plunger. That... didn't work. It might of, if I were a contortionist. </p>

<p>I tried sitting on the floor, with her between my legs facing me, my right leg flat on the floor but bent to keep her from going backwards; my left leg over top of her to keep her from jumping out, one hand on her face and the other hand coming over top of that hand with the syringe. I couldn't figure out how to make this work and gave up.  </p>

<p>I tried with her facing away from me, on the floor, where I kneeled and tried to hold her between my knees, with my feet touching to keep her from going backwards, and one hand holding her head, but then the head holding hand gets in the way of the syringe because I have to reach in from the front because of the cone. Nothing makes sense. </p>

<p>I also don't want to be too rough with her underside, given that a surgeon yanked her ovaries out then sewed her back up less than 24 hours ago.</p>

<p>Plus she was terrified of the syringe right off the bat, and is really, <em>really</em> angry at the cone. I'm being gentle. I'm petting her. I'm talking to her softly. I'm doing everything I can to calm her down, and everything seems to go so well until the moment she sees the syringe.</p>

<p>I looked at the cone after reading the suggestions below to take it off. It's got a lot of plastic tabs to undo and after current struggles I'm not confident I could get it back on, so I am not going to attempt to remove it, even though I'm sure this is the way to go. A more easily removable cone would be nice; but it will take a few days for one to arrive unless I can find a vet with a nicer one.</p>

<p>I've also tried giving her canned food (half of a small can) with the liquid mixed in. She can't really eat it well with the cone on, though, and also doesn't seem to be into it (her normal diet is hard food). I can sort of convince her to eat it if I put it on a spoon and hold it out for her, but not enough to get her the full dose.</p>

<p><strong>This appears to be impossible.</strong> </p>

<p>How do I do this? But like, <strong>really</strong> how do I do this? It's one thing to say ""wrap your cat in a towel and hold her still"" but keep in mind that I have a fairly typical human body with two legs that bend at the knees, two arms that bend at the elbows, and five normal length fingers on each hand with the standard set of knuckles. Plus the normal laws of physics apply. </p>

"Restricting the duration of volunteers walking dog at a local shelter","<p>My local shelter accepts volunteers to walk the dogs. However they limit each walk to a maximum of 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I'm a bit puzzled by this limitation. Considering that shelter dogs generally live in a very stressful environment I think that this policy is quite bad for the dog: the dog experiences even more stress when getting ready for a walk as he knows it's going to be short. Even with no prior experience, imagine this: the dog is already under stress. He meets new people. He goes for a walk. After 10 minutes he has to turn back and go back to the shelter.</p>

<p>People walking a dog in view of adopting him will have no chance to see the dog in a ""normal"" state of excitement or stress.</p>

<p>Their argument is that this gives more chances to the dogs to be adopted: the dog can't be adopted if he's not in the shelter.</p>

<p>Are there studies about shelter dog adoption considering this problem? Or other sources suggesting that this could be beneficial/detrimental to the dog?</p>

"How can I tell whether adopting a second cat is a good idea?","<p>I have a 7-year-old female cat, adopted from the Humane Society last September. About a month ago we moved from a two-story house into a smaller one-bedroom condo. Perhaps because I brought a lot of familiar furniture, she seems not to be very anxious in this new place, but she's become rather inactive. She has perches to look out the windows, but there's not as interesting of a view as there was at the last place. She doesn't play with toys unless I'm controlling them, and even then she loses interest pretty quickly, and I'm not always home. She has also become pickier about her food and water - she won't eat dry food any more, and she doesn't drink water any more. I'm afraid that she's understimulated.</p>

<p>For this reason and others, I'm considering, in the near future, adopting a second cat. I understand that a young male cat would be the best choice in this situation. But I don't know whether my cat would actually get along with another cat. At the house we lived at previously, she and the neighbour's cat would sometimes fight at the window, and those are the only interactions between her and another cat that I've witnessed - but they were never properly introduced or anything like that, so I don't know that I can predict how she would interact with a new roommate based on that. I don't want to go and adopt another cat and have her hating me and the intruder forever... </p>

<p>My question is: are there any behavioural signs, that I can observe without having another cat around, that might indicate whether she could coexist with or even enjoy the company of another cat? Am I misguided in thinking in the first place that adopting a second cat could be a way to bring some life into her?</p>

"What causes a dog or a cat to shed?","<p>My Long haired cat sheds a lot. It's insane how much fur he loses, and yet there always seems to be more of it. It doesn't seem like it's tied to the season because he sheds during the winter too, but he's also inside all the time, so I can kind of understand that he wouldn't need more fur since he's not out in the cold.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I had a labrador as a kid who would shed tons in the spring. It seemed pretty clear that there was a winter coat of fur, and a summer coat. Which makes sense since she spent most of her time outside.</p>

<p>So what makes dogs and cats shed their fur? Is it defined by seasons, or are there other reasons?</p>

"I stopped giving my cat dry food for 4 days and after 4 days she started vomiting with dry food","<p>I adopted a cat a little over a month ago. She is one year old. At first, I bought a small bag of Purina Indoor dry cat food to make sure she liked it before buying a big bag. I also bought some Friskies cans of wet food. During the first month, she seemed to like the dry food and did not have any problems with it. When I ran out of the small bag, I gave her only wet food for about 4 days before I could go get a big bag of dry food since she seemed to like it. The cat has been vomiting since eating from the new bag. For the moment I just switched back to wet food while I figure this out. I read that cats have to get used to eating dry food if they spend time without it. Is 4 days enough to make a cat not being used to dry food? What could it be?</p>

<p>At first, she started leaving coin-sized poodles. I could not identify if they were vomit or from coughing up fur balls since the poodles were so small. I could also notice she was spending more time in the hunched up loaf position with her head down. For the next two days, I noticed she was not eating almost anything. Then, I saw her vomit a lot of bile and some undigested food. This was shortly after eating. Later that same day, she vomited a more solid chunk of semi-digested food. This was also relatively shortly after eating. Like a big log of paste with pieces of dry food. (I am just being specific since I read that different kinds of vomit mean different things with cats).</p>

<p>We are going to the vet just in case, but I am uneasy and wanted to know if I should be very worried.</p>

<p>I know it might not even be the food, but I have no idea what else might cause it. Since I stopped giving her dry food she seems to be acting normal and I have not seen any more vomit.</p>

"My cat suddenly stopped using the litter-box to defecate","<p>I have read <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/1009/how-can-stop-my-adult-cat-from-urinating-in-inappropriate-places"">this question</a>, but no answer seems to help here.</p>

<p>My cat is an eight-year-old neutered male, and I have had it for five years.</p>

<p>He has always used the litter box, but sometimes defecated outside of it (always just in front). I figured that he didn't like the box (too small), and fixed it years ago. Also, I did some tests with different types of litter to see which he was comfortable with (the one I currently have is really efficient at neutralizing the smell).</p>

<p>Until then, when he did defecate in front of his litter-box, it was always related to one of two causes:</p>

<ul>
<li>He was not happy (we sometimes lock him up inside the bathroom when we clean up the flat; it is his way to say that he disapproved of it)</li>
<li>Because the litter is dirty and/or smelled bad</li>
</ul>

<p>But for the last month or so he refuses to use the box to defecate at all, even if the box is clean and the litter is new. He always defecates just in front of the box. Thankfully, urination has never been a problem.</p>

<p>I haven't changed the litter brand, the ""cleaning stuff"" brand, location of the box,  or anything that could have disrupted him. I know cats can easily be stressed by small environment changes, but I can't see anything that could have stressed him.</p>

<p>I don't think my cat is doing this out of anger, but what my cat does really look like a ""I show you I am not happy"" behavior. Maybe he is stressed when we lock him up and stress leads to this behavior?</p>

<p>I will bring my cat to a veterinarian next week if the problem isn't solved by then. I didn't do it yet, because ""health problem"" seems like an unlikely cause (apart from that, his behavior didn't change at all).</p>

<p>Except for unforeseen health problems, do you know of anything else that could bring a cat to change this kind of behavior? Can a cat suddenly not like a litter brand anymore, for example?</p>

"How to introduce a large playful dog to a kitten","<p>This isn't quite the same situation as the question asked here: <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/1718/how-can-i-introduce-a-cat-into-a-household-with-dogs"">How can I introduce a cat into a household with dogs?</a></p>

<p>It's also not something that's happened to me. And - fair warning - this did not end well.</p>

<p>People I know found an abandoned kitten that was just barely old enough to be away from its mother. They have two large dogs. One of the dogs is very playful and does not understand ""small and fragile"". </p>

<p>They were keeping the kitten separated from the dogs to prevent accidents, but the kitten got out of the room when the dogs were around, and the playful dog accidentally killed the kitten (they had to supervise this dog closely when their child was a baby - the dog despite training has never managed to understand that it can break something small and delicate). They're devastated. </p>

<p>How could this tragedy have been prevented? </p>

"How can I make my dog comfortable with riding in the elevator?","<p>We have a charming once-feral puppy. We've had him for two months and only just got him going on regular walks in the last week. (see <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/2966/how-do-i-convince-my-dog-that-a-collar-or-harness-is-not-the-end-of-the-world"">How do I convince my dog that a collar or harness is not the end of the world?</a> for more on that).  The thing is, he's absolutely terrified of our elevator. He sits in the corner shivering. I'd take the stairs but... well <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/3275/why-wont-my-dog-take-the-stairs"">that's another issue</a>. He hates them. Given the choice, he'll run to the elevator and then shake the whole ride.</p>

<p>I tend to say soothing things like ""you're a good dog."" and ""it's okay"" but I've read that I'm just reinforcing his fear. How should I handle his fear?</p>

<p>He has to go downstairs a few times a day, and I hate traumatizing him. Should I just ignore his fear and figure he'll get desensitized eventually? Or can I do something to make it easier on him?</p>

"Why won't my dog take the stairs?","<p>I've gotten some good reassurance here about our feral rescue shepherd. (See <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/2966/how-do-i-convince-my-dog-that-a-collar-or-harness-is-not-the-end-of-the-world"">How do I convince my dog that a collar or harness is not the end of the world?</a> for back story). We've finally worked out our slip lead technique and started taking him for regular walks. He's <a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/questions/3274/my-dog-is-terrified-am-i-doing-this-all-wrong"">absolutely terrified of the elevator</a>, but definitely prefers it to the stairs. After taking him up and down some staircases in the park, I decided the problem isn't the very concept of stairs -- he does just fine on them -- but something about ours in particular.</p>

<p>So I basically drag him to the stairs (+1 for polished tile hallways) and then he walks down them. He's slowly getting better about going down -- I don't have to drag him again around each bend (we're on the 5th floor) anymore, but he is having no part of going up the stairs.</p>

<p>Going down, I think self-preservation kicks in. He can either walk down like a normal mammal, or he's just going to fall. So he walks. But going up he just fights and fights. I don't want to push him too hard so I usually give up and take the elevator, but I don't like it. He hasn't shown any aggression in the elevator but I'm still not comfortable with other people getting on and off while he's shaking in the corner because I'm not confident he won't lash out. And plenty of people are scared of dogs. I don't want to ask someone with fear of dogs to share a confined space like that. So I'd really like to get him taking the stairs up and down. </p>

"Why does my cat reject half her food? Is it stale? How can I fix this?","<p>Why does my cat always leave behind food, and refuse to eat it later when combined with new food?</p>

<p><strong>I'm not overfeeding...</strong></p>

<p>I'm not giving my cat more than she can eat, but rather she seems adamant to leave behind her food.</p>

<p>After several days, she will end up with an oversupply of left-overs. </p>

<p><strong>Its not the bowl or comfort issues...</strong></p>

<p>I initially researched it, and I thought perhaps she did not like her wiskers touching the side of the bowl -- hence she would not eat from the fringes of the bowl. </p>

<p><strong>Perhaps she is spoiled...</strong></p>

<p>That was not the case. I tried bunching her food together to the middle of the bowl and topping it off with a very small amount of new food, perhaps ""tricking"" her into thinking the whole pile was new. </p>

<p>She seems to reject anything that was previously a left-over, and there is no tricking her. </p>

<p>It seems likely she is sensing something by smell that I am not fully grasping. </p>

<p><strong>She is possibly making health decisions, and her food is not good in her eyes...</strong></p>

<p>The food is ""Friskies"" and I had switched to fish-based ingredients when I was told her poultry-based food was causing a rash that she had (I had been inspecting it's cause for a year or so)</p>

<p>The only thing I can surmise, based on what I know of my cat, is she is instinctively rejecting portions of her food based on her own sensitivities.</p>

<p><strong>But how do I know for sure? Is this common cat behavior?</strong></p>

<p>I'd like to stop wasting food as well as get to the bottom of this issue.</p>

<p><strong>An extra note...</strong></p>

<p>My wife and I have a cute little feud over this. She says I spoil her, whereas I think the cat is probably having a real problem I don't understand. Yet on that ""spoiling"" level, if I ever cook fish she is extremely interested in our meal and begs a great deal. Of course I feed her the fish!</p>

"Warm weather walkies and water","<p>With the warmer weather, the 'walkies duty' hasn't lifted. When going out for longer walks on hot days, I've been taking with me a bottle of water and a bowl. </p>

<p>But I thought I'd ask - what's your 'rule of thumb' of how far you're going before you'd consider taking a dog drink with you? I've tended to assume up to about an hour walking, and 30m running/playing. Is this too long? (On a warm day)</p>

"What is the real chance my 8-week puppy gets parvo?","<p>I have an 8-week old cocker spaniel - poodle mix. I'm told she's had her first parvo shot out of three. </p>

<p>I live in a relatively well-to-do neighborhood with very, very few stray dogs. We have a front yard and a back yard, with the backyard completely gated and dog-proof. The gate joins the house where the front and back yard meet, probably about forty feet between the sidewalk/road and that gate.</p>

<p>For a couple reasons, we really didn't want to let the puppy go to the bathroom in the backyard a few minutes ago (minutes-old tree spray, probably innocuous but playing it safe). </p>

<p>We got lucky and the puppy didn't want to go to the bathroom before the spray dried out (really super hot here). But if she <em>had</em> (because this will probably come up again): <strong>What is the real chance my puppy gets parvo</strong> if I had let her relieve on my front lawn? How common is it among dogs, and do more dogs come that far up on my lawn than I think? How much does that first shot do?</p>

"How can I keep my dog in my back yard?","<p>My sister has a Siberian Husky, and just moved into a rental home. Her previous home had a fenced backyard (6 foot privacy), but this home does not. How can she easily keep her dog in her yard?</p>

<p>They've used an overhead trolley on him before, and he didn't care for it. At the time, they had another dog and they would get tangled together, so that may have been part of the problem.</p>

<p>They're considering installing an invisible fence (the landlord will deduct improvements from the rent) but they aren't sure if it will be effective through his thick fur. What other options are available?</p>

<p>He was on a regular walking schedule for the 6 months they lived in my parents' basement, and once he settles down in the new home he should return to that fairly easily. In their previous home he enjoyed just hanging out outside sometimes, and they'd like to be able to allow him to do that.</p>

"Should I be worried that my cat is making a huffing noise?","<p>I have a six year old diabetic Devon Rex cat. </p>

<p>Yesterday she was sleeping on the chair next to me. Suddenly she lifted her head and started making a strange huffing noise, almost like she was hyperventilating at an extremely fast pace. At times, she included a small noise that sounded a bit like a quack. She did it three times in a row, and each spell lasted about 15 seconds. Her eyes weren't showing signs of panic, and she looked calm throughout the entire thing and after, but it really freaked me out. Afterwards, she continues laying and looking serene, but continually licks her lips.</p>

"Kangkong (morning glories) as rabbit diet","<p>Since I got a rabbit a couple months ago, he's been eating mainly <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangkong"" rel=""nofollow"">kangkong</a>, a vegetable popular in Southeast Asia in the morning glory family. (It's also called ""water spinach,"" but it is <em>not</em> a Brassica.) Some research (<a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/252244391_Water_spinach_%28Ipomoea_aquatica%29_as_a_feed_resource_for_growing_rabbits"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>, <a href=""http://www.lrrd.org/lrrd16/5/hong16034.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>) suggests that this food is alone suitable for raising healthy rabbits, but mine is a pet, not livestock. </p>

<p>He has never eaten any hay. When we go for walks, he likes to nibble on grass and random plants, but it's not a significant part of his diet. He seems healthy and active. There was some tooth decay, but it's gone away since I stopped feeding carrots and tomatoes. He eats his poop and then leaves hard pellets, which is supposed to signify good digestive health.</p>

"Is trancing due to fear, or vice versa?","<p>My rabbit is virtually fearless. He does not run from cats or running cars, showing curiosity instead. (The one time he got up close and sniffed a cat, he did become startled and put a couple meters of distance from it. And he does hop away from moving cars, but not as fast as he could.)</p>

<p>Issues of outdoor protection aside, my question is about the physiology of trancing. (I've only done this to check his teeth, by the way.)</p>

<p>When he's upside-down, he'll kick for a couple seconds before he rolls his eyes and passes out. After I put him back, he seems none the worse for wear. He goes right back to his usual friendly self. I thought this was normal until I saw ""<a href=""https://pets.stackexchange.com/q/2911/1417"">Can trancing a rabbit have cumulative negative effects?</a>"":</p>

<p>My bunny is certainly uncomfortable with being upside-down, but seemingly no more than if he's picked up awkwardly. As for the rest, he just gets really sluggish. Is this unusual? It seems to conflict with the common explanation of tonic immobility.</p>
