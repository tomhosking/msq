"What series is this depiction of Araragi Karen referring to?","<p>In episode 8 of Nisemonogatari, we briefly see Araragi Karen drawn like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJ0ehm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This looked a lot like some anime (or possibly a character from an anime or manga) I'd seen within the last ten years or so while in Asia, so I have the feeling this drawing style was supposed to allude to something. (Possibly <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Slump"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dr. Slump</a>? I'm not sure since I don't think I ever saw the anime, and I could easily have mixed it up with something else.)</p>

<p>That said, this also looks ""generic"" enough that's possible that this is only a shift in drawing style. But then right before this image, there's a drawing of Karen that looked  like (to me anyway: I have a feeling I'm wrong about this) an imitation of the titular character of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chibi_Maruko-chan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chibi Maruko-chan</a>, so I'm not sure:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yI3Izm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Moreover, I remember seeing something that looked very much like a parody of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiya_Co."" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Peko-chan</a> in an earlier episode, though unfortunately I don't remember which one it was:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vj0sIm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is this (the first image, I mean) supposed to be an allusion to some other anime series, and if so, what is it referring to?</p>

"Have characters' voice actors in Fate/ always been the same?","<p>I've been wondering, between Fate/Zero, Fate/Stay Night Realta Nua, Fate/Stay Night (anime), Unlimited Blade Works (movie), Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC and Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA (and to an extent Carnival Phantasm), have the same Japanese voice actors been employed for returning characters (e.g. Saber-Arturia, Gilgamesh, Rin, Ilya, EMIYA)?</p>

"What exactly are the rollbacks in Higurashi?","<p>We know that the ""mini-arcs"" in Higurashi (When They Cry) all start with a sudden rollback. After some terrible events, the town looks normal again. </p>

<p>Closer to the end of the anime we are being shown that </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It's Hanyū who is responsible for the rollbacks, and she helps Rika keep her memories of what happened before the ""rollback""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now my question is about what those ""rollbacks"" really <em>are</em>. The wiki article, for example, says that they are </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> time travels, and what Hanyū does is reverses time to let Rika relive those days again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when I was watching the anime itself, I clearly remember Rika saying that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> what they did was traveling between ""worlds"", trying to find a ""world"" where everything was right (i.e. no murders). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, if the first version is right, then </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> all the murders didn't actually happen, because the time was reversed each time. In the second case (changing ""worlds""), however, all those murders would be for real in each particular world.</p>

<p>Was that possibly just a bad/false translation of the subtitles I was using? And which version is right, after all?</p>

"Mecha anime where boy pilots small, somewhat feminine robot that can teleport to him","<p>I found one post on this site that might be about the same anime that I'm looking for. It's not answered and already closed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was about a boy who gets involved in some kind of (military? government?) mech program. There are already some other people there piloting mecha. The boy forms some kind of connection with a mecha that is smaller than the rest, and also somewhat feminine-looking. At least, it seemed to have high heels on its feet.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure but I think I watched it the late 1990s.</p>

<p>Now, what I remember is that, that boy also gets another, big yellow robot. Once, when his fraction is under attack and he gets cornered in a corridor, he steps back and surprisingly appears in that yellow robot, it turns on and he starts fighting.</p>

<p>The small robot isn't usual. It's not just standing there and waiting for that boy to drive it. Boy and small robot, they have some kind of spiritual connection. Boy can call him and the robot somehow teleports to him. He also can combine that small and big yellow robot.</p>

<p>And I also remember that scene when that boy is stack in a big spaceship, which is about to explode and he calls that small robot but it's not teleporting.</p>

"Why didn't Chibi-usa initially recognize Sailors Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, & Venus as her friends?","<p>In the R season of the classic anime of <em>Sailor Moon</em>, Chibi-usa had a flashback memory of her surprise birthday party in the 30th century Crystal Tokyo, in which Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars, Sailor Jupiter, and Sailor Venus were present (Wiseman made use of the piece of memory of the span of time during which the secret about the surprise was being kept from her in order to turn Chibi-usa into Black Lady). Chibi-usa also had a faint memory of the same four sailor soldiers fleeing with her while Crystal Tokyo was being attacked, but in this memory, the four people are darkened silhouettes. I can understand that, due to the trauma of the attack and worry about her mom, Chibi-usa might not remember clearly who helped her escape. After these events, she time-traveled to the 20th century where she met Sailors Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Venus in their solider forms (as well as met them in their civilian forms).</p>

<p><em>If Chibi-usa had the clear memory of the birthday party, why didn't she immediately recognize those same four sailor soldiers when she ""re-met"" them in the 20th century?</em> Didn't the party scene indicate that they were her friends and she knew their names?</p>

<p>I am curious about how Saki's society came to be because, in her society, there is knowledge about science (implied from their knowledge about genes). However, part of it is also mixed with aspects of less modern societies, which makes me want to know how these different aspects came about, from previous societies during the Dark age.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there are these ""creatures"" called false Minoshiro which seem to be some kind of very advanced bio-technology, which suggest very advanced technology (but their society doesn't really live that way). With these different aspects of ancient Japanese societies and much newer societies, how did Saki's society came to existence? Why does it have this mix of modern technology and more ancient aspects? What happened to the previous Dynasties during the dark age? Did they combine/converge to form the modern society which Saki lives at? From which dynasty from the Dark age did they come from and what do we know that explains their present society?</p>

<p>As a refresher, here are some of the dynasties from the dark age:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1st, Slave Dynasties, Where PK users controlled those without PK capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>2nd, non-PK users who escaped the Dynasties and lived as hunter-gatherers.</p></li>

"How does an official anthology for a manga series get created?","<p>So, <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/36/what-is-the-difference-between-doujinshi-and-manga"">doujinshi</a> are rather common in Japan. However, it seems that doujinshi, especially ones that are derivative works of an existing series, usually only appear in limited non-commercial circulation, such as at doujinshi conventions, in doujin shops, or on art sites like Pixiv.</p>

<p>But sometimes, there are official doujinshi anthologies that seem to be officially endorsed by the publisher, and are published commercially alongside the source material?</p>

<p>These anthology volumes are typically collections of non-canon oneshots from various third-party manga artists. These stories are basically the same kind of stories that you'd find at a doujinshi convention; the only difference is, these stories are being officially published, so I guess they're not <em>technically</em> doujinshi, although they do feel very similar in spirit...</p>

How do they decide who will be included in the anthology and who won't? Do they just call up various manga artists directly, asking if they want to contribute a chapter to the anthology, or do they put up a notice somewhere?</p>

<p>In the <em>Naruto</em> series, there are many occurrences where Naruto clashes with Sasuke. Their battles always end with a Rasengan against Chidori blast.</p>

"Has there been a study or documentary on the influence of Ani-song themes on Japan's music scene?","<p>As noted on <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3744/how-are-the-themes-and-songs-picked-for-a-particular-series"">How are the themes and songs picked for a particular series?</a>, some anime openings are created for their show; thus, the song and anime theme usually coincide and work together.</p>

<p>Since these songs are widely promoted in Japanese society (and consumed largely by young ones that regard them highly as they grow), I guess these themes heavily influence Japan's music scene too. </p>

<p>At least the influence of early video game music is easy to note. The wide spread of anisons has to have had an influence in musicians.</p>

<p>Sure, the trace of influence might start with the society itself as in Society/Home → Author Experience → Piece of Work → Anime+Anison, and then feeds back to Society.</p>

<h2>The background of the question</h2>

<p>I think that there's a lot more of songs that talk about peers understanding (in love, hurting, etc) in Japan than in Western music. The motivation for this question is to prove or disprove, since I'm making the assumption that these anisons lyrics/themes have influenced current Japanese song writers.</p>

<p>I do believe that Japanese writers express the need of Japan's society to communicate their problems to others and to understand other people struggles. </p>

<p>But there has been any study or documentary talking about this?</p>

<p>Even a formal investigation about this theme bias I see in the lyrics of Japan's music bands works. And sure, this might be just my imagination, is really uncommon that theme on western songs?</p>

<hr>

<p>An example of these kind of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtPx6WdNM30"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">differences between japanese music and western music</a> is noted by Marty Friedman (former Megadeath guitarist). But what he talks about is the music composition, not the topics on jpop/jrock lyrics. </p>

  <p> By my math, Tobi possesses his Mangekyo for quite some years. It <em>is</em> his Mangekyo, he stated it himself. So in that case, how come he hadn't gone blind yet? Itachi went almost completely blind in under 10 years. Sasuke got half blind in less than 1 year (because he abused it freely).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how come Tobi hasn't gone blind? As far as I can figure:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> He obviously replaced his other eye, but it was kept behind his one-eyed mask for a long period of time, he didn't use it for vision.</p>

"Is there such a thing as an 'Indie'/Alternative anime scene?","<p>Having followed anime for some time, one thing I have noticed, at least from my perspective, is that there is no equivalent of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_media"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Indie/Alternative</a> scene when it comes to anime.</p>

<p>What I mean by this is that the vast majority of anime seems to be produced and distributed by some corporate production studio(s). While my knowledge of anime production is quite limited, this would seem to hold for most anime.</p>

<p>What reasons are there for this trend or am I wrong in assuming the lack of an alternative scene?</p>

<p>If I am wrong, then what can be considered as Indie anime? </p>

"What do Seiyuu do after they are no longer at the peak of their fame?","<p>Before they are famous, many seiyuu would work part-time whether it be at fast food restaurants or even physical works. For example the seiyuu <a href=""http://love-live.wikia.com/wiki/Uchida_Aya"" rel=""noreferrer"">Uchida Aya</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the early stages of her career she supported herself with part-time jobs such as being sales staff at departmental stores, production line quality inspector at factories, and sometimes even menial labor carrying cardboard boxes. The key criteria she had in choosing her jobs were that they had to be shift-based and versatile such that she could report to her entertainment office any time she needed to.<a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/36207/why-do-seiyuu-famous-for-doing-eroge-still-use-alias"">2</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Others also have career as eroge seiyuu (Nitta Emi, voiced a character in an eroge, Da Capo III), before they went famous and might continue even after they are famous, such as <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/36207/why-do-seiyuu-famous-for-doing-eroge-still-use-alias"">Itou Shizuka and Asakawa Yuu</a>.</p>

<p>Like all entertainment job, a seiyuu job has its peak, and after that peak is over, the number of job offers one receive would reduce. I'm curious as to what does a seiyuu that is no longer at their peak of fame do for a living when they no longer have many anime to voice? <strong>Do they work on eroge? Or just normal games? Or they turn into salary-man/woman (office workers)? Please give some examples with your answer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong></p>

<p>If they retire at age of 40 or so (which is already stretching it as most female seiyuu would see the peak of their fame at their 25s, while the male ones would still be able to retain their fame longer), then they still have around 30 to 50 years of life ahead as a retired seiyuu. Certainly they would still need some jobs that earn them money to support their living, which is what this question is about. This is especially true since seiyuu don't get royalties from having their voice recorded, unlike singers. Mangaka gets their royalties from every copy of goods that is produced from the series they make.</p>

<p>krazer suggested that they are like athletes and other celebrities, they retire. Many athletes continue working after they retire from their professional career. Some famous footballer becomes a coach, for example, Zinedine Zidane, Antonio Conte, Diego Simeone, Pep Guardiola, and many more. <strong>But as for seiyuu, I never heard of a seiyuu that turned into a voice-acting coach.</strong></p>

<p>senshin suggested that they do Hollywood dubs, while Aki Tanaka suggested that they do freelance voice-acting and voicing for mobile games. Problem with this is that as Aki has mentioned, it is not regular, while their living bills (accommodation, food, etc) still needs to be paid regularly. And with the seiyuu being no longer at the peak of his/her fame, freelancing might not be enough to earn them the money they need. Also I don't think the number of such job available is not much. I mean how many hollywood movies are being dubbed into Japanese anyway? I bet not much. Only the famous ones would see itself being shown in Japan. As I noticed from games such as Chain Chronicles, Kancolle and Panzer Waltz, one seiyuu voice several characters in such games.</p>

<p>Thus, I think the number of jobs available from dubbing Hollywood movies and mobile games won't be that much, and they still have to compete with seiyuu that is still at the peak of their fame, plus the rookie seiyuu as they are often also chosen to mitigate the production cost.</p>

"How did Netero manage to levitate during his fight with Meruem?","<p>I recently rewatched the epic battle between Netero and Meruem in the 2011 anime. I noticed that most of the time, Netero ""floated"" in front of his summoned Kannon. (I am lazy now to include snapshots, but believe me, he was not just ""jumping"").</p>

<p>IIRC, in the final battle in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter:_The_Last_Mission"" rel=""nofollow""><em>The Last Mission</em></a> movie, Netero stood in front of his Kannon by standing on one of Kannon's palms, which was a very clever and reasonable way to keep a high position.</p>

<p>This leads me to question: <strong>How did Netero manage to levitate during his fight with Meruem?</strong></p>

<p>So far (both in the manga and the anime), no Nen user was shown levitating, just flying at best (and using wings in those cases). Of course, the answer to my question can be ""By using Nen"", but frankly, it would be a very inefficient way to use it (c'mon, just reserve one of Kannon's palms to lift you, and leave the other 99 for ""ant swatting"").</p>

"Is it possible for a Byakugan user to awaken the Rinnegan?","<p>Well... the title says it!</p>

<p>I ask this because, supposedly, Hyuuga and Uchiha are descendants of the Rikudou's eldest son (at least I am under that impression). In that way, does the Byakugan have any other special techniques that can be awakened (such as Tsukuyomi, Susano'o and Amaterasu in the Sharingan), and can it (ultimately) awaken the Rinnegan?</p>

<p>So far we have not seen techniques that derive from the Byakugan itself, but rather techniques that are possible because of it: the whole Hyuuga fighting style comes from the use of Byakugan, but it is not related to it in the same way that every Mangekyou technique is related to the Sharingan. They were only able to develop/and use it properly due to them having the Byakugan, but (again) it does not relate to it in the same way the Mangekyou relates to the Sharingan.</p>

Fumoffu</em>, Baka and Test had <em>Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu: Matsuri</em>). However, in cases of Full Metal Panic and Baka and Test, neither OVA series was counted as a season.</p>

<p>I am wondering: Why was the OVA season of Maria Watches Over Us named the third season instead of making the 4th season the 3rd season, like the case with Baka and Test and Full Metal Panic?</p>

"Why do anime series change titles so often (nearly for every ""season"")?","<p>I've always wondered this, but why do anime series titles change so often whenever it gets a new ""season""?</p>

<p>I mean, I understand that the title stays the same for long running series, like <em>Bleach</em> or <em>One Piece</em>, but why do new ""seasons"" for one or two cour anime have slightly different names? For example...</p>

<ul>
<li><em>To Aru Kagaku no Railgun</em>, <em>To Aru Kagaku no Railgun S</em></li>
<li><em>Zero no Tsukaima</em>, <em>Zero no Tsukaima: Futatsuki no Kishi</em>, <em>Zero no Tsukaima: Princesses no Rondo</em>, <em>Zero no Tsukaima F</em></li>
<li><em>Medaka Box</em>, <em>Medaka Box Abnormal</em></li>
<li><em>Sword Art Online</em>, <em>Sword Art Online II</em></li>
<li><em>Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai</em>, <em>Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai.</em> </li>
<li><em>K-On!</em>, <em>K-On!!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm particularly interested in the last two, where the only noticeable difference in the title is a punctuation mark. They're all direct sequels, so why not just give it the same name as the first season, like in American television? The source material keeps its name throughout its entire life (e.g. there was never a <em>Naruto: Shippuuden</em> manga or a <em>Shakugan no Shana III</em> light novel), so why do their anime adaptations get different titles?</p>

<p>Is there a legal thing in Japan which disallows a production for one ""season"" to have the same name as another, for clarification purposes? Or do the producers/whoever chooses the names just want to attract more fans by making a distinction between different ""seasons""? </p>

<p>Some insight into how the airing of anime works would be much appreciated.</p>

"Is it possible to combine all five chakra elements?","<p>The title says it all... but I'll elaborate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially we see techniques derived from <strong>a single chakra element</strong> (Katon, Doton, Suiton, Fuuton and Raiton). These are the most common, since usually a ninja can master only one chakra nature (since normally ninjas tend to have an affiliation with only one chakra nature)  </li>
<li>Later we discover these can be combined in a number of ways, <strong>creating new elements</strong> (Mokuton=Doton+Suiton, Ranton=Raiton+Suiton, Youton=Katon+Doton, among several others). From what I understand, these are usually transmitted as a Kekkei Genkai. But I believe they can also be created by the combinations of the elements, by ninja who didn't inherit it from other generations (correct me if I'm wrong). These are not uncommon, but less frequent than the ones above (there are ninja who can master and possess affiliation to more than one chakra nature: Sasuke comes to mind, since he can master both Katon and Raiton. Katon is his clan's natural affiliation, and he mastered Raiton too. However, I don't <strong>remember</strong> if he has ever combined the both of them)  </li>
<li>Even later, we find about combinations of <strong>even more elements</strong> by ninja who can master several elements, such as Muu (Nidaime Tsuchikage) and Oonoki (Sandaime Tsuchikage), who can combine Katon, Doton and Fuuton, to create Jinton. These are called Kekkei Touta. I don't know if they can also be transmitted through Kekkei Genkai, or if they can only be taught. They are even rarer than the ones above, since ninja can rarely master or be naturally affiliated to more than two chakra natures (Terumii Mei the Godaime Mizukage, can also master Doton, Katon and Suiton, but I don't think she ever combines more than two at each time). </li>
</ul>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Are combinations of chakra natures taught or only transmitted by Kekkei Genkai (or both)?</strong>  </li>
<li><strong>Are combinations of more than three chakra natures possible?</strong>  </li>
<li>And the above question created a new one for me: <strong>Can a ninja master more than three chakra natures?</strong> (I think Kakashi does, but I am not quite sure about this)</li>

"Why did two hours pass before Kirika was asked to put away the pocketwatch?","<p>In episode 1 of <em>Noir</em>, Kirika and Mireille speak at Kirika's home after surviving the attack at the construction site.

<p><strong>Why did so much time pass before the pocket watch was removed, if Mireille has such a knee-jerk reaction to it? Is there anything that happens before the removal of the watch that the viewers are not being shown?</strong></p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>I considered the possibility that I had confused the minute and hour hands on the watch. However, that does not work with the layout of the clock face: if it were 00h35 and not 19h, the hour hand should be closer to the first tick on the pocket watch.</li>

  <p> How long was it from the first time that Taki and Mitsuha swapped until the last time (the day before the comet struck)? Relatedly, how long was it from when they <em>realized</em> they were swapping until the last time they swapped?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sense I got is that it had to be a fairly long time (some number of months, perhaps), based on details like how they had pinned down that the swaps occur 2-3 times a week, and how each of them had gotten quite good at fitting into the other's life. </p>

<p>However, during the first scene that is set in Mitsuha's present with her in her own body, the TV news indicates that the comet is due to approach perigee within a month, and at this point, they hadn't yet figured out that they were swapping, which suggests to me that at best they could've had a few weeks where they were aware of the swapping phenomenon. (Granted, the swapping could've been going on for considerably longer with both of them still believing the swaps to just be vivid dreams.)</p>

<p>So the timelines seem a bit wonky to me. Can we pin down the duration of the ""first"" part of the movie more accurately?</p>

<p>I suspect that we should be able to get relatively tight bounds at least on how long they were aware of the swapping by examining the details of the diary entries Mitsuha was keeping on Taki's phone. (Or maybe this info could be found in the novelization?)</p>

"Why isn't Digimon consistent with its rule mechanics per story/season title?","<p>After reading <a href=""https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/digimon-digital-monsters#"" rel=""nofollow"">this review</a> about Digimon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the general basis of relationships between the show's kids and their digital companions remained constant over the course of the series, almost everything else went through many <strong>makeovers</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Some seasons <strong>feature seven human visitors to DigiWorld</strong>; others,
  <strong>as few as three</strong>. In early episodes, the kids <strong>can't get back home</strong>; later stories show a new cast of youngsters <strong>effortlessly
  journeying between the two worlds</strong>. And while in most stories <strong>each
  kid has his own specialized Digimon sidekick</strong>, a full season of
  episodes featured <strong>humans who could transform into the digital
  beings</strong> rather than just summon them for battles.</p>
  
  <p>Youngsters will certainly find this lack of continuity confusing, and
  parents may be wary of introducing their kids to yet another marketing
  conglomerate looking to rival Pokemon. (Digimon boasts a similar
  assortment of tie-in video games, trading cards, virtual pets, and
  other toys.) And it's worth noting that although the show's violence
  is mostly of the flashy, fantasy variety and battles are reserved for
  the digital beings, those who are seriously injured dissolve into
  pieces that are said to regroup and reincarnate at a later date.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anime titles that has certain rules like Pokemon's battling system, Bakugan, B-daman and Yu-Gi-Oh's Trading card Game. With every season or Arc those anime change the concept and lot but not the ""in-universe rules"". See Zoids for example, 
we see different Zoid Titles but still stays consistent with the rule that there's an MC that has a Zoid as the Mech Pilot fighting other zoid pilots. Yugioh battle with cards. and Pokemon with its concept of <em>Gotta catch them all</em>, battle with other trainers and wild pokemon and compete in a league.</p>

<p>However in Digimon, as a season / title ends, they make these <strong>Make Overs</strong> in the story's scenarios and mechanics of the rules of battle. </p>

<p>for example, in the first season of Digimon (Digimon Adventure 00) We see 7 Chosen Ones who where transported to the Digital World. In there they meet their seven companion Digimons (one partner for each). </p>

<p>The Second season, continues the first with the 2 veterans and 3 new Digi-destined. Nothings wrong there then they throw in Frontier in which the Humans transform in Digimons (as armor) and they were the ones fighting instead of digimons (Power Rangers style).</p>

<p>Also in Digimon adventure and Digimon Xros Wars the ""Chosen Ones"" were having difficulties returning to the Real World, but the other titles can cross easily between worlds right?</p>

<p>Is this because they were being called Pokemon's ""Rip-off"" ? or is it marketing strategy because like pokemon they also sell merchandise and Trading Cards.
Are there any detailed explanation for this?</p>

"What was Incursio's trump card ability?","<p>According to the definition of a trump card, it is the ultimate Teigu's ability, one that often comes with a risk to the user's life.</p>

<p>It is true for several Teigu, like Murasame (infecting oneself with the fatal poison and the regret of everyone slain by it), Susano-o (giving up one's life force to the Teigu, said to be usable only three times before certain death).</p>

<p>Wikia has on the Trump Card:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several Teigu were shown to have a hidden ability (奥の手, oku no te, lit. secret move), often referred to as ""Trump Card"" or ""Ace in the Hole"". (...) Usually, such moves are the most powerful, <strong>last resort</strong> ones. <sub><em>(emphasis mine)</em></sub>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikia lists the invisibility power as Incursio trump card. It goes against the very definition, since it has no risk (exaustive, yes, but not life-threatening) and is used in almost the time.</p>

<p>So I have to disagree with that definition. I think that Incursio Trump card is the evolutionary power. It is shown in the Manga that Tatsumi is being consumed by Incursio due to the repeated evolutions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However because Tatsumi forced Incursio to evolve rapidly to increase his strength, Incursio started to manifest in one of Tatsumi's eyes. After being examined by a doctor, he reveals that the armor has started to bond with him. He also states that after a few years Tatsumi could use it without overdoing it like Bulat. Now <strong>at the risk of being devoured by Incursio</strong> (...) <sub><em>(emphasis mine)</em></sub>.</p>

"Was running into people with toast in your mouth already a cliche by Evangelion's time (1995-96)?","<p>As everyone who's seen <em>Evangelion</em> knows, the alternate-reality segment in the last episode (of the 1995 TV series) prominently features a scene where Rei, mouth entoasted, runs into Shinji on her way to school. </p>

<p>To those of us living in the year 2016, this is an obvious cliche; countless many anime have portrayed the same thing in the two decades since (episode 1 of <em>Nichibros</em> has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNsuvpiXb7M"" rel=""noreferrer"">my favorite rendition</a>). But would viewers in 1995 have seen this as a cliche? </p>

<p>It seems plausible that <em>Evangelion</em> could have been using the toast-collision trope as a touchstone to really drive home the prototypical-slice-of-life nature of the alternate reality. But then again, it also seems plausible that the toast-collision was only an incidental feature of the segment, and that the trope's present-day status as a cliche is a <em>consequence</em> of other shows imitating <em>Evangelion</em>. I don't really have enough of a pre-<em>Evangelion</em> knowledge base to discern which is true.</p>

"What does the ""Dark age"" mean in Shin Sekai Yori?","<p>I was wondering, in the anime on the 4th episode ""Bloody History"", they refer to some period of time called the ""Dark Age"". I was wondering (maybe the people that can read the original Japanese Novel can respond this better) what exactly was meant by the ""Dark Age""? </p>

<p>I tried to figure what the Dark age was and while searching for that answer, I approximately transcribed (from the subbed english version) when the False Minoshiro talks about that. In that scene he approximately says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The turning point for Japan was when ""Boy A"" committed a series of crimes.
  He realized he could use his PK powers and open the most difficult of
  locks.  “A” broke into the bedrooms of 19 sleeping women, assaulted
  them and eventually killed them. At this point Saki and her friends
  couldn’t comprehend how a human was capable of killing other humans.
  Even after his arrest people continued to use PK to commit crimes. It
  became a weapon for terrorists. It split society into a complex mix of
  opposing political, humanitarian, and ideological factions… ...and the
  world entered an era of war, unlike any known before. Ironically, the
  constant threat to the lives of PK users led to a dramatic evolution
  of their abilities. <strong>Meanwhile, the human population plummeted
  worldwide, until it was less than 2% of what it it’d been at its
  height. These events serve as an overview of the Dark Ages that lasted
  five centuries</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From that, I concluded that around 2011 A.D. society was something very similar to what we have now (with cars, iPhones, airplanes and normal technology). Then people with PK caused a war and for that reason, human population suffered a terrible decrease to 2%. Then this era lead to a war and then to an era where northeastern Asia divided itself into four distinct and irreconcilable units:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1st, Slave Dynasties, Where PK users controlled those without PK capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>2nd, non-PK users who escaped the Dynasties and lived as hunter-gatherers.</p></li>
<li><p>3rd, Bandits who used PK to attack other settlements. </p></li>
<li><p>4th, a group of those who managed to preserve some remnants of the technological age.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then we have the present time where Saki and the others live.</p>

<p>My question is, which time period does the ""Dark Age"" correspond to?</p>

<p>Is the following time scale correct?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U6yhI.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Or is the Dark age before the dynasties/division of asia age? Also, what is known about the dark age?</p>

"Does Mizuho reveal his crossdressing after he graduates?","<p>It's been a long time since I watched <em>Otoboku</em>, but I've always wondered if the visual novel explained what happens to Mizuho after he graduates and puts aside his fa&ccedil;ade. </p>

<p>Mizuho is a guy disguised as a girl, attending an all-girls school. He doesn't exactly keep a low profile, either; if he'd done that, he could have just made his girl form disappear after graduation and went back to being a man. Instead, he runs for Elder and becomes a celebrity who is looked up to by the younger girls. When he graduates, he can't just throw off his wig and dress, go ""Phew, what a relief"", and be a man again, because tons of his former classmates recognize him. He would have to either tell them all ""Yeah, I was cross-dressing all those years and hanging out in the dressing room and bathrooms with you"" and get arrested for a pervert, or else pretend to be his own brother (or something) and get out the disguise again whenever his old school friends come around.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgOsd.jpg"" alt=""Mizuho hair flipping""></p>

<p>Yes, seriously, that's a guy.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, Mariya, Takako, and Shion all know by the end of the anime series that Mizuho is a guy. Yukari and Kana never find out. So at some point, he's going to have to break it to Yukari and Kana, even if he decides to never see anyone else from the school again. (According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Otome_wa_Boku_ni_Koishiteru_characters#Main_characters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Wikipedia article</a>, though, he, Shion, and Takako often visit their old school after graduation.) </p>

<p>The Wikipedia article says the VN does show what Mizuho does after he graduates. Does it address this? Does he maintain his female disguise or eventually break it to everyone that he was a guy the whole time?</p>

"Fate/Zero and Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works - prequel vs sequel vs something else?","<p>This may not be the appropriate place to ask this, but since you guys are the most intimately familiar with the anime, I thought I'd ask here.</p>

<p>I'm designing an anime database for a personal project (not unlike MAL or AniDB), but unlike those two, I have a much stricter definition of the two terms. I define them as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>sequel</strong>: a work produced after the original story <em>and</em> continues or expands upon the original story.</li>
<li><strong>prequel</strong>: a work produced after the original story <em>and</em> is set chronologically before the original story.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that all prequels are implicitly sequels, which is what a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel"" rel=""nofollow"">prequel</a> <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel"" rel=""nofollow"">means</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the situation with F/Z and F/SN:UBW is tricky. Everyone and their mother tends to see F/Z as a <em>prequel</em> to UBW, because the F/Z visual novel actually <em>is</em> a prequel to the F/SN VN.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to the anime, F/Z was produced first, and then UBW after. In this case, would the UBW anime be considered a <em>sequel</em> to the F/Z anime? Some have argued that UBW was not intended to be a sequel to F/Z at all, but then what would their relationship be? Spin-off? </p>

"Couldn't the Chimera Ant King be trapped in Knov's Nen dimension?","<p>I enjoyed the anime a lot. Most of the time, no main character made bad decisions in fights or at progressing. However, in the Chimera Ants arc, wouldn't it be easier to trap the Chimera Ant King in one of the special rooms in Knov's Nen dimension? Are the rooms to weak to keep him in there?</p>

<p>They could just let him starve there. I know Knov was scared of the Chimera Ant's Nen, but he created those rooms before the battle, so one of the others could move the King there.</p>

"Why do Japanese live-action adaptations appear to have extremely similar artistic direction to their manga/anime source material?","<p>It is possible that my premise is extremely flawed, but I have noticed in recent times that there are quite a few live-action adaptations of Japanese anime or manga that look very similar in visual style to their source material. For example, I recently saw a trailer for the Japanese film <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasyte:_Part_1"">Parasyte</a>, which is based on a manga. Many of the scenes from the trailer look identical to parts of the manga, and the appearance of the parasites is identical to the original artwork. I also saw the movie trailer for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan"">Attack on Titan</a> and the titans in the film look identical to those in the manga and anime. There are quite a few other examples that I've encountered that I cannot list right now. </p>

<p>In Hollywood, even when animated material is adapted to live-action, usually the artistic direction is quite distinct between the two. Some of Marvel's latest superhero movies borrow a lot from their comic book material, but even then their visual style is quite distinct from the ""comic book"" look. The film adaptation of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen"">Watchmen</a> was <em>extremely</em> similar in both plot and artistic direction to the graphic novel and it was critically panned for this, which leads me to believe that it is somehow deemed unacceptable to do this for Western graphic novels.</p>

<p>Is there a reason why the live-action adaptations of manga are so close in appearance/artistic direction? Or is it just my limited experience?</p>

"What time travel category applies on Steins;Gate?","<p>I'm kind of a fan of time travel stories, so I got a little disappointed with <em>Steins;Gate</em>.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel#Time_travel_in_fiction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Time travel themes in science fiction and the media can generally be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-many-worlds interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When they explained timelines in the show, I got the idea of the timelines being alternate, but then we got all of this ""Alpha/Beta timeline"", and that goes more with the immutable timelines, with some alternate-difficult-to-reach timelines.</p>

<p>And at the end, Okabe couldn't change the beta timeline, except if he cheated himself (which would make the timeline mutable)...</p>

<p>So, did the scriptwriters just cherry-picked things as they felt it could add more drama? (For example, I was telling myself all the time: if Kurisu dies in timeline beta, and Mayuri dies in timeline alpha... wouldn't the solution be going to timeline Gamma?!) </p>

"How was Light able to maintain his academic performance?","<p>After Light got the Death Note, he started writing criminals' names and killing them. Even after L made his first appearance and said that he would find Kira, then Light was thrilled up and accepted that as a challenge. </p>

<p>As we all know Light was the 1st performer in his academics from the start. But when he got the Death Note, then he was certainly spending a lot of time on planning how to kill, and also observing how the Death Note works. But even after all this pressure of killing and L coming to find him, he maintained his academic performance.</p>

<p>So does that mean Light was so talented that even without studying he was able to come first in his academics, or was he spending enough time in academics as well? Is there anything specified in the anime or manga about how he was managing his time between his studies and by writing names in the Death Note so that he would not get caught?</p>

"Why are only some of the references censored in Lucky Star","<p>As anyone who has seen Lucky Star will remember, most of the references to other anime and manga are censored. The most obvious examples of this are references to Gundam or Sgt. Frog (both of which are notably Sunrise shows). Presumably this is done to avoid KyoAni getting sued. This also explains why references to Haruhi and Full Metal Panic weren't censored (as far as I remember). Interestingly these instances of censorship probably could have been removed in the English release since it was licensed by Bandai, but I don't know if they actually were, so this question might only apply to the Japanese version.</p>

<p>However, there are still a few cases of references which weren't censored despite no obvious connection between the Lucky Star team and the source. The one that immediately comes to mind is To Heart, which is referenced several times. To Heart is associated with VN studio Leaf as well as animation studios Oriental Light and Magic and AIC, neither of which have anything to do with Lucky Star (KyoAni and Kadokawa). I can't find any connections between them, but of course that could be oversight on my part, and I didn't check all of the individual staff members.</p>

<p>Is there some connection that I missed? Barring that, what sort of policy would a studio typically use for references like this? Would they try to obtain permission for all of the references, or just bleep the ones that seem risky to them?</p>

<p><sub>Master Roshi (Dragon Ball) and Umino Iruka (Naruto)</sub></p>

<p>However, when I mentioned this to a Japanese person (someone who was not a big anime viewer), she was confused, and adamant that a bloody nose would normally just mean that the person was excited in general, and it would not necessarily have anything to do with sexual excitement.</p>

<p>This could (and seems likely to be) true for Japanese day to day real life, but very different in anime, where the connection to libido seems very clear.  </p>

<p>Is there someone that can explain this difference? Is the ""bloody nose"" in anime just used to signify excitement, and it just happens to often (always) be sexual excitement because of the plot?

"Why do some fans believe Lelouch vi Britannia had the code when the show staff themselves have always stated otherwise? (Code Geass R2 spoilers)","<p>Some people believe that Lelouch had the code at the end of R2 and was immortal, but <strong>the show creators have always officially stated that Lelouch was truly dead.</strong> (I will make a summary of some of the official statements below)    </p>

<p>Sometimes people try to invoke ""Death of the Author"" but even that doesn't work. ""Death of the Author"" still requires that the interpretation matches with what the work itself presents, that there is an internal consistency, and this is not true for code theory.<br>
We see that Lelouch uses his geass long after his final confrontation with Charles, this is not possible if he had had the code because the anime made it very clear that you lose your geass when you get the code. ALL 4 examples of people with the code have had this happen, they all lost the geass, no exceptions. Furthermore Charles establishes that rule explicitly by saying ""I've gained a new power <strong>in place of</strong> geass.  </p>

<p>The idea that the code needs to be activated first is debunked by the anime itself, as it shows us that Charles was immune to geass. There were no red rings around his eyes, and there was no nerves realigning scene. This means Charles was immune to geass, which means his code was already ""active"", which means there is no such thing as an inactive code and thus codes do not need to be activated. It was later explicitly confirmed in a live commentary that Charles was indeed already immune and just toying with his son (see below). </p>

<p>The idea that Lelouch was a special case which allowed him to keep his geass, and thus was an exception to the normal rule is also not supported by the anime. At no point does the anime even suggest that it could be possible for someone under certain circumstances to have both a geass and a code. Nobody talks about it, thinks about it, wonders about it, etc. And there are zero precedents, all the precedents the anime shows us deny the possibility.<br>
Without a basis in the anime, this idea is pure fanfic and entirely detached from canon lore.   </p>

<p>Since the anime itself debunks the ideas of code theory, it is not possible to invoke ""Death of the Author"" as the fan interpretation doesn't fit in the anime's lore at all.    </p>

<p>As for official statements, the provided evidence for Lelouch being truly dead is massively overwhelming. There is a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/GeassedbyLelouch/comments/8hklfr/evaluating_code_theory_main_body_index/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compilation database</a> on reddit which has gathered those official statements. I will highlight a couple of them. For a full overview I urge people to follow the above link.       </p>

<ul>
<li><h3>The interviews from Animage 10 (<a href=""https://matome.naver.jp/odai/2143969576830905201/2143972453355434003"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">October</a>, Okouchi) and 11 (<a href=""https://matome.naver.jp/odai/2143969576830905201/2143972453355433703"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">November</a>, Fukuyama) from 2008.</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>In these interviews they explain that the death of Lelouch was a matter of principle for them (their aesthetics, their psychology, etc.), it was a matter of redemption and salvation in the eyes of Lelouch and Lelouch found peace dying for the gentler world his sister wanted.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Okouchi</strong>: <em>""(...) That end is to Lelouch and to Suzaku both the punishment and the salvation at the same time. It's also connected to the words Lelouch said at the beginning: ""Utte ii no wa utareru kakugo no aru yatsu dake da."" The person who gave the punishment was punished themselves and if you want to get the salvation, give the salvation first. Of course it's also the same with Lelouch's decision to accepts the geass (wish), because he geassed many people, as he himself has said in the show. [He refers to the last episode when Lelouch says what the people of the world wish for]""</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>Animage</strong>: <em>""So this was the end, but was Lelouch happy?""</em><br>
  <strong>Okouchi</strong>: <em>""I think that the show had a happy ending, not a bad ending. Lelouch and C.C. talks about it in season 1 episode 7 - just living a life is meaningless. Lelouch saved his beloved sister and managed to create a kind world in his own way. His life wasn't meaningless. That's why in the end he is smiling.""</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>Animage</strong>: <em>""So you accept the end of the show?""</em><br>
  <strong>Fukuyama</strong>: <em>""I think that before he reached that final scene, Lelouch had many possibilities to choose from. But he understood very well what he had done and had to pay the price for that. Suzaku choose to live as Zero and was awarded the opportunity to pay for his sins by this choice. And Lelouch got his salvation by choosing not the happiness of living on but to sacrifice his own life to create the situation for the world to move forward. If you think about his character, I don't think he would still be himself, if he chose other end.""</em>    </p>

<ul>
<li><h3>The interviews from Continue (<a href=""https://www.retromags.com/galleryimgs/monthly_2017_10/small.59f05755697f9_ContinueVol.42(October2008).jpg.f9ec262ce76541c515b3ea32e65060c8.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vol.42</a>).</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>In this interview they confirm that the decision to kill Lelouch was a unanimous one, the entire show staff agreed:   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Continue</strong>: <em>Was there a dispute among the staff members regarding the ending?</em><br>
  <strong>Okouchi</strong>: <em>No. It was decided fairly naturally. During the ""Code Geass"" script meetings, there are many cases in which there were a number of disputes, but there were barely any when it came to the scripts for (the previous series's) episode 25 and the final episode. I think everyone felt the same when it came to the end of the character that is Lelouch.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They confirm that Lelouch's death was one of the first things they decided for the show and that his death was a matter of principle to them (""their sense of aesthetics""). This statement was confirmed yet again 10 years later in the tweets (see below).   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Continue</strong>: <em>Why were you so bold as to choose this ending when the viewers might see it as a Bad End?</em><br>
  <strong>Okouchi</strong>: <em>Bold... yes, we were so bold as to chose this ending. Perhaps the show that is ""Code Geass"" ending up this way was decided the moment Director Taniguchi and I teamed up. I suppose you can call it our sense of aesthetics, or perhaps a part of our psychological makeup.</em>    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following statements explain how they foreshadowed Lelouch's death from the very first episode with his famous line ""The only ones allowed to kill are those who are willing to be killed"" (exact phrazing will depend on the subs you used, of course):   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Continue</strong>: <em>Still, isn't it possible that defeating the wise ruler Schneizel, the person who was supposed to have brought order to the world, might lead to some [viewers] interpreting it as a Bad End?</em><br>
  <strong>Okouchi</strong>: <em>That's true. There are probably a lot of people who think of it as a Bad End, a tragedy, considering the protagonist's, Lelouch's end as well. However, Lelouch says in the first episode: ""Only those prepared to be shot are allowed to pull the trigger themselves."" If you were to think of that as his pride, then I think his getting shot (killed) in the end was a logical end. Of course, I understand that not all of the viewers will accept this ending. There were people who wanted a happier ending, after all.</em>    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that part of this last statement was often misinterpreted by code theorists as him saying that people could see it as open ended. It is clear from his words that this is NOT what he is saying. He said that he understands that some people will see Lelouch's death as a bad ending and that some people wanted a happy ending. Basically, what he is saying is that people are free to interpret Lelouch's death as happy or sad, but Lelouch's death itself was never open for interpretation, it was set in stone as the rest of the article clearly demonstrates. The ending was never meant to be ambiguous.<br>
It is also important to note the Lelouch's death can only be interpreted as a true, final death and not something temporary until the code revives him, especially the foreshadowing of his death doesn't make sense if we see it as temporary death or faked death, but the later tweets will make this even clearer, so I will go in further depth there. (see tweets below)   </p>

<ul>
<li><h3>The tweets</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the 10 year Code Geass anniversary, the creators of the show started a series of tweets titled ""Geass Memories"" in which they reminiscence about the days when they made the show, shedding light on the production process, the way certain decisions were made, etc. Of particular relevance here are the Geass Memories 77-83:   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Before I started writing the story of a person called Lelouch, I confirmed with Taniguchi-director something. That thing was that <strong>the end of Lelouch will be death</strong>.""<br>
  ""At least he is aware of his sins and pays for them with <strong>his death</strong>.""<br>
  ""This man called Lelouch will pay for his sins by <strong>his death</strong>. The story follows him till he finally make this decision.""<br>
  ""Probably this Lelouch we see in the first episode of the series wouldn't <strong>choose death</strong>. He would try something to avoid it. He couldn't <strong>die</strong>, for Nunnally as well. But we see him changed in the last episode.""    </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/ichirou_o/status/998739675895365633"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Link to the tweets on his twitter account.</a> </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FklXz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FklXz.png"" alt=""Screenshot of tweets in Japanese""></a>
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H503o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/H503o.png"" alt=""Transation of the tweets""></a>  </p>

<p>It is important to note that ""death"" here can only be interpreted as a ""true, final death"" and not some temporary death until the code revives him, just as was the case earlier with the explained foreshadowing. This is easily made obvious by replacing the word ""death"" by ""death for 2 minutes"" or ""faked death"". ""Lelouch pays for his sins by being dead for 2 minutes"". ""Only those who are willing to fake their deaths are allowed to kill"". ""Lelouch being dead for 2 minutes was part of our aesthetics"".<br>
It is immediately obvious that their words simply make no sense if we assume Lelouch had the code and was immortal. The old argument ""they said he's dead but not that he stayed dead"" with which code theorists try to dismiss the Word of God simply does not hold water at all. (Also, who ever says something as unnatural as ""he died and after that he stayed dead""?)      </p>

<ul>
<li><h3>The Official Guide Book</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>The official guide book explicitly states several times that Lelouch is dead. To avoid too much repetition I will only copy the explanation of the Zero Requiem:    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""For those two who bear the heavy sin known as killing their fathers, they share the belief that they can forgive each other by imposing the greatest punishments on themselves. <strong>Death for Lelouch</strong> who wishes for a tomorrow with his sister, <strong>life for Suzaku</strong> who wishes to atone for his sins through death.""    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This explains that Zero Requiem was not only about creating a better world, but also simultaneously redemption for both Lelouch and Suzaku for their sins (as explained above in the tweets). Lelouch eternally boinking C.C. is NOT redemption, as much as some fans might want that. It is undeniably clear here that Lelouch is truly dead.   </p>

<ul>
<li><h3>The New Epilogue (2009)</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>Unlike the fake fan made epilogue which is going around on the internet (and which I will not give more attention by linking it!) where there's a fan edit which zooms in on the face of the driver and reveals it to be Lelouch, there is actually a real, new epilogue which can be found on the official release of the Zero Requiem blu-ray.<br>
While the fake ending was nowhere to be found except on shady youtube channels from people who were pushing their code theory narrative (If it were real how did THEY get it? And why ONLY they?), the real new epilogue can be found all over the web where you watch anime (look for Zero Requiem movie).<br>
Unlike the fake one where the image quality massively dropped during the edited zoom, the tv logo suddenly disappears, and there is no music during the edit, the real new epilogue has brand new, high quality art, music and <strong>narration by C.C.'s voice actress</strong>.<br>
In this new epilogue, the often misunderstood hay cart scene is dropped and replaced by a new scene where C.C. talks to the audience and explicitly explains that Lelouch is dead, that she mourns his death, but that she finds comfort in the thought that he died achieving his goals.    </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>""A young man dies. He had the power to change the world, to create a new order. The world feared him, hated him. But, I know he died with a smile on his face. Only those who have realised their dream will truly understand that feeling of utter contentment. So, this is not a tragedy. And whenever I feel sad or cry at night, I sing a song. A song of man's making. Zero Requiem!""</em>    </p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Nunnally Did NOT See Memories</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>As if all the official statements about his death aren't enough, the creators even explictly denied some of the core points of code theory, such as Nunnally seeing memories/code visions.   </p>

<p>In <a href=""http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-65848"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mook Animedia</a> (28 January 2009, p.89-90) there was an interview (see 2 pictures below) which explicitly denied that Nunnally was seeing visions or that those images had anything to do with codes or geasses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: <em>""How did Nunnally managed to realize Lelouch true intention, when she touched his hand at the end?""</em></p>
  
  <p>Staff member K: <em>""The way Nunnally can tell that someone is lying, just like she was able to tell that Lohmeyer was lying to her, is that she can feel the hand of the person she is talking to is sweating or lightly trembling. It's nothing like Geass or some special ability like that.""</em></p>
  
  <p>Staff member Y: <em>""Yes. So, she simply came to conclusion [Lelouch was lying] by herself, because of this ability.""</em></p>
  
  <p>Staff member K: <em>""She is Marianne's daughter and Lelouch's little sister. Two months have passed since that defeat of Schneizel and for this two months she's been wondering constantly about what had happened, like ""why it happened?"" and so on. So when she touched Lelouch's hand at the end she felt that he is calm, she put the two and two together and realized the truth. Of course, we know that in anime, it's hard to explain things like that, but yeah, please accept it like this kind of romantic idea we had.""</em></p>

<li><h3>Codes Do NOT Need To Be Activated</h3></li>
</ul>

<p>The release of the Code Geass movies was accompanied by various Code Geass related events, some of these were, obviously, live interviews and live commentary. The following are excerpts from commentaries given by Okouchi, Taniguchi-producer and two other producers when they talked about the scene where Lelouch attempted to geass his father. This was documented by people who were present at these events. To protect the privacy of these people, I have removed all information which would allow them to be identified.</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/vVhX214"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tweet</a> reads パパんにギアス掛けるシーンも、「これギアス掛かってないのに死んだふりするんだよ」「息子を驚かせようと」「ルルーシュくんかわいそう」「これ一番ショックなタイミング計ってるよね」「絶対笑いこらえてるよ」って色々言われてて笑った。   </p>

<p>Translation: About that scene Lelouch geass his dad I laughed because they said like ""He isn't geassed, just pretends he dies!"" "" He tries to surprise his son!"" ""Poor Lelouch"" ""He tries to choose the most shocking timing, doesn't he"" ""I'm sure he tries hard not to laugh""     </p>

<p>This <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/aow8Fmc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog post</a> talks about various Code Geass things, the relevant part is highlighted in red and reads コウジロウさん「この人、ギアスかかってない じゃないですか。よく我慢してますよね。こことか 絶対笑い堪えてますよ」   </p>

<p>Translation: ""He isn't under an influence form Geass, is he? He's good with pretending, sure. I'm sure he tries his hardest not to laugh right now.""</p>

<p>The creators are saying Charles is immune to geass already, that means Charles already had an ""active"" code, which means that codes are never not active and thus don't need activating.    </p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>There's is a mountain of official statements which all repeat the same thing <strong>Lelouch is truly dead</strong>.<br>
When you put all these things next to each other, you see this conclusion is inescapable, consistent and waterproof.    </p>

<p>Some people will argue that the fact that a sequel is coming with Lelouch as the officially confirmed protagonist is proof that he's alive/immortal, but it is, in fact, the exact opposite. The official name of this sequel is ""Lelouch of the <strong>Resurrection""</strong>. when you combine all the official statement about him being truly dead, him returning for the sequel and the sequel's name, it is obvious that Lelouch will start as dead in the sequel and will somehow be resurrected, he'll return from the grave somehow.    </p>

<p>Some people will argue that the sequel is an AU (alternate universe) which somehow must mean Lelouch is immortal. It is indeed true that the sequel will follow the movies and not the original series, and these movies have 1 BIG difference with the original series which makes it an AU. However, this change does not directly involve Lelouch, Zero Requiem still happens, Lelouch still dies, so as far as the movies show, all of the statements about R2 also apply to the sequel.</p>

<p>This summary of official statements was based on a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/GeassedbyLelouch/comments/8hklfr/evaluating_code_theory_main_body_index/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compilation post</a> from reddit. The compilation post consists of 2 parts, part 1 gathers all the official statements, part 2 shows how the anime itself contradicts code theory because code theory violates the rules established by the anime's canon.<br>
That post is very long (even linger than this answer), but it is thorough and complete, and an absolute MUST READ for all Code Geass fans.</p>

<p>When faced with such a massive amount of official statements which all repeat that Lelouch is truly dead, combined with the fact that the anime itself contradicts core points of code theory, why do so many people still cling to the debunked theory?<br>
Wouldn't it be more respectful to Lelouch, to the anime and to the creators to accept the work that was made the way it was made? Especially because the creators made a point of it that Lelouch's death was a matter of principle for them. </p>

I would argue that the way Giriko's Fullbring works is very inconsistent, but am hoping for a decent explanation. The first time we see his power, he attaches a timer to a box while training Ichigo. The next time we see it, he shoots projectiles at Ginjo. The third time, he uses a dial on his shoulder to get massive (big and green like hulk it seemed to reference). </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: How does his power <em>actually</em> work? Is there some link to each of this uses that I missed? Can you give me an answer that is not full of loopholes?</p>

"What do smaller eyes persons in anime mean?","<p>As we know, japaneses have smaller eyes than western people, as the result of an evolutive adaptation against snow blindessness apparently. But in anime, japaneses draw japaneses with big eyes. If an american cartoon would draw a character with smaller eyes, it probably would mean he's japanese, korean, chinese, etc. Though sometimes, japanese draw anime characters with smaller eyes. What does it mean for them?  Does it mean the character is from some area, is old, or what?</p>

"Attack on titan chapter 79: possible flaw?","<p>In Shingeki No Kyojin's latest chapter (chapter 79), beast titan throws a stone like he is playing baseball. But the story takes place in a time when baseball wasn't even known. These are the pictures:</p>

<p>Or could it mean that Reiner, Bertolt, Annie and the beast titan are from a different time-line? (I don't think it's possible. If that's the case, they could have just used nuclear bombs instead of titans).</p>

"Boruto's Right Eye","<p>So, I have watched the first 3 episodes of Boruto already, and they seem interesting so far. But being a person who watched the Boruto movie first, I have a lot of questions in my mind. One of them is about Boruto's right eye. Whenever he unintentionally activated his right eye, he is able to see chakra, just like the Byakugan, except it can't see complex chakra flows.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ex2rX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ex2rX.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

"Why is Kong using a Japanese surname?","<p>In the epilogue to <em>Ping Pong</em>, we see this newspaper headline.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/U7I9R.jpg"" alt=""newspaper headline about Kong Wenge""></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Five years after naturalization, finally a ticket to the Olympics for Tsujido Wenge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I don't know Japanese, but I can kind of read this at the very beginning of the Japanese text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>辻堂文革（中国名 孔文革）</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This translates to</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tsujido Wenge (Chinese name Kong Wenge)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This suggests that Kong Wenge is known as ""Tsujido Wenge"" in Japan. This is because it doesn't make sense for 中国名 to simply be referring to the Chinese characters (the kanji) for his actual name to me, given the ""中国"" (i.e. ""China"" or ""Chinese"" in the sense of nationality), but again, I don't know Japanese.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any in-universe reason for this discrepancy?</strong> Perhaps since he wants to play for Japan, he's better off with a Japanese surname? I think the school Kong played for was Tsujido, and this also seems relevant.</p>

"What does Shu's void tell us about his personality?","<p>In Guilty Crown, Shu finally uses his own void in the end (last episode, if not mistaken). A void is basically a physical manifestation of a person's heart. So what does Shu's void (I'm not mentioning what his void is, for the fear of spoiling it for someone), really tell us about his character and personality ? Also Inori's void being the huge 'Singer's Sword', would reflect  a bold and aggressive personality, whereas she is the exact opposite of that. So how exactly do the voids reflect the person's character and nature(if they do, at all..) ?</p>

As I continue to watch the show, I see during the initial transformation they are ""stronger and more powerful"" but then later once the character returns back into the transformation, all that has changed was the hair colour, I am now starting to think that a super sayian 1 is just as strong as a SSGodSS,  and goku only uses SSGSS because he likes his hair to look blue, </p>

<li>this shows how much stronger a SSgod is compared to a regular sayain right?? Like a whole nother level!!! </li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Goku as a SSGodSS (blue hair) actually scared Berus as goku was able to match Berus""s level</p>

<ul>
<li>GODLY!!!</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>With that being said, goku should have no problem as a super sayian blue fighting with brolly, who is one step past SS1 and under a SS2 level, - to me I cannot make sense of this??? Unless dB super is trying to say, brolly is stronger then Berus, ssgss goku and vegeta, and if that is the case, then what's the point of having a SS2, SS3, SSGod, SSGSS, or now Ultra Instinct which I know is not a real SS transformation? </p>

<p>I honestly expect as a SSGSS goku should struggle against real strong enemies, but up against a Lower class sayian transformation goku should be wiping the floor with them. </p>

<p>I like brolly and always have, but there is just no way, he should be able to even see gokus movements when is blue, along with Berus. So I feel like the God transformation is being so undercut it's not funny and is actually making me a bit upset with the series,</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, they gave brolly 3 movies, in which it didn't take the strength of a SSGodSS to defeat him! 3 normal ss took him on, plus some help with the Z fighters team to be live punching bags. </p>

<p>I'm confident that a SSblueSS Kamehameha point blank range at brollys face should leave brolly headless </p>

"How does Renji become stronger than Rukia?","<p>I only have the anime to go on so maybe there's an explanation in the manga. It seems clear that Ichigo is stronger than Rukia was in episode 1 at the point of his first battle with Renji. In fact it seems like Ichigo may have been stronger as soon as he became a soul reaper, but based on Rukia's reaction to the stronger enemies up to that point (Menos Grande, and Grand Fisher) it seems she believes that a single shinigami could hope to win in cases where Ichigo does. This seems to imply that Ichigo is stronger than Rukia ever was at that point. Then Ichigo fights Renji and is at least closely matched. It's difficult to say that at the point where Ichigo gains the upper hand whether he is stronger or weaker than when he was fighting stronger enemies in the past but it does seem like Ichigo and Renji, at their first meeting, are at roughly the same strength which is greater than Rukia's at the beginning of the series.</p>

<p>But in episode 32 where Renji has his flashback to his time in the Rukon district and training to be a shinigami it seems clear that Rukia was always stronger than he was. So then how do we explain this discrepancy? Did Renji get significantly stronger in the few months Rukia was in the world of the living? Is there any particular reason for that? Or am I underestimating how strong Rukia was at the start?</p>

"How does the equivalent exchange of alchemy work?","<p>Alchemy, in Full Metal Alchemist, is based on the concept of 'one needs to provide materials of equal value compared to the thing one want to create' (equivalent exchange).</p>

<p>But, how does it exactly work.
Can this amount of required materials be calculated by the alchemist? If so, how? Are there some sort of lookup-tables?</p>

<p>Or does one need to guess and provides something of more value to be on the safe side? If so, can one become a more skilled alchemist by experience of successful guesses?</p>

<p>Also, different alchemists might have different specialized skills. How does that work? For the guessing part, I can imagine that one have a preference for certain kinds of alchemy and thus gain experience with a specialized skill.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/106/51"">Madara Uchiha</a>'s answer suggests that there are always materials required. I was also wondering about the situation where this is not the case and the alchemist was successful none the less.</p>

<p>If she had continued on as an errand boy, the debt would have been paid off eventually... even if it took years. </p>

<p>The hosts don't charge any of their customers, and even if they did... Tamaki tells Haruhi she only needs to get 100 customers for her debt to be erased, and unless they were charging a fortune 100 customers wouldn't even come close to paying off her debt. </p>

<p>So, what's in this deal for Tamaki? At the time of the 100 customer arrangement he's not attracted to her, he still thinks she's a boy. So it can't be that he just wants to keep her around. </p>

<p>Is it a personal challenge for Tamaki to see if he can train the ""commoner"" well enough to get 100 customers? </p>

<p>What's his reasoning?</p>

"Is the Dragon Ball Super manga ""more faithful"" to Akira Toriyama ideas than the anime?","<p>After hearing some dragon ball youtubers I remember one of them told that Akira Toriyama gives a bullet list of ideas he wants the anime and the manga artist Toyotaro to follow and then they have some freedom to develop the story, this is why we see differences in techniques, events, the order the characters are eliminated in the tournament of power, and by whom etc. But then, another youtuber, a spanish speaking one with 1,3 million followers said that aside of giving the primary ideas of the story, Akira gives some sort of supervision in the manga. Is this so? Is the Dragon Ball Super manga ""more faithful"" to Akira Toriyama ideas than the anime?</p>

"Why is the boot camp for the Survey Corps 3 years long? Because Japanese High School?","<p>At the ends of s01e02, the recruits are given a speech when joining the Survey Corps by Keith Shadis, and he says that they will be training for 3 years before they are expected to fight any Titans.</p>

<p>Why does it take 3 years to train a Survey Corp member?  That seems like a good deal for all the refugees and should have caused their ranks to swell, especially with the now overflowing motivation of urgency.  Three years of food and housing is nothing to sneeze at in those conditions.</p>

<p>For reference, most modern militaries have boot camps at most a few months long.   US military boot camps range from 6 - 13 weeks depending on the branch of the service. Advanced non-infantry job training may take longer.  Modern special forces may go through a number of schools after basic training, but still less than 3 years worth.  Historically, boot camps were much shorter and less organized.</p>

<p>Three years seems like an especially long time for a para/military boot camp, though it does correspond to the length of time in attendance at a Japanese high school, which is also a common setting for anime.  Is this more than a coincidence?</p>

"Why does Yoruichi say, ""No one there could have survived a fight against Byakuya,"" in Bleach chapter 120?","<p>In chapter 116 of the <em>Bleach</em> manga, Ichigo finally meets Rukia in her tower (well, in fact, on the bridge) right after Byakuya has easily defeated Ganjyu, and Ukitake stopped him from finishing Ganjyu off. </p>

<p>However, when Ichigo tries to fight Byakuya, Yoruichi hits him in the stomach, and runs away carrying Ichigo. A little later, in chapter 120, when Ichigo complains about it, she says that he ""had no chance of surviving that fight"", and that ""no one could have survived a fight against Byakuya"". </p>

<p>While I have no doubt that Ichigo in his condition was no match for Byakuya, that phrase still confuses me. I can understand why Yoruichi thinks she would not be able to do it, since she has been in cat form for a long time, and mentions that she had ""gone a lot weaker"". However, Ukitake was on the bridge as well, and since we know he's a kind man, it is safe to assume that he would try to stop Byakuya from killing people (as he did for Ganjyu). </p>

<p>So did Yoruichi imply that Ukitake is also weaker than Byakuya, and had no chance of surviving a fight with him either? Wouldn't that be <em>really</em> debatable?</p>

<p>Why are these three translations so different? 'Tyrant's Eye' is easy enough to see; the meaning is close to the literal translation, and it sounds better in English. But why is the official translation so far off?  Is there some ambiguity in the original Japanese that makes this hard to translate? Or did the official translators drop the ball?</p>

"Will a person die when their name is written in the situation of death?","<p>The answer by Imprfectluck at <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/21659/6166"">this question</a> made me wonder what would happen to people whose name was written down in the details of another persons death. For example: <em>John Doe dies after his date with Jane Doe</em>. The foremost basic rule of the Death Note states that <code>The human whose name is written in this note shall die</code>. <strong>So will Jane Doe die?</strong></p>

<p>We additionally have rule LIV that states that if you write the cause and details of death on a different page, you need to be thinking of the original victim and would not be able to think both of John and Jane at the same time. This would indicate that you have to choose what will happen. Either you think of John and the details happen, either you think of Jane and she dies. Does a similar rule exist when writing on the same page? Or is writing someone's name in the details of another's death just an exception to that first rule?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to make the Death Note take effect, the victim's name must be written on the same page, but the cause of death and situation around the death can be described in other pages of Death Note. <strong>This will work as long as the person that writes in the Death Note keeps the specific victims name in mind when writing the cause and situation of death.</strong> </p>

"What is the origin of this alternate ending to Captain Tsubasa?","<p>A while back, I stumbled upon <a href=""http://youtu.be/ol1-my6VeZE"">this video</a> which shows an ending to the Captain Tsubasa series. However, I quickly found out that it is not the real ending.  </p>

<p>In this video (which is in Spanish, I could not find the same video in English), we see a young Tsubasa playing with a football, which eventually ends up on the road, leading to Tsubasa being run over by a truck. It then jumps to a scene where Japan is playing Brazil in what seems to be a final. Finally, it jumps to a scene where we see an older Tsubasa lying in an hospital bed.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the video, a subtitle goes by saying something similar to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the closest to another ending in which Oliver (Tsubasa) has no legs in the hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I ended up finding <a href=""http://youtu.be/W18R3PbRiss"">another video</a> (also in Spanish) that elaborates on the story.</p>

<p>It explains that on the first chapter of the original manga, Tsubasa is hit by that same truck from the other video, but since he has a football, the impact is absorbed by it. He then starts to think of the football as his friend, and so the story we know unravels.</p>

<p>The video then states that in the final against Brazil, after Tsubasa scores a goal, the scene jumps to him waking up in the hospital and hugging his mother, telling him that they had won. The video states that if we look close enough, we will notice Tsubasa has no legs, because he really lost them in that accident, and is just waking up from a coma, having imagined all of the storyline. The video even states that there is a theory that this might have been part of the original plan by the author, since the word 'dream' is present in many of the titles, basically claiming that this is the original ending to the series.</p>

<hr>

<p>All the information regarding this alternate video seems to be in Spanish, and I have not found much relevant info in English. The <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/forums/meme-research/topics/11348-the-true-super-campeonescaptain-tsubasa-ending-creepypastafan-fiction"">few English sources I found</a> state this is fan-made.

So if they are not born, but made, this means that Death and other creators originally decided what type of weapon they needed, and created accordingly. Assumedly, they could they have done this with any item, not just a weapon- thus, is there something canon that says they <em>have</em> to be weapons?  </p>

<p>(Surely there were other items that could have been of use instead of pure offense. Shields, armor- with the exception of Tsubaki's and Black Star's Shield Star. This brings into question what is needed for a good team balance in a fight, which is out of scope of this question.)</p>

  <p>I'm one of the dime-a-dozen top figure skaters certified by the JSF. I'm 23. My name makes me sound strong, but I finished last at my first Grand Prix Final. I still can't accept what happened! I even moved to a training facility in Detroit and worked hard to make the final.</p>

"Was the titan in the last episode of AOT S1 inside of the wall or on the other side? Also about walls origin","<p>First, is the titan really inside of the wall like being trapped in it or just doing his/its job (lol)? I thought it was on the other side ever since because I have seen many comments/texts using the word ""inside"" which is very confusing.</p>

<p>Also it was said so far in the anime (currently S2 E6), that walls are (possibly?) made of titans' ""crystals"" making it pretty much indestructible, so doesn't that mean that titans aren't neccessarily inside of the walls since it would make the plot point a very funny one.</p>

<p>I am also confused as to how the walls are said to be ""indestructible"" like titans' crystals except certain parts like ""entrances/exits"", but some titans are seen to be able to pretty much destroy wall parts that are said to be indestructible like how (the collosal titan destroyed some parts of it) not sure if it really did though? </p>

"What is Toji's ""accent""?","<p>I was reading a scanlation of the <em>Evangelion</em> manga and noticed that Toji <em>consistently</em> uses a lot of ""informal""-sounding speech.

For example, from ch. 20: ""Ikari! Yer not allowed ta look!""</p>

<p>Later, Asuka accidentally provokes someone at the arcade. Someone, possibly Suzuhara, tells Toji to talk to the angered man because both have the same ""accent"". Thus, it seems unlikely that Toji's language is similar to, for example, Shinji's, when he asks Toji ""Whadda mean?"" after being asked about his exchange with Rei in the same chapter. In other words, it does not sound like Toji's habits fall within the ""normal"" bounds of variation in how people are supposed to talk.</p>

<p>The part I found intriguing with both of these CMs was that Kyouko is animated at the end of these commericals, even though (as of writing) there is no plan for an animated version of the series. The animation is credited to Shaft, which is unsurprising since Shaft is responsible for animating the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogatari_(series)"" rel=""nofollow"">Monogatari series</a> by the same author.

</ol>

<p><strong><em>Is it a coincidence that Big Mom has the exact same devil fruit ability as Mother Caramel?</em></strong> Or could it be the case that Mother Carmel was eaten by Big Mom?</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>If we assume (1) to be true, can we also assume that eating Devil Fruit Users will give a person the ability of the fruit?</li>
</ol>

<p>If so, is it required to eat the entire devil fruit user, or would the person need ""only a bite"", like how only a bite is enough to attain the abilities from the fruits?</p>

"How many continuities are there in Dragon Ball?","<p>The new movie is going to retcon the old Broly movies. This made me think how many continuities do we have in Dragon Ball.</p>

<ul>
<li>The old anime series and/or manga were one (or two?)</li>

<li>Dragon Ball GT</li>
<li>Dragon Ball Heroes. How many continuities do we have in this set? There are 2 mangas written by different persons and one anime. is it 1,2 or 3?</li>
<li>Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F. They are different than the anime and manga versions.</li>
<li>Dragon Ball Super anime is different than the Dragon Ball Super manga. Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken, Super Saiyan Rage, Ultra Instinct Omen and Super Saiyan Blue Evolution exists in the anime but not in the manga. </li>
<li>And what about the new movie? Does it fit with the anime continuity, with the manga continuity or it's a new continuity?</li>
<li>What about the spinoffs? (Jaco, Yamcha manga, etc.) What about the Tv specials? </li>
</ul>

<p>To know which stories are independent of the others is important to understand any Dragon Ball story.</p>

<p>Examples and or clues that he's a pet:</p>

<ol>
<li>Teaches him tricks</li>
<li>Takes baths with him (not a lot of people do but a lot of little kids do)</li>
<li>Calls him ""boy"" (Like, ""Here boy!"")</li>
<li>He was given to Kiba at a very young age by Kiba's mother (something that happens a lot in real life)</li>
<li>They lived together for (you could say) their whole life so they're like family (something that also happens in real life)</li>
<li>They play together (something you will do with a friend or pet)</li>
<li>Kiba cares a lot about Akamaru that he will do anything to protect him (something that a lot of people do for their pets)</li>
</ol>

<p>The list goes on and on. I've been looking up stuff, but haven't found anything that says he's his pet. It only says he's his partner, comrade, friend, etc.</p>

<p>When I look up, ""Kiba and his pet"", then go to images, it shows (at least the first couple of pictures) Kiba and Akamaru.</p>

"What happens in the end of The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi?","<p>I was watching <em>The Disappearance of Suzumiya Haruhi</em>, and the scene when Asakura attack Kyon is rather confusing. So this is what happens:</p>

  <p>After Kyon has a mental struggle with himself, when he was about to shoot normal-Nagato with the device that android-Nagato gave to him, he suddenly got attacked by Asakura. She stabbed him twice, and when Asakura was about to kill him, suddenly Nagato (perhaps the android one?) saved him. And when he was about to lose consciousness, young and old Asahina come. And then someone (perhaps future Kyon?) comes. After that he loses consciousness.</p>
  
  <p>Later, he woke up at the hospital with Koizumi. And when Kyon asked what happen, he said he fell down the stairs at school. But Kyon seems to know what really happened before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I have to guess, this is what I think happened:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After Kyon recovers from his injury, he, Asahina, and android-Nagato travel back to the past, and save the past Kyon after he got stabbed, and Nagato alters some memories about the incident so Koizumi didn't know anything about it, and they travel back to the current time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that's what happened, why he didn't save himself back then before he got stabbed? What's the point of giving an antidote for Nagato to Kyon? And why did Nagato give false memories about the incident to Koizumi? What exactly happened here?</p>

"Is that jutsu really the Edo Tensei?","<p>I know the title probably needs to be changed, but I wasn't sure how to put it spoiler-free.<br>
The question follows as a block, for its 'spoilery' nature for anyone who hasn't seen Naruto Shippuden up to episode 290.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In this episode Kabuto summons several shinobi using <a href=""http://www.leafninja.com/ninjutsu-03.php#Edo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edo Tensei</a>. For this jutsu we know that a living body to act as receptacle and a piece of DNA from the one being revived are needed. The summoner will then use a tag to control the summoned soul's personality.<br>
 Kabuto explains to Naruto and Sakura that the water in the ""Hole"" is so rich that he was able to create life with those weird snakes embedded with Orochimaru's chakra. I assume this means that the body that comes out of the water is the living body that serves as sacrifice. I assume this because Hidan's eyes look like those of the ones summoned by Edo Tensei. And afterwards Kabuto inserts a tag in this Hidan, to control his personality.<br>
 Considering that Hidan was really summoned by Edo Tensei, however, there is the fact that his body does not look 'complete'. But then again, I don't think we've ever seen a naked Edo Tensei summoned body, so we cannot be sure if this is normal or not.<br>
<br>
 So basically:<br>
 <strong>Is this some weird jutsu that really <em>looks like</em> Edo Tensei?</strong><br>
 <strong>Or should we assume that Hidan as died and this was <em>really</em> Edo Tensei?</strong> (It <em>is</em> possible that Hidan is dead, if you take into consideration what is explained in <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/209/what-is-hidans-source-of-power/211#211"">this</a> answer)</p>

"Is the Manias version of ""Sanki Tousen"" available as a single?","<h1>Question</h1>

<p>Has the Manias version of ""Sanki Tousen"" been made available for sale, or, alternatively, is there an announcement that it will not be made available for sale? It is, notably, not part of <a href=""http://vgmdb.net/album/64457"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Akiba's Collection""</a>, unlike all the other EDs.</p>

<h1>Background context</h1>

<p>So, in <em>Akiba's Trip: The Animation</em>, there are these three characters, Mayonaka Matome, Denkigai Niwaka, and Arisa Ahokainen. Within the show, they form an idol unit called ""Manias"". </p>

<p>These three characters are voiced, respectively, by TAKAHASHI Rie, KOUNO Marika, and NAGAKU Yuki. In real life, they constitute an idol unit called ""Earphones"". </p>

<p>The ""trademark"" song of the Manias, so to speak, is a song titled ""Sanki Tousen"" (サンキトウセン). They perform this song as an insert in episode 3 and again in episode 11. ""Sanki Tousen"" performed by Manias is the ED for episode 4.</p>

<p>Separately, Earphones (the real-life idol unit) performs this same song as the ED for episode 3. The Earphones version of ""Sanki Tousen"" is track #3 on the album <a href=""http://vgmdb.net/album/64457"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Akiba's Collection""</a>.</p>

<p>You might be sitting there wondering why I'm asking this question, given that I've just pointed out that Manias and Earphones consist of exactly the same people. What difference could there possibly be between the two versions of the song? </p>

<p>Well, it turns out that the Manias version is discernibly sung in-character, while the Earphones version isn't. This is easiest to detect with Nagaku Yuki, whose character voice (Arisa) differs most significantly from her regular singing voice. A careful comparison of the two versions of the Arisa solo verse that begins ""<em>seseragi</em>"" will make it clear that the two versions are subtly different.</p>

"Why is King Arthur female? Why is Iskander tall?","<p>I've watched both the Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night anime (including the Unlimited Blade Works movie), but none of the visual novels, so no spoilers from that unless they are light spoilers. One thing that bothered me was that despite the fact that heroic spirits are defined by the public opinion/view of them, some heroes had qualities that were in direct opposition of what the public thought.</p>

<p>We know that heroic spirits, being sealed on their Throne of Heroes, are meant to be completely unchanged. This is the entire point of the Throne of Heroes. But this seems to be in opposition of the previous fact that heroic spirits are defined by what others think they are. Then there are Counter Guardians who are completely different, I believe, in that they are not sealed on their Throne of Heroes.</p>

<p>One particularly important Counter Guardian of the series is Arturia, or Saber. Arturia is female, despite the fact that she was treated by even her contemporaries as male, and has gone done in history as male. In fact, there isn't even any small hint as to Arturia's gender being anything other than male in our history, or the history of the Nasuverse (I believe). This being true, shouldn't Arturia be male?</p>

<p>This not being the case shouldn't Arturia be erased, or else create instability in the World? Same with Iskander. In history he is known for being pretty short, even for a Macedonian. That he is very tall means there is an incongruity with human knowledge and true fact.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the Unlimited Blade Works movie Archer is revealed to be Heroic Spirit Emiya. If Heroic Spirit Emiya is summoned before he is even a hero, or acquired his gift from the World, etc., then how is it that Heroic Spirit Emiya is even strong at all? The power of a Servant being based on their popularity at the time of their summoning, Emiya should be weaker than pretty much every other Servant, and then some.</p>

"Oblivious life-threateningly terrible cooks?","<p>There are quite a few anime, manga, and JRPGs that have a character who, at one point, offers to (or in some cases has to) cook for the other characters and is often convinced they are at least decent. They end up poisoning the others by mistake. It's often played for laughs that this person is shockingly bad, but (often) completely unaware. Usually, this person is a woman or girl. It's mildly amusing,<sup>(citation needed)</sup> but it happens in so many stories, it seems any show going long enough needs to have this joke in it.</p>

"who are Stripism a parody of?","<p>One of the most popular anime shows in Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed is Stripism. Here's a screenshot of them in-game (in their own game).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MB9Ve.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Knowing Akiba's Trip and its countless references, I can't think that this isn't a reference to some magical girl series. Unfortunately, I don't know enough magical girl series - and there isn't much info about the girls on the internet.</p>

<p>I'm somewhat inclined to think they're a parody of Pretty Cure because of their vibrant colour scheme, but it's got a load of different series so I'm not sure if they are or not.</p>

"Could you avoid to die due to the death note if you have no heart in your body?","<p>Death note states that if there's no other way a person would die due to a heart attack, but what if when you should die via the death note you have no heart? And no, that's not a silly question, there's a machine used for heart tranplant surgery called extracorporeal circulation system that acts as a sort of heart for the person in which the surgery is being performed on while it's done. So, technically speaking if your name where to be written you could not die due to a heart attack, unless that by heart we would also consider that machine, although this is a bit far fetched. Then if you get another heart or put yours back you have avoided the death note effect, and at this point it has failed to its own rules. From this point I'm not sure what would happen.</p>

<p>I don't think something like that was covered either in the anime or the manga, although I think it would have been an interesting concept to explore, as they could have experimented with that if they wished, but maybe the author explained how things would be like in a case like this one in an interview.</p>

"Thematic or mood effects of shadow placement on a character's face?","<p>Not sure if this is on topic here as it's not a question about a specific manga... or even specifically about manga, but about comic books in general.</p>

<p>The use of shadow is important for conveying lots of different things... mood of a person, setting or simply for dramatic effect. I am wondering specifically, in a close up shot of a face in the classic 3/4 position, <em>what is the difference if the face is in shadow in the foreground versus on the background side?</em></p>

<p>For this assume the only difference in the drawing is the placement of shadow, the position expression and amount or surface covered in shadow are the same. The only difference is shadow on the side facing the viewer versus the side away from the viewer.</p>

<p>Here is my poorly drawn example of what I am thinking in my head:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qt7XH.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

"Did Ranma lose his (her?) virginity in the Ranma 1/2 anime series?","<p>Remembering old anime series we happened to talk about Ranma 1/2 and the amount of sexual jokes it had. I then remembered that the show was emitted in Spain with a lot of controversy, and then I came across an article from the 90s, published in a major newspaper, that charged against the show and the channel emitting it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the episode in which Ranma loses his virginity in the showers (the kid comes out tripping over, in shock), [...].</p>

<p>I sincerely cannot remember such moment. I am almost sure that the person who wrote the article just saw something that nobody else saw. I know that some years later, when Karekano was emitted in Japan, there was a lot of controversy and debate about the scene where it is poetically suggested that the two main characters lose their virginities with each other, I supposed because that was the first time that such thing was depicted in an anime series with teenagers as main characters. So I doubt that a similar scene really happened in Ranma 1/2.</p>

"Why do the names of the Sankakusu sites match the surnames of Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto?","<p>In ep. 2 of season 3 of <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em>, Mamoru says that the amusement park Chibi-Usa is going to is in Sankakusu, which is on reclaimed land. Later, Artemis tells Luna that there are three reclaimed sites that comprise Sankakusu: Tenohzu, Kaiohzu, and Meiohzu.</p>

<p>It struck me that the romanised forms of these three sites can be produced by appending ""-zu"" to each of the surnames of the Outer Senshi (excluding Saturn). (The civilian names of the Guardians concerned are Haruka <em>Tenoh</em>, Michiru <em>Kaioh</em>, and Setsuna <em>Meioh</em>.) After some experimenting with romanization schemes (<code>tenohzu</code>, which is the official romanisation, does not produce useful search results, but <code>tenouzu</code> produced a lead) and running some searches, I found <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20160413011900/http://galaxycosmos.tumblr.com/post/49479674510/christianity-in-sailor-moons-infinity-arc"" rel=""nofollow"">someone</a> who claims that these three sites have the kanji 天王洲, 海王洲, and 冥王洲 respectively. In each case, the first two characters correspond to the surnames of the Senshi that I named earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any in-universe reason for this correspondence between the names of the sites and these Senshi's surnames?</strong> (I might shrug away ""Kaiohzu Park"", which appears in ep. 7 of <em>Sailor Moon S</em> as a one-off coincidence, but it would be unlikely if <em>all</em> three names matched up by chance.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It makes sense that Haruka and Michiru have helicopters that are named Tenohmaru and Kaiohmaru, <em>since they own these helicopters</em>, but it seems doubtful that they would have plots of land named after them.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps their identities are completely made-up, and the surnames came <em>after</em> the sites were named? (Perhaps they chose their new identities based on the names of the sites?) However, at least in <em>Sailor Moon S</em>, the identity ""Haruka Tenoh"" seems to have existed even before Haruka became Sailor Uranus (per the characterisation in the flashback of ep. 17 of <em>Sailor Moon S</em>), even if it makes sense that Sailor Pluto would need a new identity (not being from the present).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>As an aside, with slight spoilers for <em>Sailor Moon S</em>:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It makes sense that Saturn is excluded. Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto consistently work together in <em>Sailor Moon S</em>, whereas Saturn only appears towards the end of that season. I imagine that this might also be the case in the manga and <em>SMC</em>. Moreover, it's clear that at least Saturn has a  real-life identity that has not been falsified.</p>

<p>This seems to imply that she covers up her tattoo to look more ""normal"" in public, but if that's the case, why wouldn't she be covering up the tattoo earlier? Or is the assumption that she covers up in public not correct?

  <p>To perform this technique, the user must first acquire some of the DNA of the person they intend to reincarnate.

The soul of the intended reincarnated must also reside in the pure world (浄土, jōdo); for example, those whose souls have been consumed by the Death God cannot be reincarnated. However, if it is a case where the souls are freed from inside the Shinigami, then a user of this technique is free to reincarnate them once again.</p>

<p>Quoting directly from Wikipedia:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word ""swastika"" comes from the Sanskrit swastika - ""su"" meaning ""good,"" ""asti"" meaning ""to be,"" and ""ka"" as a suffix. The swastika literally means <strong>""to be good""</strong>. Or another translation can be made: ""swa"" is ""higher self"", ""asti"" meaning ""being"", and ""ka"" as a suffix, so the translation can be interpreted as <strong>""being with higher self""</strong>.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both these translations would fit (at least according to my interpretation) the secondary purpose of the Juinjutsu:<br>
- <strong>To be good</strong>: the secondary function of the Juinjutsu is to control the branch house members, which is to 'make them good' (at least to make them submit themselves to the main house members' will).<br>
- <strong>Being with higher self</strong>: the Juinjutsu links the branch house members ('lower self') with the main house members ('higher self').</p>

<strong>If this resemblance is purely coincidental? Or if the seal is <em>really</em> a swastika?</strong></p>

<p>It's not entirely clear to me whether the first movie covers the anime series and the other two are new content, or whether the three movies are supposed to be recaps of the whole series (maybe there are supposed to be three anime seasons of Ajin, and each of the movies recaps one of them?).</p>

<p>What's the relation between the manga, the anime series, and the movies (given that two of the three movies haven't been released yet, that part may be harder to answer)? Are the adaptations faithful to the manga?</p>

There are some exceptions, such as <em>Love, Chunibyo &amp; Other Delusions</em> where an ONA was released of it before a full anime and <em>Toaru Hikūshi e no Koiuta</em> where the manga began a month after the anime. A lot of other LNs are never turned into anime at all, including ones that exist in otherwise existing anime canons (eg the light novels set in the Naruto canon). </p>

<p>Are the ones that are made into a manga first done so to determine if they'll be financially successful in visual form, and that's why they're not made directly into anime?

<p>If so, does that mean Historia Reiss would have become a titan of the same size (or maybe even bigger since she would have been injected with the whole serum unlike Rod Reiss that only licked a bit) as her father?</p>

<p>That would kill Eren and Rod seeing as everyone died when Ross transformed except the ones protected by the hardening ability and Kenny who managed to get out but died short after from injuries as seen in the recent episode.</p>

<p>She wouldn't even be able to eat Eren that way and take his titan shifting power and the coordinate since he would be vaporized by all the heat and burried under the wreckage. So she would stay as a mindless titan.</p>

<p>I don't think Rod would want to die by it too so either he didn't knew it would be that big since the other times the ceremony happened the titan was smaller, or she simply wouldn't become that big (for some unexplainable reason or something that I'm not aware of).</p>

Quality may not be objectively measurable, but quality-as-perceived-by-the-consumer certainly is. Technical merits of the production (e.g. sakuga, sound direction, etc.) are important in this context only insofar as they factor into the ""Rotten Tomatoes ratings"" here.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> For ease, let's restrict ourselves to thinking about anime that run for one year or less (so no Naruto, Bleach, Yugimanz, etc.), and treat anime as belonging exclusively to the season in which they began airing (so e.g. all of Shingeki no Kyojin counts as a spring anime). </p>

<p><sup>3</sup> I can substantiate this claim if need be, both by reference to user ratings on sites like MAL and by reference to more subjective impressions by commentators who know a thing or two about anime. That said, I'm sure those of you who have a finger on the pulse of the anime-osphere probably have more or less the same impression. </p>

"What exactly is Sugimoto's relationship to Kawasaki?","<p>In chapters 18-19 of <em>Aoi Hana</em>, it is revealed that the third-year Yasuko Sugimoto is moving to England with Ayako Kawasaki, her co-star in Fujigaya's production of <em>Wuthering Heights</em>. The discussion surrounding this revelation gives a romantic undertone to this relationship &mdash; a newspaper headline is shown with ""Catherine Heathcliff Honeymoon in England."" It is unclear whether this should be taken any more seriously than straight teenage girls who proclaim to be ""married to"" or ""engaged to"" or ""dating"" their close female friends. (I personally assumed that there was potential for a relationship, but that it probably would not develop in that direction.)</p>

<p>Later, during Akira and Fumi's second year, Sugimoto visits Japan and has a conversation with Kyouko Ikumi in ch. 32, in which Kawasaki is mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ikumi: &hellip; And do you have any plans with Kawasaki-sempai?</p>
  
  <p>Sugimoto: Huh? I see her all the time over there. I'm not going to go out of my way to see her here.</p>
  
  <p>Ikumi: So that's how things are between you? How nice. I like that sort of relationship.</p>
  
  <p>Sugimoto: Well, we're taking it slow over there &hellip; Letting our love blossom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sugimoto's final comment suggested to me that there is indeed something between her and Kawasaki. However, in ch. 52, which depicts the events around Ikumi's wedding, we are told that Kawasaki is in the hospital with appendicitis. We also learn from Ryouko Ueda that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Right now, her boyfriend and her roommate are looking after her [Kawasaki].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5xXD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The panel</a> also shows a character who clearly is not Sugimoto and who is probably male.</p>

<p>With this in mind, was Sugimoto <em>ever</em> romantically involved with Kawasaki, and if so, do we know anything about what happened to their relationship or why Kawasaki now has a boyfriend? Alternatively, am I misinterpreting something in the exchange with Ikumi?</p>

"Aptitude for Busoshoku?","<p>My question is about busoshoku haki or coat of arms as people like to call it. Until the last episode I thought haki was something that required intensive training to master. But in the last episode </p>

<p>For those who haven't watched spoilers:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Sabo was shown wielding busoshoku against a small army at 17. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I only started reading the manga in the zou arc so I'm not sure if this is filler or cannon but is it safe to assume then that some people just have an aptitude for mastering buso quickly? I mean only a small percentage of people are capable of using haoshoku so it seems like it makes sense. </p>

<p>But it took Luffy two years to perfect it and I'm not even sure if Ace ever learned it. Does anyone have any feedback on this?</p>

<p>Kazuki's body doesn't seem to have aged though it may be difficult to tell. Either way, that doesn't give any new information.</p>

<li>Likewise a body in a vegetative state would continue to age at the normal rate.</li>
<li>A newly grown body can be given an arbitrary look and age.</li>

"Why all the ""Re"" in titles?","<p>There have been quite a number of series whose English titles use peculiar forms of <strong>Re</strong>. I don't mean normal usages like <em>Rebirth</em> or <em>Requiem</em>. Here's some I chose from an <a href=""https://myanimelist.net/anime.php?letter=R&amp;show=50"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alphabetical listing at MAL</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Re Boot</li>
<li>Re-Kan</li>
<li>Re: Cutie Honey</li>
<li>Re:_Hamatora</li>
<li>Re:Creators</li>
<li>RE:Map</li>
<li>Re:Zero (and several spin-off series)</li>
<li>ReLIFE</li>
<li>Rewrite (although normal, seems to conceptually fit here)</li>
<li>Re:Monster</li>
<li>Tokyo Ghoul:re</li>
</ol>

<p>It is likely that some of these are just using the prefix ""re"" as often done in English, to mean either ""again"" or ""concerning"". What makes these seem odd to me is the variety of ways they use off-kilter orthography. Is it done as a marketing ploy to attract attention?  Or is there some underlying Japanese concept that maps particularly well to English ""Re""?</p>

<p>A Japanese student grows up learning three alphabets (two Japanese and the Latin one) plus Kanji. I wonder sometimes if this variety can lead them to think flexibly in how they choose to build titles in English.</p>

"Why do anime mothers often get the short end of the stick?","<p>In a significant amount of anime, the protagonist (and possibly others) experience one of the following parental situations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Both parents are dead and are inconsequential to the story.</p></li>
<li><p>Both parents are dead, but one was more consequential to the story than the other. Based on my experience, it's usually the father.</p></li>
<li><p>Both parents are alive and are relatively normal.</p></li>
<li><p>Both parents are alive, but one is more consequential to the story than the other. </p></li>
<li><p>One parent is absent from the story, or dead. The other is still alive, and is usually more consequential to the story.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to name some examples, and assign them a letter according the scenarios I described above.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>One Piece</em> - 5. Luffy, Usopp, Shirahoshi, and Rebecca's mothers are all either dead, or absent from the story. Their fathers are all alive and very relevant. Ace's situation would fall under 2. His mother was largely normal, while his father is the pirate king and the catalyst for the whole story.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> - 5. Mother is dead, while father remains a somewhat prominent figure in the story.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Attack on Titan</em> - 2. Both parents are dead, but the father had a much larger impact on the story.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Bleach</em> - 5. Mother is dead, while father remains relevant to the story.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Berserk</em> - 5. Mother is dead. His adoptive father is short-lived, but he still had an impact on Guts' life.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> - 5. Mother is dead, while father is alive and kinda relevant to the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fairy Tail</em> - 5. Lucy's mother is dead, but her dad is alive for a good chunk of the story.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Medaka Box</em> - 5. Father is alive and influential.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Shokugeki no Soma</em> - 5. Mother is absent, but his dad is far more influential to the story thus far.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Ouran High School Host Club</em> - 5. Mother is dead.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sweetness and Lightning</em> - 5. Mother is dead, dad is one of the MC's.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Garo: Divine Flame</em> - 5. Mother is dead, father is quite relevant to the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Katekyo Hitman Reborn!</em> - 4. His mom is pretty normal, while his dad has actual ties to the mafia world, which is relevant to the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Prince of Tennis</em> - 4. Ryoma's dad is a former pro, while his mom is an attorney. Being an attorney is still pretty badass, but his dad is far more consequential in the story, since it is about tennis after all.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations</em> - 4. Boruto's dad is a powerful ninja and the Hokage, while his mom is just a housewife.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Naruto</em> - 2. While both parents were strong while alive, his dad, Minato, was the stronger, and had a larger impact on the story, being the Hokage and all.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Beelzebub</em> - 3. His parents are background characters, usually for comic relief.</p></li>
<li><p><em>My Hero Academia</em> - 5. For the most part, Deku's parents are support characters. However, his mother gives him parental support, while his father is working away from home.</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</em> - 3. His parents are background characters, usually for comic relief.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> - 5. I know it's not a Japanese anime, but I'm going to include it. Katara and Sokka's mother is dead, but their father is alive and well, and a prominent figure in the Water Tribes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Kill la Kill</em> is an interesting example. It doesn't fall under any of the scenarios I listed, since the mother is alive, more powerful than the father, and is super relevant to the plot. However, she's the final villain. I guess it'd be nice to have a character like her who isn't a villain, is what I'm saying.</p>

<p>That's definitely not all the examples, but it's just a few. Whenever an anime character has a missing/dead parent, chances are very high that it's the mother. If both parents are alive, it's usually the father who is more relevant to the story. If it's a shounen/seinen series, the father is usually stronger and/or more relevant than the mother.</p>

<p>My question: Why do anime mothers get the short end of the stick? In many stories, the mother is dead (<em>Bleach</em>). If they're not dead, then they're largely irrelevant (<em>Katekyo Hitman Reborn</em>). If it's a shounen series, they're often weaker than the father (<em>Naruto</em> and <em>Boruto</em>). If not, then they're the villain (<em>Kill la Kill</em>).</p>

<p>How come there's not as many series where the mother is the living parent, is relevant to the plot, is not a villain, and is the stronger parent in the case of shounen/seinen? The father tends to get all the spotlight. Personally, I would love to see more badass mothers in anime.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Disclaimer: These are all generalizations. I know that not every anime is like this, but I've observed it in enough series that I thought it was worth asking a question about. I also realize that my observations are biased mostly in shounen anime. I tried throwing in a couple of shoujo, but this largely remains a shounen trope.</em></p>

Usually people in the entertainment industry use a stage-name to avoid mixing up their personal life and their public life.

<p>This quote makes me wonder about the number of weeks in a year in One Piece. One would expect there to be 52 weeks as there are in our human world. So what about in the One Piece world? Are there 48 weeks in a year, 52 weeks in a year, or maybe a different number?</p>

"Why did Ika Musume lose her squid powers?","<p>At the end of season one's last episode in <em>Shinryaku! Ika Musume</em>, Ika Musume loses her squid powers, like glowing, tentacle usage, and regeneration, among others. In fact, it seems that the only power she kept was breathing underwater. Why? The anime gave no reason for her powers to go away, nor any reason for them to come back. The trigger was, ""someone is in danger"", but Takeru threw an inflatable orca at her to no avail, and Sanae managed to glomp Ika without being hurt. Given Ika's notorious selfishness, the best motivator should have been her being in danger, rather than someone else.</p>

<p>Was it ever explained or implied in the manga? Was this anime-only filler? What's the deal with that?</p>

"Is there any significance to Risei's line?","<p>In episode 16 of <em>Fate/Zero</em>, we see Kayneth go to the church in a wheelchair to plead for a command seal. Risei Kotomine relents, and when transferring one of the command seals onto Kayneth's hand, we see this line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take this cup and drink from it. This is my blood, given to you, for the salvation of all. The blood of a contract!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Translation from Crunchyroll subtitles.) Barring the bit about the contract, this is suspiciously -- to me anyway -- reminescent of the Christian tradition of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper#Institution_of_the_Eucharist"" rel=""nofollow"">the Eucharist</a>. However, unlike the real world ritual, there is no actual cup here: Risei says this line while his hand is on Kayneth's.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any in-series meaning or significance to this?</strong> (Is it part of the ritual of transferring ""blank"" command seals unconnected to a specific servant? Notice that when Sola-Ui forcibly takes Kayneth's command marks, nothing similar seems to appear.) <strong>Or is this merely symbolism or a reference thrown in for the sake of atmosphere?</strong> (Here, perhaps to give a sense of mysticism and foreboding to the Grail, given that blood, on its own, could have negative connotations? Or perhaps simply some sort of ""Easter egg""?)</p>

<p>The latter explanation seems more likely to me, given what I've heard about a lack of knowledge of Christianity in Japan, but it could be that I'm missing knowledge about the workings about the <em>Fate</em> series universe.</p>

"Is Junketsu conscious?","<p><a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/10047/7579"">Why is Senketsu the only Kamui that can talk?</a> is a related, but slightly different question.</p>

<p>Senketsu is the only uniform that can talk, and apparently he can only talk to Ryuuko because their brains are connected at some level by Life Fibers. He also seems to be the only uniform that can move and think on its own.</p>

<p>However, late in the series, when Ragyo forces Ryuuko to put on Junketsu, it seems like Junketsu might have a consciousness&mdash;it might be able to think, even if it can't speak or move. It seems to have a will; it resists being removed by Ryuuko, and after she tears it off, Satsuki is only able to wear it because it was infused with some of Ryuuko's blood and Senketsu's Life Fibers, which changed its ""personality"" in some way. It also seemed like Junketsu might be creating some of the visions in Ryuuko's mind while she wore it, like when she saw herself at a wedding. But the scene was ambiguous; it could have also been Ragyo and Nui creating these visions and making Junketsu bind itself to Ryuuko.</p>

<p>We never see Junketsu talk or move, and it seems safe to assume it can't. But does Junketsu actually have a consciousness, or was it just made to behave this way by Ragyo and Nui?</p>

"Anime involving a love story and two samurai/assassin villages, previously on unfriendly terms, that were made to fight each other again","<p>Please help me find the name of this anime I've watched online maybe 3 years ago. This is how I remember it:</p>

<p>There were two villages with previously unfriendly assassins or samurais (possibly with supernatural powers) that made some sort of pact because a woman from one village and a man from the other were in love. They were always meeting somewhere in the middle of the path between the villages. It was almost sunrise and each wanted to stay together a little bit longer.</p>

<p>In the meantime, some weird bad person decided the villages had to have a tournament of some sort, and scrolls were given to the heads of the families. They had a fight, maybe both died? And a crow or some bird took one of the scrolls. The Romeo/Juliet (not their real names) parted ways. Maybe some spiderwebs now and maybe the scrolls were 10 for each of the strongest warriors.</p>

<p>And there was fighting. In the last episode, the only ones left were the Romeo/Juliet combo. I think the Juliet was seriously injured and one of them was blind. Furthermore, one of them took some kind of poison. They probably both died at the end, but I think the weird bad person died, too, maybe in a carriage carried by people, not horses.</p>

<p>So in episode 32, while they're waiting at the start line to begin day 2 of the Interhigh (around 17:10 in the episode), Tadokoro tells Onoda that Imaizumi will start 1 minute and 50 seconds after the day 1 first place finishers.

<p>Konan mentions during her fight with Tobi that Tobi's dematerialization technique can last for only 5 minutes.

It is later revealed that Tobi's dematerialization technique is actually just teleporting himself into his alternate dimension with Kamui.</p>

<p>However, earlier during the Five Kage meeting arc, he had teleported Sasuke and Karin and kept them in the alternate dimension for quite a long time. He also kept Fu and Torune in the alternate dimension for several days. This shows that he does not face any significant side-effects, like draining chakra, by keeping people in the other dimension. Also, staying in the alternate dimension did not seem to have any adverse effect, on at least Sasuke and Karin.</p>

<p>Wood release is the kekkai genkai of the Senju clan (originally the God trees sacred ability and also the Otsutsuki clans Kekkai Genkai), however, <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Moegi_Kazamatsuri"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Moegi</a> is able to do it by combining Water and earth style. <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/49153/can-2-elements-be-combined-into-a-new-release-without-a-clan-based-kekkai-genka"">Does this mean being able to combine 2 elements can allow anyone to use an advanced element?</a>  We know Orochimaru used to perform experiments on merging <a href=""https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Hashirama_Senju"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hashirama</a>'s cells with small children but Sarutobi Hiruzren (the Third Hokage) put an end to it.</p>

<p>Moegi did not have the wood style ability while she was younger plus the experiments that Orochimaru did with Hashirama's DNA were destroyed earlier in the series. So how did Moegi suddenly become able to use it at adulthood?</p>

It should noted that the holder's eyes change colour almost immediately after consuming the previous holder, as evidence by Grisha again and Frieda Reiss. Based on what is seen and known thus far, it would make sense that the purple eyes of the holder would signify that they are in control of the Founding Titan, when compared to other Titan Shifters, like Annie and Reiner.</p>

"Why is there so much reluctant sex in hentai?","<p>Multiple authors on the net have pointed out that a lot of the sex in hentai is, or appears to be, non-consensual.</p>

<p>From here: <a href=""http://magicalgirlproject.tumblr.com/post/91661244454/porno-month-reflections-why-so-much-rape-in"">http://magicalgirlproject.tumblr.com/post/91661244454/porno-month-reflections-why-so-much-rape-in</a></p>

  <p>I watched 20 hentai over the course of June/July, and looking back over them all, I’m left with one frustratingly unanswered question:</p>
  
  <p>[WHY IS THERE SO MUCH RAPE IN HENTAI?!?]</p>
  
  <p>Why is rape so ubiquitous in hentai, why is it so inescapable, and why do so many of [these hentai that I've watched] focus exclusively on rape, with maybe one token consensual scene or sometimes none at all? It’d be like if 90% of the porn made in Belgium featured a buttplug scene — it’s weirdly specific and implies there’s some kind of cultural thing going on that I don’t yet understand.</p>

<p>Also, note this: <a href=""http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/431127-Why-does-hentai-have-so-much-violence-rape-towards-women"">http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/431127-Why-does-hentai-have-so-much-violence-rape-towards-women</a>. </p>

<p>A commenter on the first article claims these 'rapes' are not as non-consensual as they seem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ninfadelagua said: The average porn scene does seem rapey, even if it isn’t extreme (no hitting/scratching/biting) there seems to be a trend of women acting like they are resisting a lot and the men in the porno keep going and prey on them sexually (for hetero porn).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies that the 'victim' enjoys the rough sex and is 'resisting' as part of the 'game', sort of like how tsundere pretend to hate the person they actually love.</p>

<p>Which leads to <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotIfTheyEnjoyedItRationalization"">Not If They Enjoyed It Rationalization:</a> which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Turns up often in Hentai, Boys Love Genre and Fanfiction. A lot. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the claim is that this, in some sense, doesn't count as rape because the purported victim enjoyed the experience.</p>

"Why do mecha anime tend to be original works?","<p>So this may seem like a weird question, but bear with me.</p>

<p>Loads and loads of anime are based on manga, and it's a fact that has become well-known in the anime community. However, the mecha genre seems to be a tad different.</p>

<p>I've seen a decent amount of mecha anime in the past. However, one trend that sticks out to me is that a lot of mecha anime are original works, and not based on manga, or light novels.</p>

<p>Here are some examples that I was able to gather by going through the mecha genres on MyAnimeList:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gundam franchise- is technically a multimedia franchise, but started as a TV anime</li>
<li>Code Geass - another huge mecha franchise</li>
<li>Macross franchise - huge and old mecha franchise</li>
<li>Neon Genesis Evangelion </li>
<li>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann </li>
<li>Darling in the FranXX</li>
<li>Eureka Seven</li>
<li>Aldnoah.Zero</li>
<li>Suisei no Gargantia</li>
<li>Kakumeiki Valvrave</li>
<li>Cross Ange</li>
<li>Hoshi no Koe</li>
<li>Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari</li>
<li>Tenkuu no Escaflowne</li>
<li>Star Driver</li>
<li>Kuromukuro</li>
<li>Aquarion series</li>
<li>Heroic Age - this one's kinda iffy since the giant beings they transform into are organic (kinda like Attack on Titan), but MAL categorizes it as mecha</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are original anime, or started as original anime. However, when you look through other genres on MAL, there aren't a lot other genres with this many original works.</p>

One of the directors of the organization states Evangelion Unit 01 has become self aware, almost becoming god-like, and that they have no use for a god in their master plan.</p>

<p>Now I fail to see how a sentient EVA Unit can prove to be such a hindering factor in SEELE's ultimate plan. How could one EVA Unit pose such a threat to the plan that the Unit had to be grounded until further notice? and what type of hindrance were the SEELE directors talking about?</p>

"Philosophical meaning on how Ed beat/defeats Truth?","<p>I've been reading around everywhere on this topic and haven't really come to a proper understanding.
From what I've read, Ed beats truth by sacrificing his gate and from this he gets to take Al back home.</p>

<p>Now this doesn't make sense. Does this mean that he essentially sacrificed everything, his ability to do alchemy, and in return he gets to ""take anything you want"" which is what Truth says back to him in the Japanese dub?</p>

<p>What's the deeper philosophical meaning to this? Why would you give up/sacrifice/destroy truth? Isn't it important to know the truth?</p>

<p>Does sacrificing truth destroy it, i.e. the truth is you can't do this, so I sacrifice truth, and truth doesn't exist except what I think it is?
So I become truth and essentially I can do anything because I am truth?</p>

<p>Any explanations?</p>

"The science behind Squall's Gunblade, if there is any?","<p>So, Revolver, Squall's gunblade, is a pure melee weapon, and not actually a gun. Apparently, squeezing the trigger just before the blade hits the target mid-swing amplifies the damage dealt by this weapon.</p>

<p>Here's what I know, and please correct me if I am wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li>It uses cartridges (most likely, without the bullet/projectile part) to do its damage-amplification thing.    </li>
</ul>

<p>And here are my issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since making the cartridges explode is the key to the damage-amplification mechanism, does the explosion send vibrations to the blade, like star wars' vibro blades?  </li>
<li>Or does it use the raw explosion, like, making mini shockwaves to deal more damage?  </li>
<li>Either way, do you think there is a barrel (with only one hole, since the tip of the Revolver has no hole, like for bullets) inside for this vibration/shockwave to travel to the blade?  </li>
<li>Asuming that there exist a material elastic and strong enough to do this mechanism, do you think it would make sense scientifically?  </li>

"Can an Ackerman become a Titan Shifter?","<p>After reading the Manga until the current issue, it kind of feels like to me that it's building to Mikasa is going to become the Female Titan, or that Mikasa is going to inherit the Attack Titan from Eren due to the curse of Ymir.</p>

<p>This raised yet another question about the AoT series, can an Ackerman become a Titan shifter, seeing that this clan is one of the ""special clans"" that cannot be affected by Titan powers in any way, form or shape?</p>

<p>I would think that they can, given that the Ackerman clan was a ""result of Titan Science"" before or after the walls were built, explaining their enhanced abilities and skills, but still leaves the burning question, can an Ackerman become a Titan should it be inherited from elsewhere?</p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>As of Chapter 112. It is revealed by Eren that the Ackerman Clan can control Titan abilties when in close proximity with a Titan Shifter, or if that Ackerman member has a relatively close bond to said Titan Shifter (e.g. Mikasa and Eren). I feel that this information is relevant to this question, and thus has been added.</p>

"Why is adult anime so much less likely than US adult animation to be comedic?","<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ksyHccgEEU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This video</a> explains why US adult animation is almost always comedic. US animation studios transferred their efforts to television in the years following Hollywood's anti-trust case (which meant future shorts were less likely to be assured of theatrical releases), but this was only cost-effective if the animation style was simplified and the content made child-friendly enough for extensive ad-heavy re-runs. With the exception of a 1972 series, adult TV animation waited until <em>The Simpsons</em>. Although this series was a risky investment, lessons learned from its rapid success allowed a transition from expecting adult animation to be unviable to expecting it to be viable as long as it was comedic, preferably in a sitcom format.</p>

<p>Clearly, adult anime is in a very different situation and has been for decades. (One need only look at the lists <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Lists_of_anime"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.) The reason, in short, is that the historical factors mentioned above are unique details of US history. A similar overview of the history of Japanese animation, both cinematic and televisual, would sound completely different and make sense of the diverse range of adult anime that resulted, including in the present day.</p>

<p>So my question is: what are the key details of that history? (If it's an inappropriate question here, I might move it to History.SE instead.)</p>

<p>Edit for requested clarity: I'm referring to work with an adult target audience, without specific implications of sexual or violent content (though these could well apply in some cases).</p>

"How was Obito able to use Kamui immediately after awakening his MS?","<p>In Episode 435 of <em>Naruto Shippuden</em>, Obito awakens his Mangekyo Sharingan and attacks the hidden mist ninja using the MS ability. However, he had no prior knowledge about the MS as Madara never explained it to him at this point.</p>

<p>So, how did Obito know about the Kamui Dimension after he suddenly awakened his MS? Madara never said that it can be a MS ability, nor Zetsu told him anything.
Also, Kakashi figured about the Kamui much later. How did Obito figure out how to use the ability without training?</p>

<p>My questions are the following: did the anime left some important content out (its normal to skip some as it can't be all adapted) and if so, how much? Furthermore, if I plan to read the novels, should I start from the beginning (if the anime skipped some parts) or start where the anime ended (if you could provide that information too I'd be very grateful)?</p>

"Do Lag Seeing and Gauche Suede have eyebrows?","<p>I noticed something very perplexing while watching the <em>Tegami Bachi</em> anime: Gauche Suede and Lag Seeing don't appear to have eyebrows. This is a perplexing situation because they both have long hair that could be hiding their eyebrows. To make matters worse, the tops of their eyelids are both prominently drawn, so it's possible that I'm mistaking some of the lines for their eyebrows for their eyelids.</p>

<p>There doesn't seem to be a relationship between this shared feature and that both characters are Albisian, since Sylvette and Doctor Thunderland Jr. both have eyebrows (although notably, according to the <a href=""http://tegamibachi.wikia.com/wiki/Dr._Thunderland_Jr."" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki</a>, it isn't confirmed that Doctor Thunderland is an Albisian).</p>

<p>This issue is so distracting that I find myself searching for their eyebrows whenever either one of them appears. Do Lag and Gauche have eyebrows? Is there any point in the anime or manga that clearly shows their eyebrows (or lack of eyebrows) or does a character ever acknowledge they don't have eyebrows?</p>

"Did we ever find out what happened with Nagi between Volumes 36 and 38?","<p>Spoilers, obviously, since this concerns the end of the Negima manga.</p>

<p>There were many confusing aspects of the ending of the Negima manga. Many, many confusing aspects. For a series that started out as Harry Potter crossed with Love Hina, it's amazing how many were the confusing aspects of the ending.</p>

<p>Nagi's appearances towards the end were possibly the most confusing. In 334th Period at the end of Volume 36, the group defeats the Averrunci, only to find that their leader, in the black robe, is apparently Nagi. He tells Negi: ""Kill me. Then it will all be over&hellip;I'll be waiting"" (KC USA translation), then disappears.</p>

<p>In Volumes 37 and 38, we go through the wrap-up to miscellaneous other plots, and it seems that no one says anything at all about Nagi, as the focus is mostly on Asuna. Then, in Volume 38, 355th Period, the story skips ahead seven years to the day of the Ala Alba reunion. And there's Nagi, sitting right there drinking tea with Albireo, Rakan, Eishun, and Evangeline. Nodoka, Yue, Makie, and Ku Fei are surprised to see him, but Konoka and Setsuna are just surprised to see him up and about, and make some remarks about his health. </p>

<p>What happened? Is there any supplemental material that explains how we went from the events of 334th Period to what we see in 355th Period? I read <a href=""http://anime.astronerdboy.com/2012/03/new-proposed-japanese-law-reason-ken.html#.VYnTu0ZmO1s"" rel=""nofollow"">a blog</a> saying there was some kind of legal issue going on at the time Akamatsu finished Negima, which may have led him to finish it early. Did that have anything to do with this? The entire story began with Negi wanting to find his father, so it seems pretty odd to go through 37 volumes of material, set up the story where'd he'd finally accomplish this goal, and then totally skip it.</p>

<p>Now, Rei knew the reason for her creation, what she was supposed to bring about when all of the Angels were finally defeated, but she outright rejected Gendo, and instead tried to aid Shinji during Third Impact, ultimately denying and overruling her purpose in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>What was Rei's reason for abandoning Gendo and aiding Shinji, other than deciding not be a puppet any more? Did Rei abandon Gendo for Shinji, because of Yui's maternal instincts kicking in when Shinji called out for her, seeing that she is a clone of Yui?</p>

In my quest to know the differences I tried to find the manga online (legal), but I've yet to know for certain how many volumes/chapters (of the manga) are available for the original Beyblade series.

  <p>Phantom&hellip; the strongest assassin in Inferno&hellip; the title given to the top sniper in the organization&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can see how Ein and Zwei are the strongest assassins in Inferno, but I'm confused by the designation of ""top sniper."" To me, ""top sniper"" suggests that the person specializes and is especially proficient in, well, sniping. But Ein and Zwei spend a lot of time in the series (at least up to ep. 10) in close quarters combat or situations that lead to close quarters combat. It was probably intended that they fight in such situations, given that they follow certain instructions when carrying out orders. They also seem to have been specially trained for such situations, based on what I remember from ep. 2 and 3. The only instance that I recall where Phantom serves as a sniper outright is in ep. 7, where Ein is ordered to shoot people who are overseeing a narcotics shipment.</p>

<p>In contrast, other fictional snipers that I can recall, such as Riza Hawkeye from <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> and Sinon from <em>Sword Art Online</em>, clearly have a background in sniping, even if they end up in close quarters combat on numerous occasions.</p>

"What are the numbers in the background in Sae's room?","<p>In the 4th season of Hidamari Sketch, Honeycomb, there's scenes where there's a bunch of numbers (and an <strong>HK</strong> with a ""honeycomb"" symbol) in the background.

<p>If they don't, then Naruto's chakra level should go down exponentially, as long as he creates new clones. </p>

<p>Now since Naruto has mastered Senjutsu (which of course has a time limit), he can create 2 clones in the battlefield itself with the help of natural energy. Also with Nine Tails chakra, he can create unlimited number of clones, because Tailed Beasts possess unlimited (compared to human limits) amount of chakra. But how about his battles prior to his Senjutsu or Nine-Tails form?</p>

<p><strong>How do I get these comics published in the West and is it something I can do on my own?</strong></p>

<p>The only ideas I've come up with are with regards to contacting Western and/or Japanese publishers. The former would be just a request of sorts, whereas the latter would involve asking to purchase license, but that pretty much becomes a business on its own and I am not sure if that's what I want. Any other ideas? I am willing to part with a decent amount of resources for every manga, so I am open to <em>any</em> suggestions.

To illustrate this with an example from the literary world: Suppose I wanted to translate a book from a foreign language to English. It would be perfectly acceptable to approach the author, and/or their publisher, with a sample translation and then potentially negotiate a deal. Or it's not uncommon to directly speak with a publisher who's willing to publish the book and then they do the rest of the negotiation (and legal affairs) on your behalf.</p>

<p>After reading the liner notes of <em>Maria Watches Over Us</em>, I know that some humor in Japanese language comes from puns on how words look very similar but have vastly different meanings only because of one character of the placing of a space.</p>

"How is a technique categorized as a Kekkei Genkai?","<p>During the Land of Waves arc, Kekkei Genkai is defined as techniques which are unique to a clan and passed down through the bloodline. After timeskip, it is touched upon again, and is now defined as a technique which combines two elements. Looking back at the Land of Waves arc, Haku's Ice Release satisfies this definition as well. </p>

<p>However, Sharingan and Byakugan are also called Kekkei Genkai, although they do not combine any elements. Later, Terumi Mei is showed to use Lava release and Boil release, and they are both considered Kekkei genkai, although it appears that this is something unique she achieved, not passed down through bloodline.</p>

<p>Thus, the term kekkei genkai seems to be used in various contexts to mean either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bloodline techniques passed down through generations, but not involving combining basic elements (Sharingan, Byakugan users)  </li>
<li>Techniques combining basic elements, but not passed down through bloodline. (Terumi Mei, and a few others)  </li>
<li>Combining basic elements <strong>and</strong> passed down through bloodline (Haku)</li>

"Is the person who appeared at the very end of Fate/Stay Night UBW (desert scene) Archer or Shirou?","<p>Right after Archer ended his monologue, he fades away. Then we see Shirou (or Archer) walking in a desert.</p>

<p>I wouldn't have any doubts concerning this scene whether it's Shirou or Archer (it would've been Archer who's taking part in a new mission) if he hadn't had orange hairs which don't fit Archer. So if it's not him, then it has to be Shirou in the future. If that's true, then why is he travelling alone and not with Rin?</p>

<p>According to a <a href=""https://animewithsky.wordpress.com/2015/07/06/review-fatestay-night-unlimited-blade-works-ep-25-finale-my-whole-life-was-unlimited-blade-works/comment-page-1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">review</a> and two similar questions on Reddit, there might also be a third possibility which Kinoko Nasu (author of Fate/Stay Night) explained (though, it seems it was only a suggestion or request to ufotable which hadn't been accepted by this studio):</p>

<p><em>“Desert scene- After the end credits. A desert scene, same as the opening. Shirou walks alone. His strength falters and he stops walking. Shirou looks down to shield his eyes from the sandstorm and sees traces of someone else having been there (the place where Archer stopped). Shirou breathes out and looks up. There’s fake endurance in his expression, but it’s full of hope. Shirou walks away with a steady gait. The camera lingers on the traces of Archer’s presence, and watches Shirou leave as the shot ends.”</em></p>

<p>According to this explanation (if ufotable did accept Kinoko's suggestion, but only changed it a bit), this scene might be just some sort of a metaphor which hints that Shirou will be able to make a step forward and therefore doesn't have to suffer like Archer. Or is this supposed to be a time leap and not a metaphor?</p>

"What is this anime about people who can transform themselves into giant robots with the help of a device/talisman?","<p>I only saw the last part of this Anime. A few minutes. So, I cannot give many details.
I think it was a movie and I think it was around the 2nd half of the 1990s. Because it was on a weekend program where they showed Anime movies and once ""<em>X (1999)</em>"" was one of them. </p>

<p>What I remember from that short scene:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Anime is about people, who can transform themselves into giant robots with the help of a device/talisman (?). However, the transformation rips their clothes apart and when hey change back, they are totally naked.</li>
<li>The protagonist is a girl. She has straight, shoulder-lenght, brown(ish) hair and she wears it in pigtails maybe. Anyway, her hair is tied up somehow. Either she cannot transform till the end of the movie or she has problems with fighting... but in the end she transforms and fights well.</li>
<li>There is and older guy (not old!), who may be her ""teacher"", who teaches her how to transform(?) He has brown hair and glasses I guess. In that end scene he came to help the girl out but she did well on her own, so he just watches and changes back. Being experienced, he brought spare clothes with him, but there is a giant dog (I think it is his) that takes them. So the guy ends up chasing the dog naked. They were under a bridge that time.</li>
<li>The art was great and detailed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is <strong>ALL</strong> I remember.</p>

"What was the source of magic used in Grand Magic Games in Fairy Tail?","<p>In the grand magic games arc we saw several team events that use a lot of magic events. Which are ""Hidden"", ""Chariot"", ""Pandemonium"", ""Naval Battle"" and ""Battle Royale"" etc. </p>

<p>In the world of magic, we see magic circles being used to create these events. For Example, creating the water sphere in Naval Battle or Peripheral Chariots. These may be comparatively easy, however it would require lots of magic power to create thousands of exact clones (Hidden) or 100 monsters of Pandemonium.</p>

<p>So who/which guild/how was used to create these events since they would require an absurd amount of power.</p>

<p>Considering, How powerful would the user be if he can create a monster which can fight on level footing as an S-Class mage? Thousands of clone which may have same power as that of user(?)</p>

Do the Marines kinda depend on information from newspaper media outlets to increase or award a bounty? (or is the other way round; that they only use newspaper and the media for getting the bounties out). Is the Bounty based more on popularity within the media? </p>

<p>Also, what warrants a decrease/withdrawal in Bounty? I know it has never technically happened but is it ideally possble?</p>

<p>What I don't get is how no one knew it was defective. If Kisuke's supplier marked it as such, firstly wouldn't they have had it destroyed because of Soul Society's orders to destroy Mod Souls? If they ignored the order, then Kisuke should have known because he would have seen the box and opened it, checking what it was because he knew it wasn't Chappy which is what Rukia said she wanted when Ichigo was complaining about it being a duck. If the box wasn't marked as defective before it arrived, then Kisuke must have done it and was fully aware it was defective in the first place.</p>

Sadly enough, the Bounties of these Yonko are also unknown.

<p>What I'm trying to understand is how a pirate actually attains such a level; is it in any way related to the actual bounty of that individual or their second in command?  we all know that Kaido and big mom had subbordinates who attained bounties roughly around 1 billion; is that the prerequisite for becoming a Yonko? But then if that were the case, it doesn't explain how Marshal D teech was able to slyly slip into the ranks of Yonko.</p>

<p>Or is it more about who is closest to becoming the pirate King? Or more like whoever can defeat a Yonko automatically snatches the title?</p>

<p>I ask this mainly because of a lot of theories floating around about luffy becoming the 5th Yonko;</p>

"Kakuzu's way of getting all the five chakra elements","<p>So I went back and started reading, or just looking at, really old questions about Naruto, including Shippuden. I read <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/304/is-it-possible-to-combine-all-five-chakra-elements"">this</a> question, but <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/311/20270"">this</a> answer got my attention. After looking at the answer, I started to wonder how exactly Kakuzu's methods of getting the chakra natures work.</p>

<p>We know that he gets all the chakra natures by stealing people's hearts throughout the years but once the hearts he has on are damaged or just get too old he has to get new ones. But how does that work? I always thought the nature of the chakra was in the body not exactly the heart. Or do both, body and heart, have the chakra nature, so when Kakuzu gets the hearts he gets part of the chakra nature?</p>

<p>Also, since we also know that Kakuzu has been living for a while, until Kakashi killed him, exactly how old is he? I know he has been living since the First Hokage was alive, which I guess was about 100 years ago, so I think he was at least a little more than 100 years old.</p>

"Where was Fate staying during the first season?","<p>The DVDs I own of <em>Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</em> seemed to use very bad fan subs as when Alph first appeared, Arisa kept referring to her as a 'he' (despite clearly seeing her boobs), then Fate was named Feid, and Alph was Elofy.</p>

<p>In episode 7, <em>Is This a Third Magician?</em> (titled in the subs as <em>The Third Magical Girl</em>), there is a subtitle indicating where Fate was living. However, I don't trust it as shortly after when Nanoha gets off the bus to walk home and meets Yuuno with the repaired Raising Heart, there is a subtitle of where she is and not only is it totally different to what was shown with Fate's location, but it doesn't even says Uminari City which is where the the Takamachi's, Bannings' and Tsukimura's live and where Midori-ya and Seishou Elementary School located (as such it's very unlikely Nanoha was dropped off in another city after school to go home or to visit Arisa or Suzuka).</p>

The chapters themselves are pretty similar to an episode of the TV series, so are there specific time frames, or episodes that these chapters are reported to take place?

"Is ""Payday"" Money, real money?","<p>In the Pokémon games, when Payday is used, you can gain a small amount of money. The amount is however pitiful, so it's never used as an infinite money trick or effective money grinding strategy.</p>

<p>In the anime however, during the Johto League Arc, in one episode Jessie, James, and Meowth are copycatting a famous burglar who had a Meowth as a partner. In his escapes the burglar's Meowth used Payday like a smoke screen. When Jessie and James copycat, they do the same thing, however because Meowth can't use Payday, Meowth throws bottle caps belonging to James' collection. (When Ash, Brock, and Misty examine the ""coins"" they comment they are just bottle caps, after which you hear James in the background saying they aren't ""just bottle caps"".)</p>

<p>I am wondering however, is the money that's thrown out when Payday is used the same kind of money used in society in Pokemon? If so, then how is it people don't abuse the move to get rich? (For example, Team Rocket stealing Pokémon with Payday and using them to fund their criminal operations.)</p>

"Is Ash's explanation for the origins of his name correct?","<p>In vol. 11, Eiji asks Ash about his real name while they are on the Staten Island ferry. Ash claims that his first name, Aslan, is a Hebrew word referring to daybreak.</p>

"What makes the mannequins different from the results of the sacrifices' human transmutation attempts?","<p>In the manga / Brotherhood, we learn that the reason human transmutation is forbidden is because it would otherwise allow people to create their own private armies (at least according to the man who talks to General Armstrong after she's transferred to Central). Right after that, we're shown the mannequin ""soldiers"", implying that they're the results of some form of human transmutation.</p>

<p>Given this, what's the difference between the human transmutation referred to in the context of the mannequins and human transmutation as attempted by the sacrifices?

"Why is Ed able to exchange his knowledge?","<p>In FMA 2009/Manga, Edward is able to exchange his Gate of Truth for Alphonse's body.</p>

<p>However, I find this pretty dumb. The Gate symbolizes the knowledge of alchemy.  Father's Gate is small and has no ornaments like Ed's which indicates that Father doesn't know anything as stated in the series. But alchemy is a science in this universe. They learn it from reading books. Why is Edward unable to use alchemy but able to read it? I can imagine that Ed is not able to use alchemy by clapping his hands anymore but by drawing circles and alchemy formulas.</p>

<p>Another question: Edward's toll (his leg) to see Truth is less than Alphonse's (who lost his whole body) and it is also stated that Al probably saw more of Truth than Edward.</p>

<p>So Alphonse's Gate is worth more than Edward's Gate. Couldn't Alphonse easily exchange his own Gate?  He probably would still use alchemy since his knowledge is worth more than Edward's.</p>

<p>Edit: Just thinking about it, you don't have to sacrifice anything at all when using human transmutation. All you need to do is sacrifice your Gate and you won't lose that much of your body.</p>

"Girl who wants to be the king's cook?","<p>I am looking for an anime that I had watched fairly around a week ago on a school computer. Here's the details I remember.</p>

<p>It started off with an opening song. There was a little girl who had wanted to be a cook for the king. Her mother used to always love it when people enjoyed her food. Sadly, she passed away and the girl was left alone, I believe. She had this very fat relative or cousin too. He was very enthusiastic and looked after her? (Not really sure). I only got to watch two episodes of this series and I don't think it was the average 20-23 minutes but perhaps maybe 15?</p>

<p>The first episode I remember is that this girl who wants to become the king's cook accidentally let a puppy loose into the palace, which wrecked the noodles for the royal dinner. There was this other girl, who sounded spoilt rotten and was very unpleasant. I believe at some point she tried to get this girl into trouble. The next thing I remember is that the little girl said she could provide some noodles for wrecking the noodles in the first place since she grew some type of noodles. It could have been tadpole noodles? (I'm not quite sure on this either).</p>

<p>In the second episode there was the king. He was riding on horseback with a whole lot of troops and looked like he was dressed in traditional looking armour like a samurai. I believe they were looking to hunt down a giant boar. Next thing I remember is that there are these people dressed like ninjas who try to kill the king. Suddenly there is this big fight in a forest on horseback and some other elements such as the king chasing after the assassins after they fail killing him.</p>

<p>The final detail I remember is that girl that wants to be the king's cook and who ruined the noodles finds one soldier on the ground with her fat cousin and dog. Suddenly three assassins walk up to her and tell her to move out of the way. They were intent on killing the soldier. She refused and one of the assassins who was a girl was told by one of the assassin leaders to ""take care of her"". She closes her eyes as she is grabbed but then her cousin says something like ""leave her alone"" and throws a barrel of wine? which the boar that the king was hunting/looking for in the forest smells and quickly charges to where the smell was coming from and I think the girl, cousin, and puppy run away with the soldier.</p>

<p>There was also some sort of cooking competition on where you cook something really nice so you can become the king's cook. She ended up cooking rice since that was the only ingredient left when she finally came. She was late because she had to save that soldier so her cousin went and told her to get in the back of this pulley and pulled her all the way to the palace, and she almost got refused entry for being late.</p>

<p>I also remember a scene where that spoilt girl steals some other girl's frog/pet and pretends that the girl stole her ingredient for frog soup to try and eliminate her from being the thief.</p>

<p>Just on a side note: I think the girl who wants to be the king's cook is Ming or Mei? The graphics and art style weren't too dodgy but it did look a little old, although I wouldn't know the exact year it was released.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> The girl is not tsundere. It is more like an historic anime and there is nothing magical or otherworldly in it. It has a kind of ninja theme to it. The people in the anime do not typically look like the usual anime characters with unusual height or eyes or crazy styled hair and look pretty normal or well anime normal anyways. It looks like it was set in a Japanese (possibly ancient) setting similar to the medieval era. There was a castle but it didn't have a moat. The girl has black hair and everyone wears pretty Japanese looking clothing such as possibly in that of the feudal time period. Woman in the palace wore what looked like gowns and had their hairs in a bun.</p>

<p>While I am it, I just remembered that the female assassin/ninja had some type of symbol on her arm. I think her sleeves got ripped by the boar? and then she quickly covers it up. Also the girl who wants to be the kings cook and saves that soldier had two rings that she got from her mother. One was green and the other was some colour I forgot (maybe red). I have no idea but she ends up dropping it.</p>

"What does it mean by 大地を見る in Kotomi's essay?","<p>At the start of <em>Seitokai Yakuindomo</em> OVA episode 19, there is this scene where it shows Kotomi's essay:</p>

<p>In text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>「家族」…。その中でも兄妹とは…禁断の一線を超えさせない理性の言葉。私の家は両親は仕事の事情などで留守に成りがちでよく兄とは二人きりになる。特に休日や平日の夜。まるでどこかのパソコンゲームのようだ。しかも未成年が遊んではいけないような。未成年の男女が二人きり、夜中で未成年が遊んでいけない状況にある。そこで食い止める劣情の防波堤が家族であり、そして兄妹と言うキーワードだと思う。しかしこのキーワード、危険が伴う。肉欲に任せて落ちれば燃え尽きてしまう近親相姦。我も危険なら彼も危険。共に<strong>大地を見る</strong>ことができるのか？</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was able to understand almost everything with jisho.org, except the bold bit. That whole sentences, as far as I know, means something like ""Can we see the earth together?"" Why ""see the earth"" all of a sudden? It was talking about the fact that if we don't control our lust, it will become incest, so why ""see the earth""?</p>

<p>I tried googling ""大地を見る"" but nothing related seems to come up. Is there something I don't get?</p>

<p>EDIT: Translation</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Family""... ""Brothers and sisters"", is a rational word that will not cross the forbidden line. Because of my parents' jobs, my brother and I, just the two of us, always stay at home, especially in holidays and weekdays. It's like in an adult game. Two minors, in the middle of the night, doing adult things. Situations like this often appear. In such situations, the breakwater that holds back the lust is ""family"" and also the keyword ""brothers and sisters"". However, this keyword goes hand in hand with danger. If we don't control our lust it can become incest. If I am in danger, he is too. Will we be able to see the earth together?</p>

"Was ""defenestrated"" simply a literal translation, or part of a bigger concept or joke?","<p><em>WorldEnd: What Are You Doing at the End of the World? Will You Save Us?</em> (aka <em>Shūmatsu Nani Shitemasu ka? Isogashii Desu ka? Sukutte Moratte Ii Desu ka?</em> (終末なにしてますか? 忙しいですか? 救ってもらっていいですか?), commonly called <strong>SukaSuka</strong>) is a currently airing anime of Spring 2017. It should be obvious from the title that the author is very particular and non-traditional with their word usage. As strange as it sounds, the title of the series fits excellently. The English sub translation has flowed very well.</p>

<p>However something in <a href=""http://www.crunchyroll.com/worldend-what-do-you-do-at-the-end-of-the-world-are-you-busy-will-you-save-us/episode-8-slight-light-slight-hope-733689"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 8</a> struck me as odd at time mark 14:00 (if watch, start 30 seconds earlier for context).  Willem, the main character is speaking with Chtholly, who is in love with him. He is defending himself from light jealousy. When she counters an argument of his with an alternative case, he says with wit and resignation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Defenestrated in two seconds flat.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I did not know what ""<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;q=defenestrated"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">defenstrated</a>"" meant (basically, in this context, he acknowledges she has completely dismissed his argument and admits defeat.) It is not often I need to look up a word while watching anime, and on top of that figure out how that word fits the situation.</p>

<p>What I wonder now is if the translator used ""defenestrated"" as simply a literal translation of a Japanese word, without any real thought.  My suspicion is the opposite, that this is a contextual translation which would probably seem just as odd (and as oddly appropriate) in Japanese as it does in English. What kind of translation was it, and does it carry the Japanese intent well?</p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>HotelCalifornia (HC) further researched this question, and it turns out my original interpretation of ""Defenestrated in two seconds flat."" was incorrect. I had assumed the meaning to be [My argument was dismissed in two seconds flat.] As HC learned in the Japanese SE, a much better meaning uses a different subject and adds an object (both absent in the literal Japanese as well). So a translation that better fits conversation flow is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would have thrown Nygglatho out the window in two seconds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Nygglatho is the attractive female adult leader of the ""warehouse"", and Chtholly had just asked what Willem would have done if she had crept onto the couch where he was sleeping, instead of the teenage female who had actually done so.) So the primary meaning for <strong>defenestrated</strong> was the proper one, not the figurative meaning of <strong>dismiss</strong>.</p>

Thus, it looks like a woman would not be normally regarded as an appropriate candidate for military duties. This makes sense combined with the gender roles alluded to in the first two episodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Girodelle initially refuses to duel Oscar on account of gender</li>
<li>Later he makes mention of ""womanly whims"" when she disappears in the second episode</li>
<li>The Jarjayes housekeeper laments that Oscar isn't treated like a daughter and hopes when she refuses to become an officer that she is doing so because she wants to be a woman.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, both in this episode and the one that follows, it is shown that Oscar's gender is more or less an open secret: at least three people outside of the Jarjayes household know of it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Girodelle (see above)</li>
<li>The woman who tells Marie Antoinette about Oscar while she is going to Versailles</li>
<li>The man whom Jarjayes talks to who proposes the duel between Girodelle and Oscar, although he tells Jarjayes that it's fine that Oscar is a woman</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Given that a number of outsiders are aware of Oscar's gender, is there any in-universe reason why Oscar is still permitted to take on masculine roles, if being female was supposed to be an impediment in the first place?</strong> Or is everything fine and dandy provided that Oscar does not appear overtly feminine and so long as <em>the average person</em> isn't aware of it?

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Zeke meets Eren for the first time, their conversation is cut short but as he turns to leave, he addresses Eren and says the following: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aM17D.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/aM17D.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I have been trying to understand what Zeke means by this statement. So far, what I've gathered is that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Zeke and Eren share the same biological father but Zeke refers to their father as strictly Eren's father. Zeke believes that ""Eren's father"" brainwashed the two of them and Zeke made it clear that he understood what Eren was currently going through. </p>

<p>However, given that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>anyone fighting in the Eldia vs Marley conflict seems to have a very biased view of historical events,</p>

"How to tell apart Japanese and non-Japanese characters in-universe and out-of-universe?","<p>Anime characters are <em>almost</em> always drawn with... ""anime"" facial features.

<p><strong>Since there are anime series starring both Japanese and non-Japanese characters, how can one distinguish them?</strong> I'm asking both in-universe and out-of-universe.</p>

<p><a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7539/why-are-most-people-in-anime-white-or-european-looking-instead-of-japanese"">Comments and answers to this question</a> claim that Western characters tend to be drawn with big noses, square jaws, <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19315/michiru-is-a-fake-blonde-ok-but-what-about-sachi-and-amanes-hair-colors"">blond hair</a>, wide mouth, etc. But to me it seems not always the case! For example, in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh</em>, Bandit Keith has some of these features, but Pegasus Crawford has not, and they are both supposed to be American. Naruto, Jonouchi etc are blond and Japanese. Most characters in <em>Escaflowne</em> have a long nose regardless of their origin.</p>

<p>For even more blatant examples, let's compare Lelouch Lamperouge and Suzaku Kururugi from <em>Code Geass</em>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qm0gP.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qm0gP.jpg"" alt=""Lelouch Lamperouge VS Suzaku Kururugi""></a></p>

<p>or Teletha ""Tessa"" Testarossa and Kaname Chidori from <em>Full Metal Panic</em>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXRJl.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXRJl.jpg"" alt=""Tessa VS Kaname""></a></p>

<p>Same big round eyes. Same pointy chin. Very similar noses. And, for the two girls, crazy hair color. (Similar comparsions can be done for Light Yagami an L from <em>Death Note</em>, and for many others).</p>

<p>I'd say that, at least <strong>out-of-universe</strong>, the viewer is expected to tell them apart only from their <strong>names</strong> (or, in case of biracial characters, from the double surname, e.g. Asuka Langley-Sohryu, Kallen Stadtfeld-Kozuki) and from <strong>dialogue</strong> (e.g. a character declare his/her origin). But I wonder: am I missing something? Are there subtle <em>physical</em> traits that the viewer is supposed to use to get their origin before they declare it?</p>

<p>Theoretically, there shouln't be the need to tell them apart: a character (like a real person) is defined by his/her actions, not from his/her ethnicity. But <strong>in-universe</strong>, characters seem to always recognize <em>at a glance</em> if another character is Japanese or not. For example, in an episode of <em>Full Metal Panic</em>, Sosuke asks to free first the Japanese girl (Kaname), then the Western one (Tessa), as it is obvious to everyone who is who. In <em>Code Geass</em>, the distinction beween Britannians and Japanese is an important plot point, and people doesn't seem to need to know the name of a character to tell if he/she is Britannian or Japanese.</p>

<p>So is there some kind of artistic convention?

"Has Sakura expressed signs of love towards Naruto?","<p>Throughout Naruto and a lot of Naruto Shippuden you can clearly see that Naruto has a lot of affection towards Sakura. Various times he tries to ask her out and the like but it never goes very well for him. We do eventually learn later in ""Naruto:the Last"" that Naruto's feelings for Sakura were another way for him to compete with Sasuke, but his feelings cannot be simply denied.  </p>

<p>My question is: has Sakura ever shown signs of love, not friendship, towards Naruto throughout the series? When?</p>

"How did maids get popular in anime?","<p>Nowadays, maids are basically a moe stereotype. Otaku characters like Sakurasou no Petto na Kanojou's Ryuunosuke Akasaka, Lucky Star's Konata Izumi, and the Genshiken gang all love maids. Even K-On's Sawako Yamanaka, who isn't an otaku, puts the Light Music Club girls in maid outfits.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xM8knm.jpg"" alt=""K-On girls in maid outfits""></p>

<p>For a while, every single show that came out had a maid character, and several shows focused wholly or in part on maids, who may or may not also be androids (e.g. Hanaukyou Maid Tai, Hand Maid May, He is My Master, Koharu Biyori, Mahoromatic).</p>

<p><sup>It was shockingly difficult to find a SFW picture from Koharu Biyori.</sup></p>

<p>Even shows that didn't have maids were affected: Digi Carat's Dejiko wore a costume which looked rather like a maid outfit, even though she was not a maid, but rather a clerk in an anime store (and actually an alien princess).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxmcIm.jpg"" alt=""Dejiko""></p>

<p>My perception was that this all started sometime around 2001, but I never saw how; it just seemed like one day I was surrounded by maids. (Not that it bothered me to be surrounded by maids.) How did this get started? Was there a single show or a few shows that started the maid craze? Or was it always there, and I just never noticed?</p>

"Does the size of a person matter when Devil Fruit powers are involved?","<p>As seen in the anime, Lily Enstomach grew herself into the size of a giant inside Luffy thus giving Luffy immense power.  He was strong with a weakness of becoming slower.  However, when he went into 2nd gear, the sheer power of turning into 2nd gear caused everything around him to be thrown back.</p>

<p>So does the size determine the amount of initial power the person has?</p>

<p>-The reason why I said initial was because power really matters on the training rather than the power of the devil fruit</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p>Luffy, when he got bigger, the effect of 2nd Gear was stronger.
Let's say that Buggy's devil fruit (section-section) gives Buggy the ability to split and fly a range 25 meters around his feet.  If Buggy was the size of a giant or the size of Whitebeard, would the range increase?</p>

<p>The <em>Ope Ope no Mi</em> can perform the ""Perennial Youth Operation"" which kills the DF user and gives eternal youth (and so potentially eternal life) to the subject. The <em>Yomi Yomi no Mi</em> enables the soul of the user to return to his body <strong>after his death</strong>.</p>

<p>Does the <em>Ope Ope no Mi</em> respawn after the Perennial Youth Operation (the user's death) or after the death of the operated person? Does the <em>Yomi Yomi no Mi</em> respawn after the ""First"" death or after the soul leaves this world forever?</p>

<p>At least for the <em>Ope Ope no Mi</em> there is no body left to contain the fruit's powers and after Doflamingo wanted to become immortal by Rosinante eating the fruit and performing the operation, the powers can not be stored in the operated person's body.</p>

<p>After the shot, Umiko, pointing at the for loop, said that the reason why the code crashed is that there is an infinite loop.</p>

<p>I don't really know C++ so I'm not sure whether what she is saying is true.</p>

<p>From what I can see, the for loop is just iterating through the debufs that the Actor currently has. Unless the Actor has an infinite amount of debufs, I don't think it can possibly become an infinite loop.</p>

<p>But I'm not sure because the only reason that there is a shot of the code is that they wanted to put an easter egg here, right? We would have just gotten a shot of the back of the laptop and heard Umiko saying ""Oh you've got an infinite loop there"". The fact that they actually showed some code makes me think that somehow the code is an easter egg of some sort.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pifXO.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<h2>However, the numbers don't add up.</h2>

<p>Suppose Misaka uses 10 gram coins. At <strong>1030 m/s</strong>, that coin has this much energy:</p>

<pre><code>Energy = 1/2 m v^2
       = 1/2 (0.01 kg) (1030 m/s)^2 = 5304.5 kg (m/s)^2
       = 5304.5 Joules
</code></pre>

<p>An olympic-sized swimming pool has 2,500,000 kg of water. Based on the image above, that cone probably travels a good 100 meters into the air.</p>

<p>So let's say for benefit of the doubt, that only 10% of the water is lifted 100 meters into the air.</p>

<pre><code>Energy = m g h
       = (0.01 * 2500000 kg) (9.8 m/s^2) (100 m) = 2.45 * 10^8 kg (m/s)^2
       = 2.45 * 10^8 Joules
</code></pre>

<p>The coin needs <code>2.45 * 10^8</code> Joules of energy to uplift the swimming pool as shown above. But her coin can only provide <code>5304.5 Joules</code>. <strong><em>There is a difference of about 4 orders of magnitude.</em></strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Okay... Before anyone dismisses this as just another case of Anime physics, let's look at what else could produce so much energy:</p>

<ol>
<li>The spin of the coin is not captured in the net velocity of 1030 m/s. But given the moment of inertia of a little coin, it would need a tremendous (relativistic?) amount of spin to carry <code>10^8</code> Joules.</li>
<li>The charge of the coin is unspecified in the Anime. Perhaps Misaka somehow polarizes the charge in the coin and somehow makes it release upon contact with the target.</li>
<li>The mass-energy (<code>E = mc^2</code>) of the coin is <code>9 * 10^14</code> Joules. Is this what she did?</li>
</ol>

<p>So the question is: Is there any official explanation for where the coin gets so much energy? Or are we left to dismiss this as another case of Anime physics?</p>

"Does the Parappa the Rapper anime actually have any rapping?","<p>I watched the Parappa the Rapper anime several years ago, given that it was one of my favorite video games. However, I quickly discovered a fatal flaw: there was no actual rapping!! The producers instead decided to make it a children's show. How do you make an anime about a rapping dog with no actual rapping?!</p>

"Why does Shiroe bought all the land in Yamato and sold it to the server?","<p>In Log Horizon S2E12, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Shiroe asked one of the Kunies to lend him money so that he can buy all the land of Yamato, and then though a contract, reassign it to the Server permanently. He explained that this is so that other players can't buy the land and misuse it. e.g. trapping people out of the bank etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that. This means that in terms of land ownership, it will become something similar to when Elder Tale was still a game.</p>

<p>However, doesn't this cause another problem?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The whole reason why Shiroe bought the zone of the guild house in season 1 was to maintain peace in Akihabara wasn't it? Other members of the Round Table said that there is no way to maintain law and order, and Shiroe revealed that he now owns the bank, which means he can just restrict the access to the bank, of whoever breaks the ""law"" (""kicking them out"" of Akiba). And thus peace is maintained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what if someone starts to exploit new players again, like some guild once did to Minori and Touya?</p>

<p>This doesn't seem like something Shiroe would do...</p>

<p>Note that I haven't watched past episode 12 yet.</p>

"Why won't Harime Nui's left eye heal?","<p><strong>Fact 1</strong>: Any wound on a Life Fiber-infused human will automatically regenerate even if it is opened by a single blade of the Sword Scissors.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Harime Nui's torso is pierced by the blade of the Sword Scissors that is owned by Ryuuko. The wound healed off as soon as the blade is pulled out. There are many scenes like that throughout the series.  </p>

(Episode 21, 21:41)</p>

<p><strong>Fact 2</strong>: A wound on a Life Fiber-infused human will be prevented from regenerating only if it is cut by the two blades of the Sword Scissors, Bakuzan or an equivalent weapon at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>: The dialog at the beginning of episode 23.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Inumuta Houka</strong>: I figured out why Harime Nui's arms couldn't regenerate.
  The Sword Scissors and Bakuzan are able to cut Life Fibers.
  But for the case of strong Life Fibers, it immediately starts to regenerate from the point where it is cut off.
  However, if it is cut from the both sides at the same time, it is possible to once again cut off the Life Fibers which started to regenerate.
  This is the true power of the Sword Scissors that is made by Professor Matoi.<br>
  <strong>Matoi Ryuuko</strong>: Wait! Then those two Bakuzan pieces...<br>
  <strong>Inumuta Houka</strong>: ... will have the same effect.</p>

(Episode 23, Just after the opening)</p>

<p><strong>Contradiction</strong>: When Harime Nui invades Matoi Isshin's laboratory, he cuts Nui's left eye with only one blade of the Sword Scissors, but that eye of Nui never heals up. He couldn't have used both the blades, because the other blade of the scissors pair wasn't pulled out of his body until Ryuuko arrived.</p>

(Episode 12, 07:29)</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why doesn't Nui's left eye heal? It is not cut with the two blades together at the same time from both sides. It is cut with only one blade. Thus, it must be able to regenerate. But, it doesn't. Why?</p>

"Are the events in Ishbal based on or inspired by the Holocaust?","<p>I've noticed that a lot of Western fans seem to associate the genocide / war in Ishval with the Holocaust (or alternatively, the Middle East). However, from somewhat secondary sources, I've heard that Arakawa was inspired by the plight of the Burakumin or Ainu. (The first I don't remember the reference for; the second appears on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scar_(Fullmetal_Alchemist)"">this page for Scar</a> and on this reported interview, although there's no statement of where this is from.)</p>

<p><strong>Given that FMA is a <em>Japanese</em> manga and that the direct linkage of Amestris to Germany seems tenuous, I am more inclined to assume that there isn't an exact real world parallel to Ishbal.</strong> (After all, the exact details of <a href=""http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Ishval_Civil_War"">what happened in FMA</a> don't entirely match up to what I know about the Holocaust. In combination with the statements by Arakawa and the fact that Amestris isn't really reducible to being a ""fantasy version of German"", I would assume that the events are largely fantasy, even if some portions might be inspired by various real-life events.) </p>

<p>Moreover, I would see it as best to assume that the events in Ishval were inspired (at least partly) by issues such as Japanese colonialism (per <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/733666-in-researching-this-volume-i-interviewed-veterans-who-had-been"">statements</a> about interviewing war veterans<sup>1</sup>), even if some aspects might be European. My cynical self suggests that Western fans are also more likely to say <code>Ishvalan War of Extermination == Holocaust</code> because they simply are more likely to have more experience with it (or with the Middle East being an issue) than with tensions in East Asia, and not because this was necessarily explicitly stated somewhere.</p>

<p>What exactly is the arc involving Ishbal supposed to be based on, if anything? <strong>Is the oft-cited factoid that it is based on the Holocaust true, or is it more reasonable to associate it with issues linked to Japan or to see it as a largely fantastic element with occasional grounding in things that have happened in real life?</strong></p>

<hr>

<ol>
<li>(<strong>Update</strong>) I now realise that the most obvious purpose of such interviews would be to get some grounding for the experiences of military characters such as Mustang or Hawkeye. However, I'm trying to preserve the question as close to its original form as possible (and there, I had mentioned East Asia) in this clean-up.</li>

"What was the point of the game in Future Diary?","<p>In Future Diary, the justification for the game was that Deus was dying and looking for a successor.  That's an easy enough premise to understand.</p>

<p>But then it turns out that this is not the first time that this has happened.  Yuno had previously won the game and used her powers to enter the reality that we observe so that she can be with Yuki.  That is a little complicated but still relatively easy to follow.</p>

<p>Then when Yuki wins he ends up in his own reality, and we see that Deus is alive and well and it is around here that I begin to lose the plot.</p>

<p>What is the point of the game?  It shows absolutely no evidence of achieving it's stated goal, and by all appearances the stated justification for the game itself is false.</p>

"Why aren't mages trusted to remove their own limiters?","<p>In Nanoha StrikerS (season 3), several of the high-end mages had <a href=""http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Limiter"" rel=""nofollow"">limiters</a> imposed on them to limit their power output thereby reducing their mage rank levels:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Nanoha_Takamachi"" rel=""nofollow"">Nanoha Takamachi</a> - S+ reduced to AA.</li>
<li><a href=""http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Fate_Testarossa"" rel=""nofollow"">Fate Testarossa</a> - S+ reduced to AA.</li>

<li><a href=""http://nanoha.wikia.com/wiki/Lutecia_Alpine"" rel=""nofollow"">Lutecia Alphine</a> - S reduced to D?</li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose of the limiters was to limit the damage that could be caused to a small area and possibly to protect the mages themselves from overexerting.</p>

<p>Furthermore, limiters can only be removed by a high-ranked official.</p>

<p>With the exception of Lutecia (who was a captured antagonist), why were the mages not trusted to remove their own limiters if their purpose was to prevent <strong>accidental</strong> collateral damage?</p>

"Was the ending of Mawaru Penguindrum completely incoherent?","<p>The ending of Mawaru Penguindrum had a lot of ambiguous symbolism.</p>

<p>My first impression was that the writer had no idea how to resolve the fundamental questions of the plot, and thus had to throw out completely unresolvable symbolism in order to fake an ending.
A few of my driving questions throughout the series were as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A recurring motif of the show is that the main character would get possessed by a penguin hat, and pull one or two characters into a kind of alternate reality where they were handcuffed.  To what degree was this a hallucination?  Likewise, Penguins 1, 2, and 3, plus the additional penguin, were important characters who were not visible to most people in the show.  To what degree were they hallucinations, and to what degree were they paranormal?  </p></li>
<li><p>Were there any forces in the story that were godlike, in that they were both powerful and capable of passing judgement on mortals?  In particular, at the end of the show, it seems that two boys sacrificed their mortal lives for the sake of two girls.  Was this a sacrifice made to a god or other cosmic power?</p></li>

"Is Rascal correctly wearing a real type of backpack?","<p>In the first set of opening credits for <em>Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai</em> we see a short scene of Rascal wearing an unusual type of backpack in a way I have never seen before.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdH22.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tdH22.jpg"" alt=""Rascal from the back, wearing narrow, low backpack.""></a></p>

<p>I have only watched the first three episodes, and I don't believe there has been context for this picture presented. I've never seen such a narrow backpack before, but I'll assume they exist.  Several characteristics strike me as odd:</p>

<ol>
<li>By as low as it sits, it is as much as a ""butt pack"" as a backpack, at least as Rascal is wearing it.</li>
<li>The upper straps are shown restricting his arms. Is he unnecessarily binding his arms, or is that the proper way to wear it?</li>
<li>If the backpack were raised high enough for the upper straps to fit over his shoulders (common for most backpacks I believe), then the lower strap would seem to fit around his upper chest, which also seems unusual.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this a real world item being worn the way it is supposed to be?</p>

"Why are a lot of characters in anime and manga named after their mothers and not their fathers?","<p>I've noticed this a lot in many manga I've read. The character (usually the protagonist) is named after their mother's family name and not their father's. Some examples I have found of this are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Special A, Kei Takashima is named of his mother's family not his father's. Unless the parents were cousins, it seems the dad changed his name to Takashima, too.</li>
<li>In Naruto, Naruto Uzumaki is named after his mother Kushina Uzumaki. I know that this may be a plot device to hide who Naruto's father is at the beginning, but still why name after the mother? Why wasn't he named Namikaze?</li>
<li>In Shokugeki no Soma, Saiba Jouichiro changes his name to his wife's: Yukihira. Why doesn't he keep his name? It's possible that he wants to stay out of the public eye, but is it common for the man to take his wife's name?</li>
<li>Another example from the same manga as above, Azami Nakamura. He changed his name to Nakiri after marrying into Erina's mother's family. It could have been for prestige, but isn't it normally the wife who changes the name and not the husband? And Erina is named from her mother's family too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sorry for all the examples, but I really would like it if someone could help me understand. I know it could be because of a plot device, but it has confused me for a while.</p>

"Who typically owns the rights to an anime's soundtrack?","<p>I watched episode 7 of <em>Space Patrol Luluco</em> today, and, well, that sure was a thing. Saliently, it featured</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> a piece from the <em>Kill la Kill</em> soundtrack: ""Gekiban Tokka-gata Hitotsu-boshi Gokuseifuku"" (OST 2 track 1), which is basically the soundtrack-ified version of ""Before my body is dry"", a.k.a. ""DON'T LOSE YOUR WAY"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I'm spoilering this because, frankly, this is the best anime-related surprise I've gotten in ages.)</p>

<hr>

<p>This got me thinking - who typically owns the soundtrack of an anime? Is it the composer, or is it some other party, such as the animation studio or the production committee? </p>

<p>(By soundtrack, I mean the soundtrack; not OPs/EDs, which I strongly suspect tend to have different ownership schemes.)</p>

<hr>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.marklitwak.com/obtaining-music-for-a-motion-picture-soundtrack.html"">situation in Hollywood</a> is interesting as a point of comparison - various ownership schemes seem to be possible (though I don't know which are more common). In some cases, the soundtrack will be treated as a work-for-hire owned by the film's producers; in other cases, the composer will own the soundtrack and will license usage rights to the producers; and surely other possibilities exist. (Keep in mind, of course, that Japan and the US have fairly divergent conventions when it comes to the handling of intellectual property, so the situation in Hollywood is probably not the same as the situation in... Akihabara?)</p>

She has no recollection of Yuki at all in this world, even though she knows she is missing some very important memories. </p>

<p>This is almost identical to the state Yuki is in while trapped in the ""ideal"" world created for him by the original Yuno. However, she purposely removed herself from that false world, so it makes sense that Yuki can't even recall her name.</p>

"Why is altering the future limited to diary users?","<p>Throughout the episodes, there are several scenes that play out in a similar fashion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Static is heard and a diary's contents are updated to reflect the updated future.</em></p>
  
  <p>Person 1: ""Did you hear that?""</p>
  
  <p>Person 2: ""There must be another diary user nearby""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But sometimes the things that alter the future are incredibly trivial, (like travelling to a different floor on the elevator, or not eating a salad) and theoretically anyone should be able to do them. The main reason the diary users change the future more often is because they can see certain events in advance and consciously decide to change them, but other than that, they are visibly no different from the rest of the population.</p>

<p>Everyone seems to have free will, and so everyone should be able to make a spontaneous decision and affect the timeline. For example, Yuki altering the future by opening the door at Yuno's house was down to his curiosity alone and not related to his diary, so surely a non-user would have altered the timeline in that same scenario. </p>

<p>Granted, for a diary to display the altered future, it has to correspond with that diary's output (e.g. something in close proximity to Yuki, something affecting an escape for Ninth), but that alone doesn't isolate changes to <em>only</em> other diary users.</p>

<p>So why are the diary users so confident in proclaiming the proximity of another diary user when the future changes? Why couldn't it just be a regular person altering their schedule, coincidentally coinciding with the user? And doesn't Akise change the future (as a non-user) in chapter 14 during the coin game?</p>

"What do people eat, if not rice?","<p>Episode 7 of <em>Koutetsujou no Kabaneri</em> brings up the point that nobody in Japan eats rice anymore, since the rice paddies are outside the stations, and hence overrun by the <em>kabane</em>. </p>

<p>This makes a lot of sense, and is a splendid bit of worldbuilding. But if they can't grow rice, what staple food(s) do they grow and eat instead? </p>

<hr>

<p>Out of all the common staple foods currently eaten, it seems that potatoes (or sweet potatoes) can provide the most calories-per-unit-area, clocking in at about 4-5 times as much as rice. But at just 4-5 times rice's calorie/area yield, they'd have to have lost no more than 75-80% of their arable land to maintain the same calorie output. Judging from the sizes of the stations we've seen, it doesn't seem plausible that they still have that much arable land - we see the railforts driving through days of outside-station land between stations.</p>

<p>Perhaps the resolution here is that Japan's population has dipped so precipitously in the face of the <em>kabane</em> menace that the meager amount of land enclosed by the stations does suffice to grow enough of some other staple crop to feed the people?</p>

"Why aren't Meow and Dandy zombies anymore?","<p>In episode 4 of <em>Space Dandy</em>, Meow, Dandy, and many other people become zombies, after Meow gets bitten by an infected alien. If I'm not mistaken, there's no cure for being a zombie -- all the advice Dandy and Meow get is to change their outlook by eating yoghurt instead of meat and sunbathing, so that they are <em>fermenting</em> instead of rotting. (Whether this logic about zombie biology is true is probably best left to another question.) This reaches the point where since life insurance companies are losing a lot of money to zombies cashing out on their policies, they try in vain to hunt down these zombies (but fail and eventually also become zombies).</p>

<p>Now, everything looks fine in the next episode: Meow, Dandy, and the massive swathes of the population that were zombies in episode 4 are now alive again. Why is this the case? Does <em>Space Dandy</em> largely simply consist of non-cohesive ""filler"" segments that don't necessarily have to follow each other? Or did some cure for zombification come up?</p>

<p>I haven't read the manga, so perhaps something comes up there.</p>

"Is it known if Rimuru's magicule supply is growing rapidly?","<p>Rimuru, the protagonist of <em>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</em>, has powerful magical abilities.  In that world, ""magicules"" are basically particles of mana and are the fuel for magic.  In two episodes we see him depleting magicules to below his minumum reserve point, at which point he shuts down for three days.  When he awakens, his supply is fully restored.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In episode 3 he names about <strong>100</strong> goblins and, lastly, the direwolf alpha.  (Later we learn that naming the alpha (Ranga) allowed the name to be shared by the entire pack.) Then he shuts down due to insufficient magicules.  In episode 6 he names about <strong>500</strong> more goblins before shutting down.  Even if naming Ranga counted as 100 named wolves, that was still only <strong>200</strong> total beings named the first time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could he actually store about 2.5 times more magicules after about 10 days?  That is the simplest explanation for the greater feat.  If so, is it known if his magicule storage continues to grow at that kind of fast pace?</p>

<p>A second possibility is that, in the first instance, simultaneously affecting a whole pack acted as sort of a short circuit on magicule usage.  Doing it one at a time might have used much less total. This case would not require the kind of magicule storage growth seen in the first.</p>

<p>A third possibility is that as he learns to use his abilities, he gets more efficient in using them.  So the second time he could accomplish a lot more with the same amount of magicules.</p>

<p>A fourth possibility is that I'm way overthinking this...</p>

"Which of the character quirks are based on real life, and which are purely fictional?","<p>In the Kancolle anime (and presumably the game as well), several characters have little quirks that make them more memorable and unique. Some of these appear to be based on the factual history of the warships they resemble, but others I'm not so sure on.</p>

<p>For example, the character Kongou often uses English phrases sporadically in her sentences, and in her introduction to Fubuki she mentions she was ""born in England [and] raised in Japan"". The real life battleship that was the first of the Kongou class was indeed originally constructed in England, which makes me believe that the quirks of this character are a reference to the history of the warship.</p>

"Does Nausicaä wear underpants, and if not, what outside-universe reason is there?","<p>I haven't watched all of it yet, but it seems as if Nausicaä isn't wearing underpants in the anime version. Either that, or she's wearing tight-fitting slacks that are of a colour close to skin tone. Is she wearing underpants?</p>

<p>If she isn't wearing underpants, what is the outside-universe reason for not doing so? Within-universe, it seems to make sense: a lot of the clothing worn is very simple clothing, as if it were hand-made. However, while other Ghibli works I've come across seem moderately relaxed with regards to clothing (you can briefly see totally innocent underwear in Kiki's delivery service, and there's a joking suggestion of nude portraiture) it seems a little surprising.

  <p> After the Naruto and Sasuke fight (in Naruto volume 72: Uzumaki Naruto chapters 694-698), both of them lost one of their arms above the elbow. <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnJjV.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bnJjV.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> After a while, Naruto got a fake arm (I think Sasuke didn't) which was wrapped in bandages (it was shown in the rest of the mangas, The Last: Naruto the Movie, and Boruto: Naruto the Movie).

<p>It was shown in the movies and in the manga that his arm can move and act like his arm used to before he lost it, so he can use it for eating, writing, carrying things, holding things, waving hand signs, releasing jutsus, etc.. But how does it work? I know it was created by Tsunade, and since she's an excellent medical ninja she could have found a way or something, but was it ever mentioned of how it worked or anything? I mean, I know the Naruto Universe evolved over time and stuff, so I guess they found a way to create body part that works like they used to.</p>

"Why can Devil Fruit users use their abilities while wet?","<p>My understanding was that the sea is supposed to weaken devil fruit users and rob them of their powers. The <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Devil_Fruit#Side_Effects_of_Devil_Fruits"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One Piece Wikia</a> elaborated: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Devil Fruit users are susceptible to all types of water, not just seawater. This includes the white sea surrounding Skypiea. [Oda] elaborated on this, saying that ""moving"" water, like rain or waves, does not weaken Devil Fruit users, while standing water does.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Wikia also states the users cannot use their powers while submerged.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if a part of the user is submerged, they cannot use their Devil Fruit powers, no matter how much or how little is submerged. However, if the user's body has been permanently altered by the fruit, then the user's ability can be manipulated by outside sources (eg Luffy's neck was stretched while submerged at Arlong Park).</p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How did Ajoki freeze the ocean?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/udP1Cl.png"" alt=""Ajoki freezing an ocean""></p>

<p>May I emphasize he submerged his hand in the sea to use Ice Age?</p></li>
<li><p>How did Luffy fight Crocodile while wet at Marine Ford?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JboMcm.png"" alt=""Luffy fighting Crocodile while wet""></p>

<p>He was dripping wet after having fallen into the sea. Does the water not weaken him since he was now submerged? I assumed since sea stone worked just by touching it and it has the same effect as the ocean, then by having part of the ocean ""touch"" him would drain his power.</p></li>

"Why is (action-adventure) anime so focused on teenagers?","<p>I've been a fan of anime since Star Blazers in my childhood, but... I wonder about an overused cliche in anime action-adventure series: teenage prodigy heroes.</p>

<p>For example, the most popular action-based anime (as opposed to comedy or relationship-based) currently on Netflix and Hulu (as well as StackExchange tag frequency): Attack on Titan, Black Butler, Bleach, Death Note, Fairy Tail, Fullmetal Alchemist, Knights of Sidonia, Naruto, One Piece, Sword Art Online. All of them feature unusually capable teens as the lead protagonists. Adults are supporting characters, or entirely absent.</p>

<p>Certainly there are exceptions (Samurai Champloo, etc), and this trope is also seen in the US (e.g. Adventure Time, Avatar, Young Justice, etc) but it's a matter of degree. Non-child heroes are not a rarity in western animation (Avengers, Batman, Tranformers, etc).</p>

<p>Is this a real thing in Japanese culture, and if so what does it mean? Or is it just a USA-based artifact of marketing (i.e. this particular subgenre is actively emphasized for translation) or audience (i.e. non-child anime is just as common but has less active fans)?</p>

However, after an extensive review on their fight (Episode 626), I can't see where and when Madara bit Hashirama. It said in the wiki that:  </p>

<p><em>""...To use Izanagi to its full potential, users must also have the genetic traits of the Senju, who are also descended from the Sage..""</em></p>

How come Madara activated Izanagi (I assume on its full potential) just right after he acquired the flesh/blood from Senju?</p>

<p>Does the original lifespan mean the amount of time a person has from birth to death, ultimately caused by old age (e.g. the longest a person could live barring abnormal health problems or unusual circumstances (e.g. murders, accidents))? </p>

<p>What if the person contracts a lethal disease? Surely it would shorten their lifespan, but would it affect their original lifespan?</p>

John has a lifespan of 93 years (as seen through Shinigami eyes). He works for the CIA, though, and at one point comes into contact with a high dose of radiation from a nuclear device. Doctors tell him he only has a couple days to live.</p>

<p>In this case, John's lifespan has been shortened from 93 years to 2 days. If he writes his own name in the Death Note, set to die from a different disease that takes years and years to develop, would he have effectively beaten radiation poisoning? </p>

(I was particularly puzzled by her comments, made with an authoritative tone, that ""An adult, even a parent, who takes a bath with a child would be arrested"" in the United States.) <a href=""http://mrcaxton.livejournal.com/26421.html"">This source</a> also claims the series is only regarded as ""mildly risqu&eacute;"" in Japan.</p>

<p>But what is NARAKU NINJA's motivation? What drives him - a NINJA himself - to slay other NINJA indiscriminately? </p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> Note: FUKUSHŪ means REVENGE.</p>

"Who produced what on Alexander Senki?","<p>Reading the question <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/q/6198/7579"">Can an animated show created outside Japan be called anime?</a>, I recalled one of the worst shows of my teenage years: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign:_The_Conqueror"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alexander Senki</a>, released in the US as Reign: The Conqueror.</p>

<p>This show retells the life of Alexander the Great as anime, in much the same way that the movie <em>300</em> retells the battle of Thermopylae as a video game. The first review on <a href=""http://myanimelist.net/anime/1442/Alexander_Senki"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the MyAnimeList page</a> pretty much sums up my feelings about this series. 
Beyond its gruesome awfulness, I've always had my doubts that this show really counts as anime according to the definition that ʞɹɐzǝɹ gave in the answer to the linked question.</p>

<p>According to the Wikipedia page, the show was created by an ""international crew that drew from the resources of the worldwide animation community"". The offensively hideous character designs were courtesy of Korean-American animator Peter Chung, well known for such highly regarded anime classics as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriculated_(The_Animatrix)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Matriculated</em></a> from The Animatrix, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86on_Flux"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Æon Flux</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugrats"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rugrats</a>. The animation was by Madhouse, though Wikipedia claims ""[m]ost of the production work was handled by Korean animators."" The producers of the show also apparently created their own English dub, which was scrapped by Tokyopop when they distributed the series.</p>

<p>I'm curious who else made up the ""international crew"". Was it essentially a normal anime production, where Madhouse outsources the grunt work to Korean studios, except produced under the creative direction of a guy who thinks the ancient Greeks ran around in thong underwear with metal plates sewn on? Or did the Korean studios play a greater than average role? Was there some other significant part of the show which was produced outside Japan?</p>

"How did Chino's grandfather end up as a rabbit?","<p>From the first episode of <em>Gochuumon wa Usagi desuka?</em> (<em>Is the order a rabbit?</em>) Chino's grandfather was depicted as a rabbit (very questionable since he didn't look like a rabbit, but the anime says so, so let's call him a rabbit). However, considering that both Chino's father and Chino are normal humans, and that the writer who often comes to Chino's cafe (Rabbit House) used to chat with the first owner (Chino's grandfather), there must be a time where he was a normal human. Otherwise, the writer lady would have noticed it was him when she saw the rabbit. Also since the rabbit has no arms (at least the first season doesn't show it having arms), and considering his size, he wouldn't be able to pour coffee. Has it been explained somewhere (anime and manga) why Chino's grandfather turned into a rabbit?</p>

"Did both Crocodile and Smoker use the artificial rain powder in Alabasta?","<p>By reading the manga and rewatching the anime I reached to this conclusion - 
Rain didn't fall in Alabasta for 3 years, but before that it did only in the capital and not in the neighbouring regions. 
When the artificial rain powder is used, the location where it is used gets more than average rain and nearby areas don't get any. 
Since by good faith we know the king wasn't using the powder or had any knowledge of it being used, could it be that Crocodile was using it in the capital from some hidden location which resulted in such a phenomenon and after he stopped using it, say the 3 years that no rain happened was the time natural weather was reconstructing itself and whether or not Crocodile was defeated, it would have rained nonetheless??</p>

<p>And secondly if Smoker had used artificial rain machine from a ship after the fight (couldn't figure out whether it was the case or not as he says when asked, he will never break the law but it is shown such a ship is there in the back) , how was he able to make rain the whole island?? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eventhough they never directly admit it, I'm sure there's some amount of influence that Evangelion had on Rahxephon, intended or not, simply because <em>Evangelion was an incredibly influential show, at a time when it seemed anime in general was stagnating</em>.

"How is the ability to use chakra alloted?","<p>This might have an obvious answer that I've missed but I'm just checking it out for a fanfiction. I know kekkei genkai are genetic. I know everyone has chakra but not everyone has the ability to use it and this may or may not have something to not with the size of chakra coils? Not sure about this as I've probably read more fanfics than canon. Anyway.
The question is this: Is the ability to use chakra genetic (so basically all ninja are descended in some way from Kaguya Otsutsuki including Sakura Haruno via some kind of recessive gene..) or was it simply available to use (randomly?) after Kaguya ate the fruit of the Shinju? Since Kaguya is named as the progenitor of chakra, I'm assuming no one could use chakra before her.
The genetic theory requires a long period of natural selection, such as the Out of Africa and Eve theories on Earth. I'm not sure of the time skip between Kaguya and Naruto is enough for this.
Anyway, all answers welcome.</p>

It includes the souls of the four previous Hokages. Now, before his death, Minato was able to seal half of the nine tails chakra into his own. Does it mean that he is much stronger than he when was alive? Does he have any chance on using the kyuubi's chakra for himself just like what Naruto did?</p>

<p>Pledge 4 actually seems to point out that the 'game' and that which players bet in pledges 2 and 3 are kinda not quite defined at least in terms of the scope. I mean, what's the scope of the games or that which players bet? It seems pledge 4 is precisely defining the scope, but pledge 4 refers to pledge 3. My understanding is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pledge 2: All conflict in this world will be resolved through games, where games are defined in scope in pledge 4.</p>
  
  <p>Pledge 3: In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value, where games and that which players bet are defined in scope in pledge 4.</p>

Then, he tells Kisame about his Eye of the Moon Plan (Tsuki no Me) and recruits him to Akatsuki. So that's like 4 people who knew the true identity of Tobi as 'Madara' (later Obito, but they didn't know that): Konan, Nagato, Itachi, Kisame.</p>

<p>But if Kisame also knew him as the leader of Akatsuki, then why was he surprised when Tobi showed his face to him the second time, after Itachi died? I thought he already knew that Tobi mas Madara since he was the one who recruited him. It made sense for him to continue with Akatsuki after Nagato died, since Kisame didn't really care about who the leader was, as long as Kisame got the job done, but the only thing that bothers me is: why was he surprised when Tobi showed his face to Kisame the <em>second time</em>? He should've already known it was Madara/Obito. Is this a plot hole?</p>

"How did Menma fulfill her wish?","<p>In Ano Hana, if I understood correctly, Menma's wish was to help Jinta's dying mother fulfill her wish, and that was to make Jinta cry. If it was, then why did Menma start to vanish on the last episode when Jinta cried again for the first time after Menma appeared before him in the episode when he joked that he remembered something (a movie perhaps) to hide the real reason he was crying from Menma? </p>

<p>Would the wish just take effect if Menma clearly remembered what it is? Or <em>making Jinta cry</em> was just put in that way by his mother for the young Menma to understand and what it really meant was for Jinta to generally open himself up again to different emotions like enjoying himself with his friends, to laugh when he's happy, to get angry when he is, to cry when he's lonely, etc? </p>

<p>And the day Menma died, Menma called for the Super Peace Buster to fulfill that wish but unfortunately, due to Yukiatsu and Anaru's plan to tell everyone what Jinta feels about Menma, (which apparently Menma and Tsuruko knew about) it failed and led to Menma's death. How did she plan to fulfill that promise that day? </p>

<p>If that were all, then we could just write off the show as one of anime's great failures, but the abomination continued with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_o_Nerae!"">Smash Hit!</a> (<em>Hit wo Nerae!</em>) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Love?"">LOVE♥LOVE?</a>. These series were aired in sequence immediately after CosPrayers and produced by the same people. In them, CosPrayers is a live-action television show, and both shows are about the production of CosPrayers. It is plagued with numerous problems, including poor management, lack of experience of the producers, unsuitable content, and even actresses seducing the screenwriter to try to get more screentime.</p>

<p>If a real show was plagued with so many problems, I imagine the result would be pretty bad. So it's almost understandable why CosPrayers was so bad, especially if it was intended to add to the story of the other two series. However, if that was their goal, I'd imagine that airing CosPrayers last, rather than first of the three, would be the better approach. It's also rather unbelievable that a studio would create a bad show deliberately, since I can't imagine they'd expect to make money off of it. Still, the show seems almost too bad to be true, and some forum posts online claim that it was deliberately made that way to match the other two series better.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence suggesting that CosPrayers was made to be a bad show, and the problems plaguing it were deliberate? Or is this just ""fan"" speculation?</p>

"What does the German say in the opening of ef - a tale of melodies?","<p>The OP sequences for ef - a tale of melodies have a lot of German text in the background. The text seems to be the same for all of the different versions. This version is from episode 6, and features the instrumental version of the song (Ebullient Future) and the characters are not present, so it's the easiest to read the text:</p>

"Why did Majitani's surrender not count in his Trick Tower fight with Kurapika?","<p>In <a href=""https://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter/episode-9-beware-x-of-x-prisoners-585056"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 9</a> of the 2011 version of <em>Hnter x Hunter</em>, Kurapika's fight is with the prisoner Majitani.  They agree to a battle to the death.  Once Majitani realizes he is hopelessly outmatched, he says ""I surrender!"" (time code 18:41)  Kurapika is already in the process of punching him, and knocks him out. The surrender is never acknowledged, and there is a verbal dispute over whether Majitani is dead.  The other prisoners claim that Kurapika's match must end before Leorio's can begin. Majitani's surrender is never brought up by either side.</p>

<p>One might argue that in a death battle, surrender is irrelevant.  Yet the first match, between Tonpa and Bendot, was also a death battle.  Tonpa was allowed to surrender. Presumably this was because when the examiner Lippo explained the rules, he stated, ""A winner is declared when the opponent admits defeat"" (<a href=""https://www.crunchyroll.com/hunter-x-hunter/episode-8-decision-x-by-x-majority-585054"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 8</a>, time code 14:17).</p>

<p>(following paragraph added next day)<br>
Everything Majitani said and did prior to and during his match with Kurapika was meant to intimidate. Calling for a death match was part of that strategy. He knew he was not really a strong fighter, so I believe his goal was to get Kurapika to surrender.</p>

<p><strong>Why did Majitani's surrender not matter?</strong></p>

<p>One might claim that no one heard it, not even Kurapika. But then dramatically, what was the point in having the surrender in the first place? If it's just going to be there, unexplained and unmentioned, it will just cause some nerd to come to a q&amp;a site and ask about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hijiri: I win with the most, which means...I'll be in charge of this matter.<br>
  Onsa: But how do you make the race more exciting with gold?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is this game supposed to work? According to Hane, ""whoever has the most wins"". The most what? It looks like ""the most people writing the same character"". But then why does Hijiri win, and not Raimu, who wrote the same character? (Aside from the reason that it's hard to organize a race when you can only communicate by writing on a notebook and no one officially recognizes your existence.)</p>

<p>Also, if you're allowed to pick any character, the odds of any of the <a href=""https://japanese.stackexchange.com/a/11737/7218"">50,000 kanji in the Dai Kan-wa Jiten</a>, or even any of the 2,136 Jouyou kanji, getting a majority among five people are quite low. Initially I thought the characters were limited to days of the week, but Rin picked 銀 (silver), which isn't a day of the week.</p>

<p>Since Hane mentions that Onsa invented this game, I assume it isn't a real game, but maybe it's based on something, or was explained more fully in the manga.</p>

 Secondly, not being of the Uchiha bloodline, he faces immense problems in using even a single eye for long periods of time.

"Does Kaido possess any other power other than just being physically strong?","<p><em>Kaido (カイドウ)</em> has such incredible strength. But, to be one of the Yonko, it takes strength beyond even an Admiral level and there must be an explanation for Kaido. The most normal person I've known as Yonko is <em>Shanks</em>, but since he possesses incredible and powerfull Haki so it makes sense. But Kaido? Does he have mysterious power other than just being physically strong?</p>

<p><em>From One Piece Wikia</em> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps the greatest sign of Kaido's strength is his apparent
  inability to die. He has been caught and tortured 18 times, and people
  as powerful as the Marines and other Yonko have attempted to execute
  him 40 times. However, he mysteriously survived every single attempt
  because every single execution weapon broke when being used on him.
  Most notably, Kaido has jumped from 10,000 meters in the sky onto the
  ground, creating a massive shockwave strong enough to sink a large
  ship nearby, and emerged without an injury; it has even become a hobby
  for him to attempt suicide, only for it to fail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's not enough explaination about <em>Kaido</em>'s power.</p>

<p>Here is the thing, you know <em>Admiral Akainu (赤犬)</em>,  possesses the <em>Magu Magu no Mi</em> which grants him the ability to transform his body into terrifying magma and manipulate it at will, he can even afford to crush a land if he wants. But hey, that's not enough to match a Yonko.</p>

<p>So back again to Kaido, Does he have any other mysterious power?</p>

"Why do the stronger enemies in anime/manga tend to look more human?","<p>So if the question sounded a bit confusing, allow me to explain.</p>

<p>In media that feature a lot of non-human characters, such as many video games, anime, manga, or movies, the low-level enemies always tend to look blatantly non-human, ie generic monster.</p>

<p>However, as you encounter more enemies, you start to notice that the more powerful the enemy, the more human they look. They might still retain some monstrous features, such as horns, tentacles, claws, etc, but their overall figure is very clearly humanoid.</p>

<p>Let me use some examples to illustrate this observation.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon Ball</strong>: Cell has various forms that he transforms into. However, his most powerful form looks the most human.</p>

<p><strong>One Punch Man</strong>: The final villain of the first anime season is Boros, an extraterrestrial. Most of his subordinates look very alien-like, such as <a href=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/onepunchman/images/7/73/Geryuganshoop_anime_AV.png/revision/latest?cb=20151222074111"" rel=""noreferrer"">Geryuganshoop</a>, with the big eyes and tentacles. However, Boros <a href=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/deathbattlefanon/images/a/ad/Render_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20160228030045"" rel=""noreferrer"">himself looks very human-like</a>, save for the single eye. His hands even have 5 fingers.</p>

<p><strong>Gantz:</strong> In the Osaka Arc, the final villain was an alien called Nurarihyon, <a href=""https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gantz/images/f/f4/Nurarihyon_Alien_Boss.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141124124112"" rel=""noreferrer"">who just looks like an old man.</a>. His human-like appearance even caused some of the characters to doubt his status. However, his two subordinates look viciously demon-like, and all the other lower-ranked aliens also look very monstrous. Nurarihyon is the strongest of them all, but resembles a human the most. Also, in the final arc, the final alien antagonists are almost identical to humans in appearance, behavior, and civilization. They serve as the final villains since they're the most powerful aliens our humans characters have had to face.</p>

<p><strong>Bleach:</strong> The Hollows all look like <a href=""https://cdn.myanimelist.net/s/common/uploaded_files/1445787031-10e017b1f94530461d63ce1fb2777900.jpeg"" rel=""noreferrer"">your average monsters</a>, and are usually not that strong. However, the Arrancar, which are basically Hollows that have ascended and gained new powers, <a href=""http://pm1.narvii.com/5804/3055358fd24a8357adf7e6e72cc3bb491a660580_00.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">all look like humans</a>, save for a few features. The Arrancar are exponentially stronger than regular Hollows, and serve as the antagonists for a major story arc. </p>

<p>There's a lot more series that implement this trope, and it extends far beyond just anime and manga. I'm just curious as to the reasoning behind it. </p>

<p>Is there some kind of physics-based reason for why stronger enemies tend to be humanoid? Is the humanoid form factor the most optimal one for combat?</p>

<p>Or is this some kind of literary technique that I'm not familiar with? Clearly these creators all have this type of design philosophy in common.</p>

If he is not really in love with Haruhi or if he is in love with Asahina, then, why isn't he affected of Haruhi's power (assuming that Haruhi thought that having Kyon in love with her would be great)? Or is it that Haruhi didn't think of something like that (this seems to be impossible since she even dragged Kyon when she was about to change the world) or she's not really in love with Kyon (seems not the case as well)? Or Haruhi's power doesn't affect people's feelings? If Kyon is really in love with her (from the bottom of his heart and not from Haruhi's powers), then how can it be? Was Kyon the exception to Haruhi's rule or Kyon can somehow nullify Haruhi's power? </p>

"How does element dominance work in Avatar?","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/x2p7m.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Even though I learnt this concept from the Naruto series, <strong>it really makes sense</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you blow (wind), fire will increase... so fire > wind</li>
<li>When you throw water on fire, it diminishes... so water > fire</li>
<li>When you smash water against it, it will have no effect on solid (earth)... so earth > water</li>
<li>And so on...</li>
</ul>

<p>Following this logic, why can't waterbenders beat firebenders in Avatar (The Last Airbender)?</p>

<p>I also noticed that Aang himself, who is an airbender, could defend against firebending with his airbending skills. (note that I am referring to those earlier episodes when he was just an airbender (season: 1, episode: 1-5))</p>

"A one shot shoujo manga about a girl who's afraid of boys","<p>I've been trying to find this particular one shot shoujo manga. </p>

<p>It was about a shy girl with short (red?) hair, who didn't really know how to hang out/deal with boys. An upperclassman who had blond (?) hair from the drama club (?) noticed her predicament. He tried to help her out by going on a date with her to the amusement park. The upperclassman dressed up in different clothing for a stimulation, and he went with the cool ikemen image. They both went on their amusement park date, and the girl gradually fell for the upperclassman. Somewhere along the plot, she thought that she had been cured from her androphobia, but it turns out she was still bad with boys, except for that upperclassman.</p>

<p>The last thing I remember from the manga was that the girl found out she wasn't the only one that the upperclassman was helping. He had other girls ask for make-believe dates, so she felt betrayed, and she probably ran away crying or something. In the end, the upperclassman came to her and said that she was the only one for him, and he promised he would never go on make-believe dates again, all that jazz.</p>

<p>The art was shoujo, similar to <a href=""https://www.mangaupdates.com/authors.html?id=3742"" rel=""nofollow"">Shiraishi Yuki</a>'s art.</p>

"Law regarding doujinshi","<p>Doujinshi, as defined on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Djinshi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, are self-published works. While not all doujinshi are derived from other manga, they mostly are, like the many Touhou and Naruto doujins. The works that they are derived from are mainly those with copyrights, meaning that the characters depicted in those original works are also protected and thus cannot be used without consent of the copyright holders. However, as we can see from Yuru Yuri, Oreimo and the Comiket in real life, doujinshi are sold in Comiket. When they are derived from other works and sold, it means that their use is for commercial purpose, which would be very likely prohibited by the copyright holders. Yet, they keep selling doujinshi in every Comiket and the police ain't doing anything about it.</p>

<p>Thus my question: what is the law behind doujinshi? Does every doujinshi sold in Comiket have a written consent from the copyright holders? Or is it the case that by labeling their works as doujinshi, they are exempted from the copyright law? What about the R-18+ doujinshi?</p>

We have seen Madara, Itachi and Sasuke, all wielders of the Mangekyo Sharingan, use Susanoo. All three have gone blind or have worsened eyesight at some point*. Itachi and Sasuke have also been shown using Amaterasu which makes the eyes bleed afterwards. </p>

<p>Danzo Shimura, Obito Uchiha and Kakashi Hatake, also wielders of the Mangekyo Sharingan, on the other hand, have never used any of the above techniques and have never shown any sign of blindness*. <strong>Why didn't they go blind or have worsened eyesight?</strong> </p>

<p><strong>What causes the blindness effect of the Mangekyo Sharingan? How does the Mangekyo Sharingan eventually blind its wielder?</strong></p>

"Is there a way to indicate the action to remove a manga's cover to see the hidden cover?","<p>Ok, maybe the question can look weird. And actually it is.
Let me explain further: a friend of mine removes a lot of times covers from his manga(tankōbon). I don't mean that he actually rips off the cover from the manga, but he removes the dust jacket(or, for me, the first layer) of the colored cover. Under this dust jacket, sometimes, there is another hidden not-colored cover page, that shows author's easter eggs.</p>

<p>I don't have pictures now, but, for example, it happens with some volumes of Monster Musume and Made in Abyss.</p>

<p>I didn't find anything about this on the web, and no one talks about it.
So, I was asking: is there a term to describe this practice? Is it frequent to do it between collectors?
I am just curious to know about this.</p>

<p>P.S. I know that it's difficult to understand, but I don't speak english natively. I'm sorry for bad english.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As Aki Tanaka said in comments, also <a href=""https://blog-imgs-31-origin.fc2.com/g/o/g/gogohappyday/20111110220206242.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One Piece sometimes has this kind of easter eggs</a>.</p>

"How exactly does Akiko's healing ability work?","<p>In episode 4, we learn that Akiko is the Armed Detective Agency's doctor, when she's healing Junichirou Tanizaki.</p>

<p>Just when she's about to start healing him, she starts taking off her shirt, and though Tanizaki appears to be dreading what's about to go down, she has a grin on her face:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/imWeA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/imWeA.jpg"" alt=""Akiko grinning""></a></p>

<p>That suggested, to me, that she was about to take some sort of sexual pleasure from what's about to go down.</p>

<p>Then the scene switches to the next room, where Atsushi and Kunikida are, and it sounds like Tanizaki is not really enjoying himself:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZxT1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PZxT1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

"Do we know the timing of all of the events in the anime?","<p>To the best of my knowledge, in the <em>Joker Game</em> anime, we are not consistently given information about when the different events shown occur. I do know the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Joker Game"" clearly occurs shortly after the founding of D-Agency in autumn of 1937.</li>
<li>""XX (Double Cross)"" occurs in spring of 1939.</li>
<li>""Robinson"" and ""Asia Express"" take place in 1939.</li>
<li>""Double Joker"" includes a flashback that takes place six months before the main events. In the flashback, the D-Agency has recently been created; the main events then probably are in 1938.</li>
<li>The spy in ""Miscalculation"" had a one-year stay in France planned, starting from June 15, 1939. France was occupied in June 1940, so it seems likely that ""Miscalculation"" is set in 1940.</li>
<li>""Pursuit"" makes reference to the events of ""Robinson"", and so must have occurred afterwards.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also see a character in ""Coffin"" comment that a behind-the-scenes three-way alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy has been formed. This restricts the possible dates of the main events of that episode, but I still do not have anything narrow enough for want of sufficient historical knowledge.</p>

<p>I am left without knowing when ""City of Temptation"", ""Pursuit"", ""Codename: Cerberus"", and ""Coffin"" take place. (It is obvious, for instance, that ""City of Temptation"" takes place when Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese, but the resulting timeframe is still rather large.) Is there any official information on when the various events happen? If not, can we make any inferences (based on details we see, or details in other adaptations of the same material) to make educated guesses?</p>

"Is Ryuk required to write Misa's name in his Death Note at the end of her life?","<p>Death Note Rule LXIV states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gods of death are obliged to confirm the death of the first owner and
  write down that humans name in his/her Death Note</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Misa was the first human owner of the Death Note that was brought into the human world by Rem.</strong> Misa then gave up this Death Note, and then picked it up again later, and this time the Shinigami owner was Ryuk (Light made him and Rem switch notebooks). Obviously the responsibility of killing Misa would normally be Rem's, since she was the first to ""drop"" that DN in the human world. <strong>But then Ryuk also ""dropped"" it after he got ownership of it, and Misa ""picked it up"" and became the owner for the second time. Rem is dead, so she can't kill Misa. Does this mean that the responsibility transfers to Ryuk?</strong> </p>

<p>I know that the anime makes it look like Misa was about to commit suicide. And it looks like it's her idea, too--I seriously doubt Ryuk would have made her go through all that trouble (wearing the ""handmaiden of death"" outfit and fancy makeup, traveling to the place where Light died,etc). But we don't actually see her die. Would Ryuk be the one to kill her, now that her life is about to end due to her own intentions? </p>

<p>Does anyone know of anything in the manga, creator commentary, etc., that might clear this up?</p>

"Why do Japanese anime characters shout so much?","<p>I would like to point out this incident from <strong>NHK ni Youkoso</strong> - Episode 21 (11:12 to 11:34).
The main character Sato is escorting his friend Yamazaki to a subway station to bid final adieu to him. Yamazaki is a game creator (gal games) and MC helps him to create one. I have written below a short piece of dialogue (writing it from the English subtitles) between the two at the subway station:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sato</strong>: Sorry</p>
  
  <p><strong>Yamazaki</strong>: If you visit home, be absolutely sure you get in touch</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sato</strong>: Sure..</p>
  
  <p><strong>Yamazaki</strong>: See you around.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sato (a bit panicked)</strong>: Yamazaki..</p>
  
  <p><strong>Yamazaki</strong>: Don't let the world beat you, Sato</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sato (this main character seems even more panicked and shouts in Japanese)</strong>: You are not going home defeated, right?!</p>
  
  <p><strong>Yamazaki</strong> <em>chuckles</em>.<br>
  ...
  ..</p>

"In Death Note, how far could ""sexual"" interaction go with a shinigami before it broke rule XXXVI?","<p>As the internet knows, in ""How To Use"" XXXVI, the following rule is stated:
""There are male and female gods of death, but it is neither permitted, nor possible for them to have sexual relations with humans. The gods of death also cannot have sex with each other. ""</p>

<p>Now, this rule isn't to prevent romantic interaction, as a shinigami can be in love and act like it, he will only die when he steps in to save his love interest. In other words, love isn't forbidden, purposefully saving lives is. No, the obvious would be that this rule addresses breeding. Nobody wants half-shinigami running around in either worlds. Or at least, the shinigami king doesn't.</p>

<p>But if something is not possible for a shinigami, why is it also forbidden? It's a pretty awkward catch: in humans (and supposedly also in creatures as sophisticated as shinigami, who have a culture and a personality) sexuality goes way beyond reproduction. We guys in the human world have hundreds of ways to spend a steamy hot night without actually doing the deed. So what is ""sexual relation"" supposed to mean?
Here are the two options that seem obvious to me, but neither feel entirely satisfying.</p>

<p>1) If ""sexual relations"" are both forbidden AND impossible, can a shinigami behave as lewd as he wants, with humans or peers, since none of it can be called ""sexual relationships"" (they're impossible) therefore everything sexual he does is by default allowed? (In which case, the interdiction would only exist in case it somehow became possible for shinigami to get laid, I guess?)</p>

<p>2) Or, is the rule twisted/badly worded, and implies that intercourse is not possible but also that all and any sexual behaviour is forbidden, despite being completely feasible? If that was the case, it begs the question why this rule exists in the first place, since it won't cause any offspring. That would also be the first time a Death Note rule is so imprecise and ambiguous.</p>

<p>The whole question could be dismissed by saying that shinigami just won't be interested in it in the first place, but I ruled it out, given how diverse their personalities are and how much some of them like to mess with humans in every way possible out of sheer boredom <em>am I right</em>.</p>

<p>Both solutions seem problematic. Is there any info out there that I missed, or any thinking I got wrong? Thank you a lot for helping me solve this mystery. </p>

I'm not great at telling the difference between dialects, however, so I was wondering, are non-Tokyo accents/dialects common in anime, or used at all? In shows like Yuri!!! on Ice, which is set in Kyushu, is a Kyushu accent being used or a Tokyo one? Do shows set in Kyoto use a Kyoto accent, or is everything standardized to a Tokyo-ben?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not saying that the history was only 1000 years, it might have been longer or even shorter.  There was no evidence to it so I estimated it by generation.  Each new generation every 60-80 years.</p>

<p>Similar sentiment is expressed in the <em>Fate</em> route of the visual novel. On the last day, Saber tells Shiro that he must have been able to summon her as a result of having had Excalibur's sheath embedded in him (similar to how it was embedded in Irisviel in <em>Fate/Zero</em>):</p>

I mean through a whole series we see tons of huge boobs, panty shots, etc. But when a hot girl or mainly the love interest, tries to hold hands with the guy or kiss or anything of that nature. He always chickens out, or thinks that it's inappropriate or they are interrupted or he's to stupid to get the situation. They can fight monsters and demons but when can't do that? It won't make the character any less Noble. Any why is there the need to ALWAYS have other characters interrupt it or make him to dense to understand the female loves him. Why can't anime creators for once let romance start near the beginning and go smooth instead of towards the end and super hard to get to? It's been this way since anime first started and it's not funny or entertaining anymore. </p>

"When do Japanese high schools have midterms?","<p>Exactly which days of which month do Japanese high schools that use a 3-semester format (which can cause students to repeat a grade) typically hold midterms in the first semester? And how many days pass between taking the midterms and the posting of the grades?</p>

<p>In episode 177 of Sailor Moon, Ami (Mercury) and Taiki (Star Maker) tie for top grade when grades are posted in the hallway. Taiki mentions in this episode that the (fictional) comet they see is visible at the same time as the (real-life) Centarus constellation, which is visible in Tokyo from mid-March until mid-May, with its maximum visibility around the first week of April.</p>

<p>However, in the previous episode, 176, Nezu (Sailor Iron Mouse) is reading issue 7 of <em>STAGE芸能</em> magazine, implying that it is mid- to late-June (since Japanese magazines come out a month, or half a month, before their publication date: 7 = July) and class 1-1 has a <em>sho tesuto</em> (quiz) in Math.</p>

<p>In the following episode, 178, it must be before June 1 because the students have not done <em>koromogae</em> yet (changing from long-sleeved school uniform to short-sleeved, which I read on the web takes place on June 1st every year). On the other hand, in this episode, Yaten (Star Healer) is taping a TV show, and I read online that Japan has four television seasons: winter (January–March), spring (April–June), summer (July–September), and autumn (October–December), and that each episode of Japanese dramas are usually shot only a few (two to three) weeks before they are actually aired. The minor character Noriko accuses Yaten of <em>""itsumo""</em> (always) heading straight home after a taping, so they're a number of episodes into the series. This would indicate that episode 178 is, at the earliest, in early June so that the episodes can air starting in July.</p>

<p>I imagine that episode 177 is correct regarding the time of year for grade posting, and that episodes 176 and 178 are the ones that makes a mistake about the timeline.</p>

<p>I found this info about the Japanese high school academic year online:</p>

<p><em>Typically, the first day of a new school year is around April 8th, 9th. Summer vacation usually starts just before July 20th and usually lasts til the last day of August. 
The students take their midterm exams at the end of May. Since the finals are given in July, that means the students only have a month and a half between midterms and final exams.</em></p>

<p><em>While midterm exams go on for two days, final exams last three days. For a week before both midterms and finals, school club meetings and other after-school activities are canceled. Students are also not allowed in the teacher's workroom or the copying room.</em></p>

<p><em>In high school, there are 5 periodical tests in a year (the midterm and the finals). There are some subjects which only require 1 test per term, some 2, others give no test at all, and some would base the student’s grade on classroom performance alone. Periodical exams are usually held within 3 to 5 days. There are some schools that give take-home exams or evaluation exams.</em></p>

<p>Until I found the instances of acknowledgement, I was beginning to wonder if by the time he turned 12 his grandmother had become a ghost that only Mito saw. It seems clear that Gon sees her, too, though.  But alive or a ghost, why does he never speak to her? I guess it is possible that it is abnormal in Gon's culture to speak to a grandmother when your parent (figure) is there.  At 14:57 of ep.1(1999), the point Gon speaks to her, they are alone in the kitchen, with Gon asking, ""<em>Where is Aunt Mito?</em>"".  Once Mito shows up, he doesn't speak with his Grandmother again. (This is the scene where Mito brings Gon his father's fishing rod.)</p>

<p>The simplest explanation is that the animators and/or Togashi simply had nothing for Gon to say to his grandmother. Still, it seems at best awkward that he tells Killua that Mito raised him by herself, and that, during his extended goodbye to Mito before leaving for the exam, he ignores his grandmother.</p>

"Why do fansubbers merge video and subtitle into one file?","<p>Why do fansubbers merge video and subtitle into one file?</p>

<p>Sometimes its an mkv file and I can just extract the sub.</p>

<p>On some sites they hardcode it into the video frames as image overlay.</p>

<p>This is so silly. Why not just have the one video file which several languages or translation versions (corrections) can <strong>share</strong>, instead of re-encode and re-upload? And if someone wants a sub they can download <strong>just</strong> the sub. Distributing subs must also be easier because the subtitle files are smaller, so no wasted <strong>bandwidth</strong>, and it might not even be <strong>illegal</strong> to share just the sub. Plenty of reasons!</p>

"Do Kururi and Mairu swap chat handles?","<p>In episode 6 of <em>Durarara!!×2 Shou</em>, we see Mairu speaking lines that are attributed in chat to ""Kyou"" (狂) around 18:14. Later on, around 18:44, we hear Mairu's voice actor (Kitamura Eri) speaking lines that are attributed in chat to ""San"" (参), followed shortly by Kururi's voice actor (Kanemoto Hisako) speaking lines that are attributed to ""Kyou"". </p>

<p>Then there's the fact that Kururi is taciturn in person but ""Kyou"" is super-talkative in chat, while Mairu is a chatterbox in person and ""San"" just occasionally posts one-line replies in chat. </p>

<p>Another thing (which I might be making too much out of) - in episode 2 of <em>Ten</em>, Mika mentions that ""San and Kyou are Mairu and Kururi"", without specifying which one is which. </p>

<p>And, to be clear, the character used for ""Kyou"" can also be pronounced ""Kuru"" (as in 狂う), while the character used for ""San"" can be pronounced ""Mai"" (as in 参る) - the chat handles are clearly derived from their names. </p>

<p>I don't see how to reconcile all these details without concluding that both Kururi and Mairu use both ""Kyou"" and ""San"" as chat handles at various times. This seems like exactly the sort of trollish thing they would do (runs in the family, I imagine). Am I right in thinking so? Or have I misinterpreted something?</p>

"Where was the Seven Blood Stains Incident detailed?","<p>In <em>Ar Tonelico Qoga</em>, in the glossary under the Necrohouse of Ayatane, it talks about that some of the Teru Clans began to hate humans after something called the Seven Blood Stains Incident that was caused by Sol Ciel. It was this event that led to the Necrohouse allowing Garthnode Infiria to occur hoping that humans would destroy themselves.</p>

<p>But I don't know what this incident is. The only incident involving the Teru Tribe in Sol Ciel I am aware of was when Bourd kidnapped Misha from the Crescent Chronicle resulting in a battle between the Teru Tribe and Tenba which resulted in the destruction of Aurica's hometown Skuwat. But this was way way way after Garthnode Infiria so this can't be it.</p>

So I am wondering where was the Seven Blood Stains Incident detailed? Was it in a drama CD or manga?</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menorah_(Temple)#In_other_cultures"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> suggests that the Orthodox church uses the menorah in liturgy, but <em>Le Chevalier d'Eon</em> takes place in France, where Western Christianity predominates.</li>

"Why is Trunks not as powerful as Gohan when they are both human-Saiyan hybrids?","<p>In the Saiyan Saga (don't recall which episode, but I believe it was when he was with Nappa on another planet), Vegeta mentions that Saiyans who were born from humans and Saiyans are more powerful than pureborn Saiyans. This makes sense when you see moments of Gohan surpassing Goku in power level when he gets angry, such as when he fights with Garlic Jr. or Raditz.</p>

<p>Later, we see him being a teenager and surpassing Goku definitely by becoming SSJ2 first, but we don't see anything of this sort with Trunks. Trunks apparently surpasses Vegeta in a fight with Cell, but then we know Vegeta wasn't using the buff form because it makes you slow. And Gohan surpasses Trunks even more when he's 10 and Trunks is chronologically 19 or more (2 years in the time chamber). Later, Gohan doesn't train and Goku surpasses him, but then again when his hidden power is released he becomes the strongest character for a while again.</p>

<p>Gohan doesn't train much, but if he does he becomes the strongest. Why doesn't Trunks have this ""hidden"" power, or is able to surpass Vegeta when he gets enraged or after a hard training, as Gohan does with Goku? Trunks is also a descendant of a human and a Saiyan, so shouldn't he be much more powerful than what he is?</p>

"Can a transformed Saiyan lower his ki to base-human level when transformed?","<p>In Dragon Ball Resurrection of Freezer, Goku, when transformed in Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, is almost killed by a laser beam from Sorbet. Now how could this happen? Was his ki so low even when he was a SSGSS? Later in the Dragon Ball Super series this seems to be corrected because he isn't transformed when he is hit. But then again, I don't know which is the version that counts, supposedly the manga is over the movie and series but between something that happens in the movie and series I don't know.</p>

<p>Then the question of this topic is: can a transformed Saiyan (Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan God, etc.) lower his ki to base-human level when transformed? Was this just a mistake or what?</p>

"Did Death know Blair was a cat and not a witch?","<p>At the start of Soul Eater, Maka and Soul are tasked with hunting the soul of a Witch to turn Soul into a Death Scythe. The target is normally assigned by Lord Death as to avoid the Meister/Weapon group from getting killed.</p>

<p>During Maka's/Soul's fight with Blair, Death comments that there's ""something odd"" about her (right before he Reaper Chop's Spirit for Spirit's comment on Blair's body), then we learn she is actually a cat with a lot of magic. As a consequence, because Maka and Soul messed up the final soul, their previously collected 99 souls were confiscated.</p>

<p>From what Death said during the fight, it didn't seem as if it was a test to see if Maka and Soul could correctly identify a Witch. So I am wondering, did Death know Blair was a cat? If not, why did Maka/Soul get punished when he himself thought that she was?</p>

Even the Wizard King admitted that only people without Magic could wield those weapons. Are there any exceptional rules to how the Anti magic weapons work? </p>

My question here is about the life cycle of a manga becoming an anime. </p>

<p>From my understanding, an artist or mangaka creates their comic called manga and it gets published by a major studio if it's deemed worthy. From there if it cultivates a big enough fan-base it becomes licensed by a studio like Viz, Funimation or Bandai. And from there it becomes a game, movie, t-shirt, toy, etc.</p>

"Trouble following Akai squad vs Gauna 487","<p>I'm having some trouble following the battle of the Akai squad vs Gauna 487 at the end of Knights of Sidonia episode 3 (which I am clearly overanalyzing). I've replayed the scene like five times and cannot figure out how or when Aoki is killed, and I can't follow Momose and Midorikawa's demise.</p>

<p>Something about the animation and visual similarity between characters (as well as similar voices for the men) is making it difficult for me. The only way I could really tell who was who was the unit numbers on their helmets (001: Akai, 002: Momose, 003: Aoki, 004: Midorikawa).</p>

<p>So from what I can <em>tell</em> (Netflix timestamps), I've bolded the parts that I wouldn't mind some clarification on:</p>

<ul>
<li>19:44 Akai and Momose go in together, Momose gets grabbed.</li>
<li>19:59 Akai slices off the tentacle, saving her. In a heavy-handed sequence, everybody immediately yells ""Akai!"" an Akai apologizes, <strong>although I'm not sure how everybody knew he was about to die</strong>, because from the shot he looked safe and nothing had grabbed him yet. 9 seconds of wondering what he just apologized for follows, until...</li>
<li>20:08 Akai gets grabbed and is soon killed; we see him being pulled in in the following scene.</li>
<li>20:46 We see confirmation on control room screen that Akai is out and Momose is injured (presumably from when she initially got grabbed, but it didn't look like she took any damage?).</li>
<li>20:54 Aoki is told to take command and leave Momose, to which he responds ""but Momose is..."", but <strong>I can't figure out what he means by that or why he was told to leave her at that point or where she even was</strong>, because we haven't seen Momose do anything yet, really.</li>
<li>21:19 Aoki says ""I'm going in"" (I had to pause to read the 003 on his arm to confirm) and closes in on the Gauna, instructing Midorikawa to support fire</li>
<li>21:32 Momose goes flying past (about two frames, needed to pause to catch it and didn't even see this until like the third time I watched it) and Midorikawa yells ""stooooop!"". Momose goes into full blind rage mode.</li>
<li>21:57 Momose gets too close, takes a hit, we hear buckling metal. She is knocked back quickly. Presumably this is what ultimately kills her (she may or may not randomly explode later).</li>
<li>22:07 We see either Aoki or Midorikawa go after her and immediately deduce it is Midorikawa because we see 003/Aoki tell him to stick to the mission.</li>
<li>22:09 Immediately we see Aoki's view of some tentacles coming at him. <strong>Then the camera switches and we don't see anything else.</strong> Somebody yells during the exterior shot of Midorikawa, but can't tell if it's Aoki or Midorikawa.</li>
<li>22:12 Midorikawa grabs Momose as he flies past then soon after loses his grip and clearly dies as he is impaled by a tentacle.</li>
<li>22:25 <strong>Somebody explodes but I can't tell who or why.</strong> This part doesn't make any sense to me because:

<ul>
<li>Ok, so from 22:12 Momose is further from the Gauna than Midorikawa.</li>
<li>Midorikawa grabs her. Now they are together.</li>
<li>His grip slips and it looks like he throws her further because when he is impaled, he is clearly closer to the Gauna than she is.</li>
<li>Exterior shot we see the person closest to the Gauna explode, unprompted (I didn't see any tentacles?), which is where Midorikawa was like a second earlier.</li>
<li>But then we see that it wasn't Midorikawa, because we have an interior shot of him floating through space, blood-covered and dead. <strong>So somehow him and Momose switched places then she mysteriously exploded?</strong> Or perhaps it was Aoki that exploded? But he should be pretty far away (and I guess dead) now. Anyways Momose is definitely presumed dead.</li>
<li>Adding to this, I later noticed that the explosion didn't appear to be <em>anybody</em> in the squad (see edit below the line below).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I <em>think</em> the final state is: Akai is captured/eaten/absorbed/whatever by the Gauna. Midorikawa is dead and floating through space. One of Momose/Aoki is presumably floating through space too and the other exploded (not sure who; update: see below, somehow <em>neither</em> of them exploded).</p>

<p>The whole scene is a little eyebrow-raising because the mistakes they made and tactics they used didn't seem to agree with the build-up of their skill and confidence to this point (although on the other hand none of them had fought a Gauna before and maybe highlighting their break-down and the contrast with their hyped up skill here was the point). They went down pretty easily.</p>

<p>So, questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Did I get all that right?</li>
<li>How did everybody (including Akai himself) know Akai was going to die 10 seconds later?</li>
<li>What was going on when Aoki was told to leave Momose behind?</li>
<li>When did Aoki actually die?</li>
<li>Who/what exploded?</li>
</ol>

<p>I admit I'm overthinking this (and at this point I've spent about 40 minutes dwelling on a 3 minute scene where the only thing that's really significant about it is that it's chaotic and everybody dies), but this is the culmination of my frustration so far at having a <em>really</em> hard time keeping track of who is who (doesn't help that there's like, clones everywhere; at least I assume they're clones - either that or the animators are really struggling to differentiate the characters).</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: OK, so two new data points that make this even <em>more</em> confusing.</p>

<p>First of all I just noticed that we <em>briefly</em>, for like a half second at around 22:31, see <em>Momose</em> floating through space (interior shot, this happens <em>right</em> before we see Midorikawa's interior shot):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I2Ukb.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/I2Ukb.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>We know this is Momose because if you look at the arm band it ends in ""02"", and if you look at the status display it's missing 002 (I noticed everybody's status display displays everybody but themselves). (This also re-raises the question of how Momose died; at this point only decompression seems plausible except their skin-suits are airtight)</p>

<p>So now it seems clear that Aoki was the one that exploded (although how he got so close to Momose/Midorikawa I have no idea), <em>until</em>...</p>

<p>We see this map in the control room at the start of the next episode:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JBfZ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JBfZ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So we see 001 (Akai) near the Gauna, which we already knew, and 003 (Aoki) as well. Momose and Midorikawa are not on the map, not even on the more zoomed out views in that same scene. But we know Momose and Midorikawa are both floating through space, we saw them directly after the last battle.</p>

<p>So that rules out Aoki exploding as well, which raises the question, <strong>what <em>was</em> that explosion at 22:25 in episode 3?</strong> Ahhh!</p>

Of course, cursive is a particular style of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_calligraphy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">calligraphy</a>, but calligraphy includes more than just cursive, and clerical script (reisho, 隸書) would seem more appropriate for a report like this (though perhaps less awesome).</p>

<p>In the original Japanese text, was Sakamoto really saying that he was going to write in Japanese cursive, or just with handwritten calligraphy (or maybe even English cursive)?</p>

The question made it sound like the term referred to a male tsundere.</p>

<p>I searched this site for more mentions of ""oranyan"", but only found the linked question. I Googled for more info, but the only results I found aside from <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere?from=Main.Oranyan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this TV Tropes page on tsundere</a> and the question I linked above referred to the mythical founder of the Oyo Empire of Yoruba, which I'm pretty sure has nothing to do with the anime meaning of this term. The TV Tropes page just says ""oranyan"" is another word for ""tsundere"" which ""is sometimes used to refer to a male tsundere character&mdash;incorrectly since it means the complete opposite"". </p>

<p>TV Tropes's reputation for accuracy aside, the linguist in me wants to nitpick that statement because of its implicit prescriptivist assumptions about ""correct"" use of language; for this question, I'm going to ask that answers take the linguist's viewpoint and define ""oranyan"" as whatever the majority of people think ""oranyan"" means, and to please explain the situation if no majority definition exists, or if the majority definition differs between Japanese and Western fans.</p>

<p>So, here's what I'm curious about:</p>

<ul>
<li>What's the etymology of the term ""oranyan""? </li>
<li>Is there any basis to TV Tropes's claim that it means the exact opposite of 'male tsundere'?</li>
<li>In the common usage of the term, is there some difference in meaning from 'tsundere' aside from the sex of the character?</li>

<p>However, neither one was really explained, at least in the anime. It isn't really clear to me what either term means, and how they're related. It is clear that every character has a Maken, which is basically a unique ability or power, but there's a lot that's still confusing.

"Dragonball Z different versions","<p>So as I understand there are four versions of Dragonball Z Anime (correct me if I am wrong with this):</p>

<ol>
<li>Japanese version / Subtitles in English</li>
<li>Funimation version</li>
<li>Ocean Dub</li>
<li>Dragonball Kai</li>
</ol>

<p>So I am going through rewatching the episodes with my wife for her first time and am watching a version that seems ""less censored"" than what I remember watching. There is a lot of blood and swearing, which I am actually ok with as it makes it more realistic in my mind but <strong>which version would this be?</strong> It would not be the one that played on Toonami I am guessing.</p>

<p><strong>My second question is, plot wise are there any major differences between the uncensored one that I am watching vs the more censored one?</strong> I just got to the start of the Freiza Saga and noticed that in the Saiyin Saga for example Gohan never mentioned where he wanted to invite Piccolo to his birthday party. This isn't a huge deal in plot but I was wondering if anyone who has watched both versions noticed anything bigger? I would think more or less that the uncensored version = censored version + a bit more.  One thing that really shocked me is that in the uncensored version, Goku finds out that he transformed into the Ape form and killed his grandpa when he was little, whereas the uncensored never mentions this. <strong>This seems to be a huge deal of him finding out or not!</strong></p>

<p>I do notice that the music is quite different as well and IMO the uncensored music is better than I remember. It sounds like a full orchestra performing it each episode.</p>

"Why did Frieza trick Frost?","<p>Frieza pretended to work with Frost only so he could cheap shot Frost for an easy elimination. However, Frieza is very powerful in his golden form, much more than Frost. Why did he go through the trouble of tricking Frost if he could've just easily eliminated him the traditional way? Did Frost really pose such a threat to Frieza?</p>

"Dragonball Z - Rule for dragonballs","<p>This may be a question that can't be answered but I figured it may be a little fun to try anyways. I know the rules that are established about the dragonballs:</p>

<ol>
<li>1 (original earth) /2 (later on earth) /3 wishes (Namek) depending on which version you have.</li>
<li>Wish can't exceed the creator's power</li>
<li>If the earth dragonballs then can't make the same wish twice</li>
</ol>

<p>So in rewatching the series with my wife recently, when they are on Namek she asked if they could just take the balls into space to hide them which is a <strong>great question</strong> IMO. Freiza, or Vegeta for that matter, could have just parked their space ship floating over Namek or on some moon or close by planet and had it come get them every so often to deposit found dragon balls, or in Freiza's case where he doesn't need air to breathe he could just fly away with them. </p>

<p><strong>So are there any rules about the dragon balls leaving the planet to which they were created on?</strong> Would they turn to stone? Would they just not work?</p>

"Who is the idol Yuna in Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale?","<p>In Sword Art Online: Ordinal Scale, Shigemura is the creator of Ordinal Scale and is trying to recreate his dead daughter Yuna as an AI. Now, during the movie, we see two versions of Yuna. The first one wears an idol costume and appears at event battles to sing (I will call her ""idol-Yuna""). The second one wears a hoodie and appears to Kirito to point him in the right direction (I will call her ""hoodie-Yuna"").</p>

<p>By the end of the movie, I was under the impression that idol-Yuna was a throwaway data collection AI created by Shigemura. I thought that her purpose was to collect information so Shigemura could create hoodie-Yuna, who would be the true recreation of his daughter. However, in discussions and reviews other people have told me that idol-Yuna was the daughter AI, and that idol-Yuna and hoodie-Yuna were the same.</p>

<p>Were there two different Yuna's, a data collection program and a copy of the daughter? Or was there one Yuna and she only changed appearance?</p>

<li>The old man dies (or is knocked out or something) in the fight</li>
<li>Young man returns to the table and proceeds to pot the rest of his balls</li>

"Were Judeo-Christian religious references part of the ""Akira"" movie's original dialogue?","<p>The animated Akira movie (not the manga) contains a number of explicit Judeo-Christian religious terms, in addition to the overall apocalyptic themes. The most prominent of these (from the 2001 dub) are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When the citizens of Neo-Tokyo see Tetsuo deflect tank shells and
destroy helicopters and tanks, somebody shouts out, ""It's the Great
Awakening!"" while another says, ""Don't be fooled! This isn't the
Rapture! He's a false messiah!"" </p></li>
<li><p>Later, Lady Miyako appears with her entourage and, during the chaos
of battle, chants, ""Burn all the unclean believers of our time! Give
yourselves into the flames, children, you will all be born again.
Consume our hearts! Wash our unclean hearts in the eternal fire!""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While different cuts of the movie may be of different runtimes, the scenes I'm referring to occur from approximately 1:06:00 (Tetsuo walking out of the smoke of the exploding helicopter) until 1:08:00 (Nezu's escape), and then 1:10:00 (Miyako's entourage) until 1:12:00 (Tetsuo destroys the bridge). </p>

<p>Were these religious references, extremely familiar to American Christian society, part of the original Japanese dialogue, or were they 'westernized' for the English dub? What was the meaning of these quotes in the original Japanese context? (e.g., did it refer to messianic figures or raptures etc?)</p>

"Does Fairy Tail have one main goal / plot, or is it just many separate stories?","<p>Does Fairy Tail have one major plot line that is developed along the hundreds of episodes it has, or does it simply have many ""chunks"" of unrelated adventures (in blocks of a few episodes)?</p>

<p>For example, in One Piece there is one main ""goal"", and even though there are several different arcs, there is a clear notion of ""progress towards the goal"" happening with every arc. Naruto, Boku no Hero Academia and Black Clover also have clear ""goals"", i.e. there is also a main plot, and the ""progress in the plot"" is clear after every canon arc, etc. </p>

<p>I started watching Fairy Tail (only watched 15 episodes so far) and so far I couldn't see any ""main plot"" or ""main goal"". It seems that they will simply have different adventures, by picking certain quests/missions in the guild, fulfilling the mission, coming back and repeating this loop. Surely they will probably get stronger with time, but this is not the ""progress"" I'm looking for. Is there a ""main goal"", ""main plot"" that gets slowly developed along the hundreds of episodes? Or is it just a collection of loosely-tied adventures (each taking a few episodes each)?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Don't say what the main plot is (if it exists) - hide it in a spoiler tag. I just want to know if it exists - and if possible, what is the number of the episode in which this plot becomes clear.</strong></p>

"Is it proven Gogeta is stronger than Beerus?","<p>Commentaries from dragon ball characteres many times tell us which character is stronger than other. But sometimes they seem to be wrong or contradict themselves later. With regards to Beerus, in the Dragon Ball Super manga in the times of the battle with Zamasu, it was said by Wiss if I recall correctly, than Gogeta might be as strong as Beerus. A lot of battles and training happened since that, several zenkais and Goku and Vegeta got stronger. Now in the Dragon Ball Super Broly movie, it was said by Goku that Broly might be even stronger than Beerus. If Broly is equally or stronger than Beerus, Gogeta has to be way stronger than him, since Gogeta showed to be much stronger than Broly. Is this so? Were Wiss and Goku just speculating or are there more clues sustaining the authors intended to assert this? </p>

"What's the basis for the gender of Black Hanekawa as reported on the wikia?","<p>The <a href=""http://bakemonogatari.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Hanekawa"">wikia</a> for the Monogatari states that Black Hanekawa is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Male (Physically Female)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After seeing a blogger describe their experience of seeing this and concluding that Hanekawa is nonbinary (a conclusion which to be honest I was a bit suspicious of for reasons I'm not going into, since they're off-topic), I ended up with several questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Where is such a description of Black Hanekawa stated? Or is there no explicit in-text reference for this? Can this idea at least be drawn from other details in the ""text""?</p></li>
<li><p>If such a conclusion about Black Hanekawa actually exists, why is the gender of Black Hanekawa what it is?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The most likely answer to me is that Black Hanekawa is based off of Hanekawa so the apparition will have female traits, but since the ""sawari neko"" itself has a gender, we have this discrepancy. But I'm not sure how true this is - it's possible that it was mentioned somewhere that the ""sawari neko"" is male (perhaps in Oshino's descriptions of it), but I don't remember this with complete certainty.</p>

"Sources for Christian themes and motifs in Naruto?","<p>Compared to some of its contemporary shounen titles, <em>Naruto</em> draws heavily on a variety of religious and mythological sources to inform its narrative, themes and cosmology. Kishimoto's use of explicit <a href=""http://nihon-go.org/nihon-go-guides/narutology-an-introduction-to-japanese-mythology-symbolism-in-naruto/"">Hindu, Buddhist and Shinto</a> motifs has already been <a href=""http://www.godofkonoha.com/blog/influence-of-buddhism-and-hinduism-in-naruto"">discussed in a number of places</a>. Common elements identified include deity names for jutsu, shamanic activities such as obtaining the eyes of others to 'see' as they do, making pacts with animal and other nature spirits, summoning 'demons' such as Susanoo, etc (<a href=""http://www.geocities.ws/sasuxhinatheories/t04.html"">Shinto,</a> heavily associated with the Uchiha clan); Jimmu Tenno motifs for both Rikodu Sanin and later Naruto himself, such as his magatama and staff of 6 rings, manifestation of Gedo Mazu upon a lotus, etc (<a href=""https://mangahelpers.com/forum/showthread.php/2995557-Buddhist-mythology-explaining-Naruto-(How-Madara-and-Hashirama-are-Mara-and-Buddha)"">Buddhist,</a> heavily associated with the Senjuu/Uzumaki clans); chakra, the 6 lokas (worlds) and 6 components of the bhavachakra corresponding to <a href=""http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1190691"">the 6 paths</a> of Pein and referenced with the Rikodu Sanin as well, the Garuda, Jashin religion (apparently influenced by the Thug cult) and the battle between Indra and the Ashuras, complete with spiky hair imagery for his protagonist (and to a lesser extent the antagonist) frequently associated with ashuras (who are known for great rage and passion) - <a href=""http://art-eater.com/2012/01/a-buddhists-guide-to-asuras-wrath/"">probably derived from Toriyama's <em>Dragonball</em></a>, a major influence on Kishimoto (<a href=""http://forums.cleverbaka.com/showthread.php?96454-Hinduism-in-Naruto"">Hindu,</a> many elements absorbed into Mahayana Buddhist culture). </p>

<p>However, relatively little work has been done examining Christian influences to date, though <a href=""http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/naruto-just-went-full-christianity-this-week.453347353/"">some have already pointed out elsewhere</a> that <a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/naruto-might-be-a-christian-tale"">there seem to be a number of Christian references</a> appearing, <a href=""http://beneaththetangles.com/2014/11/06/naruto-chapter-700-the-gospel-of-sasuke-uchiha/"">especially towards the end</a> of manga/anime series, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kaguya, a woman who ate forbidden fruit from a powerful tree and brought powerful but potentially evil forces into the world (chakra from the chakra tree) (Eve);</li>
<li>two of her descendants who were ""brothers"" (Asura/Indra then Naruto/Sasuke) fighting each other (Cain and Abel, Jacob and Esau);</li>
<li>Sasuke, a betrayer who turned his back on his best friend for personal gain (Judas), yet Naruto repeatedly attempts to win him back, even to the extent of proclaiming his willingness to die in the effort (Jesus, the good shepherd); this eventually works and Sasuke repents and seeks forgiveness for his behavior (prodigal son); </li>
<li>Naruto as a messiah figure who was prophesied (by the Toad Sage) to save the world (plus his 'Christ the Redeemer' poses on high points, e.g. chap. 245);</li>
<li>Naruto as the new Sage, who was the progenitor of the ninja world (Jesus as the new Adam);</li>
<li>wooden memorial crosses marking the graves of Zabuza and Haku;</li>
<li>frequency of resurrection jutsu (by Pein, Madara, Kabuto etc), even mass resurrections of the dead;</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=b033100fd1644c52a87d4f65a73c1054"">Adam Barkman has suggested</a> the use of crucifixion motifs (presumably referring to Kakashi's tortue by Itachi and/or the rongusodo ninja ato: waiya haritsuke jutsu) as having Christian significance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The heavy use of religous and mythological themes at the heart of <em>Naruto</em>, suggests that these may not be coincidental parallels. (This does not necessarily suggest that these examples were exclusively derived from Christian sources, e.g. the cosmic conflict between Naruto/Sasuke could be influenced by the primordial 'brotherly' conflicts in both Hinduism (Indra vs the Ashuras) and Christianity (Cain vs Abel) simultaneously.)</p>

<p>One potential source for such themes could be Kishimoto's <a href=""http://www.naruto-boards.com/717851/a-collection-of-masashi-kishimoto"">favorite movie</a> <em>The Matrix</em>, known to be a source of some artistic inspiration as well (<em>The Art of Naruto: Uzumaki</em>, 2007), which is filled with many <a href=""https://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol9No2/StuckyMatrixMessiah.htm"">overt Christian themes and images</a>.</p>

"Can all Saiyans become a Legendary Super Saiyan?","<p>Legendary Super Saiyan requires one to have consciousness while maintaining the form. What we have seen so far (canon and non-canon) was the berserk state, where the user is simply out of control. </p>

<p>As we know in order to attain Super Saiyan 4 one needs to have consciousness during the Golden Great Ape state. The Great Ape forms have been known for all Saiyans to be a berserk state that can only be triggered when specific conditions have been met. The user is ""rewarded"" with tremendous power, but no control. This all is extremely similar to Legendary Super Saiyan Berserk. Once the user gets consciousness in the state he/she can then evolve into the next stage, which would be Super Saiyan 4 (for Golden Great Ape) or Legendary Super Saiyan (for Legendary Super Saiyan Berserk).</p>

<p>Since both forms (LSSJ and SSJ4) require the same amount of consciousness and mental fortitude, does this mean that they are basically the same? I found it extremely difficult to find some actual information on the progress of the two being unlocked so therefor this conclusion is purely theoretical.</p>

<p>Assuming they are, all Saiyans are able to become a Super Saiyan 4 with enough training, consciousness etc. Are all Saiyans also able to become a Legendary Super Saiyan or is it purely genetic? From what I've seen so far, the only distinctive features it has, is emitting enormous amounts of ki. We have seen that Saiyans were leaking ki all over the place, so in that sense it should be possible for all Saiyans eventually, or am I completely wrong?</p>

"What made Sakuya decide to switch sides?","<p>In <em>Rewrite</em>, Sakuya, Chihaya's butler, is nothing but antagonistic towards the protagonist Kotarou from the moment they first meet.

<p>Then, around Episode 8 or so, he randomly shows up in the magic forest and saves Kotarou's life. He announces he's now working with Kotarou and friends against Gaia, offers to train Kotarou, and becomes considerably less antagonistic towards him. <em>Absolutely no explanation is given for this</em>, and to me it seemed to come completely out of left-field.</p>

<p><strong>What prompted Sakuya to change sides like that so suddenly?</strong> I think Chihaya may have already defected by this point, but surely that can't be the only reason?</p>

"Confusion about the naming of Aldnoah Zero's OST/opening/ending song titles","<p>I have a couple of very closely related questions regarding composer Hiroyuki Sawano's choices in naming Aldnoah Zero's OST/opening/ending song titles.</p>

<p>I will be referencing the tracklist for Aldnoah Zero's OST (link <a href=""http://aldnoahzero.wikia.com/wiki/ALDNOAH.ZERO_Original_Soundtrack"">here</a>), in addition to some opening/closing songs that are co-composed by Hiroyuki Sawano including ""aLIEz"", ""A/Z"", and ""&amp;Z"".</p>

<p>First, most of the song titles include special/non-alphabetical/non-English characters (even if the title is clearly meant  an actual word like ""robot"" or ""breathless""). Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>R零B零T</li>
<li>BRE@TH//LESS</li>
<li>Ch19ヲFIRE★</li>
</ul>

<p>Why did Hiroyuki Sawano decide to include all the special characters? Is there any significance in using them? To me, they are unnecessary, but I hesitate to claim that they are indeed unnecessary because they might actually have some meaning that I am not seeing.</p>

<p>My other question is why are some song titles seemingly extra-arbitrarily named? I realize that these are songs, so the composer can name them whatever he likes, but some song titles seem completely out of the blue to me. </p>

<p>I realize that there are explanations for the names of some OST tracks in the wiki that I linked. </p>

<p>For example, the song ""AD2014-7.5/7.9-零・A"" is named because ""2014 07-05 / 07-09 [are] ALDONAH.ZERO's air dates on Tokyo MX and ABC respectively"". </p>

<p>The explanation tells me WHAT the song is named after, but it does not tell me WHY is the song named after something as arbitrary as an air date for the show. OST track titles usually relate to what the song actually attempts to convey to the listener, or relates to the scene in the animation, but I cannot see how an air date relates to either.</p>

<p>Finally, I do not understand where the openings/ending names come from. What do the names ""aLIEz"", ""A/Z"" and ""&amp;Z"" mean exactly, and why are they named that way?</p>

I'm going on the assumption that their would have been some sort of news when he got out of the game, and that his character name would be mentioned. I know that if I see a character with the same name in multiple MMO's, I at least ask if they are the same person. I have to believe that SOMEONE would recognize the name at least.</p>

"Actually how deaf is Shouko in Koe no Katachi and is it revealed why she is only wearing 1 hearing aid?","<p>As it's already been stated in a <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/42275/why-did-shouko-use-hearing-aids-even-though-shes-deaf"">similar question</a>, Shouko's not completely deaf, but it's still very severe as she wasn't able to understand people clearly. It seems to be very blurry as shown in chapter 51 of the manga.</p>

<p>But e.g. the scene on the Ferris wheel in which Naoka talks to Shouko, it seems that Shouko is able to understand what Naoka's talking (I'm not sure though, as she only answered ""I'm sorry"" which Shouko says a lot). Naoka deliberately talked very slowly. So, is it safe to assume that Shouko is and has always been able to understand people when they're talking slow enough?</p>

<p>If it wasn't the case when she was still a child, has her sense of hearing been improved until now to the point in which Shouko's able to understand people clearly when they talk slow enough? If I'm not mistaken, depending on the type of deafness, it is possible to stimulate the regeneration of the hearing ability through medicaments, clinical interventions or sometimes even without any interventions.</p>

<p>And why is she only wearing one hearing aid? Is it a repercussion of the time where Shouya damaged her ear? If yes, how badly injured is that ear?</p>

"What does the position of ""theme song assistance""(?) entail?","<p>Over the past 3-4 years, I've been noticing a number of anime that credit <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=78467"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a person named 外村敬一</a> (""SOTOMURA Keiichi"", it seems) with 主題歌協力 - something like ""theme song assistance"".

There are exceptions, though, like the <em>Durarara!! Shou</em> OP ""Headhunt"", where it appears on the following overlay.</p>

<p>Note that the list of credits on ANN I linked to above is non-exhaustive - I'm pretty sure (just based on my vague recollection of having seen this guy's name over and over) there are a lot more credits for this Sotomura fellow that they haven't added to their database yet.

"When do the events of Prince de la Bun take place?","<p>In one of the anecdotes in <em>McDull, Prince de la Bun</em>, McDull makes a comment (a bit after 19 minutes) about how his single mother takes J.K. Rowling's success as encouragement for her to continue recounting her stories. Thus, the ""present day"" portion of the film must have occurred after the first Harry Potter book was published (so at the earliest, post-1997). The mention of 两文三语 (an oft-used phrase by the Hong Kong government) approximately six minutes in corroborates this (at least per my reading of <a href=""https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%A9%E6%96%87%E4%B8%89%E8%AA%9E"" rel=""nofollow"">this Chinese Wikipedia article</a>). Moreover, we see at 1:04:48 that the grave plot Mrs. Mak has reserved has <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Hong_Kong"" rel=""nofollow"">a mobile phone number</a> on its sign, which might push the date even later.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm having trouble figuring out is what years the portions of the film that concern Mrs. Mak's younger years where she interacts with McDull's father (McBing) correspond to.</strong> I might expect the section that comes before McBing meets with  Mrs. Mak to have a looser correspondence to actual history, since it's more overtly fantasy, but the portion I'm concerned with seems to explicitly take place in some older version of Hong Kong.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>About nine minutes in, there is old footage of workers at a factory (with Mrs. Mak's face superimposed on one of the worker's, as this is meant to be a recollection of her younger years), but I can't identify the year of it.</p></li>
<li><p>After 47:00, we see the destruction of a floating restaurant, but I'm unsure if this is supposed to correspond to anything. The boat is still burning when McBing leaves Mrs. Mak, so it would appear that the entire sequence (between him meeting up with her and him leaving) is supposed to take place within a short period of time. (Then again, maybe this is just a fantasy element?)</p></li>
<li><p>There are some posters on the walls (of celebrities I don't recognise) after 47:30.</p></li>
<li><p>At 49:23, we see a member of the police stand atop a raised platform to direct traffic. From what I am aware of, this practice was definitely gone by the 2000's in Hong Kong, and I don't think it was used much (if at all) in the 1990's.</p></li>
<li><p>At 50:49, McBing pays the fortune teller with a bunch of colonial one-dollar notes. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_Hong_Kong_dollar#20th_century"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> tells me that 1 HKD notes were phased out in 1960. (That this is used <em>at all</em> and that there is a copy of <em>The Little Prince</em> on the shelf at 55:45 indicates that this should be post-WWII.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is there a consistent sense of when this period corresponds to, if at all?</strong> I'm starting to get the impression that some of the evidence may even be contradictory: if McDull is still in kindergarten in the ""present day"" period (see 2:05) and his father is really McBing, it would be odd for McBing to have left before 1990 (which would seem at odds with some of the other details). But it occurs to me that I might just be too unfamiliar with the historical context to judge properly, so I am looking for confirmation.</p>

"What was the moral of Sasuke and Orochimaru's arcs across the Naruto series? Was there any?","<p>So <em>Naruto Gaiden</em> has concluded, and it featured both Sasuke and Orochimaru in his latest iteration. Which again raises the question, what exactly was the moral of the story for these two?</p>

<p>The <em>Naruto</em> series excelled at emphasizing certain moral behaviors to its readers/viewers: e.g., <a href=""http://www.narutoforums.com/showthread.php?t=352586"" rel=""noreferrer"">with hard work, determination, self-confidence, and a will to succeed, even a loser or social outcast can reach the top</a>; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/362x7q/the_moral_of_the_story_in_naruto_is/"" rel=""noreferrer"">love and understanding each other on a deeper level can solve any problem and bring out all you're actually capable of</a>; kindness and compassion towards wild 'Beasts' can lead to positive results; it's important never to abandon your friends and family; etc etc. All very good, solid shounen values!</p>

<p>So what do the lives of Sasuke and Orochimaru teach us (if anything) from their character arcs? By the end of <em>Shipuden</em> neither has really repented or shown remorse for their bad behavior (simple ""sorries"" do not cut it), both have done horrible things (murder, hideous human experimentation, etc) for which they are never punished (Sasuke is pardoned, Orochimaru's 'imprisonment' in <em>Gaiden</em> is pretty milquetoast, and he's even allowed to continue researching with his assistants!), and it is implied that they got a free pass for the simple reason that they joined forces with the Shinobi Alliance to destroy a common threat that was even worse (and one which was against their own interests to see succeed anyway!). Even then, Sasuke attempted to hijack things at the last minute and take over the world, only relenting when he was soundly defeated (i.e., he stopped when it was no longer <em>possible</em> for him to achieve his ends!). Yet both are still allowed to do pretty much whatever they please for the next decade or two. So what are we to make of all this? Do whatever you want and if you have powerful enough friends, you can get away with it, and keep on doing whatever you want?</p>

However, when she talks to Yach about how she made the Heal Jars for the quest, he doesn't believe her and Edge indicates that Alchemists are rare (kinda like what was mentioned in the first game with Klein).

If so, then Sasuke really should be having in the order of 12 children (who, if each of those keeps up near that birthrate, the Uchiha clan would be fully restored within 2-3 generations!) I know it's common for contemporary Japanese families to produce only one or two children at most, so it's what the readers would be used to, but this is ancient/different dimension Japan! </p>

"Why was the ending to the Arrancar arc so brief?","<p>I started watching Bleach probably a month ago and quickly found it to be quite interesting. But there are some things <em>I just don't get</em>. </p>

<p>For example Aizen... I thought Aizen was awesome. He commands such awe, attention and fear and you can tell that from the Shinigami's protecting Karakura town. </p>

<p>But I don't get is reason for <em>being</em>.</p>

<p>As far as I remember, every villain that Ichigo came across and defeated - at least the fairly important ones had a background story. </p>

<p>To digress Grimmjow, Barragan, No 1 and 3, 5 (+ Neliora) Espada's etc.. had a ""beginning"".</p>

<p>Disappointingly, Ulquiorra (my favorite Espada - btw) had none.</p>

<p>Kaname had a reason for being. Even Gin - also another disappointment imo - had a beginning, despite its vagueness. </p>

<p>But back to Aizen - from the very beginning he was just someone that had twice the amount of reiatsu when compared to a Captain level. </p>

<p>From what I got he simply wanted more power. To destroy the soul king and in turn destroy 
Soul Society. </p>

<p>But what happens after that? He obviously finds Hollows insignificant, he hates the Shinigami but we don't know why.  </p>

<p>I'm not sure if many people feel the same way but there just wasn't enough back story as to why Aizen <em>is</em>. </p>

<p>In the end all we got was some speculation from Ichigo - that doesn't really make sense btw - about how Aizen felt lonely because no one matched his power.</p>

<p>So to find an equal Aizen groomed Ichigo's powers, but the funny thing is Aizen, according to Ichigo's speculation in the meantime sought <em>more</em> power by subjugating the Hogyouku to his will.</p>

<p>If he had so much power, and he felt lonely simply because he outclassed all others, why not find a way to suppress if not completely get rid of his powers akin to Zaraki's eyepatch?</p>

<p>Ichigo speculates that maybe Aizen let go of his sword willingly, but in Room 46 he doesn't look like someone that gave up his sword ""willingly"".</p>

<p>The ""explanation"" that we get from Ichigo sounds rather similar to what the author gave us about Jin Kariya. But there was a reason for Jin's motive and considering his back story the explanation for his defeat does make sense.</p>

<p>But Aizen... I just don't get it.</p>

<p>If anyone can make sense of my question, can you give me a satisfactory answer? :P</p>

"Does Captain Earth borrow elements from Gurren Lagann?","<p>As a viewer of both series from start to end, I can see several elements in Captain Earth that seems to ""borrow"" from Gurren Lagann, especially in the second half of both of the series:</p>

<ul>
<li>In episode 23, just before the <em>entangle link</em>, Daichi was interfered by Planetary Gears and put inside a dream where he was tempted to keep on living his normal life, not involving with the whole saving-the-world business. However, he broke out of the illusion due to the memories of his friends in his heart. This is similar to how the almost entire crew of Dai Gurren-dan got trapped in Extradimensional Labyrinth in episode 26 of Gurren Lagann and experienced their dreams being fulfilled, but managed to escape from it with the help of Kamina.</li>
<li>Daichi and co. did an <em>entangle link</em> to jump from Earth to Uranus, similar to how Dai Gurren-dan jumped through dimension from Earth to Anti-Spiral's home world. They both missed on their first try and got ambushed.</li>
<li>In the final battle, Daichi charged into the transformed Blume while sacrificing the expansion layer (which is assembled as the smaller mecha is launched to Tenkaidou). This is similar to the final battle between Simon and the Anti-Spiral, where outer layers of the Gurren Lagann is left behind as Simon charged in with his Lagann and destroy the Anti-Spiral.</li>
<li>Kill-T-Gangs, the perceived antagonists of the series, don't have any libido (<em>Orgone energy</em>), therefore they can't reproduce, while all human has Orgone energy. This is similar to the Anti-Spirals in Gurren Lagann, who don't have any <em>Spiral energy</em> (since they purge it themselves), while human has Spiral energy. Both series feature clashes between one with the source of all-powerful energy and one without such energy.</li>
</ul>

"Piecing together the premise of Aldnoah.Zero, link between Mars/Moon/Earth","<p>I'm a little confused about some details of the premise of Aldnoah.Zero, particularly why the Orbital Knights waited 15 years without attacking, why they needed an excuse, and who is on Mars vs. the Moon. I'm about halfway through season 2, I was patient waiting for clues to be revealed but the series changed focus to Inaho vs. Slaine and the save-the-princess quest.</p>

<p>First of all, my understanding is: In 1999 Mars attacked Earth by sending the Orbital Knights and a bunch of other soldiers through the Hypergate on the moon. Yadda yadda, the Hypergate exploded, taking most of the moon with it. Now the folks who were sent from Mars are stuck here with no way back, presumably because Mars is out of range for normal travel. They can still, however, communicate with home, so they at least maintain contact.</p>

<p>That means:</p>

<ul>
<li>The war stopped because the resulting devastation from the moon's explosion caused a huge number of losses on both sides (Saazbaum, for example, lost his significant other).</li>
<li>The Orbital Knights and the remaining original Mars army are stuck here, so they dug in on the remains of the moon and built bases there and throughout the debris belt.</li>
<li>The emperor is on Mars (we know this for certain because Slaine comments about being on VERS during his unauthorized use of the audience chamber to warn the emperor).</li>
</ul>

<p>So my first question is, <strong>is my understanding above correct</strong>? My remaining confusion is based on that understanding.</p>

<p>The things that I don't understand, then, are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Why were the Orbital Knights waiting for an excuse to attack Earth?</strong> Why assassinate Asseylum in the first place? The knights have both motivation and superior fire power, what stopped them from just... invading with no excuse? 

<ul>
<li>The only possible theory I have is the emperor didn't endorse it. But why would these guys care? They're trapped without the Hypergate. They have no hope of returning home nor do they seem to ever attempt to find a way home or even care. The emperor can't touch them from Mars (and the threat of taking their Aldnoah drives isn't valid, we've already seen that once they are activated they don't need any more interaction from people with the Aldnoah factor unless they need to be re-activated, and we know there's at least 2 princesses and 1 terran that can do this, and the princesses can pass on the factor through kisses and blood or something, even unwillingly). It just seems reasonable to me that people in this situation, especially people desiring the Earth's resources so badly <em>and</em> trapped on the Earth/Moon, would go for it out of desperation if nothing else. It doesn't seem feasible for an entire army + 37 orbital knights to sit by and twiddle their thumbs in this situation waiting for some excuse (which they orchestrated themselves with the assassination plot conspiracy). </li>
<li>If you have the moral deficit necessary to conspire to assassinate your own princess as an excuse to attack, it doesn't seem so far-fetched to just skip the conspiracy effort and go for the attack.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How did the princess even get to Earth?</strong> The OK are isolated due to lack of Hypergate. So she couldn't have been sent to Earth after the fact. She must have at least been there since 1999. She's obviously pretty young, she couldn't have been more than a newborn or toddler in '99. This means the emperor sent his newborn grand-daughter to Earth during the first war? That doesn't make any sense. What was she doing there and how did she get there?</li>
<li><strong>Why were the Orbital Knights hanging out on the moon in the first place?</strong>

<ul>
<li>It seems as if it would have been a much more reasonable strategy for the knights and the Mars army to just <em>go down to Earth and live there</em>, or at least build a base on the surface (shouldn't be a problem with their vastly superior strength). We know their primary drive is lust for the Earth's resources (secondary drive is that they're just grossed out by terrans). The more power-hungry ones could just as easily dominate <em>after</em> going down to Earth.</li>
<li>""Because Martians would never be accepted"" isn't a great excuse for this. Inaho or Rayet or somebody early on even remarked on the fact that nobody can tell them apart unless they reveal themselves, since they're all human. There's no test for it. There's no way to tell. There were even Martian spies on Earth, a key point in the assassination plot. The Mars army and the knights could have blended in seamlessly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Where are the Mars army soldiers coming from?</strong> I assume that the only soldiers available are the ones originally sent 15 years ago, as Mars can't send more soldiers in without a Hypergate. So either they're making babies (but all would be 15 years or younger at this point) or the Mars soldiers are a finite resource and <em>nobody seems to be concerned about this</em>. They must have just sent a <em>lot</em> of soldiers the first time through? None of the Orbital Knights seem to be concerned at all about the survival of their bloodlines, so either the situation is already resolved (their families are with them and they're having kids) or they just... forgot?

<ul>
<li>For that matter, how are they getting ammunition, supplies, and the materials needed to construct a moon base? Well, that's not a real question, I'm willing to let that one slide...</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Anyways, it's very likely that I missed something in one of the episodes, and that's actually primarily what I'm looking for here. I am enjoying this series but in order to do so I have to set aside my questions about the fundamental premise, because otherwise nothing that's happening here seems to have any justification.</p>

<p>So the main thing I'm looking for is clarity on how the knights go to where they are and why they behaved the way they did in that 15 year gap, as well as what the princess is doing there. That is, some clarity on what remains of the link between Mars and the trapped Orbital Knights and army.</p>

  11th year of the Meiji era, where he befriends a female Kendo master,
  a former <strong>thief</strong>, a <strong>brawler</strong> and <strong>a doctor</strong> all with their own

"About the physics of transmutation in FMA:B","<p>Anyone who has watched even an episode of FMA or FMA:B knows how transmutations work. They are the staple of alchemy, and are very important to the show.

This all seems fine and dandy when it is first explained to you; you must put in what you want to get out.</p>

<p>However, I soon started to considering the ramifications of this theory. Yes, it agrees with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_mass"" rel=""nofollow"">Conservation of Mass</a>, which states that matter cannot be created nor destroyed in a reaction. Sticking with chemistry and physics, it is also well-known that energy is required to make and break chemical bonds. While Edward provides ample matter for his transmutations (which are essentially 'reactions' in the parallel universe of FMA/FMA:B), where does he get the energy? If the Law of Equivalent Exchange was truly correct, wouldn't Ed and Al have to provide the equivalent amount of energy to bond all of the required substances together? Is this 'shortcoming' ever discussed in either series (2003 or 2009), or in the manga?</p>

"Why does Puck refer to Emilia as 'My Daughter'?","<p>In episode 15, Puck referred to Emilia as his Daughter.</p>

<p>Why is this? A few thoughts I have come up with to explain the reasoning come down to:</p>

<ul>
<li>They have a relationship like Father/Daughter. (In my opinion they do not have this, they seem more like best friends than this.)</li>
<li>Puck IS her father. (Again, this seems convoluted to me, as it is stated that Puck is a Spirit.</li>
<li>the 'Daughter' terminology is code for something else, Emilia likely having something like this for Puck too.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also said by Puck in episode 18 something along the lines of ""In accordance with my contract, I shall now destroy the world"".</p>

<p>When asked why, the answer given was ""Emilia is my entire reason for existing. There is no reason for me to exist in a world without her.""</p>

<p>This shows some kind of deeper bond between them, deeper than I can think.</p>

<p>What exactly <em>is</em> their relationship?</p>

"Why is shonen manga's goriness these days abundant?","<p>So I just read <a href=""http://myanimelist.net/manga/100128/Yakusoku_no_Neverland"" rel=""nofollow"">The Promised Neverland</a> and the goriness is kinda jarring for me (and it's in Weekly Shonen Jump). It's a not alone there, actually. HxH has its own share of goriness. Shingeki no Kyojin is also formally a shonen title even though I personally treat it as a seinen. And there are other similar titles too many to mention here.</p>

 2) Yin says for Hei to ""Take her Life"", since Hei's Powers are actually Pi's because she fused with him (her power being able to manipulate matter at the atomic level apparently) and Hei was only seen with his hand outreach at the end so is Yin now fused with Hei like Pi<br>
 3) Those 2 Doll Twins had the same kind of Specter that Yin had where instead of a blob they had a human from and they said they was going to a 3rd gate that has just appeared so what is the 3rd gate and why has it appeared after the first 2<br>
 4) There's the unknown being that would be born which is probably that child that came out of the coffin but also there's a huge black monolith extending out of Hell's Gate so does it has a connection to the kid</p>

"Discrepancies between Kishimoto and the Asura Path?","<p>According to the wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Asura Path (修羅道, Shuradō) grants the user the ability to augment their own body to summon mechanised armour and various ballistic and mechanical weaponry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two questions on this topic. </p>

<p>1) Kishimoto has said there is no technology in the Naruto universe that would defeat the purpose of ninjas, specifically guns and weapons. However, why did he have the Asura Path of Pain equipped with machine guns, rockets, and lasers? Here's a quote from him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Masashi Kishimoto: Firstly, projectile weapons such as guns aren't allowed. (The one exception is Inari's bowgun.) Guns aren't suited to ninja. Gunpowder is used in the anime, though I don't think it should be there. And, vehicles such as aeroplanes are not allowed. I try to restrain technology that can be used for war... For example, if missiles were in it, it'd be the end. (laughs)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out when Pain assaulted the Hidden Leaf Village, it pretty much was the end! So why did he say these things would not be in the Naruto universe when in fact they were? </p>

<p>2) So all the Rinnegan wielders have access to the Six Paths. Does that mean the highly advanced weapons from the Asura Path of Pain originated from the Sage of the Six Paths himself? In other words, did the Sage of the Six paths have some lesser, technologically inferior form of machine guns, rockets, etc. long ago for his Asura Path powers?</p>

<p>Also, what exactly are the powers for people who've wielded the Rinnegan at some point, like Obito, Madara, and Sasuke, regarding the Asura Path? Can they even use it since it involves constructing your own weapons? Or is there something they do to summon these weapons?</p>

"Why is alchemy powered by tectonic plates?","<blockquote>
  <p>In the manga, alchemy is said to have been taught to Amestrians over 350 years prior to the start of the series by a mysterious man known as The Philosopher from the East and is explained to harness the diastrophic energy that is released from the movement and collision of tectonic plates deep within the Earth's crust to power transmutation.</p>

<p>I am simply confused between the correlation of tectonic plates and alchemy's power. How does the tectonic plates moving act as the fuel for any non-p.stone transmutations???

"Why doesn't Kana's boss know about the Day of Flight?","<p>I'm currently rewatching <em>Haibane Renmei</em>. In episode 4, we see this exchange:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Kana's employer:</strong> Hey, is Kana going away? </p>
  
  <p><strong>Rakka:</strong> Oh, not at all. I didn't come to replace her. I'm just visiting everyone's workplace because I'm new. Kana loves it here. I can tell.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Employer:</strong> I see. Well, with those wings of yours, they make me think she might just fly away on me one day.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Rakka:</strong> They look fancy, but they don't actually work at all.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Employer:</strong> I see. That's good, then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's quite clear from this exchange that Rakka does not know about the Day of Flight, which is probably to be expected, as she's a newcomer who does not learn about it until Kuu leaves.</p>

<p>However, what struck me as strange was that Kana's employer (who looks relatively older and who isn't a Haibane) seems to have no knowledge of it (as might be inferred from his question). It would appear that he is old enough to possibly have seen other Haibane disappear in the past. There are two obvious ways to explain this for me. However, I'm not sure if either of them is correct:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Beyond the trading that the Communicator does with the Toga, the normal townspeople don't have many personal interactions with the Haibane, so they wouldn't notice if one disappeared one day. The townspeople might have a basic understanding of how Haibane life works (so wouldn't be surprised to see the teenage Rakka appear as a ""newborn"" one day) particularly if they often interact with them, but they wouldn't be aware of the specifics.</p>

<p>However, given the limited number of places where Haibane can work (in episode 3), I'm not sure how true this is, since the people who work <em>there</em> would probably be slightly more familiar with things, even if the townspeople seem to outnumber the Haibane.</p></li>
<li><p>The Haibane are seen as somewhat separate: the employer earlier tells Kana:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The clock tower in your home. Go repair that yourself. [...] We're not supposed to meddle too much in the Haibane's lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might mean that the townspeople might not delve into the <em>specifics</em> of the Haibane's lives, and that the Haibane are responsible for themselves. However, this is more of a general statement than anything, as we see in episode 3 that the housemother isn't a Haibane. Moreover, this would only mean that the townspeople might not bother inquiring after the Haibane who have disappeared (even if they might not know <em>why</em> they've disappeared): it does not mean that they do not necessarily know that the Haibane -- or at least the Haibane outside of the Federation -- eventually ""go away"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there a more satisfying explanation for Kana's employer's ignorance about the fact that the Haibane eventually ""go away"" than these? Or do I already have the best explanation we can get? (Again, I wouldn't expect him to know the exact specifics about the Day of Flight beyond that the Haibane eventually leave.) Alternatively, am I possibly just misinterpreting the exchange? (I could see the first line as implying that the boss does indeed have the Day of Flight in mind, but what he says afterwards seems slightly out of line with that.)</p>

Then, she was told that she can be <strong>anything but Arch Wizard since it requires intelligence</strong>. Arch Wizard, being a Wizard, and as we can see from Megumin, is a class that uses magic to attack. Aqua's low intelligence prevents her from becoming a Arch Wizard, means that magic is related to intelligence.</p>

<p>When they checked Megumin's adventurer card, both Kazuma and Aqua mentioned that Megumin, being from the Crimson Demon clan, has a <strong>very high intelligence</strong> and is an <strong>Arch Wizard</strong>. It was also shown that Megumin <strong>can cast advanced spell</strong>, Explosion although only <strong>once a day due to her limited mana</strong>.</p>

"How did so many people get away with cheating during the written portion of the Chunin Exam?","<p>Disclaimer: I never read past the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, so it is possible that my question may be answered if I had read further. However, I do believe that the Chunin Exam arc, which is what my question is about, is far enough from the Sasuke Retrieval Arc that my question would have already been answered by the time the story arrives at the Sasuke Retrieval Arc. </p>

<p>I will be referencing the part of the Chunin Exam Arc where the characters take the written portion of the exam. This is in volume 5 of the Naruto tankoban (which covers chapters 37 - 45).</p>

<p>During my trip down memory lane with my re-reading of what I have read of Naruto, this question occurred to me: how did so many characters get away with, at least to me, seemingly obvious, cheats during the written portion of the Chunin exam?</p>

<p>Here is a list of cheats in particular that went unnoticed that I would like to know how they managed to do so:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Akamaru was barking the answers to Kiba. We know that dogs are used a fair amount by skilled ninja, including Kakashi himself, so would it not be logical for the proctors to assume that a dog could be used to cheat? I can believe Shino's insect trick because ninja-insect interaction is much rarer than ninja-dog interaction since it is an ability exclusive to Shino's clan and also a fly buzzing is much more inaudible than a dog barking.</p></li>
<li><p>Naruto and Hinata were having a full-blown conversation, it was whispering, but still a conversation nonetheless. How did none of the proctors notice?</p></li>
<li><p>Also going along the lines of communication with other ninja in the room, how did Tenten manage to communicate to Rock Lee to raise his head band to notify her that he was able to see her mirrors in the ceiling/how did she communicate to him that the mirrors were even there without getting caught?</p></li>
<li><p>How did Tenten get those mirrors up in the ceiling undetected in the first place? I cannot imagine that it was done before the exam started, unless she was planning to cheat from the very start, without knowing what the exam was going to be like. I can believe Kankuro and his Crow cheat because it is much easier to set-up Crow as a proctor undetected in the masses of ninja in the room than it is to set-up a mirror system in the ceiling.</p></li>
<li><p>Ino's Mind Body Switch Technique requires hand seals. How did she get away with using it on Sakura without being seen? I would imagine that hand seals would be the very first thing that the proctors would look out for considering it is an exam for ninja.</p></li>
<li><p>Proctor Ibiki himself actually SEES Gaara making a hand gesture that could pass as a hand seal if the next panel had not revealed that he was just using that hand gesture to cover his eye so he could create the sand eye. But even so, Ibiki did claim to count ""anything out of the ordinary"" as cheating, and a suspicious hand gesture resembling a hand seal, I would say, qualifies as ""out of the ordinary"", so why did he not call Gaara out?</p></li>
<li><p>I realize that this last point is a bit too hypothetical and assumes too much, but  we do know that there are ninja who can sense chakra usage. I do not recall this directly from the manga, but taking a look at Ino's Wiki page <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Ino_Yamanaka"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, it says that she is one of such ninja (eventually, but that is not the point; I am just linking to show that there does exist chakra sensing ninja). Surely [I know, this is a large assumption here], there must be some proctor in the room who would have such an ability since it is a ninja exam, so why did no one detect the chakra expenditure that was going on in the room? </p></li>

"Did Goku actually die near end of Frieza saga? Plothole?","<p>So I am going through and rewatching Dragonball Z with my wife and noticed something.  When Goku is fighting Freiza as a SSJ, he gets sent into lava during the process of King Kai's wish for bringing back everyone that ""Frieza and his henchmen killed"". </p>

<p><strong>So my first question is:</strong></p>

<p><code>Did Goku die in this moment?</code> Seems that the events went as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>King Kai starts wish</li>
<li>Goku goes into lava and dies.</li>
<li>Goku is brought back to life from King Kai's wish</li>
<li>Goku is much more powerful and full of energy (finally having the edge over Freiza vs before these events when it was a pretty much stalemate)</li>
</ol>

<p>This makes me think that <code>yes Goku died</code> but then this reveals a plot hole as the wish was made with the earth dragonballs which were stated many times to not be able to revive someone already revived from them before. Well Goku was revived for the Vegeta / Nappa arc already. Plot hole?</p>

<p><strong>Second question:</strong></p>

<p>After Namek blows up it is said by King Kai if someone were to be wished back they would appear wherever they died and basically making it so Goku can't be wished back since Namek is gone but later Vegeta states they can wish someone back to the Earth's check-in station and then wished back to life. </p>

<p>So they do they following 3 wishes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask for Krillin to be wished to the Earth's check-in station</li>
<li>Wish Krillin back to life. Seems to work based on rules.</li>
<li>Wish Yamcha back to life. He doesn't have to be wished to the check-in station as well?</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this because Yamcha was in a ""safe place""? <code>Why did't they need two wishes like they did with Krillin?</code></p>

<p>FYI, even though I know many documented plot holes exist, and I could very well be wrong with my logic above, I enjoy learning things that I may have missed and having the discussion at least</p>

"Why can Sailor Pluto be away from the Space-Time Door?","<p>In the classic 90s anime, Sailor Pluto was commissioned by Queen Serenity (mom of Princess Serenity [Sailor Moon's ancient incarnation]) to guard the Space-Time Door, which she is shown doing in the <em>R</em> season, but she is later allowed to leave, and thus shows up with a civilian form (Setsuna) in the <em>S</em> season.  One of the 3 rules given by Queen Serenity was that she could not leave her post at the door.  She does go on to break all of the rules, but <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Pluto#Profile"">according to Wikipedia</a>, Neo-Queen Serenity (future Sailor Moon) <strong>gives her permission to leave her post</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>But why?  Does the door not need to be guarded anymore?</strong>  Is it <strong>temporary leave</strong> and she will need to return eventually, or is it <strong>permanent leave</strong>?</p>

<p>In the manga, Sailor Pluto's guarding location might be located <strong>outside of time</strong> (or is it located inside of the palace in 30th century Crystal Tokyo?), so perhaps she could technically be there as well as have a 20th century civilian incarnation that is at a point <strong>inside of time</strong>, so she could apparently continue to guard the door <em>while</em> she shows up in <em>S</em>, the <em>SuperS</em> movie, and <em>Sailor Stars</em> (but this is unrelated to why Neo Queen Serenity would excuse her from her post in the classic anime).</p>

<p>They can speak.They are delicious.Big mom was fed these stuffs by Jinbe.
<strong>Are they living beings</strong>?</p>

  <p>'Jinbe then arrives and feeds Big Mom some <strong>croquembouche <em>tourists</em></strong>, returning her to normal.'</p>

"Is Goku still pure-hearted?","<p>This question could seem as an opinion based question, but let me try to explain why I think it is not. In Dragon Ball, Goku was supposed to be completely pure-hearted to be able to ride the Flying Nimbus, to the point he needed to have no bad intentions at all, otherwise he couldn't stand in the top of it, he had to be a sort of Super Saiyan Jesus. At some point in the Dragon Ball series, Vegeta emphasizes this by saying Goku never dared to kill someone (because of this). </p>

<p>But at some point after that, Goku indeed kills someone, that is kid Bu. With Piccolo before, someone could argue he didn't actually finished him because he immediately reincarnated or so, but this isn't the case of kid Buu. And now, in Dragon Ball Super, Goku is doing something different to what he always did. When someone threatened the Earth or the universe, no matter how strong he was, he at least tried to defeat him. But with the case of Zeno, he didn't even try. Someone could argue Zeno is so powerful that he knew he couldn't defeat him, but is Zeno that powerful? He isn't almighty because several Zenos were created by Trunks and Zamasu when messing with time, Zeno isn't unbelievably strong because he can't follow Dyspo's moves. At some point I thought this ""destroying all universes"" thing was a fake, but now the manga has shown that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> indeed Zeno destroys all universes permanently and the great priest doesn't care, he only acknowledges Zeno whims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why Goku didn't even try to defeat Zeno by training and merging with Vegeta or whatever, and he doesn't care much about all the universes which are being destroyed every time he defeats them? Is Goku still pure-hearted?</p>

<p>When I bought the DVD Set which had all 3 series and the 2 movies from eBay, I assumed it was the proper Japanese DVDs.

"Does it make sense that Knuckle has a mascot as an emitter?","<p>Knuckle Bine is listed as being a natural emitter but I am having difficultly reconciling that with his main power. As an emitter, the most difficult class for him to master is the conjuration and then (ignoring specialisation) transmutation.</p>

<p>His ability is to donate (sure you could call it emit) his Nen into another fighter. That Nen will gain interest until it reaches a point where it can force the other fighter into zetsu for 30 days.  The difficult thing to reconcil is that this Nen takes the shape of an indestructable mascot and has very unusual properties following very exact rules.</p>

<p>The creation of a physical manifestation is conjuration.  This creature appears to be made of Nen which means it wouldn't actually be a physical object (transmutation). These kinds of contracts/rule-following abilities seem to be tied to conjuration as well.  I could even buy that he is using manipulation to control the other person's Nen to force Zetsu.</p>

<p>Foreign names are common in Japanese manga. It's very common to introduce a foreigner (main character or not) to join the rest of the Japanese cast. Apart from those cases, we have stories where the setting is in a land foreign to Japan, or in an alternate universe where the names of the character are made foreign like in the case of <em>Akatsuki no Yona</em>. However, in most of the manga I have read that falls into this category, the names are dominantly Western and I have never seen any other shows with all the characters having Korean names.</p>

In my mind, I can only see Iskandar as a worthy opponent to Gilgamesh, but the Iskandar Urobuchi created was an excellent, wild, and unprecedented character that I could have never thought up.

<p>In the chapter 399-400 from Fairy Tail manga, Erza is fighting Kyouka to stop faces's activation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1000 years ago Garland placed the Soul Divider at the Iifa Tree's base to discard the Gaian souls and replace them with Terran ones, thus slowly restoring Terra. <strong>Terran flora and fauna began reviving on Gaia</strong> as it was finally recovering from the destruction that happened in the wake of the failed Fusion.

"Is Yonezawa Sachiko inspired by Misawa Sachika?","<p>In <em>Joukamachi no Dandelion</em>, there is a character named Yonezawa Sachiko (aka ""Sacchan""). There also exists a real human being named Misawa Sachika. Observe the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Sachiko is voiced by Sachika.</li>
<li>Their names are curiously similar, sharing three of five characters - 米<strong>澤紗千</strong>子 vs. 三<strong>澤紗千</strong>香.</li>
<li>Sachiko is an idol. While I don't know that I would characterize Misawa as an ""idol"", per se, she is a skilled vocalist, and certainly strikes me as the idol ""type"" of voice actress.</li>

Now, her name Toushinou Kyouko is written as <strong>歳納京子</strong>. I'm not sure how her pseudonym is written since I wasn't able to find the original spelling for that name, but I think it would use the Kyou from Kyouko（<strong>京</strong>）in Nishikyougoku and Ko from Kyouko（<strong>子</strong>）in Ramuko. The first Nishi that I think of is（西）which means West, and the first goku I can think of is（国）which means Kingdom/Country. Thus, it would be somewhat a word play of her own name since Tou（東）in Toukyou（東<strong>京</strong>）means East.</p>

<p>Now, it is quite common for writers to use pen name that is similar to his/her real name and is related to him/her somehow. An example for this would be Joanne Rowling whose pen name was J. K. Rowling with the K. taken from her paternal grandmother's name, Kathleen. Another example would be the writer Saito Satoshi whose born name was Saito Tomohiro, more commonly known under his stage name as actor, Hiro Mizushima which uses the same Saito as in his real name. An example from another anime would be Kousaka Kirino whose pen name was Rino.</p>

"Where do the people of Orth get their food from?","<p>Due to lack of land, there is no agriculture in Orth. This means that the town's food can only come from two places:</p>

<p><strong>Imports/Trade</strong></p>

<p>If Orth was trading relics for food, we would be seeing a constant line of ships coming and going. There would also be infrastructure in place to transport goods up and down the outside of the volcano.</p>

<p><strong>Hunting/Foraging in the Abyss</strong></p>

<p>In Episode 5, Riko mentions that any meat they had at the orphanage came from here, so this is the likely option. There are thousands (possibly tens of thousands) of people living on the surface. Shouldn't there be hundreds of people in the first layer every day hunting animals, catching fish and gathering fruit? How come we never see anyone other than the odd cave raider?</p>

<p>As much as food plays a role with our main characters, we curiously never see anyone eating on the surface. I doubt that the need to eat is tied to the Curse of the Abyss.</p>

<p>In a story so world-building focused, I find this to be a strange oversight (though not one that draws from my enjoyment of the show).</p>

"What purpose does Zoro's third sword actually serve?","<p>Zoro has trained with Santoryu for basically his entire life, and has completely perfected it by this point. But, just from a fighting perspective, it would be quite difficult to get enough leverage/support with a sword in your teeth to actually do effective damage to anything (at least, without Haki). Unless this is just a classic case of ""this is a fantasy world with fruits that give people magical powers, so it's possible for Zoro to have a strong enough neck to use a third sword effectively"". </p>

<p>Most of the times we see him fighting, it's usually only with his two swords in his hands, and we barely ever actually <em>see</em> his third sword do anything. We often see implied strikes after he finished Oni Giri or other big finishing moves. </p>

<p>It seems Nitoryu would be just as effective as Santoryu in most situations.  What exactly does his third sword do in a normal fight, that is so important for his style to hinge on it? Did the third sword become more useful in normal combat after the timeskip (not including the use of Haki, because if that was included, obviously it would be more useful), or is it still basically the same?</p>

"In season 2, how did Koichi manage to obtain Aoi Tsunemori's ear?","<p><strong>Note: The whole post is a spoiler.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>How did Koichi come to be in possession of <a href=""http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/Aoi_Tsunemori"" rel=""nofollow"">Aoi Tsunemori</a>'s ear?</p>

<p>In Episode 9 of Psycho-Pass 2, <a href=""http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/Koichi_Kuwashima"" rel=""nofollow"">Koichi Kuwashima</a> gave a present to <a href=""http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/Akane_Tsunemori"" rel=""nofollow"">Akane Tsunemori</a> before turning himself over to MWPSB. That present was revealed to hold Aoi Tsunemori's ear. </p>

<p>Given the circumstances, I assumed that Koichi or <a href=""http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/Kirito_Kamui"" rel=""nofollow"">Kirito Kamui</a> and company abducted Akane's grandmother, but given Akane's reaction I suppose Aoi wasn't killed up until that time. </p>

<p>However, earlier in the same episode  <a href=""http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/Sakuya_Togane"" rel=""nofollow"">Sakuya Togane</a> ordered <a href=""http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/Mika_Shimotsuki"" rel=""nofollow"">Mika Shimotsuki</a> to determine the whereabouts of Akane's grandmother. Also, in the scene next to Akane's reaction after seeing Aoi's ear, the expressions on Togane's face implied (as I saw fit) that he was involved in that brutal act. </p>

<p>In the last episode, Togane had revealed that he was the one behind the brutal killing of Aoi, whose body was found in Warehouse district (not sure whether it is the same district where she was living; an earlier episode revealed that she was living in a  nursing home with considerable drones guarding the place).</p>

<p>All of this doesn't seem to add up to a coherent plot.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kirito and company knew where Aoi was living and they were able to hack the drones guarding the place, as witnessed in an earlier episode.</li>
<li>Togane came to know about Aoi's home via Mika.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following are the two events that I suppose happened in the story but were not revealed and left to ponder:</p>

<ul>
<li>Koichi or friends stormed the house, took away Aoi's ear, and left off. Later, Togane came and killed Aoi brutally -- too many flaws in this plot.</li>
<li>Alternatively, Togane first reached the house, killed Aoi and left the body in Warehouse district. Koichi or friends later visited the house or the place where the body was dumped, took away the ear, and went off -- I have high hopes with this theory.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some theories floating in some places on web that Togane and Koichi were working together, so after finishing off Aoi, Togane handed over her ear to Koichi since both had the intention to blacken Akane's hue. This doesn't follow any logic in my opinion since Koichi remained a loyal friend of Kirito, and Kirito and Togane were enemies.</p>

<p>So, what really happened? Or, what is the most logical conclusion for the story?</p>

"What are the characteristics and themes present in Gundam characters based on Char Aznable?","<p>Across all <em>Gundam</em> universes, there is always at least one character based on <a href=""http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Char_Aznable"" rel=""nofollow"">Char Aznable</a> from the original Gundam series. (I say ""at least one"" because sometimes there is a softer character that is less obviously based on Char.)</p>

<ul>
<li>In <em>Gundam Wing</em>, the obvious Char knockoff would be Zechs Marquise; the tell-tale characteristic is the mask. He was the sister of Releena and the child of the Peacecraft family. This an obvious nod to the fact that Char was really Casval Rem Deikun, son of Zeon Dum Deikun. His sister was Artesia Rem Deikun, who took the alias Sayla and was an active member aboard White Base.</li>
<li>Quatra is the less obvious Char clone, who shares Char's blonde hair and is named after the number 4. (Char in multiple Indian languages means four and his alias in Zeta Gundam was Lt. Quatro.)</li>
<li>In the most recent <em>Gundam Unicorn</em>, Full Frontal is obviously the main Char character (many in the show itself believing him to be the famed Red Comet) while Ensign Ridhe is the softer Char character (indicated by his blonde hair, his family's ancestry, and rivalry with the main character).</li>
</ul>

<p>The Char character usually has some kind of ""cool"" nickname; Char's is Red Comet, and Zechs has the name Lightning Count. Additionally, their mobile suit is usually colored red or white. Would this make Athuran Zala also a Char character, with his signature Red mobile suits?</p>

<p>Basically, what I'm wondering is: <strong>Is there a defined set of characteristics like the above mentions and their occurrences across all <em>Gundam</em> series (whether they be Universal Century or not)?</strong></p>

"Does Lelouch vi Britannia speak with a Japanese accent?","<p>Jun Fukuyama obviously has a Japanese accent, and we don't necessarily know about Johnny Yong Bosch's Japanese accent from the Code Geass dub alone. Regardless, I'm talking about the character Lelouch from Code Geass, specifically when Lelouch has been masquerading as Zero from Season 1 Episode 1 until half of Season 1 Episode 12.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://codegeass.fandom.com/wiki/The_Messenger_from_Kyoto_(episode)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Episode 12</a>, everyone is surprised Lelouch/Zero isn't Japanese when <a href=""https://youtu.be/j7zZI9dndYI?t=165"" rel=""noreferrer"">Zero confirms Kirihara's guess</a> (I originally watched the sub and not the dub, but I recall it went similarly in the sub, where I recall I thought 'They really thought Zero's Japanese?'). Does this mean that for the past 12 episodes, Lelouch, as Zero, had been speaking perfectly fluent Japanese with a Japanese accent, which he learned from his days with the Kururugi family and his other days in Japan thereafter probably with Sayokopter? If so, then is there any indication that he indeed had been speaking Japanese fluently with a Japanese accent? I believe that Lelouch is definitely N1 JLPT-level, but I'm not sure that means he has a Japanese accent, much like how not all fluent English speakers have an English (whether British, American, Britannian or European) accent.</p>

<p>My guess for the accent:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Since no one has suspected Zero is not Japanese whenever Lelouch, as Zero, has spoken Japanese publicly during the first 12 episodes, it follows that he, as Zero, must have had a Japanese accent while speaking Japanese in the first 12 episodes (and thereafter). Also, the indication may come after episode 12: If he later spoke Japanese publicly, then presumably he had a Japanese accent all along unless he had recently obtained one.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, if Lelouch, not as Zero, has a Japanese accent when speaking Japanese, then of course Lelouch, as Zero, will have a Japanese accent when speaking Japanese.</p></li>
<li><p>Other possibilities include voice distortions like in Death Note (I don't think there was indication of this) or that Lelouch has come to mainly speak with a Japanese accent even when speaking English, as some kind of force of habit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To compare Raye Penber from Death Note speaks Japanese, but his accent isn't Japanese, as Light pointed out. I like how the nationalities were pointed out like this even though the American characters in Death Note had their lines delivered in Japanese. Given that some other anime had addressed accents, I consider Code Geass unrealistic in this regard if Code Geass has not addressed things like this i.e. if indeed there isn't an indication of an accent, but of course, Lelouch had stayed in Japan more than Raye Penber had.</p>

"Why did Misty leave the Pokemon anime?","<p>I remember watching the Pokemon anime when I was a kid, and I was absolutely obsessed with Ash, Brock, Misty, and Pikachu. I remember when Brock left, and then there was Tracy, and then Brock came back. After a while, I stopped watching, but then resumed a few years later, to see that both Brock and Misty were gone, and they were replaced with May and Max (I think this is correct).</p>

<p>I must have missed what happened to Misty and Brock during my brief absence from the Pokemon franchise. I'll leave Brock for another question (or maybe bonus points if you know about what happened to him too), but what happened to Misty? What was her reason for leaving the original team? Separate from that reason, what was the executive reason for deleting Misty? For example, when the writing staff got rid of Brock the first time, they said it was due to his flirtatious manner, and were worried he would not be well received. Was there any reason similar to this for Misty's disappearance? Could she ever return, like Brock did? </p>

"When did the transition from standard definition (4:3) to widescreen (16:9) for television anime happen?","<p>Modern television anime is produced at an aspect ratio of 16:9 - widescreen/HD. But in the past, television anime was more often produced at an aspect ratio of 4:3 - standard definition.</p>

<p>When did the transition from 4:3 to 16:9 for television anime happen?</p>

<p>Now, it's not too difficult to find isolated examples to get a sense for when the switchover was in progress. For example, <em>Ouran High School Host Club</em>, from spring 2006, was produced at 4:3, while <em>Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid</em>, from summer 2005, was produced at 16:9. Clearly, the transition was under way by 2005, but not complete by 2006. And I'm fairly confident that by 2011, all television anime were in 16:9 (<em>Ninja Slayer</em> notwithstanding). </p>

<p>But what I'm looking for is a more holistic view of how this transition happened. Who were the major players? Can we identify a clear starting date for the transition? And so forth. </p>

<p>I don't know a great deal about the <em>Fate</em> franchise, but it seems to be increasingly popular with games and anime series and loads more content in development. There also seems to be a great deal of LNs getting published in English lately that don't have as much of a following.</p>

<p>Is it because they're considered old (<em>Zero</em> is 2006, <em>Apocrypha</em> is 2012) or because there's an anime adaption for both so what's the point? Was it just overlooked?</p>

  <p>The market for LN is really small outside Japan for a number of reasons so companies aren't interested in publishing them unless they are for very famous franchises</p>

<p>That's what I'm saying, is <em>Fate</em> not an incredibly famous and marketable franchise both in and out of Japan? A number of <em>Fate</em> games have English localization, most of the anime series are on Netflix USA/UK with English dubs etc, this one just seems a bit of an anomaly. </p>

<p>Not to mention that question is almost 6 years old, the market has grown since then with entire bookshelves of English LNs in Western stores now. Seems to me, despite profitability, <em>Fate</em> got skipped.</p>

<p>Especially considering LNs like <em>Globlin Slayer</em> and <em>Rise of the Shield Hero</em> have English translations way before they even had an anime* to market them in the West. </p>

<p>*December 2016 and September 2015 respectively, their anime aired Fall 2018 and Winter 2019.</p>

<h2>Are there, in the <em>Log Horizon</em> franchise, Landers which [discovered | were told | figured out | whatever] about <em>Elder Tale</em>?</h2>

<p>Do some of them know the ""uncomfortable truth""? I.e. that, <em>in the world where Adventurers come from</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Adventurers"" are not ""Adventurers"" at all, they don't have special powers, they just played a game in which they killed monsters for fun, sitting on a chair and clicking buttons on a machine</li>
<li>Theldesia is just the fictional setting of that game, where Landers are  fictional, computer-controlled characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be interesting to see how they reacted to this shocking revelation.</p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: I only watched the two seasons of the ""<em>Log Horizon</em>"" anime. 
If the answer would contain spoilers for additional material, please direct me to that additional material (if it is available in English, since I don't speak Japanese).</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: just realize that ""<em>Adventures don't treat us like real people</em>"" is necessary but not sufficient for what I'm looking for. This because realizing this is not so hard: in fact, before the <a href=""http://log-horizon.wikia.com/wiki/Catastrophe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Catastrophe</a>, <em>Adventurers did not look like real people to the Landers as well</em> (so probably the ""Welcome to the village of Arb"" joke in season 1 episode 5 could be true also from the Landers' POV). I'm looking for at least a Lander who knows something like ""<em>Adventures don't treat us like real people because they used to see us as fictional characters in a game, the so-called heroes were just playing make-believe to escape boredom</em>"". This is a completely different animal.</p>

<p><strong>Note 3</strong>: The fight between Papus and Elias Hackblade goes near to what I'm looking for, but I still don't think that's what I'm looking for. Papus says to Elias that he (Elias) is fictional, Elias is horrified, but it's not clear if he's horrified by the revelation, by that ugly monster or by the magic the monster he's casting on him. Anyway, Kanami treats Elias as real, but then the scene is cut and we don't know what happens next (at least in the anime).
According to the wiki entry for <a href=""http://log-horizon.wikia.com/wiki/Papus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Papus</a> (beware of spoilers!!!), he has a special power that causes Landers to <strong><em>believe</em></strong> they are fictional. I don't care about what the Genius <strong><em>think</em></strong> about Landers, and I don't care if Landers <strong><em>are</em></strong> fictional or real people. I care if there are Landers who will believe what the Genius say, and if this will bring them to discover that Adventurers were just roleplayers, and how this will change their relationship with Adventurers. (Note that Elias is a perfect example of Lander that did not react or ask questions when Kanami and her friends used words like ""NPC"", ""playing"", ""game"", ""real life"", etc. No, I don't think he already knows the truth about Elder Tale just because he's on the Elder Tale box).</p>

<p>It also adds that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Behind these bunks, at
  the back of the room, are <strong>six</strong> lockers where the men can store their
  clothes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since there are seven male members in the Straw Hat crew, there must be one person who doesn't get to sleep in a hammock and who doesn't have a locker. My question is, who is it?</p>

<p>I came across <a href=""http://www.narutoforums.com/showthread.php?t=810848"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>this</strong></a> and <a href=""http://feriowind.deviantart.com/art/OP-Daily-life-on-Sunny-1-132802881"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>this</strong></a> link which pose a similar question.
The answers which seem to be valid are </p>

<ul>
<li>Sanji sleeping in the kitchen  </li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think Sanji sleeps in the kitchen, but there is a couch to the right <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Thousand_Sunny?file=Thousand_sunny_kitchen.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>here</strong></a>, does Sanji sleep there?</p>

<p>I think Sanji does have a locker to himself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Zoro sleeping in the crow's nest  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Thousand_Sunny?file=Thousand_sunny_crows_nest.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>crow's nest</strong></a> seems to have wooden benches, but I doubt Zoro sleeps there.</p>

<p>I think Zoro has a locker to himself, too.</p>

<ul>
<li>Brook not sleeping  </li>
</ul>

<p>In an SBS question, Oda has said that Brook sleeps for five hours. <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Straw_Hat_Pirates/Miscellaneous#Typical_Hours_of_Sleep"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>This</strong></a> is the link. <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/SBS_Volume_74#Chapter_737.2C_Page_126"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>This</strong></a> link gives their sleep timings. So that eliminates the possibility that Brook doesn't sleep. Maybe he doesn't sleep in this room though?</p>

<p>I can't guess if he has a locker or not.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chopper sleeping on the bed in the Sick Bay  </li>
</ul>

<p>This seems like the most plausible solution, since Chopper considers the <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Thousand_Sunny?file=Thousand_sunny_sick_bay.png#Kitchen.2C_Dining_Room.2C_and_Sick_Bay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Sick Bay</strong></a> as his personal room, provided the bed isn't reserved for patients.</p>

<p>He might be the one who doesn't have a locker, since he can keep his stuff in the infirmary.</p>

<ul>
<li>One of them is on night watch, so there are enough hammocks for the rest</li>
</ul>

<p>This is possible, but is it true? If it is, was there any rare occasion when none of them was on watch? I highly doubt it, but if the answer is yes, how did they sleep then?</p>

<p>Even if they did manage to sleep somehow (one of them on the floor, for example), there are still six lockers though, so who doesn't have a locker to himself?</p>

<p>The following image provides a pretty nice solution, but this is an image from when the Straw Hats were on the <em>Going Merry</em>. Do they use the same solution on the <em>Thousand Sunny</em> too?</p>

It is still going on but I have heard that it will end by this December. But now I am not sure that I remember the whole story and picking it up again will not be that enjoyable.

"How come sports anime never have tryouts?","<p>This might sound like a weird question, but hear me out. In all of the anime that I've seen that revolves around high school sports, they never seem to have the concept of the ""tryout"". </p>

<p>Keep in mind that I live in the States, so my perspective will be biased. When I was in high school, all of our sports teams required prospective members to pass the tryouts in order to join. Basically, the coach/advisor of the team would administer an exam for the new potential members, to gauge their proficiency in the sport. If they were deemed satisfactory, they are granted membership into the team. If not, then they are rejected. </p>

<p>However, in all the sports-related anime that I've seen, it looks like any student could just submit an application and join the team. They often don't even care about their skill in the sport, since I've seen many sports anime where new team members can be complete novices. So how come they don't hold tryouts/auditions to make sure that all members of the team are above some baseline level of competency in the sport? I'm sure this would greatly improve their performance in competitions and such. This isn't limited to anime either, since I've also seen it in Japanese soap operas.

"Who is Julius Kingsley?","<p>In the second episode of ""Code Geass: Akito the Exiled"" a man calling himself ""Julius Kingsley"" exites a train of the royal family. To understand this episode and not getting spoiled by my question you should have seen Code Geass R1 completely, the beginning of Code Geass R2 and the first episode of ""Code Geass: Akito the exiled"".  </p>

<p>(Note that ""Code Geass: Akito the Exiled"" takes place in the year beetween Code Geass R1 and Code Geass R2)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The man exiting the train looks like Lelouch, his behaviour is also similar to Lelouch's (except Lelouch is less arrogant). The facts that Suzaku accompanies him and he wears an eyepatch on his left eye (the source of Lelouch's Geass) made me think whether this really is Lelouch or not. My first thought was that Lelouch lost his memories of the time before he was send to Japan (maybe he lost more memories too) and sees himself as a member of the royal family. Also, Julius Kingsley takes complete control of the troup planing. As Lelouch is a great tactician, I came to the conclusion that Julius Kingsley has to be Lelouch. Am I right? If so, why does he call himself Julius Kingsley? And what happened in the train, when he desperately begged for water?</p>

"In Mobile suit Gundam ZZ, how was Judau able to control the separated parts of his Gundam?","<p>I believe it was episode 47 when Judau battles Hammon Karn's Qubeley. Hammon manages to get hold of the Gundam Double Zeta. In order to break free, Judau separates his Gundam (it has three components, each with its own cockpit). Then there is some nonsense about the two leaving their mobile suits, Hammon with a gun and Judau with some metal rod. When Judau returns to his Gundam, he is able to use his Newtype powers to take control of the parts of his Gundam and reassemble them.</p>

<p>Now, in other instances where Newtype powers resonate with the pilot's mobile suit and result in some kind of physical action, it is attributed to the Psycommu. However, this is introduced to Federation and Aeug suits until the 2nd Neo Zeon War (this was the first) and double Zeta Gundam definitely did not have a Psycommu system.</p>

<p>There are two other instances I found where similar occurrences happened. One was when Amuro prevented Axis from crashing into Earth in what was to become known as the Axis shock. The other was when Banagher was able to link the Garencieres with the Nahel Argama. However, these two instances involve Gundams with Psycommu systems installed.</p>

<p>What explanation for Judau's abilities are there? Does this supersede the realm of science fiction? Would this be a deus ex machina?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I believe my initial assumptions when asking my questions were a bit incorrect. The Psycommu system was around since the 1 year war, present in several mobile armors including but not limited to Lalah's Elmeth and Char's Zeong. In Char's Deleted Affair, it is incorporated greatly into the mobile suit designs on Axis and eventually led to the creation of the Qubeley. The Psycho frame on the other hand wasn't introduced until the 2nd Neo Zeon War. I had the two systems confused. It was the Psycho frame which allowed the Axis shock to occur and allowed Banagher to get the Garencieres into space. However, the question still stands, How did Judau manage to reassemble his Gundam which lacked the psycho frame and psycommu?</p>

"Power of Ultra Instinct","<p>In the dragon ball universe there are plenty of methods to significantly boost the power level of the user. We have things such as Potara earrings, saiyan power ups etc. But more recently we were introduced to Ultra Instinct. As this is said to be a form attainable by anyone but mostly used by gods (which is even difficult for them to attain) how strong is it actually? Like how much does it power up an individual that uses it.</p>

<p>This question is mainly based on the episode of 115 where Goku used Ultra Instinct against Kefle as well as against Jiren in an earlier episode. In SSB form Goku was eventually outmatched even with Kaioken activated. We know for a fact that SS forms basically boost power and speed significantly at the cost of stamina and ki over time. Ultra Instinct is a state of the body, making it respond without having to process the thoughts; making the body capable of an instant perfect reflex to anything. </p>

<p>Goku was able to dodge all of Kefla's attacks which seemed like slow motion to him most likely. But he wasn't powered up. Ultra Instinct doesn't provide ki and such it simply is a state of the body making your reflexes perfect with no time delay. So where does the power output come from? How come his punches and such are stronger with Ultra Instinct compared to all his other forms? </p>

<p>As far as I understand each time he was in his none powered up form, his base form. This means his power level is a lot lower than even kaioken in base form. How come he is capable of having such a damage output? Does this mean a designing flaw in Ultra Instinct? </p>

<p>What is the <strong>actual</strong> power of Ultra Instinct apart from making muscle reflexes perfect?</p>

"Does Sailor Moon Crystal contain the Black Moon arc of the manga (Pluto and Chibiusa)?","<p>Has it been officially stated anywhere by a representative at the production company whether <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em>'s 26 total episodes cover the Black Moon arc of the manga (Chibiusa, Sailor Pluto, and the Black Moon Clan, equal to season R of the classic anime series)?  Has it been stated anywhere that it only covers the content of the Dark Kingdom arc of the manga (equivalent to the first season of the classic anime)?</p>

<p><em>Crystal</em> has covered in a mere 8 episodes the equivalent of 33 episodes of the classic anime series which contained 46 episodes total.  In other words, it has covered 72% of the classic anime's first season content within only 31% of <em>Crystal</em>'s scheduled episode count. I know that <em>Crystal</em> is based on the original manga, that it is <em>not</em> adapting the classic anime, and that the manga storyline progressed much faster (less filler), but even so, that's a big percentage of the manga's Dark Moon arc to have already shown us in only 8 episodes.</p>

"Have Mikage's powers diminished?","<p>At the very beginning of <i>Kamisama Kiss</i>, Mikage gave Nanami spiritual powers and made her the Kami of Mikage shrine, but did he do this without losing any of his own power?

"What does ""Daimadoshi"" mean in ""Dai no Daibouken"" (Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai)?","<p>One of my favorite character in <em>Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai</em> is Pop the Magician. Toward the end of the series, he battles with Hadler's chess squad and has a one-on-one fight with the horse Sigma. Pop demonstrates great magical skills and Sigma asked him if he is a sage. Pop answers that he doesn't like the title of sage and had chosen a title for himself: <strong>Daimadoshi</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What does Daimadoshi mean in the universe of the manga?</strong> </p>

<p>The manga obviously uses a lot of Japanese, even if it is set in a fantasy universe. Does Daimadoshi mean anything in Japanese? Or is it a made-up for the manga?</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: I hesitated before posting this question on Japanese.se, because I am not sure whether daimadoshi is a Japanese word (or made up from Japanese terms like Tenchimato) or a word from the manga's universe.</p>

"What was Avilio's alibi during the after-credits scene in episode 2?","<p>In the after-credits scene of episode 2 of <em>91 Days</em>, Nero questions Avilio about the circumstances of Vanno's death. Crunchyroll translates the dialogue as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AVILIO: He stole Vanno's gun. I shot Serpente, but it was too late.</p>
  
  <p>BARBERO: Your hands weren't tied?</p>
  
  <p>AVILIO: Serpente said he'd let me pray. Then he tied up Vanno...</p>

"Is there a reason Yato couldn't summon Nora in the final battle of the first season of Noragami?","<p>Nora (a.k.a. Furuhime) retains the mark of her past masters who never officially set her free, so shouldn't she still have Yato's mark on her body, allowing him to summon her at any moment?</p>

<p>If he can, is there any good in-universe reason that he didn't summon her during the final battle (in episode 11) in order to disarm Rabo?  Couldn't Yato have summoned Nora, dropped her onto the ground, and then used Sekki (Yukine) to deal with a weaponless Rabo?</p>

<p>Bishamon is able to have multiple shinki summoned into their non-human form at once, so there is no restriction that you can only have 1 shinki in weapon form at a time.  </p>

<p>I assume that once she has been summoned by a god, she cannot be summoned by another god. </p>

<p>Also, while she was in her human form in episode 11, up until Rabo summoned her into his weapon version of her (Reiki), Yato could just as easily have summoned her into his weapon version of her, and if he had done so, Rabo could no longer summon her.</p>

"How does L deduce that Kira needs a name and not just a face?","<p>This is something that I've been wondering about, how does L deduce that Kira needs a name? Surely all the victims he investigated had their name and face, but how can he figure that he needs both? The stunt on tv with Lind L. Tailor only proved that Kira can't kill anyone, and there are certain criteria. I'm not sure how that concludes that he needs both name and face.</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, here's how I look at it. L analyzes all the victims of the Kira killings and noticed that what was broadcast about the criminals was their face and their name. How does he conclude that Kira needs both? Why not just a face? When Kira kills Lind L. Tailor, that only validates that Kira has the ability to kill people, to which L himself even says ""I couldn't believe it until I saw it, but it appears you can kill without being there in person."" When Kira subsequently is unable to kill L, L can then deduce that there are people Kira can't kill. However he concludes Kira needs both name and face, which I don't understand. To me, at that point 3 conclusions are viable: Kira needs a name AND a face. Kira needs just a name. Kira needs just a face.</p>

"How well thought out are the economics in Narutoverse (Konoha and other Ninja Villages)? Has Kishimoto ever explained it?","<p>Naruto uses a currency called the ryō (両).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ryō (両) is the currency used in the Naruto world. It is based on an old Japanese gold coin that was used in Japan before the Meiji period. It was later replaced by the yen. <strong>The exchange rate of a ryō is 10 yen</strong> </p>
  
  <p>(from <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Ry%C5%8D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Ryō</a>)</p>

<p>This means 1 ryo ~ 0.1 USD.</p>

According to <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Missions"" rel=""nofollow"">the wikia</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The reward for a D-rank mission is between five thousand and fifty thousand ryō</li>

  <li>The reward for a B-rank mission is between 150 thousand and 200 thousand ryō.</li>

  <li>The reward for an S-rank mission is more than a million ryō</li>

<p>Visiting <a href=""https://www.at-x.com/program/detail/10750"" rel=""noreferrer"">AT-X's site</a>, however, shows this information:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From what I could understand here from the little knowledge I have of Japanese, 4月11日 would mean April 11 as the start of broadcast, contrary to April 07. The times would be the broadcast schedules on specific days per week and 視聴年齢制限あり seems to be something about age restriction. What's bugging me is the line 'もっとたゆたゆver.' If I understand correctly, it is read as 'motto tayutayu' where 'motto' would mean more. But I can't seem to find anything about what たゆたゆ means. </p>

So the point of the story is whether Raku chooses the ""promised girl"" or his present love? Or I think is should be which of the three promised girls is his true love? So the one Raku's referring to as the ""promise girl"" is which: <b>the girl with the key to the locket</b> or <b>the girl whom he promised to love</b>?</p>

<p>Sorry I think my question sounds a bit confusing but I hope you try to understand it.</p>

"Rem's encounter with Subaru at the end of episode 5","<p>At the end of episode 5, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Why does Rem kill Subaru, despite nothing wrong with relationship between them ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These events unfold starting at minute 22. </p>

<p>At the end of Episode 5, at night, Subaru is sick. He goes out to find help. He is attacked. At 23:35 to 23:40, we hear the sound of an iron weapon (which is likely to be Rem's morningstar). And Subaru is killed with brute force.</p>

<p>However, it is unclear why Rem does that, given that Rem's relationship with Subaru is looking good. They both go to the village and talk. Rem also looks happy then (at 17:29).  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvPt3m.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvPt3m.jpg"" alt=""Rem, happy""></a></p>

<p>I did watch Episode 6, where Subaru is very distant from Rem, and he acts suspiciously, along with having the witch's scent that gets him killed. But does Rem kill Subaru in Episode 5 for the same reason?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edited</strong>: From @ObviouslyJake's answer, I would like to add some more detail comparing the time frame in episodes 5 and 6:
- Similar: Subaru's <strong>witch smell</strong> (which is the main reason, according to @ObviouslyJake)
- Different: the relationship with Rem </p>

<p>Episode 5: They talk and go to the town together. Rem is happy. (As I said above, with an accompanying picture). In this episode, I can feel that Rem and Subaru become friends.</p>

<p>Episode 6: Rem tries to be distant from Subaru. Also, Subaru falls in her garden twice, which she has to fix. In this episode, Rem and Subaru are strangers.  </p>

<p>Does the difference in the relationship between Subaru and Rem contribute to Subaru's death at the end of episode 5, compared to episode 6? Or is the witch's smell the only reason?</p>

<p>Because there are two episodes, with some different choices and paths, I think there must be something <strong>different</strong> here. I feel there has to be, but I can't find it. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit (Aug 31, 2016):</strong> Thanks to @Davies comment and @ObviouslyJake, here is what I have in my head so far: in episode 6, things are worse than in episode 5. Here, we're talking about why Rem kills Subaru in episode 5, despite them having a good relationship.</p>

<p>My theory is that Rem has a dual personality: Rem the maid, and Rem the oni who hates the Witch. </p>

<p>In episode 5, Subaru has a good relationship with Rem the maid. As a result of having a good relationship with Rem the maid: <br>
- Rem smiles at 17:29 (picture above) <br>
- Rem gets Emilia to teach Subaru in the evening. (Episode 5, 17:57) <br></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qHdcm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qHdcm.jpg"" alt=""Emilia-sama""></a></p>

<p>However, Rem the oni still hates the Witch, which leads to Rem killing Subaru because of his Witch smell.</p>

<p>Therefore, here is a summary: Rem will try to kill Subaru because of the Witch smell unless the following condition is satisfied: </p>

<ul>
<li>Rem is dead (nothing to say, I suppose...)</li>
</ul>

<p>or </p>

<ul>
<li>Rem the Oni is freed from the tragedy of her childhood. </li>
</ul>

<p>(Spoilers for episode 18 follow) </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The second condition is satisfied when Subaru saves Rem from the demon beast in the forest in episode 11. The proof is in episode 18, from 20:00 to 21:00, where Rem confirms that.<br>

"Why is the series called ""Amaama to Inazuma""?","<p>The English title of the series <em>Sweetness and Lightning</em> is a pun on the idiom ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness_and_light"">sweetness and light</a>"". </p>

<p>The original Japanese title is <em>Amaama to Inazuma</em> (甘々と稲妻). I wanted to find out if there was a similar pun behind the Japanese title, so I started by looking up the words and was surprised to find that it's basically a literal translation of the English title: <em>amaama</em> <a href=""http://www.japandict.com/%E7%94%98%E3%80%85"">means ""sweet"" or ""sugary""</a> and is the character 甘 (sweet) repeated, and <em>inazuma</em> <a href=""http://www.japandict.com/%E7%A8%B2%E5%A6%BB"">means ""lightning""</a>.</p>

<p>Without some kind of pun or joke behind it similar to the one in English, the Japanese title seems like sort of a strange combination of words to hit upon. It's such a direct equivalent to the English title that it almost looks like the English title was conceived of first and then translated back into Japanese, but that doesn't make sense because if the original author Gido Amagakure had come up with the English title, that would probably just be the title, since so many anime are named in English already. </p>

<p>I'm curious if there are any linguistic reasons to pick the Japanese title. I'm not asking for thematic reasons; the title is thematically appropriate in both languages, even without the pun. I'm asking why there was such a suitable pun in the English version that apparently didn't exist in the Japanese title, and whether the Japanese version also contains some pun or reference that I've missed. Was the fact that it translates so well into English just a massive coincidence? Is there something more to the Japanese title that I'm not seeing?</p>

<li><p>At the <strong>start</strong> of Dragon Ball GT, Goku was turned into a kid by Ultimate Shenron when Pilaf accidentally said ""I wish you were a kid again!"" after stating Goku became way too powerful and he doesn't stand a chance against him now,  but would if he were to be a kid again. (wish granted, goku turns back into a kid)</p></li>
<li><p>During his fight with Baby, Goku turned <strong>SSJ4</strong> and with it, became so strong that the magic of Ultimate Shenron could not affect him anymore. <em>This was stated in the anime.</em> He was too powerful for Shenron's magic to affect him.</p>

<ul>
<li>After turning back into his base form, <em>he became a kid again</em>. He didn't go back to being an adult. So Ultimate Shenron's magic reasserted itself when he was no longer SSJ4.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At the very <strong>end</strong> of GT, we see the future. We see Pan being a very old lady, and a mini-goku and mini-vegeta fighting in the World Martial Arts Tournament. The mini-Goku was implied to be Pan's grandchild. Since we don't see them, we can assume that all of the Z fighters have passed away from old age. Goku is now walking around the tournament grounds, all grown up again in his base form, still having his tail (proving the wish wasn't reversed, because then his tail would have been gone) just before the end-credits come into play.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p><strong>If the Goku we see at the end turned SSJ4, would he get old and die?</strong></p>

<p>If Goku hadn't become a child and grown up again because of Ultimate Shenron's magic, he presumably would be dead of old age by the time of the finale just like everyone else is. But as we saw before, if he turns SSJ4, Ultimate Shenron's magic wears off and doesn't affect him anymore. So is Ultimate Shenron's magic the only thing keeping him alive? Without it, would he become old and die like he would have if it had never affected him in the first place?</p>

<p>Why is anime/manga not as critically analyzed by the general public, like other works of written/illustrated art are? There are a lot of different forums that review anime and many people on the internet who have their opinions on different shows, but why is it not recognized by the <em>general American public</em> like other literary works? Is it its age (it is still popular, and therefore not old enough to be considered a classic)? Is the fact that it is seen as a <em>cartoon</em> by many in the US? Is it due to negative stereotypes in the west surrounding anime (many may consider all anime to be hentai, for example, and therefore disregard it as an art form)?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> To explain this more...many, many anime have underlying themes and meanings that stretch sometimes deeper than current novels/books that are considered literary classics by the academic community.

<p>As I've been watching Berserk, I've noticed that I enjoy two aspects of the show. I love how gory and action-driven the show is (the fight scenes are awesome), but I also enjoy the deeper meanings that the show portrays with its character development and plot. For example, I like the general coming-of-age style of Guts' narrative, and I have noticed other religious motifs throughout the show.</p>

<p>However, I haven't been able to explicitly ""nail down"" the big themes. I was wondering if anyone could extract the most prevalent themes from the show and help explain them to me (similar to critical analysis in a college-level literacy class). What are the deeper meanings in Berserk? Does it have to do with religion? Friendship? Loss? Life purpose and direction? Is it commenting on history and war?</p>

"Why do we hear ""English"" speech in Philadelphia in episode 3?","<p>In episode 1 of <em>Time Travel Shoujo</em>, it is established that Mari can communicate freely with local folk when she travels back in time. For example, when she travels back to 1600 and meets William Gilbert, she perceives Gilbert's speech as being in Japanese, and Gilbert perceives her speech as being in English. The audio itself is fully in Japanese during Mari's sojourn in Gilbert's time.</p>

<p>However, in episode 3, something curious happens. Mari has been sent back to the year 1752 and meets Benjamin Franklin. Again, she is able to understand him and vice versa. At around 14:37, though, we hear two background characters say the following in <em>English</em> audio:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GIRL: Rain, rain, go away! Come again on Saturday!</p>
  
  <p>WOMAN: Good, Laura!</p>
  
  <p>GIRL: Thank you very much!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear, what I mean is that the viewer hears roughly 「レイン、レイン、ゴーア　ウェイ。　カム　アゲイン　オン　サターデイ。」 and so forth - the voice actor for the girl has a strong Japanese accent, but she's very clearly saying English words (ones that aren't loans into Japanese, in particular).</p>

<p>Now, why is that? Is there some sort of plot-related reason why Mari's ""babel fish"" didn't work on these two background characters?

"How can I check that a given anime is really over?","<p>I have been frustrated recently when I watch the last existing episode of a given anime only to find out that the story is not over yet, and I will have to wait for another season (and who knows when that would be). Examples:</p>

<li><em>Ao no Exorcist</em></li>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Status: Finished Airing</li>
  <li>No other anime listed as ""sequel""</li>

<p>I went to watch it, thinking it would be a full story in those 12 episodes, but guess what? The story is not over at all. Now here I am waiting for another season, that I don't even know when will come, if at all...</p>

<p>I know that whether a next season will be produced or not can't be predicted. The producers might decide it's not worth it for whatever reason. But some animes simply frustratingly end <strong>in the middle of the story</strong>. I was hoping that there was a place I could search for this information (if the anime is currently completed or ""paused/canceled"" in the middle of it). For example, I wouldn't have watched <em>No Game No Life</em> if I knew beforehand it was like that.</p>

<p>Since MAL's status of ""Status: Finished Airing"" is not what I want, <strong>how can I check that an anime is really over?</strong></p>

<p>Notes: for my purposes, animes like <em>Code Geass</em> and <em>Steins;Gate</em> are to be considered complete, even though both of them have a new season coming, the already existing story is 100% complete (of course I only know this because I already watched them).</p>

"Is Holo different from other nonhumans?","<p>It seems to me that the introduction of nonhumans who aren't wolves introduced a break from the initial premise, and additionally it seems that all other nonhumans don't clearly have all of the attributes Holo and Myuri have, so I'd like some clarification.</p>

<p>From the initial story, Holo claimed to be a wolf, and she seemed to indicate kinship with other wolves. To be clear, she identifies mainly as a wolf, not a human, and her human form is treated as a guise. My understanding of this initially was that it indicated all wolves in this world were at human level intelligence, or at least smarter than normal animals, and might have the potential to take human forms. However, this assumption was probably wrong since there are shown to be avatars of birds, sheep, etc. </p>

<p>With regard to these other nonhumans, there seem to be differences to Holo. Firstly, Holo has the attribute of living in and having power over wheat (also, she is required to eat it to transform back into a wolf). I don't recall other nonhumans having any similar trait disclosed. Secondly, I haven't seen in the others the aforementioned kinship that Holo has for wolves. Our two sheep, for instance, are quite disrespectful to regular sheep. In volume 10 of <em>Spice and Wolf</em>, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> we learn that the golden sheep has been eating sheep in order to fit
 in to human society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then in volume 3 of <em>Wolf and Parchment</em>, after offering to buy mutton for Myuri and Col, on page 188 Ilenia goes on to explain, ""They look like kin, but in the end we're very different."" These two, and Ilenia definitively, don't seem to view the regular sheep as their kin. In contrast to Holo, they don't seem to identify themselves as sheep (though they also don't identify as human).</p>

<p>Holo's attitude couldn't be any more different from these two sheep. In fact, on page 168 of volume 10 of <em>Spice and Wolf</em>, she throws up after learning that the golden sheep has been eating sheep.</p>

<p>Another point of note, the new <em>Spice and Wolf: Spring Log</em> books have introduced two new wolves: Selim and her brother Aram. What is the significance of these two being able to hide their ears and tails in their human transformations when Holo cannot? Is there a difference between these two and Holo or are they all the same kind of ""wolf""?</p>

<p>So, for clarification, is Holo the same kind of entity as the rest of these nonhumans? Do these other nonhumans have powers over things like wheat but they keep their affinity secret, or do they lack these traits? Is the kinship Holo feels for the wolves merely a difference in attitude or does it indicate that she is a different kind of being?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>or were these scenes originally made just for the anime version?</p>

<hr>

<p>The reason why I think about this is that there is a scene in <em>No Game No Life</em> that matches between the anime and light novel like below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>""I refuse!"" Blurting out these words caused her eyes to widen in response.</strong></p>
  
  <p>""Could you...... tell me your reason?"" </p>
  
  <p>""Hehe, that's because....."" Sora hugged his little sister who was watching with an expression that could not be discerned.</p>
  
  <p>""One of our most favoritethings for 『 』 is—""</p>
  
  <p><strong>""Standing in a position where the opponent has an advantage and denying it with a 'NO' !""</strong></p>
  
  <p>Shiro combined together. Originally unclear of the plot, Steph and Kurami could not arrange this reasoning properly. Only looking at the excited siblings while feeling stunned.</p>
  
  <p><strong>""Wahaha! 'I always wanted to try and say the number four lines[19] ' —and I really said it out!""</strong></p>
  
  <p>"".......Nii, nice, good job.""</p>

<p>Let me give you an example:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Alucard's awesome pistol ""The Jackal"" symbolizes Walter's future betrayal of Alucard because, in the Fred Forsyth book ""The Day of The Jackal"", the character The Jackal kills everyone who helped him make his forged documents and weapon as a way of covering his tracks as he tries to kill Charles De Gaulle. In the dream sequence where this motif is introduced, The Jackal comments, ""Never trust the man who makes your own weapon,"" which foreshadows Walter's betrayal.</p>

"How were the culprits ""dragged to their death""?","<p>After a student is found guilty, the next scene if of them being tied up or trapped in a new room before dying an ""interesting"" death.</p>

"Need help identifying this manga- large guy helps out schoolgirl","<p>I remember reading a fairly new manga a while back where the main protagonist is a large guy on the wrestling team, who is actually really sweet and doesn't like to see girls get hurt. He rescues a girl from being groped on the subway (I'm pretty sure this is what happened), and she bakes him cookies and wants to be friends. He likes her, but assumes she actually is interested in his popular friend (who always rejects girls) and keeps inviting him along when she asks to hang out. It seems like the girl actually did like the main guy and not the good-looking friend, but he doesn't realize. </p>

"Is there a huge difference in the amount of male vs. female protagonists in anime and manga?","<p>I'm wondering if there's an imbalance in Japanese society as there is in American society. Or if anyone has come across a survey that found the percent of female vs. male protagonists in anime and manga?</p>

<p>I think the main difference in anime and manga is that the Japanese have created genres to meet the interests of those who consume anime and manga (which if I'm not mistaken, is a far larger amount than Americans who consume comics and cartoons). For boys, they have shounen, and for girls, shoujo. For more matured tastes we have seinen and josei (which could arguably still be divided into men and women). In shounen, the protagonist is predominantly male, and in shoujo, the protagonist is usually female. Should I instead be looking at which genre is produced more for my answer?</p>

"Why are some hissatsu techniques in Inazuma Eleven never used again?","<p>I'm not sure whether anyone around has watched and followed Inazuma Eleven enough to be able to answer this... but here goes!</p>

<p>A brief description: Hissatsu techniques are special techniques in the anime which enables the users to do some powerful moves, including goal keeper techniques, defense, offense and shoots.</p>

<p>Now, I noticed that there are some hissatsu techniques which aren't used again, especially those used in the movies of the anime:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Maximum_Fire"" rel=""nofollow"">Maximum fire</a> used by <a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Gouenji"" rel=""nofollow"">Gouenji Shuuya</a> in the movie <a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Inazuma_Eleven_the_Movie:_The_Invasion_of_the_Strongest_Army_Ogre"" rel=""nofollow"">Gekijyouban Inazuma Eleven Saikyou Gundan Ogre</a> hasn't been used anywhere else in the anime.</li>

Ironically enough, the episodes immediately following it have Endou looking for a stronger hissatsu technique than his current strongest at that point in time (I hope this make sense ^^)</li>
<li><a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Joker_Rains"" rel=""nofollow"">Joker Rains</a> used in the next movie, <a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Inazuma_Eleven_GO_the_Movie:_The_Ultimate_Bonds_Gryphon"" rel=""nofollow"">Kyuukyoku no Kizuna Gryphon</a> by <a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Shindou_Takuto"" rel=""nofollow"">Shindou Takuto</a> and <a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Tsurugi_Kyousuke"" rel=""nofollow"">Tsurugi Kyousuke</a> is similar and isn't used again. Well, that one could be explained if they say they didn't want to use it again.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Is it just me or are the movies like... completely separate from the anime series? Why are hissatsu techniques exclusively used in movies never used again?</strong> If so, then there's something even stranger:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Matsukaze_Tenma"" rel=""nofollow"">Matsukaze Tenma</a> met <a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/Shuu"" rel=""nofollow"">Shuu</a> the first and only time in the second movie, but knows him when he sees him again in episode 8 of Inazuma Eleven Go: Chrono Stone.</li>
<li>All those who went to <a href=""http://inazuma-eleven.wikia.com/wiki/God_Eden"" rel=""nofollow"">God Eden</a> in the movie also know about this place back in the series.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's about the things I managed to notice, there might be more I didn't. The only thing I can think about is that the first movie alone is like a side/parallel storyline, or an alternative ending to the series, while the second movie is more like an actual event that happened but not much spoken of in the series, which I find really strange.</p>

"How is anime as a whole profitable? (If it is)","<p>I'm considering the following facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Japanese people have few spare time, with their jobs taking a lot of their time usually, even kids or teenagers have intense schedules.</li>
<li>There are lots of anime series each year, we can easily expect at least 100  series with maybe an average of 20 chapters per each series.</li>
<li>Most anime don't get out of Japan, even if we consider either worldwide legal or illegal services that offer anime, what is seen most are the most well-known series.</li>
<li>Anime is not cheap to produce, we can consider that each anime episode is about 120000 US dollars.</li>
<li>Anime is pretty time consuming to watch in general.</li>
</ol>

<p>(I'm making up the previous quantities but I don't think I'm that far from the real ones).</p>

<p>With these facts I wonder how it's profitable in general as my guess is that with those conditions most series would not cover their costs, so it looks somehow strange that people are willing to spend much in something that's hardly going to be profitable (although if the anime is successful and moreover, exported worldwide, it can be truly profitable, that's true, maybe it's just that with their big hits they cover all the rest of the unsuccessful series).</p>

<p>I thought that maybe it was subsidized by the government but with an internet search it looks like this doesn't happen often.</p>

<p>What is missing or faulty in my reasoning, or is anime really profitable? Maybe it's what I've said earlier that their successful series cover the costs of the unsuccessful series?</p>

<p>On the other hand, could it be that it's not usually profitable but they still try to do it just because anime is so big in Japan and they love it?</p>

<p>But that doesn't explain why she has to lie about her being good at cooking and her allergy to dust. If she were to hide her identity, she need not lie about the cooking and the allergies. Conan wouldn't be able to find out even if he knew that she was from Osaka since it was his first time meeting Heiji's mother.</p>

<p>Why did she have to go that far? Or was it part of her test for Mouri to figure out her real identity?</p>

<p>Even if it's the case, I bet no one's going to be able to deduce that she is Heiji's mother because first, it's impossible to even know the true identity of a person just by knowing her hobbies or skills. Unless she has a distinctive quality in which the Hattori's are famous for.</p>

<p>Second, Conan did not even know a thing about Heiji's mom. The test was actually for Shinichi but since he wasn't there, she tried Mouri instead. No matter how good Conan's deductions were, it was impossible for him to expose her real identity as Heiji's mom and her real intentions. They were even surprised when she revealed her true identity as Heiji's mom since Heiji didn't even look like her.</p>

<p>After googling around a bit, I noticed that this work is a clear parody of a work with a homophonous title ― <em>Hoshi no Hitomi no Silhouette</em> (""Silhouettes of the Eyes of the Stars""), published 1985-89. The author of the fictional work is ""Kaede Akane"", whose name means ""Maple-tree Red"", while the real work is by Hiiragi Aoi, which can be read as meaning ""Holly-plant Blue"". I point this out to emphasize that this is clearly an allusion of sorts. </p>

<p>Mayura describes this manga as a ""bible of romance"", supposedly read by four million girls, and shows us these archetypical shoujo-romance scenes from the manga:</p>

<p>But the Junker <em>isn't</em> the first person since the war to see her, is he? There's a flashback in episode 1 where we see some old guy telling the Junker about how met ""a robot"" who I think it is safe to say was Yumemi.

"Censorship in Japan","<p>This question is purely out of curiousity and based on some ecchi/borderline hentai shows. </p>

<p>As a fact we know that plenty of japanese content gets cencored in japan, but why is this applied to adult content? Such as a hentai manga. Once someone purchases it the final goal of the user is pretty straightforward. A minor won't be able to purchase one due to their strict laws and such. </p>

<p>So with this in mind it is pretty straight forward that your audience are adults. How come that the content still gets cencored? Some apply stripes, other apply pixelated art while others completely cencor certain parts of a body. </p>

<p>I have seen this applied to both manga and anime. The only shows and manga that didn't have any cencorship were unofficial stuff; essentially fan-art. </p>

<p>Is there a law in japan against nudity overall that prevents studios and official sources from implementing full nudity? </p>

<p>I don't require samples on full nudity anime/manga if there are any. I do wish those that answer to keep it as polite as possible so that if any youngster around us might read this it won't be against a law or the rules and regulations of this website.</p>

<p>I am simply curious about why this practise is implemented by (from what I know, not a fact) every studio out there in japan. Perhaps it is to make the show able to be aired on tv? I don't know.</p>

<p><em>This doesn't only apply to manga and anime but can also be applied to actual movies in Japan. In America cartoons haven't reached the level of 18+ due to nudity and explicit material, but plenty of shows have such as Spartacus and Game of Thrones (as examples) have.

"Why was it so easy to defeat Toneri, Kinshiki and Momoshiki?","<p>Toneri had somewhat the same Goal as Madara. Madara gained Hagoromo's Power and Toneri, Hamura's. The both powers are, I believe equivalent.</p>

<p>He who awakens the Rinnegan, shall receive the Powers of Hagoromo and he who awakens the Tenseigan shall receive the Powers of Hamura. Which is exactly what happened. BUT... Toneri had the Power of Hamura, who has the equivalent Power as Hagoromo... Then, how was Naruto able to finish Toneri's Tenseigan (and the Powers of Hamura) away with one blow?? + just in Nine Tails Mode, without his Six Paths Powers.. It just doesn't add up.</p>

<p>Kinshiki and Momoshiki are <strong>very</strong> powerful beings... Momoshiki even has 3 Rinnegan (One in his Forehead, and one in each palm) and has also the equivalent, if not greater Power to those of Kaguya.... how the hell was he defeated by only Boruto (a child)? While it took <strong>Naruto &amp; Sasuke</strong> to seal away (not defeat) Kaguya and they both had the Six Paths Powers, while Boruto had none whatsoever.</p>

"How did the ""silver devaluation"" scheme work?","<p>I need help understanding what is going on with the Trenni silver coin scheme plot that is mentioned throughout episodes 3-7 of <em>Spice and Wolf</em> season 1. Let me explain what I understand and hopefully get some clarity about these <em>Spice and Wolf</em> episode plots <strong>(also if someone can block out the impending spoilers that would be awesome, I don't know how to do it)</strong></p>

<p>So our main protagonist Lawrence gets word that the Trenni silver coin currency is about to go up in its silver purity. This means that both the actual metal value of the Trenni silver coin and its representative value will go up. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> This all turns out to be wrong though, as Lawrence finds out the Trenni silver coins are actually becoming less pure and going down in value and what he was told was a lie. This plot then leads Lawrence to go over to the Milone trading company where somehow he hopes to make a profit off of telling the company this info.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this is where it gets complicated. How was the Milone trading company going to make money off of the devaluing currency and how was Medio involved with this?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the anime the Milone Trading company, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> upon hearing the devaluing silver info from Lawrence, started stockpiling Trenni silver coins. Why are they trying to stockpile the silver coins if their price and purity is going down? Shouldn't they be trying to get rid of all of their Trenni silver coins if the value is decreasing?  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Also it is mentioned that the Medio trading company is </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> hiring people to give merchants the wrong info about how the Trenni silver coins are going up in value instead of actually going down. Lawrence was even told this lie. How does the Medio Trading company possibly gain any advantage from this? </p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I am asking what is the economic plot in the episodes 3-7 of Spice and Wolf season 1, explained in little kid terms, so I can hopefully comprehend what is going on in the story and enjoy the anime even more. I am sorry for not being more economics-savvy with this, but if you understand the plot be much appreciated for some insight.</p>

"Why did Father create his ""children"" as the 7 deadly sins?","<p>In both the manga and the 2nd anime (FMA Brotherhood) homunculi are willingly created. As far as I understand it, Father was created (or rather summoned from the other side of the door?) back at Xerxis before using the entire city to create a powerful philosopher's stone for himself and van Hohenheim.</p>

<p>Some time passed by and father started creating other homunculi, each named after and behaving according to a deadly sin. They are fueled by parts of Father's stone and are powerful subordinates, but neither Greed nor Sloth nor Gluttony use their power to any mentionable extent for Father's benefit.</p>

<p>It is commented by van Hohenheim (and apparently the commonly excepted ""truth"" as seen in <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/a/4397/33164"">this post</a>) that Father wanted to get rid of these ""human"" weaknesses. But that obviously didn't work: He still is immensely proud, so he sits alone in the center of the state, never standing up, making subordinates and machines do everything for him, thinking of himself as the best and most powerful being on earth and working towards becoming a ""perfect being""; He is greedy, so even though he has a powerful philosopher's stone and can create others from criminals and war casualties, he creates a stone way stronger than his old one has ever been and uses its power to enslave god and steal his/her/their/its power.</p>

<p>And he would have been successful if his underlings had used their powers to their whole extent instead of being too lazy, dumb, or greedy to do so. Van Hohenheim barely completed the inversion circle in time, and with faster digging at Sloth's end and Greed/ Gluttony going on a rampage to enforce the needed bloodshed, Father would have won. (Sure he still needed the sacrifices but as we see in the show, he can somehow make someone a sacrifice by force or he could have just ordered state alchemists to do things that made them become sacrifices. And that's not even the point.)</p>

<p>Is there another reason that I overlooked in the anime or that has been given in the manga why he created his ""children"" the way he did? Or a reference on why the plan of getting rid of these character flaws did actually work but just not entirely?</p>

"Are Hollows defeated by humans who are not Quincies considered as destroyed or ""purified""?","<p>If I remember correctly, Shinigami are ""purifying"" Hollows with Zanpakuto, cleansing souls and sending them to Soul Society (not counting cases when souls are going to Hell). And regarding Quincy, it was said that the main conflict between Quincies and Shinigami was that, unlike Shinigami, Quincies were destroying souls when killing Hollows, which was bad for balance.</p>

<p>In series, it was shown numerous times that Hollows can also be defeated by humans having certain abilities, for example, Yasutora Sado, Orihime Inoue, Hanakari Jinta, etc. So, what happens with Hollow soul in this case? Is it exorcised, or destroyed, just like by Quincy hand?</p>

  <p> In the <em>Prisma Illya</em> anime, the fact that Miyu's brother is (Miyuverse) Shirou becomes obvious fairly early on. The scene early on in the first season (""1in""?) where Miyu mentions that Illyaverse Shirou reminds her of her brother already points strongly in that direction, as do the short still-frames of him we see in Miyu's memories during <em>2wei Herz</em>.<br>

 Early in <em>3rei</em>, Illya and Gil meet Miyu's brother, and though we don't get a clear visual on him, we hear Sugiyama Noriaki speak - that settles it for anyone who had any doubt.<br>

 However, I have heard that manga-readers weren't 100% sure about the identity of Miyu's brother until he shows up to fight the Ainsworths and utters ""Trace On"".

<li><p><strong>What is the chronological list of characters of the <em>Naruto</em> universe who contributed to his Rasengan (with irrefutable evidence)?</strong> </p></li>

"Was Shadorian Civilization technologically advanced?","<p>This question pertains to One Piece.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> I know that Skypians, Birkans, and Shandorians came from the moon. But they should've been technologically advanced right? But Shandorians like Calgara seem to be a small tribe with zero knowledge of poneglyphs etc. Also, they seem to believe in rituals/superstition etc even though they were once an advanced civilization that lived on the moon. Also, they seem way too backward in terms of science and technology. How did that happen? </p>

<p>Also if that's true, then are Poneglyphs a way to find out the story about earth or moon?</p>

[Citation needed] </p>

<p>What does Satella tell Subaru as he spams declarations of his ability? I was wondering if she generally says the same thing each time (so removing the case when Subaru took Betelgeuse along for the ride), if it was intentionally muted in the anime in previous instances. Does the LN/WN have her silently whisper?</p>

"How did Madara really obtain his Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan?","<p>Regarding Madara's Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, there are three canon stories on how he obtained it.</p>

<p>The first version is mentioned by Itachi, while explaining the Mangekyou to Sasuke. In this version, he tells that Madara took his brother's eyes. Itachi shows the scene to Sasuke through Genjutsu, where Madara places his fingers over Izuna's eye and Izuna is surprised by the action. This would mean a forceful extraction.</p>

<p>The second version is told by Obito, acting as Madara. He explains to Sasuke that Izuna willingly gave his eyes to him (Madara), to protect the clan from the dangers of the fame.</p>

<p>The third version is told by the First Hokage, Hashirama Senju, when he was reincarnated by Orochimaru. He tells that Izuna succumbed to the wounds (during the warring period) caused by Tobirama Senju. And it is assumed that Madara took his brother's eyes after he died.</p>

When the first Hakuryuu, Seryuu, and Rokuryuu left Hiryu Castle, they left with their tribes and only in those tribes would the next dragons be born. </p>

"Inconsistency with regard to an event in the Resurrection of Freiza Arc and the Future Trunks arc","<p>During the ROF arc, we see Gohan powering up to his maximum (to an extent capable of almost of destroying himself), to allow Goku to detect his energy and use the instant transmission and get back from Beerus's world.</p>

<p>In episode 47 right before the Future Trunks arc, while Goku and Picollo are picking lettuce off the field, when Goku tries to go to Beerus's world, we see him not being able to detect Vegeta's energy until he turns SSJB. Him not being able to the first time, when he found out that Vegeta had gone off training on his own makes sense because Vegeta had gotten a lot stronger and it was stated that his ki was completely different. This time around, it didn't. It's obvious base Vegeta was a lot stronger than what Gohan powered up to during the ROF arc.</p>

<p>To top it all off, once Bulma contacts Vegeta and Goku regarding Future Trunks, we see Kid Trunks turning SSJ and barely powering up which was sufficient for Goku to find. Kid Trunks wasn't obviously stronger than Gohan or powered up to the extent Gohan did during the ROF arc. Which again doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>Many might argue that this is because Goku is now used to travelling to and fro and he wasn't then but you have to realise that instant transmission has nothing to do with being familiar with the place. It has to do more with detecting ki.</p>

<p>Later, after Ed's disappearance into the alternate universe, we also see Wrath fitted with automail that was intended for Ed. According the <a href=""http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Wrath_(2003_anime)"" rel=""nofollow"">wiki</a>, this happens after Dante forces the removal of the limbs.</p>

<p>Why did Wrath ""need"" or ""want"" the limbs in the first place? If I'm not mistaken:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There wasn't any note of the child Wrath was created from having deformities, which suggests that Wrath had his ""original"" limbs that didn't come from Ed.</p></li>
<li><p>This suggests that Wrath might have wanted Ed's limbs for some other purpose (e.g. wanting them in themselves, wanting to be able to perform alchemy), but I don't remember if this was explicitly stated anywhere.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Could someone shed any light on this, and perhaps provide an episode I could refer to and rewatch?</p>

"Does Luffy touch his enemies in Gear Second?","<p>Though it was apparently obvious in some cases, Luffy's fight with Magellan made me a bit skeptical.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At the initial punch (Jet Pistol) Luffy touched the venomous body of Magellan, causing him extreme pain.</p></li>
<li><p>In a later scene of the same fight, he used Jet Pistol to overcome his Hydra, but no sign of touching was shown.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, in numerous cases, the way G2 works is ambiguous - some scenes imply that the pure speed even without touch creates an air pressure ""sphere"" that nevertheless causes huge injury when hits the target. Examples were seen in case of Blueno and much later, Doflamingo.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when he defeated Lucci, it was clearly shown that he actually punches him, and in several other cases it's often visible.</p>

<p>Which one is right? Or is itt possible that Luffy combines both?</p>

Why doesn't she do the same in the main anime (episode 24)? In that anime episode, she doesn't do or say anything to help Saber (whereas with Archer she begs him and cries when he doesn't accept). What can possibly make Rin change her mind in the OVA? (I haven't read the visual novel and don't intend to, so feel free to talk about it if it gives relevant info related to Rin.)</p>

<p>Also, does Rin try to save Archer in the OVA? (We don't see what happens but since she already saves Saber and she would consume most of her prana, asking Archer would be very selfish (poor Saber) so she shouldn't ask Archer.

  <p>King Arthur was made into the incarnation of a dragon by Merlin by infusing her with the blood of a dragon, and one is shown in Realta Nua as a representation of her Magic Circuits and is visible standing near her Magic Core.</p>

<p>However, it seems that Saber is <a href=""http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Saber_%28Fate/stay_night%29#Personality"" rel=""nofollow"">linked more to lions than dragons</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though she once felt more linked to dragons, she came to enjoy lions after taking care of a lion cub for a month at some point in her life. She claims that it is not that she ""likes"" them, but rather the happiness she experienced as he became attached to her brought forth a bond with them. He was very energetic, often biting or scratching, but she wished to be able to stay with him until the end. She has had feelings for them since then, and even remembers the fond memories while holding a stuffed lion. Shirou seeing the memory of her rubbing her cheek against the lion comments on it being a time where she looks like a girl her age.</p>

"Has there ever been official pornographic media for an anime and/or manga series?","<p>I've been wondering about this for a while now. With how perverted some anime and manga are without ever crossing into pornographic content territory, were there ever any anime or manga with <strong>official</strong> pornographic media? Example: a little spinoff series of sorts of a regular anime/manga, with one or two episodes focusing on characters bumping uglies mostly. Bonus points if those ""interactions"" are officially canon.</p>

<p>Obviously, I'm not talking about something like Dragon Ball or Pokémon. That's just weird. I'm talking about anime and manga that are already adult oriented, which already have some light sexual elements or sexual overtones, where it would make sense for official pornographic content to exist.</p>

<p>I wouldn't be surprised if some companies already tried to squeeze some extra bucks from the more fanatic and perverted parts of the fanbase, while those uninterested in the content never have to see it if they don't want to.</p>

"Why does Tomoko refer to My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic as an anime?","<p>This question regards the official English translation done by Yen Press. According to the copyright page, the translators are Krista Shipley and Karie Shipley.</p>

<h2>Long Version</h2>

<p>At the beginning of volume 7 (Fail 56), Tomoko is late to school because she got stuck watching <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>, a western animation. However, she refers to this show as an anime. Like an idiot, I got really hung up trying to figure out what the reasoning and implications were for using this terminology. </p>

<p>The quote from the manga is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I randomly turned on the TV this morning, there was this anime showing... And I just ended up watching to the end, so...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, why did the English translator choose to use the term anime here, which in English is only used to refer to Japanese animation, rather than something more accurate? I've thought of several possibilities, but have no way to determine which, if any, is right.</p>

<p>If I'm not mistaken, in Japan the word anime is used to refer to any sort of animation, with no distinction for its country of origin. So the translator may have chosen the term to convey that in Tomoko's mind there isn't a real distinction for foreign cartoons. But the translator did make this decision to use this term in the English adaptation, where anime has a different meaning, so alternatively it is also possible they're trying to convey that Tomoko isn't aware the show is not made in Japan.</p>

<p>Another reason could be for style. Tomoko talks about anime and manga a lot, so it might be a little unusual for her to use a more accurate term here, such as ""cartoon"" or ""animation"".</p>

<p>The translator's note at the end doesn't offer much insight onto the matter, though does seem to imply that the translator knows the show is a western animation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The show Tomoko is watching is Hasbro's <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em>, in which Rainbow Dash is a main character. Rainbow Dash's Japanese voice actress is Izumi Kitta, who also voices Tomoko in the <em>WataMote</em> anime series.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Short Version</h2>

<p>Is there any way to determine whether the translator's choice to use the term ""anime"" to refer to <em>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em> is a mistake or a deliberate choice to be accurate to Tomoko's character and/or Japanese culture?</p>

"What is the source of superpowers in the One-Punch Man universe?","<p>Is it ever explained why some humans develop superpowers in the One-Punch Man universe?  I'm not just talking about Saitama, I'm talking about the other heroes and martial artists.  No one seems to think it's unusual that there are people who can lift up huge boulders (Tank Top Master), move faster than the eye can see (Flashy Flash), or smash through thick concrete prison walls (Pri Pri Prisoner).  Such people are just ""strong"" or have ""trained"". And then you have the esper sisters and the occasional oddball like Green.  </p>

<p>It is implied that the Hero Association physical test looks for enhanced physical characteristics, although it's not explicitly stated as such. The series doesn't seem to want to confirm or deny that C-, B-, and A-Class heroes are actually super-powered, although there is evidence that they all must be, at least in terms of how super-powers are defined in Western comic books, i.e., physical abilities greater than a human could naturally have.  </p>

<p>Is it a manga trope that people can naturally develop powers, or is there a hint as to why some people in this universe develop powers?  </p>

<p>As you can see, there's a tie for fourth between Marui and Ibusaki. It was mentioned in episode 23 that if there were to be a tie that affects who passes the preliminaries, the judges would vote to determine who passes and who doesn't.</p>

<p>So I figure they must have voted on whether Marui or Ibusaki would be the fourth contestant from block A - but which one of them won the vote? During the after-party, Yoshino mentions that Ibusaki was probably sulking in his room, so I guess maybe Marui won? But nobody seemed to explicitly acknowledge that Marui had made it through, so I'm a bit confused.</p>

   <br />
  Conditions: <br />
  Use up all the Command Seals, and let the Servant finish himself.</p>

<p>Now I've only seen up to Episode 10 but from how this reads it seems to have been in place before even the first fight between Saber and Lancer since by episode 10</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri is Lancer's Master and probably doesn't care about Kayneth since she loves Lancer</p>

<p>However, Kiritsugu had tried to kill Kayneth on more than one occasion and there seems to be nothing that tries to stop him from breaking this Geis. in Fate/Stay Night in one of Heaven's Feel's bad endings, it's shown what happens when Shirou goes against the Geis he forms with Rin</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Once he plans on going against Rin's wishes of killing Sakura Matou, he finds that he cannot move his body at all to stop her. He is immediately freed upon Sakura's death, as there is no longer any reason to bind him.</p>

<p>and in Cú Chulainn's legend, his demise was caused when he was put in a situation where he had to break a Geis</p>

<ul>
<li>Never refuse a meal offered by a woman</li>
<li>Never eat dog meat</li>
</ul>

<p>He was offered a meal of dog meat by a woman and as such he had to break one Geis.</p>

<p>So while I may be jumping the gun here and asking this before watching the entire series, where does this Geis with Kiritsugu and Kayneth appear? If it was before the first fight between Saber and Lancer, how come there was nothing enforcing the Geis as there was with Shirou?</p>

"Does Sidonia no Kishi's 256 frame formation have scientific advantages?","<p>In episode five or six of Sidonia no Kishi, Tanikaze and Shizuka were rescued by their fellow knights against orders of the captain. The rescuers adopted a 256 Gardes formation traveling to and from the protagonist's location. Is the scientific reason behind this peculiar formation explained anywhere in the series (because I can't recall)? </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pPR6s.jpg"" alt=""256 - knight formation later in the series""></p>

<p>Their formation was a perfect circle when they traveled to Tanikaze's location but was uneven as they carried his frame, hence balance might be out of the answer. This formation was also used later in the series when they were going to attack the massive Gauna (as the picture shows). They used all 256 for the formation but still, the mission-grouping were in 128 frames per objective.</p>

<p>I don't think this question is a duplicate of <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/14312/explanation-of-rescue-of-nagate-and-shizuka-by-256-guardians/14313#14313"">this question</a> because I'm asking for the scientific explanation of the formation. I'm also aware this question may be put on hold or closed as too speculative, but it's an interesting thing to ask if the explanation is in the series anyway.</p>

<p>I believe krazer's explanation to the question above (as ton.yeung comments below) is on spot after a little research. However, what I really want to know is the benefits in having everyone in one giant ring when they could create two 128-frame rings that would've been apt on the later event I mentioned. They could even have 64 4-frame rings that might cover a greater area in the long run (or not). Does it save energy, minimize danger, or perhaps guarantee a lesser chance of being lost in space?</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_LCjeODEA"">this song</a> on YouTube - there was at least one other upload of a song with the same voice, and I also found <a href=""http://zhidao.baidu.com/question/562139787.html"">a set of lyrics</a> that approximately correspond to what is sung there. However, I haven't really been able to locate the singer's identity from a quick Google search. Moreover, there doesn't seem to be mention of a singer or a dub of the song on the Chinese Wikipedia, although perhaps my Chinese skills aren't just good enough for me to pick this up. I also managed to find a different recording with a female voice that was in Cantonese, but had different lyrics, which makes me somewhat suspicious as to the existence of an ""official"" dub. (It's of course possible though that a song will have multiple covers in the same language by prominent artists, as happened with a popular Angela Aki song.)</p>

"Why didn't Krillin and Gohan store the Dragon balls in a capsule?","<p>I'm watching Dragon Ball Z Kai and never really thought about it - If Bulma was able to pack up her cave back into capsules, why couldn't she put the Dragon ball(s) in the house, then pack up the house? </p>

<p>The resulting capsule would be small enough to cause confusion for anyone who had the dragon radar, as it would be in the vicinity (if it still showed up), but could be hidden in someone's pocket or even swallowed / regurgitated as necessary. It could have even served as a ""this radar is on the fritz, we don't have any of the balls to hand over, they're still out there somewhere"" excuse if cornered.</p>

<p>Was this simply a case of the characters not thinking to try it or is there something that would prevent the dragon balls from being shrunk down / stored in a capsule? And on that note, could you store a person / animal in a capsule?</p>

"Is it possible to cultivate Sharingans?","<p>I got into a discussion with this with my brother the other day and I was wondering if this would be a valid way to cultivate and stock up on Sharingans. </p>

<p>We see that Madara/Tobi had an entire laboratory of Sharingans, presumably gathered from the corpses from the Uchiha Massacre. Now, if someone like Kabuto were to reanimate Uchiha, they would be revived back with their own eyes as we saw with Itachi. </p>

<p>Then, would it be possible to remove the reanimated Itachi's eyes and store them for use for a later date? My brother told me that the problem with this theory is that a reanimated body using Kabuto's Endo Tensei would just have body parts that would turn to paper/dust if detached from its body, as we saw from many reanimations who lost their limbs in the war.</p>

<p>But what if Kabuto un-did the Endo Tensei jutsu immediately proceeding taking out the eyes of Itachi. Would the eyes still turn to paper/dust or would they manifest in a physical form? If so, this would allow someone like Kabuto to infinitely cultivate Sharingans by continuously reanimating and un-reanimating an Uchiha, something that could be very powerful when comboed with Izanagi.</p>

<p>If the above is not possible with Kabuto's jutsu, how about with Orochimaru's Endo Tensei - the one he used to revive the First and Second Hogake against the Third Hokage in the first Naruto series? If I recall, Orochimaru's original Endo Tensei didn't make the bodies immortal or turn to paper.</p>

"Why does Black Jack charge exorbitant fees?","<h2>Is there a reason why Black Jack charges exorbitant fees for the surgeries and operations he performs?</h2>

<p>In the series I often find Black Jack to be inconsistent due to the amount of free surgeries he performs while maintaining a reputation of charging insane medical fees. Are his ridiculously priced operations merely to get his patients to question the value of their (loved ones) life?</p>

<hr>

<p>Perhaps the only consistency about his fees, besides their high price, is that if he feels he failed he will cancel the fee. The pricing seems totally random and he charges high amounts even for people that appear to be poor. I understand that as an unlicensed doctor he has no obligations to save someone. However, part of my reason for asking is that the reason Black Jack is alive is entirely due to the fact that a doctor took responsibility and saved his life. Normally, people would feel a sense of debt to this fact and try to repay this debt by doing the same in turn to those they meet in life. I don't think as a doctor he needs to give away surgeries or operations, especially with his level of expertise, but doctors are already well paid and it seems outrageous to charge as much as he does. </p>

"Why has the Hayate no Gotoku anime switched studios so many times?","<p>The anime version of Hayate no Gotoku has been done by three different studios so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Season 1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SynergySP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SynergySP</a></li>
<li>Season 2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.C.Staff"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JC Staff</a></li>
<li>Movie, Season 3, Season 4: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manglobe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Manglobe</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each studio's version is a little different. For example, SynergySP focused a lot on parody while JC Staff focused more on romance.</p>

<p>I've seen a few shows switch studios once, but switching twice seems extremely rare.</p>

<p>Why has it switched studios so many times? Was the creator unsatisfied with what the previous studios did to the story? Was it just some financial matter?</p>

"Old Anime (similar to Pokemon) that involved going to different places (/times?) and capturing monsters in their eggs?","<p>I've been trying to find the name of this show for YEARS. I watched it every day when I was young (around 10 years ago now). I'm pretty sure it was on Channel 5 (for all you English people) in the early morning since I would watch it before school.</p>

<p>All I can remember is that there was a group of kids and they'd travel to different places (maybe times too?) and would have to capture some kind of monster (similar to Pokemon/Digimon) that was causing havoc. Each monster I believe was recaptured in an egg (each egg was also unique) and there was usually just one per episode. There may have been some kind of scientist involved with a machine that sent them to these places? But my memories may just be getting confused with Pokemon at that point.
I know it wasn't Monster Rancher as I've had suggested by friends but beyond that I've no clue.</p>

<p>Any ideas? I really loved it and it would be amazing to rediscover it after all these years.</p>

Now it made me wonder how much actually goes to the mangaka himself. Do mangaka usually work for a publishing company like jump for example or do they work independent selling their copies to the company?</p>

<p>I assume for every Tankobon copy that is sold, the managaka gets a big share, because it is made by himself, but how does this work for other merchandise like anime, toys, tshirts, games or maybe even events? These things are made independently from the original mangaka by a different company, so does he still get a percentage in every sale of every article sold or how does this work?</p>

"Doesn't letting the non-existent students do exams acknowledge their existence?","<p>This contains spoilers for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_%28novel%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Another</a>, which is somewhat new (the anime is from 2012).</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_%28novel%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Another</a> is an anime series about a cursed classroom. The students (and teachers) have designed a countermeasure to avoid the curse from triggering each year, which consists on completely ignoring a student (treating them as non-existent). By doing this, the number of students in the classroom is technically decreased by one, which makes up for the extra dead student that got mixed in the class.</p>

<p>Misaki is the chosen student to be ignored by the classroom this year. After a mess up, Sakakibara is also ignored.</p>

<p>However, if I'm not mistaken, during exam periods, <strong>both students (Misaki and Sakakibara) have exam papers</strong>. Why? Doesn't giving them exam papers pretty much <strong>acknowledge</strong> that they exist? Doesn't that break the entire countermeasure? (from the point of view of the classroom)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>For clarification: the countermeasure involves people directly related to the class. This means, students that belong to this classroom <em>and</em> teachers that teach this class. External students and teachers from other classrooms are not involved with the curse, so they may interact with the non-existent students just fine.</p>

<p>The librarian, and students from the art club etc, have no problem interacting with the non-existent students.</p>

<p>The external students/teachers are not very well aware of the curse though. The cursed classroom tries not to talk about it with others.</p>

"What are the differences between all those different ki blast attacks?","<p>Some ki attacks in the Dragon Ball universe have pretty distinct purposes. Taiyōken blinds, Makankōsappō punctures, Kienzan cuts, etc. But then there is the standard <em>ki blast</em> attack, and every fighter or martial arts school has their own version of it: Piccolo and Gohan use Masenkō, Vegeta uses Gyarikku Hō, and everyone descended from the turtle school uses Kamehameha. Not to mention the many nameless energy blasts used in between.</p>

<p>Is there an in-universe explanation for the differences between these (other than color and shape)?</p>

<p>Also, Vegeta develops new (presumably stronger) attacks to replace his old ones. He moves from Gyarikku Hō to Big Bang Attack to Final Flash. Kamehameha, on the other hand, remains a staple throughout the series.</p>

<p>to be the anime's ""official"" artwork, so (barring whether or not that is a valid assumption on my part) why is a character as important as Kyoko not featured in it?</p>

"What is the song when Karma was introduced for the first time in episode 2?","<p>In the beginning of the 1st episode of season 1, there is a soundtrack playing in the background that gives off sort of calm and mysterious vibe. </p>

<p>Usually, if I encounter an interesting music theme, I am able to find the author of the composition or even the OST itself with enough persistence and searching. However, this one has been a real struggle for me, probably the hardest one to find so far. None of the known methods of identifying music names were crowned with success in the instance with this piece of music, so I really would like to know if anyone knows something about it. </p>

<p>Also, this OST was played at the very end of the 2nd episode of season 1, when Karma was introduced to the audience for the first time. </p>

"At the end, did Naruto skip Chunnin and Jounin rank before becoming Hokage?","<p>In chapter 700 of Naruto manga (last chapter) it was shown that <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Uzumaki Naruto</a> finally reached his dream of becoming Hokage. It was also shown that he didn't achieve it immediately after the 4th Shinobi War ended as <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kakashi_Hatake"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hatake Kakashi</a> was the 6th Hokage and Naruto was the 7th.</p>

<p>AFAIK, even when fighting <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kaguya_%C5%8Ctsutsuki"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Otsutsuki Kaguya</a>, Naruto was a Genin as he never passed the Chuunin nor Jounin exam (as far as the manga is concerned). There is an anime where <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1eWFKjFdtU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Naruto took the Chuunin exam</a>, but he failed after disqualified due to using Sage Mode.</p>

<p>It was shown in Naruto the Movie ""Road to Ninja"", that to become Jounin, one must become a Chuunin first. However it is also to be noted that <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/19371/is-it-possible-for-a-genin-to-become-a-jonin/19479#19479"">double promotion is also possible</a>.</p>

<p>4th, 5th, and 6th Hokage were all Jounin prior to being Hokage. I'm not sure about the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Hokage, although strength-wise they are stronger than your average Jounin. The <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Hokage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">next Hokage</a> was chosen either by the current Hokage, or the Daimyou of the Land of Fire. No other requirements was listed on the Wikia.</p>

<p>So, to the question, has Naruto reached the rank of Jounin when he was selected as the 7th Hokage? Or was he still a Genin, since it didn't actually matter much considering that everyone knows who he is, that he was the hero who saved Konoha from Pain, and more importantly the world from Infinite Tsukuyomi.</p>

"When did the Kin/Gin Brothers get their Nine-Tails power?","<p>Now I'm rather confused. The timeline doesn't add up to me. I was hoping someone to shed some light.</p>

<p>So here's how the events seemingly happened.</p>

<ol>
<li>The hidden cloud had, for a period, attempted to capture the nine-tails.</li>
<li>As a result, the nine-tails ate the Kin/Gin Brothers.</li>
<li>To survive, they ate the flesh from his stomach.</li>
<li>The nine-tails spit them out, and they had his chakra when they were expelled.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's all fine, but <strong>it doesn't add up</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>It was said that between the five great villages, the Hidden Leaf was the first.</li>
<li>It was also said that after Madara's and Hashirama's battle, the nine-tails was sealed inside Hashirama's wife, Mito.</li>
<li>Shortly before Mito died, the nine-tails was transferred to Kushina.</li>
<li>During the short nine-tails attack on the village (after being freed from Kushina), the nine-tails was sealed again, inside of Naruto.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we also know that the Kin/Gin brothers were at the same time as the second Hokage, Tobirama. Given that they were the ones who killed him.</p>

<p><strong>When did they have time to get swallowed up by the nine-tails?</strong>. The Hidden Cloud village didn't exist before Konoha did, so it can't be <em>before</em> Madara's and Hashirama's battle, and right after that, the nine-tails was in constant Leaf possession.</p>

<p>So when? When did the cloud try to get the nine-tails?</p>

"Why can Renamon disappear, while Guilmon and Terriermon can't?","<p>In <em>Digimon Tamers</em>, we see Renamon disappear or fade out after she is no longer needed several times. (For instance, she disappears at the end of episode 7, after Rika, Henry, and Takato have rescued Guilmon.) Meanwhile, Guilmon and Terriermon do not seem capable of this: Takato has to take pains to hide Guilmon (ep. 2), and Henry has to pass off Terriermon as a stuffed animal when he is at home (ep. 1).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Visual Novel of Fate Stay/Night Realta Nua once you have seen all 5 endings a new ending appears accessible from the title screen call -Last Episode-, this is in 2 parts, a Monologue of the Fate Route and a second part where Arturia is hearing from Merlin about a miracle achievable by 2 people, one who ""wait endlessly"" and one who ""pursue endlessly"", eventfully the pursuer will stop when they reach the waiter.</p>
  
  <p>What Merlin is referring to is Arturia waiting and Shirou pursueing, eventually Shirou reaches Avalon where Arturia is sleeping and the 2 finally reunite, it's not entirely sure how long it took Shirou to reach Avalon however considering that Avalon transcends all magic including the 5 Magics <strong>it must have taken an eternity for Shirou to reach.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously if it took them an eternity to meet, it's common sense that it never happened.  </p>

<p>So my theory is that there are two options for this occasion:  </p>

<ol>
<li>The author's definition of eternity is something different from what is known to the public.</li>
<li>That it was some sort of an inside joke to troll the audience who desperately want to see them reunite.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there any official statement about how long <strong>eternity</strong> is according to the Fate Stay/Night series?<br>
Are there even any clues on which to base some sort of speculation on the matter?<br>
Or maybe the light novel perhaps mentions something about it.  </p>

<p>I really want to know how much Saber had to suffer in order to finally meet with Shirou.<br>

At least I think it is an odd:even pattern; I'm only on episode 5.</p>

"Why was Sakurai Takahiro recast in Psycho-Pass 2?","<p>In Psycho-Pass (season 1), Sakurai Takahiro voiced Makishima Shougo. In Psycho-Pass 2, he voices Hinakawa Shou. I find it strange that the same voice actor would be cast to voice two different important characters in the same show. </p>

<p>Sure, it's common for a voice actor to voice multiple side characters, I guess to reduce the total number of voice actors that need to be hired (e.g. from this season, Fukuyama Jun voices Hunchoceratops and a few side characters in Amagi Brilliant Park; and Kayano Ai voices a number of side characters in Shirobako). But two different main characters? That's weird. </p>

For instance most non-ecchi anime have the breasts censored, some only have the nipples removed, and a quite a few bare them completely. The quite few who go the extremes may even be classified as <em>hentai</em> already.</p>

"Why don't Evangelion Pilots need to pump the LCL out of their lungs after exiting an Eva Unit?","<p>I just started watching Evangelion on Netflix and the series explained that pilots' lungs become <a href=""https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/LCL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">filled with LCL</a> when in the entry plug of an Eva Unit, allowing them to breath and sync with their units.</p>

<p>However, it never shows or explained why they don't need to pump the LCL back out of their lungs upon exiting a unit. Is it just implied? Do their bodies absorb the LCL through their lungs? Is it assumed they just cough it up? Is there an explanation that I am missing?</p>

<p>When Itachi was fighting Sasuke, he was saying how he wanted to take Sasuke's eyes so he could obtain the EMS. Sasuke did not have the MS at the time, so was Itachi lying, or are just ""blood tie"" Sharingan needed for the EMS? <strong>*Sidenote</strong> I personally don't believe Itachi would lie about this, because if he did and Sasuke found out, Sasuke would then be questioning Itachi's true motives.</p>

They are in an arid desert environment which appears to be the inside of an hourglass. Mayuri says that you could say that they are just one of many versions of themselves, but you could also say that they were the originals. Shortly before dissolving into sand, she says that their wills will carry on to the versions of themselves in Akihabara 70 million years in the future.</p>

"Do auras really have color and movement to them?","<p>Throughout <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> we see a variety of auras, with the majority of them differing based on color and the way that they move. </p>

<p>For example, Gon and Killua's are white and emit from their bodies fairly rapidly, similar to Saiyans from DBZ. But then if you consider Hasuka's and Killua's brother's auras, they're purple and kind of ooze. Lastly, there's also the chimera king's royal guard's aura which is red and really tentacle-like, and the chairman of the hunter association which is every color and radiates outwardly in all directions. </p>

"Ratio of key frames to in-between frames in anime","<p>In your average piece of animation, how many of the frames are key frames drawn by the animator, and how many are drawn by an inbetweener?</p>

<p>Even a small difference would have a huge impact; for example, having about a third of the frames be keys is a little over half the work for the animators compared to having half the frames be key frames, so this would obviously have a huge impact on budget, as fewer keys means you don't need as many key animators. I feel like a third or a fourth of frames being keys is probably average, but I haven't been able to find anything to support or debunk this hunch.</p>

"When did Kakashi and Obito awaken their Mangekyou Sharingan?","<p>In chapter 604 of the manga, it is shown that Kakashi kills Rin. This fulfills the requirement to activate the Mangekyou Sharingan. So that should have been the moment when Kakashi was able to use the Mangekyou Sharingan. </p>

<p>Also, the Yellow Flash was still alive when this happens, so this means that Naruto was not yet born. This clearly points to the fact that from the very beginning of the Naruto series, Kakashi had his Mangekyou Sharingan activated. </p>

<p>When Kakashi first fought Itachi (when Itachi and Kisame appear at Konoha) and faced the Tsukuyomi he was devastated in a moment, even though he had his Mangekyou Sharingan active (though not used). But the next time they face (during the rescue mission of Gara), he was able to withstand it.</p>

<p>Now my first question is, was Kakashi unaware of his Mangekyou Sharingan until he faced Itachi, or was he not proficient in using it. Also why in the Naruto series (I mean the series before the start of Shippuden) didn't Kakashi use his Mangekyou Sharingan?</p>

<p>Now for my second question, in the same chapter, a few pages back, just when Kakashi strikes the blow at Rin, Obito's vision starts to fade as he can sense Rin dying. Does this mean Obito's Mangekyou Sharingan was awakened at the same time? We know that Kakashi and Obito shares the same ""other dimension"" because of the same Sharingan that the both use (not the same eye, but the eye of the same Uchiha). So does the same apply for their activation of Mangekyou Sharingan?</p>

"How do summoning jutsus work?","<p>Let's have a back drop on the story, the Third Hokage shows Jiraya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru his summoning technique. This intrigues Jiraya and he too tries to perform the jutsu without making a blood seal with an animal. As a result he is teleported to Mount Myoboku, where the Toads live. He trains there for some time. </p>

<p>Here lies my first question, until later into his training Jiraya had not made a blood seal with the toads, so how did he get to mount Myoboku to undergo his trainings? The reverse kuchiyose should only work when there is a blood seal with the animal. Going to Mount Myoboku on foot is a long and tiresome journey, so this possibility too is cancelled out. So, in order to go to Mound Myoboku did he use the kuchiyose no jutsu every time? </p>

<p>My other question is what decides which animal a shinobi is to bond with? There is a wide range of creatures that one can choose from, but certainly there must be some sort of compatibility to be worried about. What made Jiraya decide a toad summon would be best for Naruto? </p>

They say Madam Shyarly's prediction never failed. I can't  think of any other besides Luffy that is wearing that hat.</p>

<p>How can Luffy possibly do it? Because in the first place, he saved that island and he's not that kind of guy who will do such a thing. Also, Fishman island lies right underneath the Red Line and Mariejois. So destroying Fishman island means destroying the capital of World Government, Mariejois.</p>

<p>Questions:<br/></p>

<ul>
<li>How can Luffy possibly do it? (if he is the destined one because it lies beneath Mariejois and Red Line)</li>
<li>Could this be another straw hat guy? or her prediction is just wrong?</li>

However, the key conversation in question seems to imply that the explanation was made up on the spot. To me, it seemed as though that was best alternative Kazuto's mom could come up when Kazuto confronted her unexpectedly; in reality he's really adopted from unknown parents. I couldn't find a good clip of it, so here's the clip in a reaction video, which is close enough:

"How can I easily find all languages a show has been dubbed into?","<p>I usually only watch anime with the original Japanese voice actors, since I've had bad experiences with dubs in the past. However, I'm sometimes interested in watching a show dubbed in something that isn't Japanese, and moreover, I want to know if there are any alternatives to English dubs.</p>

<p>Is there any site that will let me see <em>all</em> languages a show has been dubbed into efficiently?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>MyAnimeList gives the voice actors in various languages for characters. However, this information is often incomplete. For instance, I just looked at <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20150429123839/http://myanimelist.net/character/5449/Nagisa_Misumi"" rel=""nofollow"">the page for Nagisa Misumi</a> of <em>Pretty Cure</em> and noticed that no Cantonese voice actress is listed, even though a Cantonese dub exists.</p></li>
<li><p>A Wikipedia article in some language <code>foo</code> for a show will sometimes list any voice actors for the dub in <code>foo</code> in addition to the Japanese voice actors. Information about dubs in other languages is generally lacking. This would mean that I would have to check (and be able to read) each Wikipedia page in each potentially interesting language. Moreover, I would have to carefully check shows one at a time, which is not convenient.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, wikis for a series <em>sometimes</em> contain information about dubs (e.g. a <a href=""http://wikimoon.org/index.php?title=Sailor_Moon_in_Korea"" rel=""nofollow""><em>Sailor Moon</em> wiki</a> I found). As a general rule however, this is not the case. For instance, a Cantonese dub for <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> exists, but there is no mention of it in <a href=""http://utena.wikia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">a fan-made wiki</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of Cantonese (or even Mandarin), I can usually ""guess"" that older, more prominent shows will have a dub. However, I find it difficult to do the same for other languages that I might be interested in (e.g. German), and at any rate, it'd be nice to not have to rely on my guesswork.</p>

<p>This is the same incantation as what Tyrant Eye uses to transform (henshin). Mjolnir Hammer and Dark Flame Master also uses the same incantation.

Mjolnir Hammer is servant to Tyrant Eye. So them sharing the same incantation is perfectly understandable. </p>

It turns out that this is a drawing by <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=44597"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yakou Hiroshi</a> (posted <a href=""https://twitter.com/dakenmukuinugam/status/545983859414687745"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here on Twitter</a> and <a href=""http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=47642274"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here on pixiv</a>), who was an animation director for WIXOSS. So not quite ""official art"", per se, but very close to it. </p>

<p>Who is the person in the middle of the picture (to the right of Hitoe, beneath Hanayo, and left of Yuzuki)? </p>

<p>I can identify everyone else in the picture, but I have no recollection of seeing this person. I think every important character in the series is in the picture, too (heck, even Ruuko's brother and the card shop lady are in there). The most important person I can think of who isn't in the picture is Hitoe's mom, and that clearly ain't her...</p>

"How is Sakura's and Shinji's relationship different in Realta Nua?","<p>On the <a href=""http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/4745-Fate-Stay-Night-Realta-Nua-PC-version-Mirror-Moon-TL-insertion-project"" rel=""nofollow"">Beast's Lair forum post</a> about the <em>Fate/Stay Night Realta Nua PC English Patch</em>, there is this item in the FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: I want to view the original 2004 version of the
  relationship between Sakura and Shinji, but I don't
  want to view the H scenes, what can I do?<br><br>
  A: We're working on something to accomodate this request.
  In the meantime you need H scenes on to view the original
  version of the Shinji/Sakura relationship. If you don't
  want to view the H scenes but want to see thier original
  relationship, then my advice would be to, starting from
  Day 5 of HF, turn H scenes on when Shinji is in a scene
  or is mentioned, and on Day 14 make sure you have H scenes
  on until you see the last Shinji scene. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can also been seen in <a href=""http://realtapatch.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a>.</p>

<p>Now i am assuming that what it's talking about is that in Realta Nua, Shinji's and Sakura's relationship is different compared to the original game. In the original Fate/Stay Night their relationship was that Sakura would became the new head of the Matou family, which Shinji believed he was entitled to, and when Sakura felt sorry for him, Shinji thought she was submitting to him which lead to years of physical and sexual abuse.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> This leads to Heaven's Feel where Shinji attempts to rape Sakura, threatening her that he'll tell Shirou about what he has being doing to her and claiming that Shirou won't want to have anything to do with her after that. Sakura snaps and kills Shinji and then realizes she's the Shadow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when I played it, there was no depiction of rape so I can't understand how or why Shinji's and Sakura's relationship would be different in Realta Nua. How is their relationship different, and why would it be changed? If Sakura's sexual abuse is cut out from Realta Nua does this mean her abuse at the hands of Zouken and his worms is also altered, and if so, how?</p>

"How does Machvise even hit anyone?","<p>In the Dressrosa Arc, we see Machvise fight. His fighting style is focused around his Devil Fruit, the Ton-Ton Fruit, which allows him to change his own weight (up to a weight of 10000 tons!) with him jumping up in the air and then falling down on top of people.</p>

<p>What I truly cannot understand is how he is even able to hit anyone! One Piece is a universe where people are fast enough to smack cannon-balls out of the air and dodge bullets, how are they unable to just get out of the damn way when they see him jump up!?!?</p>

<p>Even falling from a mere 20 meters will take about 2 seconds, long enough for a real-life person to see where he will fall and get out of the way. And Machvise tends to jump a lot higher than that, sometimes what seems like 100 meters up, which would take 4.5 seconds to fall down from!!</p>

<p>Honestly, I feel that his Fruit is far more suited for a fighting style that focuses on wrestling (and he even has the big, burly body structure that would work well in wrestling). Just run in, and as soon as he gets a good grip he makes sure to ""fall over"" on top of the person (or at least on top of whatever part he managed to grab) while adjusting his weight to a couple hundred tons. If he does that when holding an arm, he would tear it clean off the body! Way more effective than ""jump and hope to hit""</p>

"What is a good way to protect manga from yellowing in an open bookself besides book covers/comic book bags?","<p>Recently I've started to collect manga. I have twenty-four volumes now. I keep them in an open bookshelf facing a window along with some other books which unfortunately I don't have any place for where it isn't facing the window, so I can't really keep them out of the sunlight. My fear of my books yellowing has been growing especially since the manga pages are so thin. I don't really like the idea of having to put each volume in one of those plastic comic book covers, so I was thinking of maybe putting a strip of white sheet behind them to minimize the impact the light has on them? I also have other books on the shelf that wouldn't necessarily fit comic bags. Is that a good idea, or would it just absorb more heat and further damage the books? Also, if anyone has any other methods, please share them. I’m open to buying stuff if I need to. I only have 20 volumes so it doesn’t need to be something huge (for now :D) Otherwise, the dimensions I need to cover are roughly 1.5 by 7 feet. Thanks in advance. </p>

I was asking specifically about other methods and if the method of hanging a portion of a cut white sheet behind the shelf would work. I would also be open to putting something else behind the shelf. Hopefully this is able to be reopened now, I think its probably different enough from the duplicate now but I can edit it further if need be.</p>

<p>Kinoko Nasu first started Type-Moon as a doujin group, so I also include any Type-Moon released doujinshi they may have released (if there are any) which contained explicit content.</p>

<p>By explicit content, I mean graphic or deeply detailed sexual content which would be restricted to adults only. I don't count stuff like in <em>Fate/Extra</em>, such as</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the nurse's office when Hakuno Kishinami's Servant is being recharged by Rin/Rani, there is an implication they may be having sex. (Though I only saw Rin and Saber's scene. Not sure about Archer or Caster, but I assume it's more or less the same.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or in the <em>Strawberry Panic</em> Light Novel (which isn't Type-Moon), where</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Yaya dreams she's having sex with Hikari and some of the language in that (when Hikari climaxes) I would have thought would only appear in 18/21+ adult content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Neither of these was restricted to adults only (can't remember <em>Fate/Extra</em>'s rating, but <em>Strawberry Panic</em> was marketed towards teens as per the rating on the back of the book).</p>

"Why don't English translated light novels retain the ""backwards"" page ordering?","<p>Despite us westerners reading from left-to-right, top-to-bottom from the front to back with the book spine on our left, when manga is translated and localized (officially) it retains the Japanese way of reading, right-to-left from the back forward with the book spine on our right.</p>

<p>From my understanding the Japanese read text from top-down in vertical lines and since this is probably too much for westerners, it's ""corrected"" in manga. However, while we still read the text left-to-right, the frames/pages of the manga still retain the right-to-left ordering.</p>

<p>With light novels however, this doesn't appear to be the case. With the light novels of <em>Strawberry Panic</em> localized by Seven Seas and <em>Spice and Wolf</em> localized by Yen Press, the books are read from left-to-right with the spine on our left; this includes the order of pages.</p>

For example an island entrance says ""Punk Hazard"" and ""Danger"" in English, even though they're speaking Japanese. </p>

<p>I've noticed this kind of inconsistency elsewhere too, for example, even in the Subbed version, you hear many English words and names, such as their shipwright saying ""Super!"". I've nopticed more things like this throughout the entire series, having watched many episodes in Dubbed and Subbed versions.</p>

<p>So, is there an explanation for why English and Japanese are intermingled so heavily in One Piece? it seems odd for the text to be inconsistent. Maybe they produced a few different versions with different text forms, but that would be odd since it's not even an English dubbed version in some cases.  </p>

<p>Was the writer bilingual? Or was it perhaps a strategy to please English and Japanese viewers equally? Or some other reason?</p>

<li>Everyone <em>thought</em> that Ninth was dead. So perhaps the ""system"" was fooled.

If that's the case, the rules can be bended. But if you could bend the rules, then it wouldn't be necessary to kill either Yukiteru or Yuno.</li>

<li>When Deus saved Ninth, maybe he kind of disqualified her from the game, so she's not a player anymore and doesn't have to die.

Then I noticed that MAL lists <a href=""http://myanimelist.net/manga/26973/Helvetica_Standard"">Helvetica Standard</a> as Nichijou's manga side-story, and that there is also an <a href=""http://myanimelist.net/anime/8857/Nichijou:_Nichijou_no_0-wa"">OVA</a> listed as a prequel to the anime series, and <a href=""http://myanimelist.net/anime/10807/Nichijou:_Tanken_Nichijou_no_Machi"">14 1-minute special episodes</a> listed as the anime's side-story.<br>
Bearing all this in mind, I thought I might as well ask:</p>

<p><strong>Is the anime (including the OVA and specials) a faithful adaptation of the manga (including the side-story), with only slight variations? Or does it add a lot of new content, and possibly stray from the original content?<br>
Or should they be regarded as two separate pieces?</strong></p>

"Do all published manga originate from one-shots?","<p>I heard that some popular manga (for example - Naruto, Nurarihyon no Mago, Beelzebub) are published as one-shots during their first try. I want to know if that applies to all manga or not? Would many manga be published as a one-shot first?</p>

"Is the amount of chakra extracted equal to the size of the part that is cut off from the Bijuu?","<p>When the Eight Tails got a part of his tail cut off, Sasuke brought back the Eight Tails' body, but only about (estimate) 94% of it (due to the tail part still remaining with Killer B in it). Does that mean that they were able to extract 94% of the Eight Tails' chakra?</p>

<p>This also applies to Ginkaku and Kinkaku, who ate whatever was in the Nine Tails' stomach. Say, they ate (wild guess) 3% of the Nine Tails' total mass (they were in there for two weeks) did they attain 3% of the Nine Tails' total chakra amount?</p>

<p>I know my facts aren't spot on, I just wondered if the ratio between the amount of physical mass of Bijuu ""attained"", equaled the amount of total Bijuu chakra energy ""attained""?</p>

It's like the sound is fading away as I play longer. Sometimes I have to focus real hard just to make out the sound of the piano. Is this what Kousei means?</p>

"Is the Umineko ED used elsewhere?","<p>Recently, I have started watching <em>Umineko no naku koro ni</em> (<em>When the Seagulls Cry</em>) and I found the ending song <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fTcLMsAMD4"" rel=""nofollow"">(YouTube link)</a> of this anime very familiar and similar to a song I have heard before in another anime. In particular, the part 0:40 - 1:00 sounds somewhat like something I've heard before. </p>

<p>Now my question is: did the same singer perform for any other anime, or are there singers who sang the same song as he did (specifically, the part of the song at 0:40 - 1:00)?</p>

"What does ""dog's circle"" mean?","<p>I just watched an anime where the phrase <strong>dog's circle</strong> was used in the English subtitles.  The sentence was, ""We are the dog's circle.""  Is that a well known Japanese expression?  The anime was episode 6 of <em>Natsume Yujin-Cho 5</em>, where it was used at time mark 20:10.  The episode just went up on Crunchyroll this week.</p>

<p>From context, I'm pretty sure it refers to them being a group of friends or allies around one they protect, but not literally surrounding him/her.  Checking on both Google and Bing, there appears to be no general English usage of this phrase.  Is my interpretation correct, and in Japanese would the phrase be instantly understood?</p>

"Laxus' plan. Would he have fought Makarov?","<p>In ""The Battle of Fairy Tail"" arc did Laxus ever actually plan on fighting Makarov?</p>

<p>His magic reveals his true feelings, and he tells his grandfather he really just wanted to make the guild stronger. So we know that he never would have smashed the statues of the girls, and he probably never would have set off the Thunder Palace. These were both just ways of pushing Makarov into handing over the guild.</p>

<p>He knows Erza and Mystogan will be coming for him. He plans for an inevitable battle with them, which he is sure he'll win easily. He even tells Freed he'll take care of them.</p>

<p>But, the statues and Thunder Palace aside as he never would have used them anyway, what if he did manage to beat Erza and Mystogan? What if the Thunder Legion had beaten everyone, and Gramps hadn't fallen ill? Makarov would never have just handed over the guild.</p>

<p>But would Laxus have actually fought Makarov in the end to get the guild? Freed tells Cana and Juvia he's storing up his magical energy to fight the master, but Laxus' true feelings are revealed in the end.</p>

<p>Laxus' plan seems to be a little over all the place at times. </p>

"Why the popularity of German?","<p>Second to English, German seems to be the most popular foreign language in anime. You see it in titles, names, and even quite a few characters are of German descent.</p>

<p>For example, many characters in <a href=""http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=9541"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Shingeki no Kyojin</em></a> appear to be German/have German names and there are a lot of German references. <a href=""http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&amp;aid=1544"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Elfen Lied</em></a> is also German (translates to ""elf/elvish song"").</p>

"Is it possible for someone to awaken the Mangekyou Sharingan before they even awaken the Sharingan?","<p>I was just wondering if it was possible for an Uchiha to awaken the Mangekyou Sharingan before even awakening the Sharingan.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Mangeky%C5%8D_Sharingan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It (Mangekyou Sharingan) is initially awakened by the trauma suffered from witnessing the death of someone close to the user.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it should be common sense by now, but if you didn't know then to awaken the MS the user has to witness something so traumatic, like seeing someone close to the said user die.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sharingan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a wielder of this kekkei genkai experiences a powerful emotional condition with regards to a person precious to them, their brain releases a special form of chakra that affects the optic nerves, transforming the eyes into Sharingan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To awaken the Sharingan, an Uchiha has to have an extreme(powerful) emotion condition which causes their brain to release a special type of chakra, which will then cause their eyes to transform into Sharingan.</p>

<p>I have put the way the Uchiha awaken the Sharingan and the MS, but could it be possible to combine both of the said ways into one? What I mean is if an Uchiha, who hasn't awakened the Sharingan yet, witnessed something so traumatic they just awaked the MS. Could that even be possible? Or would it just awaken the Sharingan and then the MS almost instantly at the same time?</p>

"At what point in the Strike Witches timeline does Brave Witches take place?","<p>I recently finished the <em>Strike Witches</em> anime (Season 1, 2, <em>Operation Victory Arrow</em> OVAs and Movie) and am planning to continue watching up to <em>Brave Witches</em>. I want to preserve the continuity of the series as I am watching it.</p>

<p>In the first episode, Miyafuji Yoshika is seen in the company of Sakamoto Mio as seen in the newspaper clipping below:</p>

<p>Or are they Quincies? Although I doubt this very much since they never been seen using bows and Quincy techniques. Or are they modified souls like Kon?</p>

"What's with the taped over speech-bubbles in the preview?","<p>I just finished episode 24 of EVA, and I noticed that the last two previews I'd seen looked a lot ""rougher"".</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The preview after episode 24 consists of a series of what seem to be rough drawings or sketchs over a voiceover.</p></li>
<li><p>The preview after episode 23 was animated (in that there were some ""moving"" frames), but looked unfinished - the colouring and lining looks incomplete. Moreover, some of the images look like they come from a manga (in terms of, for instance, speech bubbles, or hiragana/katakana given for some kanji - although it seems possible to me that the bubbles might just have been taped on so as to give people involved in production some idea of the dialogue in each scene). For example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wbXjmm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Comparatively, the artwork in prior episode previews seemed somewhat more ""finished"", and, at least in my memory, was usually animated. This I presume is probably because of the fact that EVA had production issues toward the end of the anime run.</p>

<p>But less obvious to me is this: <strong>what are these speech bubbles that show up in the episode preview for episode 24 actually for?</strong> Are they something that feature in preliminary anime sketches?</p>

"What is this Ghost Infiltration Key?","<p>Multiple times in the GITS Arise characters mention the mysterious Ghost Infiltration Key. From what I understand it is somehow used to stop (paralyze?) an agent of government, or perhaps anyone with a cyberized brain.</p>

<p>How does that thing work? A lot of cyber warfare is based on breaking encryptions and bypassing various types of barriers. And then there are these keys. They have to be unbreakable to be deemed worth keeping in one's hands. Otherwise the risk of such an item falling into enemy's hands is too great − they could neutralize the government agents.</p>

<p>It's got ""Ghost"" in its name for a reason, probably to make it clear that the target is not the cyberbrain device, but the Ghost of its user. Ghosts are as unique as it gets in GITS universe, so there can be only one key. Or not?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Germán's child with Ximena is going to inherit Zoro. That doesn't necessarily mean that Zoro <em>has</em> to be passed lineally, but it does sort of suggest that that might be the case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, it looks like Gaia doesn't have any restrictions based on bloodline, since Raphael was able to pass Gaia onto Alfonso, and I don't see how Raphael could be a lineal ancestor of Alfonso - Raphael is not Alfonso's father (the king), nor his maternal grandfather (the former Garo), nor his paternal grandfather (presumably the previous king, who must be long dead), and anybody from Alfonso's great-grandparents' generation should also be dead.</p>

<p>I believe it was produced by the same company that produced Blue Exorcist (Aniplex?). It did have a similar animation style. But I see nothing like it on Aniplex lists...</p>

<p>I also vaguely remember a large stone he carried around that could talk... I think it was a demon trapped? This demon could sense other demons nearby, and the main character had some power that allowed him to see and fight these demons... (Gee, that limits it down, I know)</p>

<p>I was led to believe that he was still unable to control his Geass (assumption based on how the first season ended), yet when he's around Milly, Shirley etc., it appears he has it under control?</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>

"Why does Satsuki address everyone using ""kisama""?","<p>I'm rewatching Kill La Kill and I've noticed that the word ""kisama"" is used by every one of the bad guys (Student Council, Satsuki Kiryuin, Ragyo, and so on) to address basically every good character (i.e. Ryuuko, Mako, her family, etc.). </p>

<p>I know that in the Japanese language there are multiple different ways to address another person depending on the level of familiarity you have with them and so on, and I know that ""kisama"" is the most impolite way of addressing anybody (and it's usually translated as ""bastard"" or something like that when it's used).</p>

<p>My question is: why does Satsuki Kiryuin use ""kisama"" to address the Elite Four? They should, at least, be worthy of a bit more of respect.

We have seen that during fight with Kabuto, he uses ordinary sharingan genjutsu on Itachi when freeing him from Kabuto's sound genjutsu.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/odeSj.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The character on the left struck me as very odd - she's wearing braids (which would normally suggest a female character), but she also has sideburns, which seem to be more or less only something men wear. (I'm assuming the character is female from the voice actor who plays at that moment.) Moreover, if the character <em>weren't</em> female, it would be odd for a school to allow him to wear braids.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1c8gw3/spoilers_aku_no_hana_episode_2_discussion/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Reddit</a> suggests that this character also appears in the manga, so is this just intentional character design, rather than an error in the art? If so, who is this character, and is there anything (e.g. personality traits) that might explain this odd hairstyle? (I have not read the manga yet, and so can't easily look this up.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I remembered seeing some video footage of the live-action filming that the rotoscoped animation was apparently from on YouTube, so I might try to dig that out to see if I can get a better idea of what's going on here. On a second glance the braids struck me as a bit odd in terms of the shaping of their ends (one usually expects the hair to thin out somewhat and possibly curve a bit), so it occurred to me that this might be useful.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> After reading the entire manga, I couldn't find a character with identical design. (From the uniform -- notice that the character here wears a bow, instead of a tie -- it seems certain that they're probably female.) However, I did notice a presumably female character with very short hair (for a girl) that was in the corresponding chapater of the manga. I don't remember if the character was wearing a female uniform but will look it up later when I have time.</p>

"What piano piece is Emil Nekola skating to in his short program?","<p>In episode 8 of <em>Yuri!!! on Ice</em>, Emil Nekola skates his short program to a piano piece. (This is around the eight-minute mark in the episode.) The music sounded like a classical work that I have heard before, but I was unable to place it. The most I have been able to gather is that if this is indeed a classical composition, it would have to be from the Romantic period in music at the earliest. (I also have a sense of which composers <em>wouldn't</em> have written something like this, but that's less useful.)</p>

"How did Nagato choose the paths of Pain?","<p><strong>Potential Spoilers for the events Season 6-8 of Naruto Shippuden</strong> <br></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Konan is a former student of Jiraiya, who is also the Angel of Amegkure and Pain who has the Rinnegan is the leader who defeated Hanzo. During the fight we learn of the six Paths of Pain, each who uses a different unique abilities while sharing their field of vision. Jiraiya was confused how could six people have the Rinnegan when only Nagato had it.</p>

  <p> Jiraiya recognises Yahiko, and then the body of pain that he pulls into the toad. He then decides to go back out and realises that <strong>ALL the paths of pain are Ninjas he'd seen/met before</strong>. And then the realization <strong>""The real one is not among them.""</strong> This confuses me since we know Nagato can make any dead person a path of pain (the new Animal Path), Why would he chose those particular individuals that Jiraiya knows? Infact how did he know Jiraiya knows them?</p>

<p>And thus the question, <strong>How/Why did Nagato choose the ""Paths"" of Pain?</strong></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the 5 shinobi that Jiraiya encountered during his journey: The Puppeteer, The Waterfall shinobi, The Fuma clan shinobi, The Grass Shinobi, The Priest. The sixth path i.e. Yahiko seems obvious due to their connection. But again using the other 5 seems very coincidental.</p>

"How and how much do the dolls know about the other dolls?","<p>Preface: This is coming entirely from the anime’s perspective and yet without the 2013 one, which I've only started watching.</p>

<p>We are introduced to Shinku, Hina-Ichigo, Suigintou, Suiseiseki and Souseiseki in the first season in order of appearance. Bara-Suishou and Kanaria are introduced in the first and third episodes of <em>Träumend,</em> respectively. During episode 1 of <em>Träumend</em>, Shinku explicitly refers to herself as the fifth Rozen Maiden doll, and Bara-Suishou answers to the seventh.</p>

<p>In episode 1 of the OVA <em>Ouvertüre</em>, we learn that Shinku then only knew about three Rozen Maiden dolls at the time of <em>Ouvertüre.</em> However, for some reason, she knows that there should be seven. Also in that episode, Shinku gets to know Suigintou for the first time.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> She finds out, that Suigintou is broken and initially does not even have a <em>Rosa Mystica</em> thus concluding that she shouldn’t be a Rozen Maiden. However in the second OVA episode, Suigintou has been restored after defeat and granted a <em>Rosa Mystica,</em> obviously making her a true Rozen Maiden.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In episode 12 of <em>Träumend,</em> we learn that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Bara-Suishou was not an original <em>Rozen Maiden</em> but rather an <em>Enju Maiden</em> being crafted by a different doll maker. It is not clearly revealed as far as I can tell whether she has a <em>Rosa Mystica</em> but she cannot cope with winning the Alice game and thus the other six girls’ <em>Rosa Mysticas,</em> possibly because she is not pure enough. In any case, the situation is restored to a pre-Alice-game situation where only those dolls defeated by Rozen Maidens stay defeated: Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki (by Shinku and Suigintou).<br>
<br>
 I conclude from these facts, that Bara-Suishou is quite a bit younger than the other dolls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, the dolls must somehow know that there are seven of them but not who they are until they met each other.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why did they know that they must be seven?</p></li>
<li><p>How and why did they know the how many-th doll they are?</p></li>
<li><blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> How was it possible that <em>none</em> of the six met the seventh <em>proper</em> Rozen Maiden in the over 100 years that they had been living and fighting all over the world, so that they all assumed Bara-Suishou to be the proper seventh?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Shouldn’t there have been any clues for the other dolls that Bara-Suishou is ‘non-canonical’? E.g. the scene at the end of <em>Träumend</em> 10 where they meet Enju and call him <em>father.</em></p>

"What does the dialog related to Nanami's quote in the last episode of Bokura Ga Ita mean?","<p>In the last scene of the final episode of <em>Bokura Ga Ita</em> (ep. 26), Yano repeats a quote that Nanami made in an earlier episode. The quote was</p>

  <p> ""it all equals out"" and questions it. He says, ""it didn't all equal out,"" and that ""it ended up more equal...<strong>on the positive side.</strong>""</p>

<p>I've watched two different translations of the scene and I am still confused. I originally thought it was basically saying</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> 'you love no one, but someone loves you a lot, so it equals out', so I'm not understanding the ""sides"".</p>

"What does the twin witch pair in 'Spirited Away' represent?","<p>This is how I interpret the story of <em>Spirited Away</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The bathhouse represents the society. People work with each other towards a common goal. Every night, 8 million gods come to the bathhouse and workers serve them, worship them. In a way they deal with them, do business with them. In Asian cultures, fire, air, earth, water, food, etc. are represented as gods, so bathhouse very accurately represents a working society. The 'spell' breaks if they stop working.</li>
<li>Yubaba is the culture. She manages the bathhouse. She is a tyrant and rules over people by taking their real names and giving them new names.</li>
<li>Chihiro was given a new name by Yubaba, 'Sen', which means 'one thousand', similar to how a person is given a roll number or employee number in an organisation. That number becomes her new identity.</li>
<li>Haku has forgotten his real name. Similar to Islamic terrorists, he's become a slave to the tyrannical culture. He'll do anything the culture tells him to do.</li>
<li>The baby is the belief system of the society. Yubaba is <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=spirited+away+yubaba+angry+fire&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">overly</a> protective of him.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I can't understand is, who is Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Yubaba and Zeniba are two parts of a whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Yubaba keeps the baby locked in a room, afraid that he might get sick because of germs. Zeniba turned the baby into a mouse so that he might have a little freedom.</p></li>
<li><p>Zeniba lives in the swamp bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>There used to be trains running between the bathhouse and the swamp bottom in old days, but the return trains from the swamp bottom have stopped. Now it's a one-way road towards the swamp bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>The tickets to the swamp bottom Kamaji gave to Chihiro had been with him for 40 years.</p></li>
<li><p>'Zeni' has <a href=""https://shokubutsujin.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/kanji-mumblings-from-spirited-away/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">two</a> meanings in Japanese, 'money' and 'ancient'. 'ba' means 'old lady'. The meaning of Zeniba which seems to fit the story is 'ancient old lady'.</p></li>
<li><p>Yubaba wanted to steal a seal from Zeniba, which was supposedly very precious.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So what do Yubaba and Zeniba represent in this story? It looks like they might represent:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>culture and nature</p></li>
<li><p>tyranny and individuality</p></li>
<li><p>life and death</p></li>
<li><p>interdependence and self reliance</p></li>

"Who is the magical girl who becomes Walpurgisnacht?","<p>Since witches are actually magical girls who, when their soul gems are fully tainted, become witches, that means that Walpurgisnacht was a magical girl.

"How was Holo unfair in this argument in volume 9?","<p>Sometimes I have difficulty understanding Holo and Lawrence's wit, such as in this conversation on pages 48-49 of volume 9 of the light novels:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Holo: Aye, we're all greedy, always running about in service of our own gain.</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: On that count, I'm forced to agree. Of course...Of course, if I weren't so greedy, I'd be able to buy you tastier food.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: Mm. But is seeing my pleasure not in your interests as well?</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: If you were truly so easily bribed by food, then that might be so.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: And what other methods could you use?</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: If food is out, then with words or manners.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: Neither of which is so reliable in your case.</p>
  
  <p>Lawrence: (<em>Quoting Eve</em>) Or you could imagine you've been deceived and decide to trust both. They might well turn out to be genuine.</p>
  
  <p>Holo: That isn't what I meant to say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were originally talking about Holo's attempt to get a narwahl, but then it branched off into this conversation.</p>

<p>With line 8, Lawrence feels that he has effectively put Holo in a corner. The text also mentions that line 8 is something Eve previously said. The text then states that Holo has no counterattack. However, when Holo makes her reply with line 9, Lawrence feels like she has done something unfair. I am uncertain as to why Lawrence feels as though he has won, and as to why he feels that Holo was unfair with line 9. </p>

"What's with the claim that Anna pulled a knife on Nobuko?","<p>In Ghibli's <em>When Marnie Was There</em>, there's a scene around 27:00 where
Anna calls Nobuko a ""fat pig"". Pretty rude, but Nobuko does provoke her
quite a bit. Later, around 35:00, Nobuko's mother is complaining about
this to Anna's aunt and uncle ... but she also says that Anna <em>pulled a
knife</em> on Nobuko! (""Knife"" in the English dub, ""cutter"" in the sub.) I
certainly didn't see her do that, nor do I see anything suggesting a
scene was cut.</p>

<p>So, what's the deal here? Did Nobuko simply fabricate the whole thing?
Seems like a pretty strong accusation to invent ... Nobuko comes off as
a jerk, but that's really over the top. Is it a mistranslation?
Unfortunately, my ear for spoken Japanese is not up to transcribing what
Nobuko's mother says. Also unfortunately, my library system does not
have the book the movie was based on.</p>

"What does Zeniba represent?","<p>This is how I interpret the story of <em>Spirited Away</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>The bathhouse represents the society. People work with each other towards a common goal. Every night, 8 million gods come to the bathhouse and workers serve them, worship them. In a way they deal with them, do business with them. In Asian cultures, fire, air, earth, water, food, etc. are represented as gods, so bathhouse very accurately represents a working society. The 'spell' breaks if they stop working.</li>
<li>Yubaba is the culture. She manages the bathhouse. She is tyrannical and rules over people by taking there real name and giving them a new name.</li>
<li>Chihiro was given a new name by Yubaba, 'Sen', which means 'one thousand', similar to how a person is given a roll number or employee number in an organisation. That number becomes his new identity.</li>
<li>Haku has forgotten his real name. Similar to Islamic terrorism, he's become a slave to the tyrannical culture. He'll do anything the culture tells him to do.</li>
<li>The baby is the belief system of the society. Yubaba is <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=spirited+away+yubaba+angry+fire&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""noreferrer"">overly</a> protective of him.</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing I can't understand is, who is Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Yubaba and Zeniba are two parts of a whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Yubaba keeps baby locked in a room, afraid that he might get sick because of germs. Zeniba turned baby into a mouse so that he might have a little freedom.</p></li>
<li><p>Zeniba lives in swamp bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>There used to be trains running between bathhouse and swamp bottom in old days, but the return trains from swamp bottom have stopped. Now it's a one-way road towards swamp bottom.</p></li>
<li><p>The tickets to swamp bottom Kamaji gave to Chihiro had been with him for 40 years.</p></li>
<li><p>'Zeni' has <a href=""https://shokubutsujin.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/kanji-mumblings-from-spirited-away/"" rel=""noreferrer"">two</a> meanings in Japanese, 'money' and 'ancient'. 'ba' means 'old lady'. The meaning of Zeniba which seems to fit the story is 'ancient old lady.</p></li>

"What does it take to be an alchemist, besides knowledge and technique?","<p>This is somewhat related to the question, <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/7756/why-cant-the-homunculi-perform-alchemy"">Why can&#39;t the homunculi perform Alchemy?</a></p>

<p>Alchemy is an essential part of life in the series, where not only have the State Military weaponized it, but seems to be at the center of religion and priesthood of neighbouring countries. And yet, only a handful of people practice it. If it's so essential, why can't everyone work with it? We are not experts at all the fields we use, but we use them in some limited capacity anyway. For example, we are not all doctors, but when we have fever, we pop antipyretics; we are not all computer scientists, but we can use computers in our own ways, and so on. In the FMA-universe, alchemy seems to practised by just experts.</p>

<p>We already know that sin-essenced homunculi can't perform alchemy, but Father is a Homunculus (the original one), and yet he can perform alchemy. Ordinary doctors (eg. the Rockbells) have the smarts for advanced study, but don't seem to use any alchemy. Skilled automail mechanics have specialized technical knowledge, but none of them use alchemy.</p>

<p>There are exceptional circumstances where Father blocks tectonic alchemy for everyone, or Edward giving away his portal. But why can't everyone else perform some simple alchemy? Is there an explanation for this in the manga, that is similar to Star Wars' ""midi-chlorians""?</p>

"How does Father prevent the use of alchemy in Fullmetal Alchemist?","<p>I have recently started rewatching FMA brotherhood, and noticed some things I was confused about concerning <a href=""http://fma.wikia.com/wiki/Father"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Father</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He uses the pipes to spread the Philosopher's Stone beneath the nation of Amestris. The purpose behind this is to act as a barrier between the tectonic energy of the earth's crust, <strong>where Amestrian Alchemy gets its energy from</strong>, so that he can stop others from using Alchemy at any time.</p>

<p>Emphasis mine.</p>

<p>And also </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>he placed himself under what would become Central Command and used himself as a buffer against tectonic energy so <strong>alchemists would actually use energy derived from the souls of Xerxes</strong> contained within himself.</p>

However, Ed doesn't seem to be able to perform alchemy without his automail arm working.</p>

<p>And later, in the same sequence, a scene appears without that contrast change:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/tEJhYm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I've seen this kind of contrast change in the HxH remake as well, and the first thing that comes to my mind is that legendary Pokemon episode where a lot of kids suffered of photosensitive epilepsy attacks in Japan thanks to Pikachu and Co.</p>

<p>Does it has some relationship with that or there is another reason? Maybe a new law in Japan related to these flashy images on TV?</p>

<p>It seems this change appears only in new anime (I don't remember seeing something like this before last year). Any clue around that time?</p>

<p><strong>===UPDATED===</strong></p>

<p>It's not just in the opening; here are more examples:</p>

<p>One of many scenes where the image is normal:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lGuF2m.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then comes the darker scenes. Maybe it cannot be appreciated in the snapshots, but all are a full sequence of images appearing quickly with a bright background:</p>

<p>And then it returns to normal:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WQSPhm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is from the last HxH episode. At first, the image looks fine:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGIAam.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Then comes an attack and the image looks darker. Maybe the effect is not so intense as in Shingeki no Kyojin, but it is still there. Look, all these bright flashes coming from the hits seem not as bright as they should be:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/J3g7dm.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eua2Ym.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bymHjm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And then the image looks normal again - compare the smoke color before and after:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PvSYgm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>As @JonLin notes, maybe it could be some kind of TV censorship, despite that there's nothing to censor besides all these flashy lights. Is it just me being paranoid or is there something more behind all this?</p>

<p><strong>==UPDATE 2==</strong></p>

<p>I've found a Blu-ray rip of the Shingeki no Kyojin opening (no subtitles, no credits) and I took some shots of the same frames that I already put. To the left, the TV version and to the right, the BDRip version (click for more detail):</p>

<p>So it is not an effect to make things more dramatic, but rather an effect included only on TV. I suppose the same applies to the other shots (at least in SnK).  </p>

<p>So my question comes again, why, lately, are there some anime with darkened scenes? My conspiracy theory is that it is related to those bright changes and possible photosensitive attacks. If that's true, why is this being applied lately? And why doesn't it appear on DVD/BD?<br>
If not, what else it could be?</p>

<p>Watching the last episode, I'm more or less convinced they work in the morning as Maika and the manager bump into each other at the train station and the time shown on the board was 10:23 AM. So perhaps she goes straight to work after homeroom.</p>

<p>However, in one of the episodes, she did say being held up at homeroom and being late for work. So either Maika was skipping school after doping in for attendance or they have a strange curriculum where they let students do jobs during school hours.</p>

<p>In Episode 6, when he returns, Tenjin brings it up and he wields Sekki to cut ties with her but she keeps refusing. However, it never shows him actually severing ties with her. Regardless of that, I don't think Tenjin would allow him to break his agreement. Later on in the episode, Tenjin and Tomone see Yato chasing after Hiyori and Tomone says, ""It seems they haven't severed their ties at all.""</p>

<p>Now, I'm sure that they said when a God severs ties with someone from the Near Shore they lose all memories of that person. It seems like Yato is frantically trying to get her to know him again, and she seems a little more distant than before. So, it definitely seems possible that he did sever his ties to her but then relentlessly harassed her to get her to know him again as sort of a loophole to his agreement with Tenjin. However, if that was the case, I don't understand why she would have remembered Yato was the one who helped her classmate when her classmate approached her later.</p>

<p>In episode 1, we see Kinoa and Shizuru beat up two people who appear to be guarding an entrance to the region. The character in red at the top of the tower in the top-center is 封, meaning roughly ""seal"" (as in ""isolate"").</p>

"How did professor Oak discovered Ash's pikachu?","<blockquote>
  <p>In the 4th Pokemon movie, Sam goes forward in time along with Celebi
  and then battles alongside Ash and Pikachu. After the battle, Celebi
  returns him to his timeline. At the end of the movie, it evens shows
  Oak with a picture of Pikachu drawn in the notebook, kind of
  confirming that Oak and Sam were the same person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the director's comments on the English DVD involving the voice talent, they talk about watching the original ending and being completely confused on whether it meant that Oak and Sammy were the same person or not. They note that the original is a fairly typical way for a Japanese movie to solve a similar mystery in the storyline. Once they confirmed that Oak and Sam were indeed the same person, they created the new ending to clearly show that they were the same for the English-speaking audiences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>here is the end according to <a href=""https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/M04"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bulbapedia</a>: ""Oak notices Ash's
  disheartened face and asks him what exactly is bringing him down, as
  he hasn't said a word since they began talking. Ash replies that it's
  because he made a really good friend, but now it seems they'll never
  see each other again. Professor Oak responds that true friendships can
  withstand the test of time and he's absolutely sure that he'll see Sam
  again and that even though they're separated, they'll be friends
  forever. Ash feels better from Oak's kind words and promises to tell
  him the full story when he returns to Pallet Town, and Oak remarks
  that he's looking forward to it.</p>

  have known that the boy they met was named Sam if none of them
  mentioned this?""sorry if its too long</p>

<p>When Oak gave Pikachu to ash. 
I don't think professor Oak was out of Pokemon, as he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""you are late. I am only left with one Pokemon which is very difficult to train"" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor Oak has a lot of trainer's Pokemon's so they breed together and usually give birth to new Pokemon, which are then given to trainers.</p>

<p>Professor Oak is also a Pokemon researcher, but how did this help him discover Ash's Pikachu? </p>

<p>Maybe there is something unique about ash's Pikachu, and the professor got it after some research when he traveled back into the past.</p>

<p>So I am left with the simple question: </p>

<p>How did professor Oak know this particular Pikachu belongs to Ash as he saw in the future after he returned to the past then he gave the same Pikachu to the ash to start his Pokemon Journey. Maybe sam and ash will meet again as oak said at the end of the movie in another time travel event in the coming movies or episodes and this mystery can be solved.</p>

"What exactly is the deal with Black Blades?","<p>Zoro recently (in the anime) unleashed an impressive torrent of attacks using Busoshoku (Armament) Haki infused blades. This was not all that surprising but his flashback was (to me).</p>

<p>Zoro flashed back to both his training with Dracule Mihawk and his fight with him in the Baratie arc. Mihawk's main blade, Yoru apparently, is clearly shown to be black throughout this fight and the flashback stresses the fact that it is the strongest Black Blade.  Yet, the episode seems to say that Black Blades refer to swords turning black when infused with Haki.  As Mihawk is the strongest swordsman, it seems guaranteed that the world's strongest ""Black Blade"" may or may not have anything to do with Yoru's color itself.</p>

<p>In addition, you can note that both replicas of Yoru we see (Mihawk's mini sword and the one wielded by the Mihawk-like monkey Zoro trained against) have silver blades.</p>

<p>This all leads to 3 closely inter-related questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Did I understand this right? Does ""Black Blade"" refer to the sword or the technique?</li>
<li>Did Mihawk use Haki on Zoro so early in the series?</li>
<li>Does Yoru (as we've seen it but in universe) look black, silver, or does it vary from person to person? What if Yoru is not wielded by Mihawk?</li>

<p>While I presume that Nappa's first line was just a result of a different take or a slightly different wording, I'm confused especially about how the TV version (and all previous English dubs of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, shown earlier in the video) gives Goku's power level as ""over nine thousand"", while the DVD release of Kai changes it to ""over eight thousand"". </p>

My main question involves Karasuno's team banner, with the calligraphy for <strong>Fly</strong>.  Several times this season the banner's translation is shown with the word ""Fly"" broken into two lines.  In each episode, there was obviously room for the ""y"" to appear on the same line with the rest of the word.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Was splitting it a pure mistake, possibly caused by some production issue?  I can imagine that maybe the translator was rushed and confused, or perhaps somehow could not tell that the entire word ""Fly"" would have fit on a single line.</li>
<li>Was the split done out of habit?  I've seen that Japanese is sometimes written horizontally and sometimes vertically.  Perhaps the translator just did not realize how odd it would look in English to see a 3-character word split.</li>
<li>Was the split a pure artistic choice?  It seems unlikely, but maybe there is some concept within the Japanese calligraphy that could be expressed in English by splitting the word ""Fly"".  I can sort of get it -- <strong>Fly</strong>, by its very nature, is a vertical concept.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since the same frame contained Aoba Johsai's banner, I might as well ask the opposite question concerning it.  Why did the translators not split the word ""Court"" from the rest of the slogan so that it would appear below ""Rule the""?  This would allow the translation to not overflow the banner, as well as avoid a partial overwrite of a second calligraphic character.</p>

<p>The cinematography of the banners here is interesting. They are intentionally juxtaposed thematically, not as they actually were placed in the stadium. Perhaps the key is not in the individual slogans, but in the viewing them as a set.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if for some reason the relevant legitimate or de facto authorities of Japan didn't want to execute Lelouch and Nunnally (pity, morality, attempt at using them as double agents or whatever), why didn't Lelouch or someone decide to have his and Nunnally's (fake) deaths made known rather than making Clovis, Euphemia, Cornelia, et al merely presume or suspect their deaths?</p>

<p>Could be remembering the series wrong, but it seems like they guessed Lelouch and Nunnally were dead rather than, say, found out from Japanese news. If I were one of them, I would find it suspicious that the Japanese authorities didn't execute or announce that they executed them.</p>

"Why was ""Gold Wedding Ring"" displayed for less than a second?","<p>One scene of <em>Yuri on Ice</em> (YoI) displays a register receipt from a jewelry store.  For less than a second, possibly even as short as a few frames, most of the receipt is visible, and it is clear Yuri is about to purchase a <strong>Gold Wedding Ring</strong>. Immediately the bulk of the receipt becomes masked by Yuri's credit card. At the beginning of time code 13:26 of <a href=""http://www.crunchyroll.com/yuri-on-ice/episode-10-gotta-supercharge-it-pre-grand-prix-final-special-721639"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 10</a> a lucky freeze-frame can capture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ckvo0.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ckvo0.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>After that instant, the only significant receipt info which remains unmasked is the price, 768.94 €.</p>

<p>Is there a verifiable reason the exact nature of this purchase is almost hidden from the viewer?</p>

<p>In the English subtitles, Yuri refers to it as simply a ""luck charm"".  There is a <a href=""http://spurisani.tumblr.com/post/154207813929/okay-i-fully-understand-everyones-excitement"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tumblr post</a> which explains that the term in Japanese is ""omamori"" and has a deeper meaning than a non-Japanese speaker would associate with ""luck charm"".  (I have no direct knowledge that this post is accurate, but it feels right.) So those in Japan would apparently get much more out of this scene, even if they could not read the receipt.</p>

<p>Within hours (probably minutes) of episode 10 airing, there were people posting the information on this receipt.  It is likely that, even though the details would slip by the vast majority of viewers, any internet-savvy <em>YoI</em> fan would know what the receipt said. So the scene seems to be intentionally hiding information, but with the knowledge that it will be revealed by the fans. Does this confuse anyone else?</p>

<p>Also, can anyone read the first word on the line with ""Gold Wedding Ring""?  I think it starts with an ""F"" but I cannot make it out, even in a sharpened version of the image. (The video was viewed, and image captured, at 1080p resolution, expanded to full screen on my 1920x1080 display.)</p>

<p>And after that, Natsume was forcibly tied by Suzuka in order for them to visit Her room.

Curiously, Suzuka tried to forcibly open the closet by removing the barrier. Then Natsume desperately crawled going to her room with tears in her face showing her great fear of Suzuka opening the closet and them knowing the contents inside.</p>

"How come Moro is stronger than Berus?","<p>I feel Moro has plot armor right now…
Dragon Ball Super Chapter 46 dropped this week, showing Moro make quick work of both Goku and Vegeta as the two tried to stop the evil wizard while on Namek. The duo were already worn out after Moro's absorption technique prevented them from turning Super Saiyan, but things went from bad to worse once he drained almost all of their energy by grabbing them both by the neck and knocking them unconscious. After consuming their combined energy, Moro's body quickly transformed into a younger, more muscular form, and he used his newfound power to terrorize the Namekians for their Dragon Balls.</p>

<p>Given that he was able to take down two full-powered Super Saiyan Gods and has shown he can consume the energy of entire planets with his absorption technique, fans have already started asking — could he beat Beerus?</p>

<p>The God of Destruction has been the measuring stick for every Dragon Ball villain ever since he first arrived in Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, and he has been shown to be much stronger than both Goku and Vegeta even in their Super Saiyan Blue forms with his Hakai ability.</p>

<p>So could Moro stand up to something like that? Well the manga gives a convincing argument when it shows that he is not only able to absorb energy from lifeforms around him, but also from energy attacks that are launched at him. Vegeta learned that firsthand in the latest chapter when he consumed a Galick Gun blast.</p>

<p>If Moro were able to consume Beerus' God Ki, or somehow absorb the force of a Hakai attempt, his power would likely spike to levels never seen before.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, it's possible Beerus would see this coming. While he opted not to help Namek during the ongoing fight, he hasn't confirmed whether he knows who Moro is -- he was first captured 10 million years ago, but Beerus is roughly 200 million years old. If he does, he'd likely know not to waste time with energy attacks and would use his Ultra Instinct Omen ability to fight in hand-to-hand combat.</p>

"Why was anime produced on 24fps film, when Japan is a NTSC country?","<p>Nowadays, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NTSC</a> isn't really all that relevant anymore since Japan ended analogue television almost a decade ago. But for most of the history of the anime industry, that's how it was broadcast.</p>

<p>Then it strikes me as really odd that the film was shoot at 24fps. To prepare 24fps video for NTSC broadcast, it would have to go through <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-two_pull_down"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3:2 pull down</a>, which results in both interlaced frames and changes in frame timing.</p>

<p>Why was it not produced at 30fps instead, which fits much better with NTSC? Surely all that interlacing can't be good?</p>

<p>The basic animation modes should stay the same, shooting on twos (12 cels per second) is easily handled as shooting on twos (15cps) or threes (10cps) at 30fps, and shooting on threes (8cps) is easily either threes (10cps) or fours (7.5cps)</p>

<p>How can one's thoughts and beliefs be same as their doubts? I can't seem to understand this sentence. One of the biggest reasons I watch Naruto is because of its extraordinary philosophical background.</p>

<p>My reasoning on this quote: Children who grew up in war prone areas always doubt if they deserve to live on this planet or some form of source that ends the suffering. So, here their doubts are, <em>is there really a chance for me to live without pain?</em> An intuitive assertion being that, such a form of life will be impossible and cannot exist and the only way to live is to try and survive against all odds and doing whatever it takes. This enters their belief system and intern imparts their thoughts making them accept the fact that life is not fair for them. Is this interpretation correct or is there a different one? </p>

<p>Sorry but I read the following part in a wiki. Zangetsu tells Ichigo that the Zanpakuto is physical representation of Ichigo's power, and Ichigo remembers its red ribbon from his friend.</p>

<p>This is where I get a little confused. In one episode, Toshiro and another guy had same dream about the sword and both wielded the sword for a short time. The Soul Society then decided only one can wield him. <strong>However, if the Zanpakuto is a part of a shinigami, then how can two people have same power?

"Does anime with more ecchi scene pays their seiyuu more compared to the non-ecchi anime?","<p>Seeing Citrus anime that aired Winter 2018 season made me thinking. This anime has so many ecchi scene. Yuzu and Mei kissed and did so many perverted acts.</p>

<p>Had this been boy-girl kissing scene it might be considered okay and normal enough. Problem is, Yuzu and Mei are both female, thus their kissing scenes are ecchi enough. Taketatsu Ayana (Yuzu's seiyuu) and Tsuda Minami (Mei's seiyuu) would have to make lots of perverted noises for those scenes.</p>

<p>This reminds me that High School DxD also has Itou Shizuka (Himejima Akeno's seiyuu) and Hikasa Youko (Ria's Gremory's seiyuu) make lots of similar noises for the recording.</p>

<p>While Itou Shizuka is also well known to be a seiyuu for Eroge, even she was embarrassed when she had to do many perverted noises during recording in front of many other seiyuus (read it somewhere but forget where, will update with link if I can find the said article again). Itou-san went as far as crying to Asakawa Yuu (provider of Megurine Luka vocaloid, also seiyuu for many Eroge) due to the embarrassment.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that both Itou-san and Asakawa-san used pseudonym for Eroge voicing. This suggest that such a work is not really desirable or at least it definitely is not at the top of desirable jobs to do. You don't have Hanazawa Kana do Eroge voicing now, do you?</p>

<p>Now, returning to Citrus, Taketatsu Ayana and Tsuda Minami was not a fresh, newly graduated seiyuu. They have worked in the industry for quite a long time and has built name for themselves.</p>

<p>Does this means that anime with many perverted scenes pays their seiyuu more?</p>

After watching the episode, most of the viewers commented that Obito ""was defeated"" even though he had the Rinnegan. But wasn't it because Obito <strong><em>""let""</em></strong> Kakashi win to undo Madara's Seal (as we see in <strong>chapter 675</strong>, Obito gets to know about the seal and wishes to undo it) and become the Ten Tails Jinchuuriki? Also, I wanted to know that would Kakashi (a <strong><em>non-Uchiha and a non-Senju</em></strong>) have been able to <strong>actually</strong> defeat Obito?

"No. 17 official status","<p>Be aware that this question contain spoilers from episode 127, 128 and 130.</p>

<p>So in episode 127 it was shown that 17 self sacrificed in order to save Goku and Vegeta. This resulted in referee saying that they could <strong>assume</strong> that he self destructed which resulted in Jiren getting no penalty. Is this correctly translated from japanese? Hence meaning that the referee indicates that 17 wasn't officially eliminated. In the godpad he was also never removed by the Zenos. </p>

<p>In episode 128 when Vegeta dropped out we were only shown a part of the godpad, the top row. 17 is on the bottom row, meaning there is no official status about it yet.</p>

<p>In episode 130 he makes a return. Were the previous episodes made like that in japanese as well (text wise) in order to indicate that 17 is still in the tournament? Or was he officially eliminated making his current status exactly what? </p>

<p>I find this extremely confusing as in the past there had been some translation errors meaning that a sentence can hold a different meaning from the original intended one. As far as I can tell he was never officially removed, meaning referee and Zenos were aware of this and didn't remove him. Or are they surprised and were they perhaps unaware, meaning that there was an error of judgement on their side?</p>

"Are there any differences between normal anime compared to Netflix original series's anime?","<p>Recently, more and more <em>Netflix original series</em> (anime) pop up in my feed and so far, all of them are of extremely high quality. This goes in audio, visuals and usually story as well. Most of them are fairly unique compared to the mainstream ones. </p>

<p>So what I am curious about is if these are different from <em>normal</em> series. Like, do they have limitations for publication? For example, most series in Japan are for Japan only and are only able to leave the country through shipping DVDs or illegal streaming services. Is a Netflix original basically the same without any limits for publication? </p>

<p>What about production costs? Are those covered by Netflix and is the cast for example appointed by Netflix or does Netflix maybe have their own teams behind the shows? </p>

<p>Normally I wouldn't be bothered by this, but I have noticed a significant difference in quality from the big hits in Japan and Netflix original series.

"How many students are there at Hagun Academy?","<p>After watching <em>Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry</em>, I found myself confused by what seems to be a plot hole. Specifically, the anime depicts the qualifying matches at Hagun academy for the Seven Stars Sword Art tournament. The qualifying matches seem to be a 20-round single-elimination tournament with 6 winners. This is never outright stated, but many points of dialogue suggest this rather strongly, and at the very least it is stated explicitly in the last episode of the anime that all of the competitors on the last day had won 19 matches.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>By basic math, a single-elimination tournament with 6 winners and 20 rounds would imply that there are about 6.3 million entrants to the qualifying tournament. That number of students at the school seems to be effectively impossible. For comparison, the population of New York City is about 8 million people, and the total number of high school students in Japan in 2011 was about 3.5 million. So this seems unreasonably large as an absolute number.</p>

<p>In addition, the number is too large relative to the size of the school. The area of Hagun Academy is said to be more than 10 times the size of the Tokyo Dome (according to <a href=""http://rakudai-kishi.wikia.com/wiki/Hagun_Academy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://rakudai-kishi.wikia.com/wiki/Hagun_Academy</a>); using that figure, the average population density would be about 5 people per square meter (more than 100 times as dense as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the most dense city</a> in the world). In addition, we've gotten aerial shots of the school, and while large, it isn't nearly big enough to contain that many people.</p>

<p>I started to wonder if a super saiyan transformation can have eyes of a different color than blue, so I started to check,</p>

<p>SSJ1, USSJ, SSJ2, SSJ3, blue eyes,
SS Rage, blue eyes,
Legendary SS , blue eyes,
SS Blue, blue eyes,
SS Blue evolution, blue eyes,</p>

<p>SS Rosé, pink eyes, but I'm not sure if this counts because it comes from a half god / half saiyan,
Ultra Instinct grey eyes, but apparently this isnt a super saiyan transformation, but a form any race can get,
SSJ4 yellow eyes but it's non canon,</p>

<p>And the only one that's left is super saiyan god with red eyes, but is this transformation a real ""super saiyan"" transformation or it's just a missleading name? Super Saiyan Blue is attained by ""getting the power of a super saiyan god and transforming into a super saiyan"" . So how can you transform into a super saiyan if you already have the power of a ""super saiyan"" god? Wouldnt this mean the ""super saiyan"" god is a missleading name and it isnt a ""super saiyan"" transformation but another kind of saiyan transformation?</p>

"How do Toads in Naruto produce Oil?","<p>Toad oil as shown on Mount Myoboku was produced from a special fountain that allowed user to more easily feel the natural energy around them. This was used in the initial stages of Senjutsu training by Jiraiya and Naruto.</p>

<p>However, We've seen several combo jutsu's used by Jiraiya which rely on the Toads spitting Oil (Toad Oil Bullet). Which can be lit on fire or even mixed with both Wind and Fire Jutsu. We know toads can manipulate Chakra and are mostly affiliated with Water Style.</p>

<p>So Is the toad oil produced naturally in the Toad's stomach's or is it something that they achieve by nature manipulation (manipulating multiple chakra natures, similar to Kekkei Genkai)?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I understand ""Toad Oil"" based techniques utilize chakra, but the source of the oil is not explained. I have read the wiki entries and Wiki just states ""converts Chakra to oil"" but doesn't explain it. Is it like the Dragon Flame produced by Dragons? For an in universe example take a look at Katsuyu and her/its ability. I can see Slugs producing Slime and Katsuyu using that slime similar to that of the Mizukage's Acid Release. This is both a Nature transformation and Kekkei Genkai, while also possible naturally. <strong>Do toads naturally produce this oil, do a nature transformation, Is there any myth that attributes toad spitting oil etc. is what my question moves toward.</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, for those confused about Ying-Yang techniques and Nature Transformations should go through the wikia page and read the cited information! <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nature_transformation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Naruto Wikia - nature Transformation</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aside from the five elemental nature transformations, there is a second kind of nature transformation that are the source of all non-elemental techniques such as the Shadow Imitation Technique, Multi-Size Technique, medical ninjutsu, genjutsu, etc. There is Yin Release (陰遁, Inton), based on the imagination and spiritual energy of a shinobi, and Yang Release (陽遁, Yōton), based on the vitality and physical energy of a shinobi. Together, they are used to perform Yin–Yang Release (陰陽遁, In'yōton, Onmyōton). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can't just club any random technique to be Ying/Yang.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Update:</strong> <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Nature_transformation#Trivia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trivia section of Wikia for the Nature transformation</a> gave an interesting lead.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Techniques such as the <em>Toad Oil Bullet and the Poison Mist</em> mention ""converting"" or ""kneading"" chakra into materials or substances, <em>but have never been mentioned to use certain chakra natures.</em> </p>

Besides a girlfriend, he dreams of having a persocom (パソコン?): an android used as a personal computer, which is expensive. On his way home one evening, he stumbles across a persocom in the form of a beautiful girl with floor-length hair lying against a pile of trash bags, and he carries her home, <strong>not noticing that a disk fell on the ground</strong>.

<p>They joined the council after Hiruzen becomes The Third Hokage. According to naruto <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wiki:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Hiruzen became the Third Hokage, Homura and Koharu became his
  councillors. With their years of experience and knowledge and their
  unending effort to make Konohagakure a better place, they eventually
  gained similar respect and social status as the Hokage himself.</p>

<p>But it is known that before that, they're member of <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Team_Tobirama"" rel=""noreferrer"">Team Tobirama</a>, that also included Sarutobi Hizuren and Tobirama himself.

"How can Naruto characters teleport/disappear?","<p>In the manga/anime, it appears as if teleportation is very rare. The few we know that gets a little bit explained are, for example, Minato (4th Hokage) and Obito (Tobi).</p>

<p>Despite of this, a lot of characters (mainly in the anime) ""disappear"" with a flashy exit when they wish. Orochimaru does this a couple of times, including others. Often with a phrase such as ""I don't have time to play around with you any more"" and then <em>poof</em>, gone!</p>

<p>Is there some explanation to this? Do they use a clone and then run off while the clone says goodbye to the opponent? If that is the case, when do they create the clone?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Just to be a bit more clear, I was wondering specifically with the colors used in these particular style line drawings, where the lines seemed to be color coded. For example, given this animatic, the first sketch has color used in shading and hue, but the middle picture shows the color coded line art, where the tears are red and the eyes are blue.</p>

"How are anime soundtracks made for a story?","<p>So say there is a manga. Now who comes up with the soundtrack and composes that according to the anime?</p>

<p>Many many soundtracks (instrumental) are masterpieces, and just as equally or even more amazingly they are composed with story to have even more effect. I want to know more about the whole process.</p>

<p>I know how they draw manga from a story, and animate (which is extremely tedious in itself). </p>

<p>But when it comes to soundtrack I am completely clueless. Obviously a studio or an artist is paid to create soundtracks but what's their process?</p>

<ol>
<li>How do they decide what it should sound like?</li>
<li>How do they actually create it and is there a process?</li>
<li>How do the people who create this get training for it?</li>
</ol>

<p>In the soundtracks that I have heard, they don't seem limited by instruments. Melodies are perfect, or composed perfectly. They often have human voices mixed with them, like <a href=""https://youtu.be/W1m43i4WK1A?t=4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, <a href=""https://youtu.be/x-xpMRCnJRE?t=30"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> or <a href=""https://youtu.be/K59ADImvpEU?t=192"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>.</p>

"Why is Princess Reiners called a monster?","<p>We got introduced to Princess Reiners in season 2, episode 1, and we were given flashes in the ending theme that she had a dark personality. This was later confirmed in episodes 9 and 10 when her brother, Prince Zanac, calls her a monster to her face. When she turned around, she had the anime crazy face, but didn't actually change form into a literal monster of any kind.</p>

<p>Over on the MAL forum for <a href=""https://myanimelist.net/forum/?topicid=1716976"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 12</a>, they simply refer to her as a yandere.

Aside from her dark personality / face twisting, and the fact that she plans out big, complicated, moves, I don't understand what the big deal is. Why would she be called a monster? How would anyone else in Yggdrasil would know that she is a ""monster""? Or is she a monster in a literal sense?</p>

"Can Natsu Dragneel use Dragonforce and Lightning flame Dragon mode at the same time?","<p>I've just read all the way to the most recent manga chapter which is chapter 466 of fairy tail and Natsu has just used, and seemingly lost, the Dragon King Mode. It seems that all hope is lost for the fairy tail mages since natsu has now depleted the Dragon King mode and the guild has lost their trump card to defeat zeref.</p>

<p>Here is my question. Can Natsu theoretically combine the Dragon Force with his lightning flame dragon mode in sort of a stacking kind of way? From what I understand about Dragon Force it is the most powerful transformation that a dragon slayer can take and puts their overall power on par with an actual dragon. It increases their strength, speed, power, senses and their overall magic power to unimaginable heights. Now from what I know about Lightning Flame Dragon Mode it increases the strength of natsu's attacks as well as grants him the ability to use Laxus' lightning to increase the power of his magic related attacks.</p>

<p>Here's the thing, it seems to me that Dragonforce is a full on transformation that can be utilized by the dragon slayers but it seems as though Lightning Flame Dragon Mode is more a power up that Natsu can use to finish a fight quickly rather than being a full on transformation. So it seems that it would only be logical that Natsu would be able to enter Dragonforce and then power up utilizing LFDM to end a fight with zeref quickly. If he could utilize both would this put him on par with the Dragon King Mode and would it be enough to defeat zeref who was almost critically wounded by the Dragon King mode?</p>

<p>Since Madara came, he was using only Sharingan, and this can be seen until 07:43 in the picture, while he was dodging Gaara's sand attacks.

"Nami look-alike in episode 144","<p>In episode 144, around 15:45 of <em>One Piece</em>, while salvaging the ship of a navigator that fell from the sky, Sanji came across a picture. The woman in the picture looked almost exactly like Nami.</p>

"How can reanimated bodies get their eyes back?","<p>Okay, this question comes up in my mind most of the time. Considering the basic law on life and death: when a body part is taken from a dead body, it can never get that back. But in Naruto, many reanimated ninjas had lost their eye of some or the other reason (Sharingan, Rinnegan and Byakugan mainly).</p>

<p>As far as I know, Sasuke has taken Itachi's eyes to awaken his powers. So then how could Itachi get his Sharingan back when Kabuto reanimated him? Is there any kind of logic behind this which I've missed out? Or is that some law in the shinobi world? Obito had taken over Nagato's Rinnegan, yet Nagato had the Rinnegan when he was reanimated. Considering the power of Rinnegan which creates stuff, there hasn't been any scene where Sharingan and other eyes of Rinnegan were created and transplanted into Itachi and Nagato.</p>

"Why do most Naruto villains end up not just being bad guys to be hated?","<p>Is there a reason why almost all Naruto villains end up having very good excuses for becoming villains and start being seen as fighting for a different cause as opposed to just being the bad guys who need to be killed? What I mean by this question is that, why do Naruto ""villains"" never play the role of the standardized ""bad guy"", but instead introduce a new and different struggle from their point of view? Instead of having one clear person to hate and criticize their actions, you end up with two very different view points, never a good vs evil kind of situation, but more of a clash of opinions.</p>

So couldn't a Koukaku ghoul also be extremely fast? I mean, Kaneki had that heavy hitting centipede Half-Kakuja that was huge, and he was still so fast, he was running on the freaking ceiling! So I think it's possible if they were very strong, and if they had a pretty lightweight kagune, they could be fast, too.

</ul>

<p>Could anyone list other similarities and when doing so, state where the similarity is mentioned: manga, anime or both? Also, could you prove or disprove the East Blue and Supernova cases? </p>

<hr>

<p>The similarities could just mean that the two are extremely like-minded individuals or it could mean that they are related.</p>

<p>While in prison, Roger asks Garp to take care of his unborn son, Ace. From this, it is obvious that there's a strong bond between the two. Is the relationship based only on deep trust or are the Gol and Monkey families related? Basically,</p>

<p><strong>2. Is Roger related by blood to Garp, and in turn, to Luffy?</strong></p>

<p>A search on the web doesn't yield much, but from threads like <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/324oi4/monkey_d_garp_and_gol_d_roger_relation_relatives/"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>this</strong></a>, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1hsk27/one_piece_monkey_d_garp_is_the_father_of_gol_d/"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>this</strong></a> and <a href=""http://www.arlongpark.net/showthread.php?t=28925"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>this</strong></a>, a few likely possibilities(barring all supernatural theories) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Roger is Garp's brother or brother-in-law.</li>
<li>Roger is Garp's son or son-in-law.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the relationship had been revealed explicitly, Wikipedia and Wikia would have the answer. Since it's not, has it ever been implied indirectly, anywhere in the manga/anime that Roger and Luffy are blood relatives?</p>

<hr>

<p>Since the answer to the above question might possibly be 'no' (at least for the time being), the ages of the people involved will be helpful pointers to accord with or negate theories about how Roger and Luffy could be related, to form one's own theories, or to refute the very idea that they are related. As of now, only <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/User:Yatanogarasu/Age,_Height,_and_Birthday"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Luffy's and Ace's ages</strong></a> are known, which leads to my third question,</p>

<p><strong>3. What are Garp's, Roger's, Rouge's and Dragon's ages?</strong></p>

<p>As with the second question, there's no answer in any online encyclopedia. </p>

<p>But some statements found on the Wikia pages are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Thirty years ago, he* fought Chinjao and earned his hatred after denting his pointy head and robbing him of the means to acquire
  a certain treasure.</p></li>
  <li><p>It would seem that he** had been around for some time, considering that Brook refers to him as a rookie, more than 50 years
  before the current storyline.</p></li>
  <li><p>Twelve years before the current storyline, Dragon returned to his home in the Goa Kingdom and witnessed the burning of the Gray
  Terminal.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>*Garp<br>
**Roger  </p>

<p>Have there been other time related statements in the manga/anime in relation to these four people that could be used to make a rough estimate of their ages? </p>

<hr>

<p>My apologies regarding the lengthy question.I put in all the facts that I know so that if anyone answers this question, the things I already know will be skipped. A hardcore One Piece fan will probably be able to answer. Also, my knowledge about the series is mostly limited to the Wikia and Wikipedia pages.</p>

It expands the closing song of the anime, <em>Fighter</em>, into a 6-minute music video, produced by the manga's author Chika Umino and the band BUMP OF CHICKEN.</p>

<p>I may have that backwards, though. The video may have pre-dated the anime by over a year, making the closing song a condensed version of the music video.  From what I can gather, a DVD with the video accompanied special copies of the 10th volume of the manga, released 28 Nov 2014.  The anime was announced 25 Sep 2015. If the music video pre-dated the anime, <strong>who animated it?</strong> Studio Shaft (producing the TV show) may not have even been involved.</p>

<p><strong>add:</strong> The music video definitely predates the anime.  It was posted to YouTube on 8 Dec 2014.</p>

<p>Much of the art in the music video looks like it may have come from the anime (and a lot does not), but that could just be that they both share the manga as source material.  Also <strong>was the music video made in Flash?</strong>  Parts of it have that mechanistic feel, but I do not know enough about Flash video capability to know if it would have been up to the task.</p>

"Could an Ukaku ghoul beat a Rinkaku ghoul?","<p>So, when Kaneki tried to eat Hide, Touka took him on, and, according to Yoshimura, beat the *#@$ out of him. However, I feel like it wasn't a fair fight, seeing as Kaneki didn't know anything about how to use his kagune, what type of kagune Touka had, or even what types he was weak against. so, inexperienced and untrained as he was, Kaneki was obviously no match for someone who was familiar with their kagune and knew how to use it, therefore Touka had a guaranteed victory. However, if a experienced Rinkaku ghoul and an experienced Ukaku ghoul went for each others throats, who would win in the end? Ukaku ghouls have their speed and long-range projectiles, but don't have the stamina to match. Meanwhile Rinkaku ghouls have their sturdiness and extremely fast regeneration, but brittle, fragile kagune due to their RC Cells being more similar to liquids than that of other ghouls. Ukaku ghouls are weak against Koukaku ghouls, and strong against Bikaku ghouls. Rinkaku ghouls are weak against Bikaku ghouls, and strong against Koukaku ghouls. Who would win in a death match between the two?</p>

"Who leaked info on section 9's kidnapping of Mr. Serano?","<p><strong>- tl;dr Version -</strong></p>

<p>How did information of Section 9's involvement with the second kidnapping of Mr. Serano, which happened in episode 23 of GitS:SAC, get leaked to the media? I can't find any source online that clarifies this.</p>

<p><strong>- Longer Version -</strong></p>

<p>In episode 23 of GitS:SAC, Major Kusanagi uses the memories she obtained from the Laughing Man to stage a second kidnapping of Mr. Serano under the guise of the Laughing Man himself in order to verify the connection between Serano Genomics and Secretary General Yakushima. During the kidnapping, Major Kusanagi impersonated the Laughing Man perfectly because, well, she <strong>was</strong> the Laughing Man for all intents and purposes. However, the degree to which the rest of Section 9 was filled in on this plot seems to be vague. Throughout the episode you can see the rest of Section 9 trying hard to ""arrest the laughing man"", though it's conceivable that this could have all been part of Section 9's plan.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not the rest of Section 9 was filled in on this plan, how on earth did the media find out that it was the Major who impersonated the Laughing Man and kidnapped Mr. Serano? At most only the members of Section 9 knew about this (and possibly the Laughing Man himself I suppose), so who leaked the information? One possibility is that Major's girly eyes gave it away, as is slightly indicated at the beginning of episode 24 when Chief Aramaki and Togusa are in the car, but that seems like a silly way for the news to be leaked. In the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex_episodes"" rel=""noreferrer"">GitS:SAC wiki page</a>, it's claimed that Secretary General Yakushima, the guy who this entire Laughing Man plot is focused on putting to justice, found out that Section 9 was behind the kidnapping and so leaked that info to the media (which played a very big role in the rest of the story). But how would Yakushima have known about that? Who told him?</p>

<p>What's really weird about all this is that in the beginning of episode 24, Chief Aramaki tells nearly everybody in Section 9 to ""find out where news of our op was leaked from."" But nobody ever seems to give an answer to this!</p>

"How exactly is the Eye of the Moon Plan supposed to work?","<p>First, I am wondering how exactly does this plan work in the Narutoverse? </p>

<p>When everyone is under the genjutsu, does that mean no one is actually living their own life? Or do people live their lives and the usage of the genjutsu just eliminates pain, suffering, and war?</p>

<p>Will the people starve to death under this technique? And if not, are they able to reproduce? And if they can do the above two, will this technique eventually cease when Madara/Obito die? </p>

<p>I'm just wondering if life can still continue under this technique? If so, does the technique ever stop?</p>

<p>Now on a more (deeper) philosophical level, how is this plan any different from Pain's total destruction plan? Both goals of the two plans are the same. They both want to end pain, suffering, and war.</p>

<p>Pain wanted to cause destruction to achieve his goal. Obito / Madara wants to put the whole world under a genjutsu to achieve their goal, and they are willing to cause total destruction in the process. Is there any real difference in outcomes? </p>

<p>The way I see it, pain is inevitable in human life. So then why bother with the Eye of the Moon plan if you can just kill the entire planet. I'm going to assume that if they have what it takes to execute this plan, they also have what it takes to just blow up the planet / eliminate all living beings.</p>

<p>This then leads me to believe that Madara and Obito just have psychological problems. Is this the reason why they are proceeding with this crazy plan?</p>

"Are Watari and Kaori a couple by the time she is hospitalized after missing the gala violin concert?","<p>One of the reasons Kousei uses to rationalize never making a move on Kaori (and the real reason being his indecisiveness, in my opition) is that she is Watari's girl/romantic interest.</p>

<p>Watari and Kaori are never shown as a couple, or even having anything between them beyond friendship, when they are together onscreen. Kaori doesn't seem to even give Watari the time of the day.</p>

<p>In episode 17, he tells Kousei ""For the woman I love, I would drink even muddy water"", while trying to usher him into visiting Kaori. His attempt at pushing Kousei into going there seems a perfectly fine wingman behavior, so I am quite confused.</p>

<p>So, there are a couple unknowns here:</p>

<p>In the fist episode, it is clearly stated that Watari has an interest in Kaori (and it is what starts the whole ""Friend A"" Kousei's self-demeaning thought train). Did they move forward?</p>

<p>Is Watari really wingmanning Kousei when he tells him to go visit her?</p>

"When did otaku become a derogatory term?","<p><em>Related: <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/3410"">Is the term Otaku derogatory?</a></em></p>

<hr>

<p>I have been reading <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0804848882"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The Moe Manifesto</em></a> lately, and noticed in a lot of the interviews, the term <em>otaku</em> was never really used in a derogatory form.</p>

<p>One of the interviews in particular mentioned something about otaku only becoming a derogatory term <em>after</em> some serial killer, which was found vaguely related to the anime culture, killed a bunch of children. However I could not find any credible online sources to confirm this.</p>

<p>This does however raise my question, when did <em>otaku</em> become a derogatory term?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Actually now that i started to look into it a bit it seems it has always been a derogatory term at least in Japan, but the situation seems to improve nowdays - <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/users/27678/proxy"">Proxy</a> </p>

  <p><strong><em>patrick w galbraith</em></strong><br>
  how should we define otaku?  </p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Otsuka Eiji</em></strong><br>
  To tell the truth, I dont really know. The word otaku was first used by writer <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akio_Nakamori"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nakimori Akio</a> in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_Burikko"" rel=""noreferrer"">manga Burikko</a>, back in 1983 when I was in my twenties and working as the magazines editor. It was the first time the term was publicly used to refer to enthusiastic manga and anime fans...</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>patrick w galbraith</em></strong><br>
  Why do you think Nakamori chose this particular word to refer to Japanese fans?</p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Otsuka Eiji</em></strong><br>
  The term otaku is a second person pronoun equivalent to you. It was used among scifi fans in the 1970s. By the 1980s the market for manga and anime had expanded and it supported a wide variety of specialty magazine, which provided space for new artist to work in niches.</p>

"Does Nenene Sumiregawa seem like a Kansai-jin?","<p>In the anime <em>R.O.D the TV</em>, one of the principal characters is Nenene
Sumiregawa, a famous author with an unusual personality for Japan:
quick-tempered, brash, outspoken, defiant.</p>

<p>She lives in Tokyo now, and we learn very little about her past, but I’m
wondering if she’s being portrayed as someone originally from Kansai. It
seems to fit her personality better than the more cultured/repressed
Tokyo style. I would guess it also fits her voice, because her <em>seiyuu</em>,
Satsuki Yukino, hails from Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture, in the Kansai region.</p>

things: Does she sound like she speaks Kansai-ben (possibly influenced
by several years in Tokyo)? Does she act like a Kansai-jin? Is she a
character that most Japanese viewers would immediately recognize as
being from Kansai?</p>

"Who generally owns the rights for a manga or anime?","<p>Who generally owns the intellectual property (IP) rights to manga characters and stories?</p>

<p>In the USA, comic books are generally produced by a team -- writer, artist, inker, colorist, letterer, editor, and maybe even plotter. Sometimes one or more of these folks can sometimes even get replaced mid-issue. The characters are typically part of a shared universe involving multiple, interacting characters. It makes sense that Marvel and DC, the largest publishers would own the IP.</p>

<p>It also makes sense that some of the artistic folks would want full ownership and control over their work, and independent publishers were formed allowing this. The leading publishers partially adapted to this desire, and sometimes grant limited exclusivity to the creator of a character. Ownership was still with the publisher, but only the creator could make decisions concerning their character, so long as they remained with the publisher.</p>

<p>From what I understand, manga is vastly different. One person handles writing, art, and lettering.  There is no colorist, and the publisher's editor generally suggests things, not mandates them. Characters from different manga seldom interact. With the one-person focus, it would make sense to me that the mangaka would hold IP rights. Is this generally the case?</p>

<p>Anime is broader, involving many folks for one series. Are they simply licensed to tell the mangaka's (or some other person's) story? (Maybe this is similar to how Fox is licensed to make X-Men movies, even though the X-Men themselves belong to Marvel.) I know some anime is a new work not based on a manga or light novel. In those cases, the studio <strong>is</strong> the creator, and it is likely they own the IP as well.</p>

"Why was the world of SAO not dominated by good real-life fencers?","<p>There are many people in real life who practice fencing for fun. Most of them (at least most of those around me) also play computer games about fighting. Sword Art Online clearly fits into the fighting genre of computer games. I didn't make a survey, but in any game about fencing it is certainly possible to find someone who likes do the same things in real life.</p>

<p>As I recall, in the world of SAO combos are quick, but very predictable, especially the strong ones, and their speed is not above human limits.</p>

<p>As I assume, if one real-life swordsman would get his hands (or his mind) on SAO, he would wreck everyone. One can move his weapon without combos, losing some speed, but getting a huge advantage of being able to use feints. Plus he would be able to stop his attacks to block enemy's blow, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, he would probably be weaker at the beginning due to not knowing the animations yet and most of combos being very short. Plus, he would probably need to get used to the pace of SAO, which may differ from real-life. But at higher levels he could both identify a combo by it's first ""frames"", plus quickly react. It would also be nearly impossible to hit him unless he doesn't expect an attack.</p>

<p>One could claim that he would lose muscle memory -- he wouldn't, since this process is more mental rather then some change applied to muscles.</p>

<li>He takes her to his village to help her recover. His village is connected by bridges to a dangerous, carnivorous forest on one side, and an industrialized desert on the other side.</li>
<li><p>The boy's father is slowly becoming a tree.</p></li>
<li><p>It turns out that the girl is from the same civilization, the apocalypse destroyed much of the world, and the people of her city were preserved in pods underwater. She came back to life hundreds of years in the future to a low-tech society.</p></li>
<li>The people of her time used Ribbon (pronounced Ri-BONE) technology in much the same way we use Apple Watches and Google Glass. It's like a cross between a holographic smartphone and a necklace. Or bracelet(?) I forgot.</li>
<li>The girl and anyone else who has come back from that time, is viewed as dangerous and is killed by bounty hunters from outside the village. They collect their Ribbons as trophies, but the bounty hunters can't use them because the Ribbon is bound to its user.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the story gets a little fuzzy:</p>

<ul>
<li>The girl ends up riding on a train to the industrial desert city. She is valuable to them somehow.</li>
<li>The city has huge steampunk beasts used for war.</li>

"What is the significance (or lack thereof) of Nausicaa's broken sword?","<p>I just finished reading the first volume of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. There was a scene that confused me in an earlier part of the book. I don't remember the page numbers.</p>

<p>When Princess Kushana lands her gunship in the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaa rushes in and challenges one of the soldiers to a duel (essentially). After the situation is defused by Master Yupa, Kushana asks if she can see Nausicaa's sword. Nausicaa hands over her sword, Kushana admires it for a moment and then cuts it to pieces with her own sword. There doesn't seem to be much of a reaction from Nausicaa or her people when this happens and the fact that Kushana destroyed the sword is never mentioned again.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is, why is the act of Kushana breaking the sword not more significant? Apparently the sword was made of ohmu shell, which is supposed to be tougher than the ceramic blades used by most soldiers (evidenced when Nausicaa chips her ceramic blade on an ohmu shell in one of the first scenes of the book). Furthermore, ohmu shell swords must be incredibly rare, considering that Kushana (who is the <em>princess of a large empire</em>) would be carrying an ""inferior"" ceramic blade. Wouldn't that sword be like a family heirloom or something?</p>

<p>The only explanation that I can think of is that the scene is purely intended to set up what a badass Kushana is and that Nausicaa is not upset because it is a small price to pay to get the Torumekian forces to leave peacefully.</p>

<p>Note: I have only read the first volume, which ends shortly after Asbel gets shot down by Kushana's gunship. I don't care about spoilers if you need them in your answers, so fire away. I have not watched the anime either.</p>

"End of Evangelion - Why does Misato dissolve into LCL and why did Asuka re-materialize?","<p>These thoughts keep me awake at night:</p>

<p>After Misato is shot in the back while helping Shinji get to Unit 01- the elevator closes, she falls over, talks to herself/the deceased Kaji, Rei/Lilith/Adam appears above Misato and then there is an explosion.
But if the frame is paused at the right moment- you can see her body is in two separate pieces- however later there is a shot with her jacket in a puddle of LCL. Video for reference: <a href=""https://youtu.be/63UIBoIF3mY?t=6m30s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://youtu.be/63UIBoIF3mY?t=6m30s</a></p>

<p>I'm confused because one of the SEELE guys seemed very determined to remain alive until instrumentality occurred- He grins happily right before dissolving into LCL- and in the puddle of his LCL, his clothes and what looks like to be many medical devices that were keeping him alive into old age remains.
From what I understand- during instrumentality, only <em>living</em> things dissolved into LCL (So SEELE guy had all the medical devices, Kaji didn't dissolve, etc).
<strong>So I'm wondering why Misato dissolved into LCL because it looks like the explosion killed her.</strong>
I'm guessing it's possible that her jacket is just in a random puddle of LCL and she didn't actually dissolve- and her body could be off-screen.</p>

<p>As far as Asuka goes- at the end, her and Shinji re-materialize from the LCL as they will to. But she was killed by the mass-production eva units. I would assume that she also did not dissolve into LCL but then <strong>why did Asuka re-materialize if she was not a part of instrumentality?</strong></p>

<p>I realize the director, Hideaki Anno, says there are no ""right answers"" to the meaning of the movie but I am wondering if there are any clarifications to these questions.
And please correct me if I'm incorrect on any of the above because I'm sure I have a few misunderstandings :)</p>

"Is Hawk Wandle's Reincarnation?","<p>Hawk has the same clover-shaped mark as Wandle did. Also, their personalities are rather similar, causing Meliodas to mistake Hawk for Wandle. They both have a strong passion for something (Wandle: shiny things, Hawk: scraps), get annoyed by certain habits that Meliodas has (Wandle: littering, Hawk: doing perverted things to Elizabeth), and are talking animals. While a talking parrot isn't completely abnormal, a talking pig is (many people ask Hawk why he can talk). In addition, Wandle and Hawk are the only talking animals we see. Also, Hawk mentions that he has a weird feeling that he used to fly in a previous life (Wandle?)</p>

<p>Combining, all of these facts, I've come to the conclusion that the Demon King used both Wandle and Hawk to keep an eye on Meliodas, and that Hawk is Wandle's reincarnation.

"How were Sakura's release sequences made?","<p>In Cardcaptor Sakura, there's something akin to a transformation sequence where Sakura calls upon the power of the key, and it turns into the staff and she twirls it like a baton. Here's a piece of it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.makeagif.com/media/6-14-2015/FMW9B7.gif"" alt=""A part of the &quot;release&quot; scene""></p>

<p>You can see the full sequence I'm talking about in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuI1IVKrVdQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this YouTube video</a>. It also goes on to show the same sequence in many languages.</p>

<p>Normally I'd expect transformations like that to be made once and just reused as necessary since (AFAIK) magical girls usually transform into the same outfits. But in Sakura's case, she stays in whatever she's already wearing, so it could be pajamas, a school uniform, casual clothes, or whatever crazy outfit Tomoyo designs for her.</p>

<p>I'm very curious about how this is done. The magic effects and shots of the key could be reused, but Sakura's motions look extremely similar each time despite the change in clothing.

"What are the markings used above some song lyrics?","<p>I believe lyrics are shown to both the first opening and ending songs of the tennis anime, <a href=""http://www.crunchyroll.com/baby-steps"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Baby Steps</a>. Here is a partial shot from the ending:</p>

<p>You can see that the normal credits are single rows of characters.  However, the lyrics at the bottom include a row of a few mini-characters above the main ones. What do these additional markings (characters?) indicate?  I am not asking for a translation, just what their purpose is.</p>

<p>I vaguely remember seeing them in another series or two, but this is the first time they really caught my curiosity. I'm assuming right now that they are related to the music, perhaps how the song may have modified pronunciation of certain words. It appears too sparse to be some sort of full musical notation. There is only one voice in each song, so it is not the simultaneous words of a second singer.</p>

She is wearing a maid-cafe outfit for the cultural festival, and her group is selling meat buns. In English the sign is an obvious double entendre. What is the literal translation of the sign? Would Japanese folks see it as a double entendre too?  (Maybe in Japan, ""buns"" just means buns.)</p>

<p>Does anyone know why the door is even open? I saw no context concerning this. He gets out of bed and closes the clock door -- that's it, apparently very routine. Is leaving a wall clock door open something that a Japanese person could relate to? His morning routine is quirky and a bit funny. Maybe this is just part of Smith's own quirkiness.</p>

<p>This may or may not be significant -- I did not fully understand what they were saying, but I've read two comments to YouTube reviews of this series that implied that the sequence of him eating breakfast was a parody from an old Japanese series. (They didn't say live action or anime.) They only referred to the breakfast-eating, which occurred after, and did not mention anything about a clock.</p>

<p>/edit add 2 hours after original post</p>

<p>I just watched episode 14, and then a review of it. The reviewer provided a link to a 2-minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO2fvkJXKUg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">side-by-side comparison</a> of Smith's breakfast and the live action drama it was parodying. It was funny and included the original guy getting up and closing the face of his wall clock. My question doesn't go away, though. Is there something Japanese people can relate to in getting out of bed and shutting the door of your wall clock?</p>

Or maybe they are the same word in Japanese?</strong> (There is a long-running (since 1930) American comic strip named <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blondie_(comic_strip)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Blondie</a>, and her husband is named <em>Dagwood</em>. Since he loves huge, multi-layered sandwiches such as these, they were known as <em>Dagwood sandwiches</em>. I'm not sure that term is still known generally, though.)</p>

"How do the different media for No. 6 fit in with each other?","<p>During the Fall 2016 season, I chanced upon an off-hand comment somewhere on <em>Reddit</em> about the different adaptations of <em>No. 6</em>. If my memory serves me, the user argued that there was a discrepancy between the anime adaptation of <em>No. 6</em> and the original light novels in how a certain plot point (possibly a relationship between two characters) was approached.</p>

<p>Furthermore, at some point before that, I saw someone mention in passing that she disliked the anime adaptation but enjoyed the manga and light novel, which suggests to me in retrospect that there are notable differences between the different adaptations of the underlying content.</p>

<p>At the time, I did not pay heed to any of this, since I had no interest in <em>No. 6</em>. Unfortunately, over the last month or two, I have seen a couple stills from the <em>No. 6</em> manga that piqued my interest. Since I would like to know how to approach to series (via the manga, or via the anime) if I ever get to it, I am now wondering if there are any notable differences between the original light novels, the manga, and the anime, and if so, what the nature of these differences is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are there major differences in <em>plot points</em>, similar to how there are differences in plot between the two different anime associated with <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em> or between the anime and manga for <em>Elfen Lied</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, are there obvious discrepancies with <em>framing</em> or <em>focus</em> or <em>tone</em>? (For instance, the <em>Revolutionary Girl Utena</em> manga feels more grounded in reality than the anime, and concepts such as ""revolutionizing the world"" are more clearly fleshed out there. However the <em>basic</em> structure of the manga matches that of the anime, although the anime has an expanded plot, pairs Juri with Shiori instead of Touga, etc.)</p></li>

"How does online anime streaming work within Japan?","<p>One of the main ways people in the United States watch anime these days is to stream it online via a streaming service like Crunchyroll or Hulu.</p>

<p>Is the online streaming of anime in Japan as popular as it is in America? I know that the Japanese music industry tries really hard to keep its works off the Internet as much as possible, and they try to get customers to buy physical CDs instead. Is there a similar impact on anime streaming where the anime industry tries to avoid streaming and opt for physical DVDs, Blu-rays, etc. in its domestic domain instead?</p>

<p>Also, most of the time in America, the subbed Japanese version is available for free viewing for anybody.</p>

<p>Do Japanese viewers have to pay in order to stream anime in Japanese? My guess is no, because I wouldn't see why Japanese viewers would be charged to view anime in Japanese when U.S. viewers get to stream anime in Japanese for free.</p>

"What is the source of Sanji's flame power?","<p>I recently came up with a theory that Sanji might get a power because all his siblings did, even though he was called a dud. I was then watching <em>One Piece Film: Gold</em> and remembered how his flames didn't make any sense. Could his flames have come from his father's experiments?</p>

<p>He did say in Enies Lobby that he got heated up when he was mad and his powers related to fire keep growing a bit stronger than friction should be able to make. His siblings had powers similar to devil fruit users, so the more powerful Sanji's flames become, the less I believe it is natural (by natural I mean through Haki and friction).</p>

Gokú was very furious when in Super Saiyan Blue he was told Chichi and Gotenk were killed in another dimesion, he had an increase in power but he didnt transform into Super Saiyan Rage. Gohan had been many times very furious, particulary the time when he already had acquired the super saiyan 2 level, when Spopovich almost kills Videl, he didnt turn into Super Saiyan Rage. And particulary Vegeta, when he was already a Super Saiyan 2, and Beerus slaps Bulma, he was so furious than when being in Super Saiyan 2 it is said by others (Roshi, Beerus, etc) that he surpassed the power of Goku's super saiyan 3, but he didnt become super saiyan rage.

<li>When do we say that <em>the Death Note has run out</em>? See the picture below<sup>1</sup>, which says that when you run out of room to write, you can ask your Shinigami to bring you another Death Note.</li>
<li>If I fill my note, ask the Shinigami for another one, then erase what was written on my first note, <em>will I have made two Death Notes for myself?</em> </li>

"How was Nagato able to re-awaken and control the Rinnegan?","<p>The Rinnegan originally belonged to the <em>Sage of the Six Paths</em>. He then divided his power between his two sons, which formed the Senju and the Uchiha. For any human being to be able to activate Rinnegan, they need both the Uchiha and Senju DNA. Uchiha Madara, in the last days of his life, was able to activate it, as he already had the <em>Eternal Mangekyo</em> and Hashirama's cells (Senju DNA), making him similar to the Sage.</p>

<p>But the question is: how was Nagato able to re-activate it? Yes, it was Madara who had implanted his Rinnegan in him at a young age, but then, even though the eyes were implanted, Nagato neither had the Uchiha DNA nor the Senju DNA to be able to re-activate the Rinnegan. How was he able to do it?</p>

<p>And as a continuation to it, let's assume he was able to re-activate the already awakened Rinnegan (Madara awakened it originally), how was he able to use it so well and control it without his body taking a toll? He belonged to the Uzumaki clan who may have been the distant relatives of Senju, but that doesn't justify how he was able to control it so well as he did not have any trait of the SO6P, unlike Madara who could now be compared to the Sage (with both DNAs and the Rinnegan).</p>

<p>An example to highlight this is of Kakashi. He got a Sharingan from Obito. But since Kakashi wasn't an Uchiha, his body would take a huge toll on him whenever he used it and had to cover his Sharingan when not using to save Chakra. Though later he trained and excelled at it, he still was a non-Uchiha and thus, his body used to take the toll, though, only after excessive usage. Similarly, since Nagato has no traits of the Sage, his body shouldn't have been able to take the toll of Rinnegan activated full and controlling his 6 Pain paths, and all.</p>

<p>Can somebody please give a detailed explanation of how Nagato was able to awaken and control the Rinnegan?</p>

<p>The final season of Chica Umino's <em>Honey and Clover</em> ended with Yuuta Takemoto eating a literal honey-and-clover sandwich made by his love interest Hagumi Hanamoto. He was crying as he ate it and said the lines (which made me tear up, just like the other moments of the series):</p>

"Are one-off openings and endings expensive to produce?","<p>At least two recent anime series have had openings (OPs) or endings (EDs) that were unique to a single episode.  The OP to <em>Erased</em> episode 11 was modified for dramatic purpose to carry over the suspense beginning in episode 10.  Every ED for <em>ReLIFE</em> had its own custom music, combined with a mixture of repeated and custom visuals. I am sure there have been other series to do this sort of thing.</p>

<p>As a fan, I appreciate the extra effort the studios take in producing special OPs and EDs. And it is likely the artistic staff at the anime studios enjoy offering their fans these special glimpses into their series. From a production standpoint, though, I wonder how much extra cost a special OP or ED adds. Do they expect that enhanced fan appreciation due to these things will result in higher returns?  Or are they, like the artistic folks, doing it ""for the fun of it""?</p>

"What is ""digi-paint""?","<p>I was reading some reviews of this season's new shows, and I somehow happened to run across references to ""digi-paint"" twice(!):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The raw mechanics of producing anime can be a pretty frustrating thing sometimes. Back in the early 00s, technology shifts prompted the move to <strong>digipaint</strong> from traditional cells, and early adopters of the new system suffered heavily for it. Shows like Haibane Renmei had fundamentally gorgeous art design, but looked smudged and indistinct due to the new technology. <sub>(from <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/.97400"">BBK/BRNK - The Winter 2016 Anime Preview Guide</a>)</sub></p>
  
  <p>So this is a forgotten <strong>digi-paint</strong> show that was dug up in a time capsule from no later than the year of our lord 2002, dusted off, reformatted into 16:9, and re-sold as an adaptation of a Masamune Shirow manga from 2010. How else do you explain its hideous color palette, jagged flat designs, and painfully dated obsession with fetishes of yesteryear like catgirls, maids, androids/cyborgs with unusually sexual hardware, and busty scientist onee-samas? <sub>(from <a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/.97359"">Pandora in the Crimson Shell: Ghost Urn - The Winter 2016 Anime Preview Guide</a>)</sub></p>

So which means all they needed was a sample of Kyuubi chakra (since all 7 Tailed Beasts were sealed, it was powerful enough to begin Moon Eye, also they had Hachibi's tentacle).

  <p>However, when Makoto arrives inside the Academy, he loses consciousness and wakes up locked inside the school, where he meets fourteen other newly picked Ultimate students who are in the same situation as him. It is there that a sadistic, remote-controlled bear named Monokuma appears before them, telling them they will be imprisoned in the academy for the rest of their lives, and that they will be put to death if they violate any of the schools rules. He offers only one way for students to ""graduate"" from the academy: murder another student and not be identified as the culprit.</p>

<p>So if the culprit is correctly identified (majority vote or something?), culprit gets executed. If not, everyone but culprit gets executed.</p>

<p>What is supposed to happen if there are 2 or 3 players left?</p>

<p>I'm not so naive as to think that what is supposed to happen is what actually happens, but I think there should be a rule for that.</p>

<p>If there is no explanation in the anime or other media, please state such and if applicable why no explanation is needed (I might be overlooking something obvious).</p>

<p>Liar Game had a rule as to what happens in Minority Rule if there are only 2 players left. There was some detail about it. I don't think explaining that rule spoils the manga or series: If there are 2 left, the prize is split.

"How did Homura able to return to a past where Madoka isn't already a Magical Girl?","<p>I just finished watching Puella Magi Madoka Magica and its movie, Rebellion. And there's something that's been bugging me. </p>

<p>On episode 10, Homura's past was shown, and I will re-iterate it so you can understand my question.</p>

<p><strong>Loop 1:</strong> 
She was still a timid and shy girl, with her hair tied on braids and with glasses. She was then shown to almost become a victim of a witch if not for Madoka and Mami showing up, saving her as Magical Girls. Fastforward, Madoka and Mami were both killed at the battle of Walpurgisnacht and Homura decided to become a Magical Girl too, with a wish to <strong><em>go back in time when she met Madoka, but this time, she will be the one to protect her</em></strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Loop 2:</strong> Time did return to the past and upon introduction of her by the teacher, she showed the Magical Girl's ring immediately to them, making Madoka and Mami surprised that there's a new Magical Girl. Fast forward, on the battle of Walpurgisnacht, she witnesses Madoka turn into a witch and realized that Kyubey has been deceiving all Magical Girls.</p>

<p><strong>Loop 3:</strong> Homura went back to time and befriends with them again, so that she can warn them of Kyubey's deceit but to no avail. Until Sayaka became a witch too, and they had no choice but to kill her. Mami killed Kyoko as well then attempted to kill Homura, but was stopped and killed by Madoka. Homura and Madoka fought on the battle of Walpurgisnacht. They were both defeated and their Soul Gems are depleting, but Madoka gave a Grief Seed to Homura's Soul Gem, begging her to go back in time again and keep her from being fooled by Kyubey. Then she asked Homura to kill her before she can become a witch.</p>

<p><strong>Loop 4:</strong> This is where Homura was convinced that no one will believe her story of the future and the deception and so she tries to prevent it, making her personality more aloof and cold, but stronger.</p>

<p>What I don't understand now is how Homura was able to go back to past where Madoka isn't a Magical Girl yet. See, on those first 3 loops, Madoka is already a Magical Girl. If her wish has something to do with it (returning to the past being Madoka's protector), she could've returned to Loop 2 with Madoka not yet a Magical Girl. I wouldn't think that Madoka's pleads to Homura has something to do with it on Loop 3 (preventing her to be fooled by Kyubey) since she's already a Magical Girl, thus, have already made her wish. </p>

<p>So, I don't understand how can she return to a <strong>changed past</strong> with a <strong>changed Madoka</strong>, cause as far as I know, she's the only character possible of change inside her looping timeline. Or am I wrong? Is there any explanation to this?</p>

<p>Since it's made of an unknown matter it's not really that difficult to believe, but we didn't really see the effects of this rule in the anime, which I guess could be more important than most of the rules (unless you show me some other point of view in the answers), by analyzing:</p>

<p><strong>The thickness of the Note should increase:</strong></p>

<p>By assuming that the number of pages will increase every time you use the Note pages to make it endless, we would clearly see that the Death Note will get thicker, since the number of pages is rising, and we would clearly see that the Note of Light would be too thick after his long years using it.</p>

<p><strong>The already written pages remains:</strong></p>

<p>We could also deduce that the pages that are already filled do not disappear since both L and Near did analyze the names written on the Notes and the names of the dead victims as another evidence of the conviction.</p>

<p><strong>Now as a question:</strong></p>

<p>We know that the user can rip some pages from the Note to use them later, <em>now what would happen if the user rips all the pages from the last one filled to the end cover of the Note for using them later? :</em> </p>

<ol>
<li>Will it be judged as destroying the Note?</li>
<li>Will it be judged as ripping some pages? </li>
</ol>

<p>If 1), the Note will be rendered useless.<br>
If 2), would other pages appear in the Note? In case they appear, could the user keep ripping off pages and giving them to hundreds of people making Kira everywhere? Why didn't Yagami Light do such a thing as becoming the master of the page users and the only one knowing their names in case they disobey him, and as a result, creating an army for himself made of the Kira fans?</p>

<p>In Liar Game, afaik, the dealers have always accounted for all possible situations so whenever there are changes in the game, they state it outright. For example, in games involving voting, the dealers have stated what happens in the event of a draw.</p>

<hr>

<p>Suppose in a Danganronpa game starting with 15 students,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>all murders are <strong>committed by exactly one person</strong> (no collaborative murders during the act, but before or after the act is fine, assuming there would be some incentive) and <strong>to exactly one person</strong> (no multiple victims)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>all murderers are successfully guessed and convicted</strong> (iirc, this is by majority vote) so long as there are more than 3 players</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No one dies in a way other than being murdered.</strong> So, no one messes with Monokuma, dies of an accident, dies of health conditions (eg asthma) or naturally (eg old age), etc, but suicide is fine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No murders will be hidden from the other students indefinitely</strong>, as in all corpses will be discovered or if the body is burned, then there will be enough evidence to say a murder has taken place and thus enough evidence for a classroom trial to be called.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Assuming the above situation is consistent internally and consistent with the initial set up of a Danganronpa game, such game will eventually come down to 3 students, whom I'm going to call Kotonoha, Yuno and Mion.</p>

<p>Suppose further:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The game continues (so it's not declared a draw between the 3).</p></li>
<li><p>Yuno dies, not of suicide or <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/29326/who-is-to-say-if-someone-is-murdered"">accident</a> but murdered by Kotonoha or Mion.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is a corpse (body is not burned or anything), it will be discovered. If none, Yuno's death is discovered in another way.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite insufficient witnesses, a classroom trial will be called.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Questions</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>So what happens in the event of a drawn vote between the two?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generally</strong>, whenever there are an even number of voters in a classroom trial, what happens in the event of a drawn vote? Since it's not a majority, everyone but the culprit dies?</p></li>

<p>But the one thing that bothers me the most, which is basically based off all the previous questions is my third and last question: Why the hell are Ogres so goddamn powerful?</p>

<p>I mean, look at the Messiah, child of Maria and Mamoru, taken off them by Yakomaru.
The first and only human kid the rats get in their hands on, breed to adolescence (which is when they get their powers) and turns out to be a killing sociopath with powers as immense as the most powerful dude in the village. This case essentially brings up all the previous questions I asked, which if you didn't notice, is driving me mad.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any answers?</p>

"Where is Eren's father Dr. Jaeger?","<p>So I finally got around to seeing what the fuss was all about with <em>Attack on Titan</em> anime series, by marathoning it in two days, and I am glad I did. Do note that I just finish watching the anime series only, so if it's answered in the manga, please indicate spoilers.</p>

<p>The thing that stood out for me though was the complete absence of Eren's father after the first two episodes, and the fact that no one seemed in the least bit concerned. We know he was (probably) not dead, because in the second episode, he was seen riding back home concerned about whether his wife, Eren and Mikasa were safe. In Eren's memories, he also seemed to be aware of what was going to happen (or saw it as inevitable), so it seemed unlikely that he had been killed, particularly with no mention of it.</p>

<p>However, aside from some recurrences of Eren's dream/memory, there was no sign of his father at all, and nobody seemed to care. Eren and Mikasa didn't mention or even recognised the absence. And the various soldiers, generals, etc. didn't seem interested either, even though Eren made it clear that his father had something hidden in his basement, possibly related to his ability. I would have thought that <em>someone</em> would have interrogated him further on what his father was doing or what could be in the basement. All we seem to know is that he had been traveling somewhere for a week or so.</p>

<p>Is there an explanation as to where Dr. Jaeger was during the 5+ years? Is it just an oversight that Eren's father is so glossed over by the series? Seems kind of weird when he's potentially a crucial character in the same vein as Annie's father.</p>

"In Danganronpa, how can a classroom trial be called if there is no corpse?","<p>Unlike the games in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Game"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Liar Game</a>, the rules of a Danganronpa game are sometimes made up or stated midway, which for me kind of sucks but is tolerable so long as the rules are consistent.</p>

<p>In Liar Game, afaik, the dealers always account for all possible situations and state consequences of the situations outright especially when there are changes. For example, in games involving voting, the dealers state what happens in the event of a draw, even if it later doesn't occur or even factor into some calculations made by the characters. In one voting game, a draw was not possible because of an odd number of players (well actually, assuming everyone votes). Later, the number of players became even, so the dealer of  the game immediately stated what would happen in the event of a drawn vote.</p>

However, I found no reliable pages that say that this is a thing, much like the person who posted the first post on <a href=""http://forum.icotaku.com/sujet/1147.html"">this forum</a>.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2013-08-06/3rd-annual-international-otaku-day"">this ANN article</a> that puts this year's Otaku Day on August 17th (<a href=""http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-08-15/2nd-annual-international-otaku-day"">2012's was on the 18th</a>). Furthermore, the second link provided there links to a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/InternationalOtakuDay"">Facebook page</a>, in which it is stated that this event takes place on the third Saturday of August every year.</p>

<p>The event announced on the first paragraph is, apparently, called ""World Otaku Day"". The one announced on the second is the ""(Annual) International Otaku Day"". However, I find no reference of any of these two, nor of any ""official"" Otaku day on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>So, is there a day that is really (official, or something of the sort) regarded as Otaku Day? Are there any more reliable sources that have a fixed date for this event?<br>
Or are these two events relatively official and both recognised as two different Otaku days?</p>

"Why are some panels just sketches?","<p>I have been reading some Boku no Hero Academia and in some chapters (only very few) there have been panels, which looked like sketches and not like the rest of the manga. Since it were only single panels, I didn't think much of it. But while reading chapter 182, there have been whole pages like that (s. picture below). </p>

<p>Did the artists run out of time and so, they weren't able to complete all pages? Or is there a different reason for this?</p>

"Why is class 3-3 still open?","<p>I was wondering why would the school keep a cursed class open for more than 20 years when people are dying.</p>

<p>Is there a canon explanation of why the school is just ignoring the deaths an leaving it to the simple ""ignore one student"" strategy? Moreover why do students openly join a cursed class instead of moving to another class? another school? another city?</p>

"Why does Madara appear unhurt despite being covered in wounds?","<p>I'm not sure if I have missed anything in the past, but Madara seems unphased by every attack.</p>

<p>Sasuke stabs a sword through his arm, but this isn't a problem.</p>

<p>All the tailed beasts stomp on Madara with their tails, and Madara doesn't even evade. Instead, he tanks the attack like it is no big deal.</p>

<p>1) Yin was Izanami which is apparent and is shown in black outfit to differentiate from the actual Yin, which is white one. Correct?</p>

<p>2) Who was Izanagi?</p>

<p>3) What was that yellow spectre thing inside Yin which makes the promise to  grant her a wish?</p>

<p>4) Is Yin dead in the end? OR did Izanagi(considering Shion as Izanagi) create a clone of Yin which differs from her in gender and placed the Izanami inside that body? and later Hei carried Yin's soul to her original body.</p>

<p>5) How come Hei gets to know about the second earth and everything which is going on and stops Suou from shooting Izanami?</p>

<p>I find it difficult to accept that Hei separated  Yin from Izanami considering his powers because then there is no body for Izanami to return to? and Shion was already dead by the time Hei appears on the screen, so it will be impossible for Shion and Hei working together to separate Yin.</p>

<p>6) Also, does anyone have any idea about Yin's wish? Was it to be dead to save the world or to be with Hei? I personally believe the second one since and think that Shion to be Izanami and the yellow spectre(which i cannot explain how but please expain if you know since he is contractor nota doll so no spectre for him) and finally he creates a seperate body for Izanami hence full filling her wish. </p>

"How does Kihara Amata's device to bypass Accelerator's passive redirection actually work, and should it work at all?","<p>Disclaimer: I watched only the anime. (And read <a href=""http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Toarupedia</a>)</p>

<p>In season 2 of Index we are introduced to Kihara Amata, one of the scientists who worked on researching Accelerator's ability. He attacks him head on which usually proves fatal for the attacker depending on their attack strength and punches Accelerator. Then Accelerator creates a wind tornado and attacks Amata. However, Amata dispels the attack into thin air. </p>

<p>Now the thing that bugs me is how he managed to punch Accelerator and the anime's explanation. Amata narrates what he is deeply knowledgeable about the inner workings of Accelerator's ability and points out that his redirection shield switches the directions of objects which come in contact with it and the trick to bypass it is to pull back your fist just at the moment of contact and the shield will switch direction of the fist which would be backwards right into Accelerator (or somehow the momentum of the punch and not the fist it is not perfectly clear to be honest). </p>

<p>The problem in this explanation is that we are quite often told that Accelerator's shield's speed is equal or faster than the speed of light because his ability reflects UV and other radiation (at least UV travels in speed close to speed of light) which means that to bypass the shield and trick it into letting through an attack Amata would have to move at speeds which are faster than the speed of UV rays or the speed of light, which is absurd even given the fact that he apparently replaces his hand with artificial one. </p>

<p>To illustrate, imagine what you are standing before a big Vector field which is slightly visible. It is of a size of a wall or something. You see Kihara Amata on the other side running at the wall going for a punch. There are few things what could happen here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Amata moves faster than the shield can react and punches you in the 
face.</p></li>
<li><p>The shield's reaction time is much much higher than Kihara's time (and that includes calculations to determine whether the vector brings harm/no harm, as shown wth UV), Kihara moves his fist close to the edge of the field and then pulls back. Nothing happens, as the fist did not make contact.</p></li>
<li><p>The shield's reaction time is still higher than Amata's punch,but this time Amata goes for the punch-pullback on the edge of the field, entering it slightly. As shield is too fast for him, Amata breaks his arm moment he even makes contact with the field, and there is no time for him (as per his relative slowness of movement) to even begin to pullback, as the shield already made calculations and reacted with at least speed higher than UV.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The only way the punch bypasses the shield is if it's movement speed is faster than the field's reaction. This way, it is possible to just ignore the shield as it does not even have time to make calculations if it is slower than the vector's speed.</p>

<p>Even if for a moment we imagine that Amata invented a way for his hand to harmlessly move at the speed of light or rather faster than the shield can react as we are never told in the anime whether the shield has any speed limits, his punch would just go through the shield, and if Amata pulls back, shield still would not have time to react and nothing happens. However that Amata can give a punch that travels at the speed of light is highly doubtful, so we can assume that the trick is something else and he bluffs.
But what is it? Did the guy who wrote the script decide to include plot induced stupidity or is there an <em>in-verse</em> explanation which actually makes sense?</p>

<p>Edit: <a href=""https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/47547/how-does-kihara-amatas-device-to-bypass-accelerators-passive-redirection-actua#comment61780_47550"">@Ryans comment</a>'s about with theory of possible exploit of the the shield got me thinking. If the field decides whether to reflect or not, and let's some things in, perhaps it could be exploited by first just moving slowly and entering the field. The field would mark the vector ""non-harmful"" and allow the hand in. Then the hand would suddenly accelerate into opposite direction of the shield's emittor (i.e. Accelerator) and the shield would mark the vector as ""harmful"" and switch the directions of the hand. Though this seems odd now that I think about it more, because the moment shield would switch direction of the fist it would become ""harmful"" again, would not it switch the direction of the vector again this time away from the field emittor? Now, one other things I wonder about is why Kihara's hand when he punches Accelerator does not fly towards him and instead the momentum of the punch does? This is certainlynot the case with bullets, when the field switches their directions, they fly away, not the momentum of theirs. But in anime it is shown that when Kihara sends a punch to Accelerator, when he executed his trick, it's not his fist what goes towards Accelerator after being switched by the shield, but the momentum. Thois seems to leave much room for speculation (for example, would the field even classify a hand, of any velocity ""non-harmful""? We never see in the anime and in other materials as far as I can tell from Indexpedia anyone touch Accelerator in a non-harmful way (aside from when Accelerator magines what a normal childhood would be like in Railgun S, but this is obviously in his head). </p>

<p>So far, it seems there is not enough information but as far as I see, @Ryan's theory seems to be the most plausible one.</p>

"Can only men pass on the will of D.?","<p>So I was wondering how the will of D. is passed on. We have seen three cases where the will of D. was shown to be passed on and they were all from generation to generation by birth. Luffy got it from Dragon, Dragon got it from Garp and Ace got it from Roger (and Rouge?). In each case the will was passed on along with the last name. Now this made me wonder. Is it merely in a name? Or is there more to it?</p>

<p>Ace would probably be the best example. He chose to go through life using his mother's name <em>Portgas D.</em> Now what if Ace's mother would not have been a carrier, would Ace have not have had the will of D because of his name? Or what if Ace's mother married some other guy who didn't have the will of D, would she be unable to pass it on, because children are given their fathers name? This sounds pretty sexist to me, so it made me wonder whether just having the right surname is enough for someone to have the will of D or if there is some other way to become a D or to pass on the will of D?</p>

<p>If there isn't, the will of D will probably die out pretty soon...</p>

"When was the Day of Severance?","<p>We know that the Day of Severance had to have happened some time after Kureha was born. Indeed, it must have occurred sometime after Ginko and Kureha became friends (i.e. after they met on the snowy battlefield past the Door to Friendship), since they could not have become friends in the first place had Severance already occurred. </p>

<p>We also know that the Day of Severance happened before episode 1 of the show, because, of course, that's how the narrative begins in the first place. I'm pretty sure that Severance was also before Ginko and Lulu met.</p>

<p>Can we pinpoint when the Day of Severance happened any more accurately (relative to other events in the story)? In particular, it's not clear to me whether the Day of Severance was before or after the day on which Reia sent Ginko back across the Door to Friendship. </p>

<p>(Or maybe I've got this all wrong? In episode 11, the way Kureha's classmates harass her about her friendship with bear-Ginko [during a flashback] seems to suggest that the Day of Severance had already happened - so does that mean that the Day of Severance even precedes the day on which Kureha went across the Door to Friendship to fetch Kureha from the snowy battlefield?)</p>

"Why is Midoriya's power so low according to the official character book?","<p>According to the official character book or <em>Boku no Hero Academia</em> Wikia, Midoriya power is 1/5. However, other students have powers much higher than him:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yuga 2/5</li>

  <p>Kuma seems to have a good enough relationship with Vegapunk. Vegapunk was able to grant him his final wish as a human being, which was to program Kuma to protect the Straw Hats ship until their return. It is very likely that Vegapunk highly respects Kuma's strength, as he modified Kuma to be the prototype Pacifista, and he let Kuma do things that go against the World Government, as well as granting him his last wish by including a mission into his programming that Kuma himself had requested.</p>

<p>It is even shown that the bible he holds is his trademark. If that is true why would he sacrifice his consciousness along with his humanity if he lived life cherishing something that very much so represented humanity, freedom and free will?</p>

"Why was the Osiris Egyptian God Card translated as Slifer the Sky Dragon?","<p>In the Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged parody, the names of the three Egyptian God Cards are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obelisk the Tormentor </li>
<li>Slifer the Executive Producer</li>
<li>and Mega Ultra Chicken</li>
</ul>

<p>The second name is a reference to a producer of the Yu-Gi-Oh English dub, who is also called Slifer (Roger Slifer, to be exact). I thought that this was just a funny little coincidence that Little Kuriboh picked up on and made a pun out of. </p>

<p>But then, I looked up the actual names of the Egyptian God Cards on the Yu-Gi-Oh wikia:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Obelisk_the_Tormentor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Obelisk the Tormentor</a> |     オベリスクの巨神兵 (lit. Giant Divine Soldier of Obelisk)</li>

</ul>

<p>Huh? ""Slifer the Sky Dragon"" is called ""Osiris the Sky Dragon"" in the original Japanese. That... actually makes way more sense, because Osiris is an Egyptian God in real life. So, was Slifer an intentional reference to Roger Slifer made by the official translators?</p>

"Did the Makers of the Lupin III ""Red-Jacket"" Series get Permission to Feature Superman?","<p>In one of the Episodes of the Lupin III part 2 ""Red-Jacket"" series, Lupin foils a scheme by Fujiko who has henchmen impersonating Superman to rob banks. </p>

<p>I am curious if anyone has any information on whether this was technically allowed by DC, and if so, why?</p>

<p>If it wasn't allowed, then why is Crunchyroll.com able to screen this episode?</p>

"What is the meaning of ""Cross"" in the title Cross Ange?","<p>""Ange"", apart from the obvious reference to the main character, also means ""angel"" in French and implies the connection between Ange and Vilkiss, which has an angel sculpture on its head. This connection also extends to the full title <em>Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons</em>, which foreshadows the end of Ange's journey, as seen in the last few episodes.</p>

<p>However, ""Cross"" doesn't quite make sense in the title. According to the preview at the end of episode 24, subtitle by CrunchyRoll:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What the hell did ""Cross"" in <em>Cross Ange</em> mean, anyway?</p>
  
  <p>Ange is always cross, I guess?</p>
  
  <p>It's a pun?!</p>

<p><sup><sup>1</sup> <em>Cross</em> in this context means <strong>""angry or annoyed""</strong>, according to <a href=""http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cross_3"">Oxford Learner's Dictionary</a>.</sup></p>

<p>While it somewhat makes sense, this seems to be a liberal translation to match the fact it is a pun in Japanese.</p>

However we also know this is a <a href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Game"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shadow Game</a>, so Pegasus could use supernatural effects instead of just manipulating Yugi using the frames or predict his moves due to his knowledge of game and Yugi's strategies. So he (or his recording) can in thesis uses his <a href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Millennium_Eye"" rel=""noreferrer"">Millenium Eye</a> - according to the <a href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_Yugi_and_Maximillion_J._Pegasus&#39;_TV_Duel_(manga)"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a> he did it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Secretly Pegasus was using his Millennium Eye to read Yugi's mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the timing of Yugi's turn durations and Pegasus turn durations seems to be so synchronized to be a duel against a pre-recorded tape. On the other hand, if it's not a pre-recorded tape, then how Pegasus would be prepared to duel Yugi in the exact day and hour he starts to watch it? It would be ridiculous to think about the long-haired businessman waiting all the time until Yugi put the tape in his video. But the <a href=""http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Pegasus&#39;_videotape"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki article</a> suggests that the tape is more than a single tape, allowing instant communication between the one in the tape:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although it appeared to contain a prerecording, <strong>people on the tape were able to communicate with people watching as if they were present at the same time and location as them</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't find in the manga a definite clarification if the duel was against a pre-recorded Pegasus or the real Pegasus in the same time, being able to communicate due to his Millenium Item effects over the tape. Is there any official explanation, be it in the manga or another source, about what really happened in this duel?</p>

"What's with the fantasy hair?","<p><em>All Out!!</em> is a sports series about high school rugby. The teams are large, so there are many characters. I understand that the mangaka and character designers want to make each character stand out. They do a great job here. But a few stand out much more than others, due to what I think of as <em>fantasy hair</em>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AwXiT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AwXiT.jpg"" alt=""4 All Out!! characters with &quot;fantasy hair&quot;""></a></p>

<ul>
<li>(ULC) Oharanu Etsugo -- ""antennae hair"", two small hair groups sticking straight up</li>
<li>(URC) Ebumi Masaru -- ""anchor hair"", two somewhat bigger hair groups sticking left and right from bottom of his head. He also stands out due to eyes often wild and almost constantly angry expressions.</li>
<li>(LLC) Ise Natsuki -- ""horn-hair"", they even manage to stick out of his helmet! (Rugby helmets have holes; his holes must be magically located.)</li>
<li>(LRC) Sekisan Takuya -- ""ribbon hair"", curly ribbons of hair at various angles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Are any of these styles something a Japanese teenager would actually wear?</strong> (Are some of them even possible?) Except for someone from another team commenting that Sekisan has really wild hair, these fantasy styles are treated as normal looks. The styles definitely help the characters stand out. With three tall blonds on the team, it is nice that two of them have unique appearances. <strong>Is blond hair fairly common among Japanese teenagers?</strong></p>

<p>The strange thing is that the series is reality based; no-one has a beyond-human-capability ability or genius move. For example, another series might have a character grow up on a dairy farm, and now he has an unbreakable grip on the rugby ball due to 10 years of milking a dozen cows twice daily by hand. In <em>All Out!!</em> there is nothing but tough training and a great coach.</p>

<li>If not, why did destroying the Saiyans exceed the dragon's power?</li>
<li>Everyone around the universe was searching for Dragon Balls because they could fulfill anyone's wish. Does it mean that it is not mandatory to be an Earthling, but it's compulsory to be on Earth to have your wish granted by the dragons?</li>
<li>If yes, why didn't they ever wish to destroy the enemies after they had landed on Earth and within the effect of the dragons' power?</li>

"Was it formerly common practice to credit voice actors in opening credits?","<p>The final OP for <em>Monogatari Series Second Season</em> (the Koimonogatari OP) is sort of an 80s-throwback sort of deal, with all the hallmarks of old anime styling - funky ""lens flares"", those old-school clouds, a song reminiscent of 80s-era pop, captioned lyrics - the works. </p>

"Can Byakuya overcome Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu as easy as he overcomed Koga since both of them are based on illusion?","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OQ4d.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OQ4d.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Byakuya breaks free and readies himself against Kōga, who is
  determined to use his illusions on Senbonzakura as well. Before he can
  attempt to do so, Byakuya activates his Bankai, Senbonzakura
  Kageyoshi, and uses Senkei, which Byakuya notes will allow him to
  overcome Kōga's illusions because his blades will always find Kōga.
  The two clash evenly several times until Kōga uses his Spiritual
  Threads to bind Byakuya once more. However, Senbonzakura has several
  Senkei blades rain down and cut the threads, to Kōga's surprise.
  Byakuya attacks him, but Kōga moves out of the way and wonders how
  Byakuya can be so powerful. Though Byakuya and Senbonzakura explain
  how their working in unison allows them to unleash their full power,
  Kōga refuses to listen and proclaims his greatness was never
  acknowledged. </p>

<p>If Byakuya's Senkei will always find illusion based shinigami, does that mean he can overcome Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu illusion just as easily with his Bankai? The war would be so much simpler with Byakuya, wouldn't it? Or there is something different with how Aizen's Kyoka Suigetsu work? </p>

His father warned him that he was going to reach a limit if he didnt, Midoriya pushed him, and after a flashback Shoto turned on his fire part. Then I dont understand very well what happened. It seems he sends an ice attack first that Midoriya dodges, and later he uses somehow his fire in the attack, but it isnt very clear how. What was Shoto Todoroki attack about? Did he just use fire, did he use a combination of fire with ice, did he use his ice part just to estabilize himself? How was it?</p>

<li><p>The Child Consultation Center is already worried or suspicious (if they visited Hinazuki's home at all). Yashiro probably informed them about the abuse at Hinazuki's home. (Even if Yashiro didn't, they are already aware of the case.)</p></li>
<li><p>The Child Consultation Center would be the party responsible for any further follow-up or protective measures, not Yashiro.</p></li>

  <p>Later, [Sumika] appears before Kureha as Lady Kumaria to turn Kureha into a bear and send Kureha and Ginko on a journey beyond severance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This suggests that at least one person sees Sumika as being the same entity as Lady Kumaria. I have trouble seeing the idea of Sumika as Lady Kumaria incarnate as anything more than a stretch of the imagination; I do not recall any plot points or characterisation that make this an undoubtedly natural conclusion to have. (Sumika does indicate in her actions surrounding Kureha's birthday that she expects that they will be separated, and she does push Kureha in a positive direction. Such behaviour might be congruent with what I would expect of a benevolent deity made incarnate, but it's surely easier to explain this as being a result of Sumika's goodness and her classmates' actions.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, perhaps Lady Kumaria appears to girls in a form that is meaningful to them, but again, I lack any evidence that supports this to a reasonable degree.</p>

<p>Is there any official material &mdash; whether from the anime itself or from interviews or artbooks &mdash; that might shed light on these issues?</p>

"What is this animation style? I would call it ""serious"", but maybe gritty?","<p>Often times in anime, I see a serious section accentuated by a gritty, more serious, more old school, animation type.  There will be many frames of animation, and the animation will be very fluid.  Usually this is done within a light-hearted anime, presumably for contrast with the main part of the show.  The example I have is not the best one, but gives you an idea of what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>The opening scene of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Boy_%28manga%29#OVA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Golden Boy</a> has a super serious vibe to it, and then goes into the regular style for the anime.  This is a screenshot of the scent in the opening I am referring to:</p>

Note that not in all cases are these clips of animation visually dark like this (for example having a black background.)  I think this art style is more often present when depicting fantasy anime, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Is there a name for this style of animation?  Ultimately, I would like to look for anime that use this style of animation throughout, so I am looking for something I can use to search The Internets for (aka a search term).</p>

<p>In contrast, after Hitoe suffers three losses, she does not recognise Ruko and Yuzuki after they find her on the street.

<blockquote>
  <p>Enfin, House est également inspiré du héros éponyme du manga Blackjack
  (ブラック・ジャック, 1973-1983) d'Osamu Tezuka, un médecin cynique, sombre,
  solitaire et sans diplôme accomplit de véritables miracles médicaux.
  Cette influence est confirmé par House lui-même, qui déclare dans un
  épisode que sa vocation médicale vient de sa rencontre avec un médecin
  marginal japonais.</p>

<p>which means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, House is also inspired by the eponymous hero of Osamu
  Tezuka's manga Blackjack (ブラック · ジャック, 1973-1983), a cynical doctor,

  This influence is confirmed by House himself, who said in an episode
  that his medical vocation comes from his encounter with a marginal
  Japanese doctor.</p>

"Who is the strongest Hokage?","<p>Who is actually the strongest Hokage? It would be such a simple question and answer if Kishimoto just gave us a direct answer. But instead, Kishimoto feeds us different information along the way as the story progresses.</p>

<p><strong>Pre Chuunin Exam</strong><br>
Sarutobi was highlighted as the genius Shinobi. The manga stated that he quickly surpassed both the first and the second at a young age, and was widely known as the Professor. We also find out later that the first and second died in war, while the third and fourth sacrificed their lives to use the demon god. </p>

<p><strong>Chuunin exam era + beginning of Shippuden</strong><br>
Minato was considered the strongest Hokage. Recall when Orochimaru was using Edo Tensei to revive all dead Kages - Sarutobi was most afraid of the Fourth. For a while, everyone regarded the 4th as the strongest shinobi. I am not sure if this is because they never witnessed the first, but it seems evident that Minato was the powerhouse. Everyone kept saying - If the fourth was here, Orochimaru would be no problem, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Late Shippuden when Tobi starts acting and Madara is revealed</strong><br>
Hashirama is the God of Shinobi. He is depicted as the strongest of all four, even recognized by Minato. He is the only one to resist Orochimaru's control. Madara Uchiha also regards everyone else, aside from Hashirama, as insignificant.</p>

<p>The thing that bothers me the most is how Sarutobi was not worried and was able to handle fighting both Hashirama and Tobirama. Minato was the source of his fear.</p>

<p>And then later on, Hashirama just seems like he is on another level. So I guess I have to redefine my question. Was Hashirama always the strongest Hokage, or did Kishimoto develop his strength later on? Or can this just not be determined?</p>

"Why doesn't Archer seem to have feelings for Rin?","<p>So, I just watched Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works for the first time.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Archer is basically Shirou in the future of an alternative universe, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the anime, Shirou mentions multiple times that he loves Rin or that he has strong emotions for her, at least. So why does Archer seem to be so ""cold"" towards Rin? </p>

<p>I mean, shouldn't he be at least a tiny bit attached to her in some way? Or did he really change THAT much as a person, that he doesn't feel romantic emotions towards her? (Well in the end he DOES save her so he seems to care about her in some way. But, it still feels like there is too much distance between them throughout the whole series)</p>

<p>I mean, technically, should Archer have had emotions for the Rin in ""his reality"" or not? What happened to her?</p>

<p>Sorry for all the questions. I will look for more content of the ""Fate"" series, but my curiosity is killing me and I may have missed something since it was the first time, watching that anime, for me. :D</p>

"Why shadow clone technique make a clone of what they are holding?","<p><strong><a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Shadow_Clone_Technique"" rel=""nofollow"">Definition</a></strong> : Similar to the basic Clone Technique, Shadow clone technique creates copies of the user. However, these clones are corporeal instead of illusions.</p>

<p>According to me when Naruto uses Shadow clone technique then his whole dress also get cloned to other user, so there might be possibility that item inside bag might get cloned too.
And it can also be proved as he uses All direction shuriken technique where ""Naruto and his shadow clones throw shuriken all at once."" - <a href=""http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/All_Directions_Shuriken"" rel=""nofollow"">Source</a></p>

<p>So the quesion is: How non-living object get multiplied because according to wiki definition about Shadow clone technique : ""The user's chakra is evenly distributed among every clone, giving each clone an equal fraction of the user's overall power."" but non-living object has no chakra so how come ?</p>

<p>If it is possible to use it which is true, then let us say that those cloned user threw kunai on the target then for sure it will get hit on that target. But if that cloned user (which uses that kunai) got vanish then :</p>

<p>Will that kunai too vanishes at that same time or it will be there as it is?</p>

"In Kuroko no Basuke, are the characters ever compared to professional players?","<p>So, in <em>Kuroko no Basuke</em> (or, <em>The Basketball Which Kuroko Plays</em>, as suits you), we see that the Generation of Miracles has some pretty wacky basketball superpowers. I'm no basketball expert, but it seems like if you took the five of them and transferred them into the real world (powers and all), they would beat most actual NBA teams. And the thing is, they're just 10th-graders. Sure, maybe they're the best 10th-graders (even the best high-schoolers) in Japan, but surely they can't be as good as <em>professional</em> players in the KnB universe, can they? </p>

"Did Naruto REALLY fall in love with Hinata in The Last: Naruto the Movie?","<p>So we know that throughout the whole Naruto series Hinata is <strong>in love</strong> with Naruto, and Naruto is oblivious to it. We also know that Naruto like Sakura, somehow. Later on two years after the war, Hinata is still in love with him.</p>

<h1>Spoiler below about The Last: Naruto the Movie</h1>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Hinata, Naruto, Sakura, Sai, and Shikamaru are sent on a mission to rescue Hinata's sister. At one moment they had to go through something to get to this one place (sorry I can't recall what it was.) When they went through there they fell in a Genjutsu without knowing. In that Genjutsu Naruto is seeing a flashback of Hinata and him, but mostly Hinata. Naruto starts seeing some moments where Hinata as a kid wrote his name on a piece of paper and started to get happy, then after he fought Kiba she gave Naruto that healing cream, when he was on the ground when he was fighting Pain she protected him and confessed her love for him, Hinata talking to Sakura about Naruto, etc. After seeing all that, Sakura is able to break the Genjutsu on him and he is able to wake up. After that, they continue to look for Hinata's sister. Hinata and Naruto have to share one of Sai's painted birds to fly on. Naruto starts to look at Hinata different. Is it because he feels sorry for being oblivious of her love for him? Then after feeling sorry, did he start feeling something for her as well or what because after that guy (sorry I forgot his name) took Hinata with him, Naruto tried to get her back. He ended up losing and getting so hurt he kinda fell in a comma. After he woke up Sai and Shikamaru told him that Sakura was all awake day and night trying to bring him back and that he was saying Hinata's name over and over. He went to see Sakura because Shikamaru and Sai said she was really bad. When he was with her she said, ""So you finally noticed"", or something like that. Then at the end of the movie, he takes Hinata and starts blasting his Rasengan like that they can move faster. They end up really high in the sky, then he kisses her. When the credits are on we see that they got married, then after that, there is a short scene that shows her knitting a scarf and his training outside in the snow. A couple of seconds later their two kids are shown, then they all start a snow fight.</p>

<p>So my question is if Naruto did quickly fall in love with Hinata after the Genjutsu in the movie, or did he slowly start to feel something for her after it?</p>

<p>Also, in between that blank timeline of those two years, did Naruto figure out that Sakura was never going to fall in love with him and stopped liking her or did he stop liking her after being in that Genjutsu?</p>

"How is the use of the red stones able to bypass equivalent exchange?","<p>In the 2003 series, we see on different occasions that the red stones are used as an unstable alternative to the philosopher's stone despite the fact that they do not have any souls entrapped in them.

"Is it physically possible to turn a mahjong tile white with a super grip?","<p>In the manga <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudazumo_Naki_Kaikaku"">Mudazumo Naki Kaikaku</a>, the protagonist Junichiro Koizumi is able to use ""goumoupai"", the ability to turn any mahjong tile into a white/haku tile simply by <em>gripping it with immense strength</em>, usually leaving the tile dented.</p>

<p>Sure, the manga frequently goes overboard with the abilities of each character, but this one seems like it might actually be possible in real life. I'd assume that the <a href=""http://www.sloperama.com/majexchange/id.html"">material the tile is made out of</a> would be a giant factor, but apparently Koizumi can even do it with <em>depleted uranium tiles</em>.</p>

<li>It seems like you don't need to be aware of the existence of the Holy Grail war (Shirou and the murderer guy were both pretty clueless).</li>
<li>You do seem to need an heroic relic... or do you? When Kotomine was surprisingly chosen in Fate/Zero, did he have one already? What if you lose the relic before the summoning occurs?

<li>The Matou were disappointed that Kariya left behind their magical teachings, so they decided to adopt Sakura to prepare her for the next war. When Kariya returns and chooses to fight, he successfully becomes a master. This suggests that there is a way to opt out/in from the war (?)</li>

  object, but also through chakra-based substances as well.</p>

"Is there hard proof for the Curse of Ymir?","<p>As far as I know, the Survey Corps (and other relevant Elderians) learned of the Curse of Ymir (that a titan shifter only has 13 years to live and if not eaten, will die to have his titan power born again with a random Elderian) from the memories of Grisha Jäger, who in turn learned it from the Owl. The Marleyian army seems to be aware of the course as well. Owl probably got his information from the army or the Taybar family.</p>

<p>Now I wonder, is it guaranteed that this information is correct? From a narrative POV I don't believe the author will just wave his hands and say ""The curse never really existed, sorry!"", but from an POV from within the world, it would make sense that this is misinformation, deliberately given by King Fritz to protect Elderians outside Paradise (so they are not deliberately killed off as long as they can be used).</p>

"Can an order be Remembered / ""Sanity"" be kept","<p>As we know, if Lelouch uses his Geass, there is a small gap in memory from the order until it has been done.</p>

<p>My question is, can it be arranged so that if Lelouch's geass is used on someone, that person will remember the order after it has been done?</p>

<p>For example, can Lelouch order ""Hide this box, and remember where you hide it.""? The <code>keyword</code> here is <code>remember</code> - as in the <code>person I geassed will remember it</code>. Notice it's not a direct order that is ordered by a query (""When I snap my fingers, tell me where you hid it"")</p>

<p>Was this explored in the Anime? What about the OVAs or supplemental materials?</p>

<p>3 main characters, as far as I remember. I remember that out of the 2 boys, one was a boy who was from a different planet(dimension?). He played the piano and it had strange effects on those around him. The other boy was human. The human boy and the girl were friends. This anime probably had a school setting.</p>

<p>I remember there being a lot of scenes involving the alien boy going into another dimension where there was always a bed(?) that he talked to. The boy's mission was probably (not sure!) to bring humans back to his home planet...</p>

<p>In the end, the 2 boys decided to leave earth so that alien guy could return to his home and the girl was left behind. As soon as the boys left, the girl lost all her memories about them.</p>

"Why didn't Mr. Satan know about Z Warriors and their abilities?","<p>Mr. Satan was a professional martial artist. Surely, he was also a buffoon, but from what we've seen he is definitely very strong and skilled by the standards of someone who was never trained by someone like Kami or Kaioshin. In <em>Dragon Ball</em> series, he would probably be a decent opponent for Goku or Tien.</p>

<p>He also wasn't completely stupid - you don't become champion, millionaire and world star by not knowing what are doing. </p>

<p>In the real world, it takes a mixture of raw talent, hard work, and passion to achieve such level, and we have no reason to assume that it's any different in <em>Dragon Ball</em> universe.</p>

<p>Now, to finally get to the point:</p>

<ul>
<li>How come that he never came across stories about people like Master Roshi?</li>
<li>How come he didn't watch 21st, 22nd and 23rd Tournaments, where flying, Kamehamehas, disappearing and other strange techniques were common?</li>
<li>How come he had no idea about Tien (who won 22nd Tournament)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Satan must have been a young boy or teenager, and if he had the passion for martial arts, people like Tournament Winners should be like Gods to him. And yet, after these Tournaments, Mr. Satan doesn't recognize Goku, Piccolo or the other Z-Fighters. </p>

<p>Mind that I'm not questioning why he kept on insisting that everything that happened during Cell Games was a ""trick"" - he wouldn't want to admit that he was outclassed - but why was he actually and genuinely surprised. </p>

"Rewrite: Moon and Terra ending","<p>In the anime ending of Rewrite season 2 (Moon and Terra) did the girls summon Kotarou as their familiar knowing who he is/was? They were still childs when he was around them trying to save the earth. When he brought them to the moon, to the Kagari of season 1 did the girls remember their past lives or alternate routes? Can someone explain the ending to me, I'm not sure whether it was a good or bad ending. He completed his initial objective, but was that a good thing in order to fullfil his promise? </p>

<p>It are a lot questions but they are all related to the ending of season 2, hence why I didn't make several threads for this but just one. I am not really into novels or mange (yes it's weird I know) so I'd appreciate it if someone could explain the ending. Up to the point where he thought that he couldn't kill her but chose to go against his own instinct I could follow the storyline, but after that it all felt kinda rushed and I think those only watching the anime might've missed out on a lot important information.</p>

"Are Logia types overpowered?","<p>Logia types seem overpowered. Excluding the fact that they are practically invincible to anyone who is not a Haki user (if they can reflexively turn into their element), they have many more advantages:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Think about how outrageously powerful some of the Logia types could be if they were creative. Almost every other strong character in One Piece (Devil Fruit user or not) is strong because they were either creative as hell, had sheer strength and technique (Zoro), are Haki users with some sort of fighting ability or a combination of all three (of which Luffy is a perfect example). My point is, they all had to be creative or strong and skillful, with Haki to boot (sometimes). Let's be honest, most of the Logia types are so powerful because of their Fruits, I am not denying that their own, personal skill didn't attribute to some of their strength, but let's be real; you've got people like Enel, Kizara, Sakazuki and Ace. Pre-timeskip Ussop would be a formidable opponent with any of these Devil Fruits. It takes a lot of Logia types no physical training, and very little creativity to be a dangerous person to face. If these guys had creativity and didn't completely rely on their Devil Fruits' sheer power, very few people in the OP universe could beat them. Sakazuki could make his opponent's entire stepping ground a field of lava, he could simply make lava ""minions"" like mannequins made out of lava that could smash into his opponents. I'm sure there are more things he can do, I just made that off the top of my head. Anyways, there seems to be so much they could potentially do, that could wreck their opponent, but they are too comfortable in their abilities to even fathom needing more variety to beat someone.</p></li>
<li><p>A Logia can produce limitless amount of their element, this screams overpowered. Someone as formidable as Hawkeye Mihawk could be rendered useless to Ace if he simply chose to send an island-sized fire ball, after all Logias can produce an endless amount of their element. Even if Hawkeye is very fast, Ace could simply use the fire ball if he neared him or if he moved out of sight, and nuke the entire area with it. I doubt even Hawkeye is fast enough to get out of the destruction the attack would cause. Or take another hypothetical situation, Enel verses Shanks. Shanks is one of the strongest characters in One Piece, but if Enel uses his supercharged mantra plus his ability to travel at the speed of sound, he would own Shanks within moments.</p></li>
<li><p>This is a bit of a combo of my two points above, if they can control and manipulate their element in any fashion and use it limitlessly, couldn't they just create a repetitively powerful attack? Okay, some of them would need time for these attacks, but what about the extremely powerful ones that don't? Enel can easily send 200,000 volts into someone. I realize this won't immobilize some of the heavy hitters, but it would slow them the fuck down after he hit them with it for a second time. Kizara could just lock someone in a light cage and shrink it until they combusted inside, Ace could lock someone in a fire sphere and shrink, I am going off on what I read on Logias, that they can manipulate their element in any way, so they don't have to touch it to control it. Why hasn't anyone done this?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would bring up other situations that a Logia could have dominated in a split second if they had simply thought of said tactic, but that would take too long. I know some Logia types are more restricted verses others, and don't follow the exact definition, but still most aren't. Logia types could easily destroy islands and kill strong people in moments, it is ridiculous considering Paramecia types and Zoans being on-par with them, some but not many. If we follow the Logia's definition, Logias should be dominating everyone, only challenged by other Logia types. It is the only way (that I know of) in which a weakling or complete idiot can become one of the most dangerous people in OP, maybe the idiot would die, but think about how easily he could decimate a town. And the weakling is worse, they could strategize with power and beat the shit out of anything. I know even the extremely powerful Logias can easily lose, but a lot of that is up to circumstance and they still have a better chance at winning unless they are fresh newbies.</p>

<p>Seriously, everyone else has to work their ass off to just compete with Logias, and they use almost non of the creative end of their powers and just rely on its sheer destructive nature, and I think Oda knows this. Oda probably knows almost no Logia uses their abilities to its fullest, not even a tenth of its potential, and is still extremely strong. It might be a long running joke.</p>

"Why are there omissions and discrepancies in Kaori's Kreutzer performance?","<p>In ep. 2, the entrants to the competition are shown playing extracts from the first movement of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_Sonata_No._9_(Beethoven)"" rel=""nofollow"">Beethoven's sonata no. 9</a> (often referred to as the Kreutzer). This is most likely the only movement played, given the portrayal of Kaori's performance and the length of the Kreutzer.</p>

<p>It would not be appropriate to show a performance of the entire movement. (It could bore viewers, and it could easily take up half the episode.) We can thus justify an abridgement of the piece or the removal of some of sections. The omissions I have found so far, however, do not make sense.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>At the beginning, the section after the violin opening and before the statement of the theme <a href=""https://youtu.be/xzOPZZtAstM?t=21s"" rel=""nofollow"">(m. 5-18, mvt. 1)</a> is <a href=""https://youtu.be/sVYVcNt8F9k?t=52s"" rel=""nofollow"">omitted</a>. The continuity of Kaori's movements might with the soundtrack imply that <em>in-universe</em>, she did not play those omitted bars, but it is unclear.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/sVYVcNt8F9k?t=1m30s"" rel=""nofollow"">Later</a> after the piano finishes its reiteration of the theme, there is a pause (which exists in the original score). Kaori then jumps to a later section (the <em>adagio</em> shortly after), which is merged with the ending of the first movement. It seems that this jump also occurred in-universe.</p></li>
<li><p>The ""bland"" part that the other violinists were shown playing, which should have fallen after <em>adagio</em> mentioned above, is skipped.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This leaves me with the following question. <strong>Is there any suggestion that the movement is actually being played with these omissions and discrepancies in-universe? If so, why would this be the case?</strong> Are these instead just badly executed (in that they are misleading) cuts? After all:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For the purposes of a performance used to assess musicians, certain omissions, particularly skipping repeats, could be acceptable. The sections involved do not fall into such a category.</p></li>
<li><p>Surely if all the violinists are playing the same set piece in the same competition, there should not be any <em>obvious</em> variation in what is played, even if some parts are removed for length.</p></li>
<li><p>The movement seems to be a reasonable length for a short performance, particularly if the one repeat that appears is taken out.</p></li>
</ul>

"Can a soul that is normally freed from the Edo Tensei be resurrected again?","<p>This Edo Tensei looks pretty complicated and annoying, since the revived one is immortal and powerful. As we've seen, every soul was freed and moved to the afterlife (by this I mean normally freed from the jutsu), so if someone decides to use this jutsu again, could it be possible to bring back again a dead person (meaning that until you run out of DNA samples and vessels, you can bring back anyone an infinite number of times)?</p>

<p>Being an exception, I'm not reading the manga, but unfortunately I know that the Hokage's are revived, and in the cases of Hashirama and Tobirama, they were revived a second time, BUT they were sealed in the Shinigami, so their souls aren't brought back from the pure world (again, I have no idea about their second arrival, please, no spoiler, just I've mentioned that they came from somewhere else).</p>

One Piece is my favorite anime and I watch it a lot, so I don't take any ""white washing"" argument lightly. I don't even want to think of Oda as having racial bias, but I won't ignore the facts.</p>

<p>The article discusses different aspects of One Piece that can lead one to believe that the show has some racist undertones, but I won't go into detail about the article. The story about racism in One Piece mentions that Oda did tell the animators to change certain things concerned with the two-year time skip, and two of the dark-skinned characters came back way lighter. Is Oda racist? I don't know but I can't say he isn't, as the article had valid and reasonable points to prove that he at least has a racial bias.</p>

<p>Early in the story, we learn that Diclonius children gain access to their vectors and begin to kill humans at around the age of 3.

<p>All of these navigation instruments have limitations and disadvantages. The compass, for example, does not work for the Grandline and New World. The Log-Pose can follow only one magnetic wave and takes time to record the next magnetic wave. And the Eternal-Pose works for only one island.</p>

"How does the travel works in One Piece universe?","<p>I have noticed that traveling between and within the oceans in the One Piece world isn't easy. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGCI1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGCI1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>However, the Marines and some advanced pirate crews/alliances commute daily between the oceans. To be more specific, here are a few examples to demonstrate what I mean:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Marines travels between every oceans they want. By using Seastone on their ships, they can easily travel through the Calm Belt and switch between the Grand Line/New World and all Blues. Because the Marines is a member of the World Government, they can also pass the Red Line via Mary Joa.</p>

<p>However, the Seastone technique (Episode 410) is a new invention from Dr. Vegapunk. How did the Marines travel through the Calm Belt so easy before that? Another example in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiFOvnqltYw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 502-503</a>: How did a World Government ship travel from the Grand Line to East Blue 10 years ago when Seastone technique hadn't been invented?</p></li>
<li><p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhK3BRBsF34"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Luffy's past</a>, Shanks was in the East Blue, then in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD-4E3Zg_Qs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of Marine Ford</a>, he was again in Grand Line, etc.</p>

<p>Same for Whitebeard. One time, Whitebead was in the Grand Line, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_v1KGYYf6Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">then</a> in the East Blue, and then again in the Grand Line, etc.</p>

<p>How do Shanks and Whitebeard manage to travel between the Grand Line and the Blues on daily basis? <strong>Do Whitebead, Shanks and other Pirates also use Seastone like the Marines?</strong></p></li>
<li><p>And what about Monkey D. Dragon? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXfNIwcfa_M"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">One time</a>, Dragon was in the East Blue. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3ZCploiduQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here</a>, he was again in the Grand Line.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So I hope you see what my question is. I'm especially curious about the daily switching between the Grand Line/New World and Blues. As I know, the only way to enter the Grand Line is via the Reverse Mountain, which isn't the most harmless way as you can see in <a href=""http://onepiece-tube.com/folge/61"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">episode 61</a>. Does that mean that every time Whitebeard and Shanks want to go to the Grand Line, they have to pass this small river with their gigantic ships?</p>

<p>Apart from getting to the Grand Line, how do they leave the Grand Line/New World? According to the <a href=""http://www.opwiki.de/images/Karte_der_Grandline.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">maps</a>, there is no way to get out. How did <a href=""http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Krieg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Krieg</a> leave the Grand Line?</p>

"What's this music in ""World of Ice""?","<p>In ""World of Ice"" (ep. 9), there is music that starts off with something that sounds like a harpsichord, after Himari enters a hidden door in the library (around 6:11). Strings (mostly playing pizzicato, I think) and a clarinet come in later. Normally I'd assume that this might be something original created from the anime &mdash; for instance, I've heard stuff that could pass as classical music in the <em>Monogatari</em> Series.</p>

<p>However, I've noticed pieces that were clearly not original being used in this series, such as the beginning of Mozart's Piano Sonata K. 331 (when Himari is still in the normal section of the library), or the famous <a href=""https://youtu.be/-ENf4VEhI40?t=45s"" rel=""nofollow"">theme</a> from Dvořák's 9th symphony (in ""Because I love him""). Thus, it seems plausible that this is not original music.</p>

<p>What is the music playing here? I tried to look up the soundtrack or the episode on the fan-made wiki, but neither gave a full listing. Is this original music, and <em>if not</em>, where is this music from?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If I'm not mistaken, the same track appears in the first half of ep. 21 (""The Door of Fate We Choose""). This would suggest to me that it's more likely to be original music, but I'm not even completely sure right now if it's the same music.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I tried to search Musipedia, which largely is a classical music identification site, for the beginning of this section of the soundtrack and came up with no results that seemed correct. I also listened to this section of ""World of Ice"" a second time and it struck me as less ""Baroque"" and ""classical"" than I initially thought. Original music seems more likely, but I'm still having trouble obtaining the title of this music. (It's definitely nothing listed on this <a href=""http://seizon-senryaku-shimashouka.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tumblr</a>.)</p>

"Do Digimon eat other Digimon?","<p>In the opening episode of <em>Digimon Adventure</em>, Taichi was attacked by Kuwagamon.

As we know from the episode where Taichi, the other Digi-Destined, and their digimon ate dinner at the mansion, they eat meat too: which means we can assume that other digimon might exhibit the same dietary manner.</p>

<p>In <em>Digimon World</em> (PS game), it was shown that meat in the digimon world is produced from farms in a fruit-like manner. While digimon that live in a community and have a farm can surely meet their dietary needs from those farms, what about those who don't? For example, would Leomon in Digimon Adventure hunt other Digimon to eat?</p>

<p>I have never watched any Digimon anime other than <em>Digimon Adventure</em> 1 (Agumon &amp; co.) and 2 (Veemon &amp; co.) So, I'm not sure whether the digimon that come later in the series would exhibit the same dietary manner, or even have needs to eat at all. Digimon in <em>Digimon Adventure</em> 2 should exhibit the same dietary manner since the story takes place in the same digimon world.</p>

"Can this anime be identified by a small number of disconnected scenes?","<p>Please forgive me my somewhat lengthy preface here.</p>

<p>At best I have to estimate that this anime was aired at least 14 years ago.  I don't recall it being part of a series, so I'm fairly certain it was a one shot movie.  Never can be sure though.</p>

<p>All I can really provide for identification purposes is a small handful of scenes.  I am unsure if these are all even from a single anime.  It may well be 2 different ones that my memories have somehow merged to form a full concept.  Hopefully someone will recognize at least one of these scenes, otherwise, I'll need to find some way to wipe these things from my memory and forget they ever existed:</p>

<p>Scene 1</p>

<p>Takes place on a star ship
A tall alien with a disc like head.  At some point the monsters head detaches from its body and begins to fly around independently.
That is all I can recall from it.</p>

<p>Scene 2</p>

<p>Takes place on a planet near some teleporters?</p>

<p>A woman is fighting the alien, hears a voice (her brothers?) telling her to use or run to the teleporter.  It later turns out to be a recording.  There was some emotional connection between the woman and whoever's voice it was.</p>

<p>During the fight the monster gets caught in an explosion and blown into a building, one of the teleporters I think.  It walks out of rubble with something impaling its head.  It doesn't appear particularly phased, but woman seems to make special note of the injury, as though it was somehow unexpected.</p>

<p>Scene 3</p>

<p>The woman, older male and youger male (possibly a child) are driving, in a tunnel or under a bridge, or just some dense cityscape.  I just recall the environment being very crowded.</p>

<p>At some point they run into quadripedal monsters of some sort and wind up running a test one one, determining that it is somehow related to the main antagonist.</p>

<p>Scene 4</p>

<p>The main antagonist alien/monster appears to have placed a beacon (for some reason it strikes me that the beacon was organic in nature) on the roof of a building to start calling in more of its kind from off world.</p>

<p>Scene 5</p>

<p>Takes place in a desert setting.  The woman confronts the monster.  The woman has a staff of some sort, it was shown earlier in the movie, I believe by the younger boy.  When the tip of the staff is pressed into the ground it generates a forcefield that surrounds the staff and
its user.  the tip is pressed into the monster, causing the force field to cut the creature in half horizontally.</p>

<p>The top half falls towards the woman and the ""face"" of the monster extends from the head to attack her.  It turns out the things neck was its only weakness.  As it is falling, someone, I believe at this point backup had arrived, takes a blade and cuts into the things neck, and then slices it down length wise, cutting the face in half too.</p>

<p>If any part of these scenes can be used to identify an anime, I would be beyond greatful to know my mind wasn't playing tricks on me.</p>

One might initially think that he would risk being overshadowed in a strong team, for example by Sendoh if he were to join Ryonan.

<p>Did Rukawa give any indication why he picked Shohoku in particular? Was it simply because, as a teenager, he made bad choices? Was there something special about Shohoku that I missed? Did the ambition come later, as the character evolved? Or did it make some sense from Rukawa's perspective?</p>

<p>He later sends Triela a bear as a Christmas present. (He claims to have sent his daughter a Christmas present every year, and Triela has received a bear for Christmas every year, supposedly from her handler.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In European folklore and folk-belief of the Medieval and Early Modern periods, familiar spirits (sometimes referred to simply as ""familiars"" or ""animal guides"") were supernatural entities believed to assist witches and cunning folk in their practice of magic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the page does not seem to refer familiars in an Eastern context. So I was wondering if they are to be taken as they are in Western culture, or if they are an interpretation of this.</p>

<p>Further down the page, there is another definition:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A familiar spirit (alter ego, doppelgänger, personal demon, personal totem, spirit companion) is the double, the alter-ego, of an individual. It does not look like the individual concerned. Even though it may have an independent life of its own, it remains closely linked to the individual. The familiar spirit can be an animal (animal companion).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this definition, does this mean that Cecil has a perverted side to her, that is expressed through Nana Genie?</p>

<p>They must be able to perform magic, as Magic Prohibition Law article 8 states that:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Article 8: If a familiar breaks the law, the owner is held responsible.  </p>

c) is really on par with Shiraki's ruthless and unscrupulous persona.<br>
d) is a way for Shiraki to strike at the same time both Mayu and Hayasaka (for her daring to step on stage again, and for his ""betrayal"" on mentoring WUG)  </p>

"Juubi and Rikudou's brother?","<p>From the current chapters of Naruto, it is revealed, that Rikudou Sennin has a brother who also sealed the juubi in himself. That means there are two juubis in the world. If Madara has/had control of one of them, where could the other be hidden? His presence in the world for now is speculation. But as the Rabbit Goddess had Byakugan, this could mean that this brother may have been the Hyuuga's ancestor, which would mean Senju, Uchiha, and Hyuuga are indeed related, but Hyuuga and Uchiha could never be able to use the other's doujutsu, because of difference in ancestor.</p>

<p>So in essence, I'm asking, where could the second Juubi presumably be, is it not possible that the brother is the Hyuuga ancestor? For now this is all speculation, but I have a feeling that Kishimoto will end this series with a few plot holes, so I want to see other users' ideas on these questions.</p>

<p>I know this might be a really silly question for someone who watches anime and this may sound very far fetched but I havent watched Naruto before.

"Under what Touge rules did Project D race against Purple Shadow?","<p>From my understanding, throughout the whole anime series, the touge rules has been one of the following:</p>

<p><strong>Cat and Mouse/Sudden Death</strong> (using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dge"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia Tōge</a> terminology...)     </p>

<ul>
<li>Cars start bumper to bumper, if cat finishes a round ahead of the rat
with a considerable time difference, cat wins. If rat overtakes the
cat, rat wins. If neither happen, proceed to a new round and swap
positions.</li>
<li>Example: When Keisuke beat Wataru on Shomaru pass</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Grip Gambler</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cars start side by side (or rolling start up to first turn), whoever is leader at the end wins.</li>
<li>Example: When Takumi raced Keisuke at Akina pass</li>
</ul>

<p>When Project D raced Purple Shadow, both Takumi and Keisuke's races started bumper to bumper indicating that it wasn't grip gambler. However, in both cases, they were overtaken at one point and the race didn't end, meaning it wasn't cat and mouse sudden death. Perhaps there's a <em>non-sudden death</em> version of cat and mouse, which would make a lot more sense as both races went into multiple rounds. </p>

<p>However, there is still something not quite right. In Takumi's case, he overtook his opponent back and prolonged the race. In Keisuke's case, he overtook his opponent back and the race ended (with no noticeable winning distance). </p>

<p>What was different between Keisuke and Takumi's race so that Keisuke won? Keisuke regained his lead but that should have taken it into the next round. Even Keisuke himself said ""That felt kind of questionable. Want to go for a third run?""</p>

<p>So overall, I am beyond confused. Exactly what Touge race rules did they race in?</p>

"What is Serial Experiments Lain about?","<p>I have yet to find a clear answer to this question. From what I've read, it may be an art-house series about dangers of remote communication, phobia of technological advancement and feeling of insecurity. The last point I can agree with because of how easily information can be accessed with the use if internet these days, but the rest… I think there's a more concrete meaning to this series.</p>

<p>SEL is a series with very unusual direction and a peculiar artistic style. These traits are commonly seen in art-house works that may not bear any specific message.</p>

<p>Throughout the series we learn about the difficult reality surrounding Lain: her relatives are troubled, some of her friends have psychological problems, there are suicides happening in mystical circumstances, and then there are some secret agents following around.</p>

<p>Later in the series, things become rather surreal and Lain turns into some kind of god of the Net. I've never understood this portion of the anime and what it could possibly suggest. <em>Does it warn us about dangers of becoming too self-important? Does it mean it's possible to lose the sense of reality when using internet? Or maybe Lain's character is a metaphor for a person new to technological advancements of today?</em></p>

<li>Both are magic users with control over time.</li>
<li>Both augment their magical powers with modern weaponry.</li>
<li>Both are very taciturn, but deeply loving towards certain people (Homura towards Madoka and Kiritsugu towards Iri and Illya).</li>
<li>Both are mentally damaged by the horrors of war (Homura's experiences in the time loops and Kiritsugu's experiences in various war zones over the years).</li>
<li>Both characters are pivotal to the events of the story, but for most of the series the viewers, and even the main heroine herself, have no idea what they are thinking.</li>
<li>Both have something of a gap in ideals with the main heroine (Homura's actions during the movie go against Madoka's wishes, while Kiritsugu and Saber clash so much from the very beginning that Kiritsugu assigns her to work with Iri).</li>

"What is the paper at Saki's desk in From the New World about?","<p>I've been wondering this for ages:</p>

<p>At the end of <em>From the New World</em>, Saki has this piece of paper on her desk. Below you can see it (and somebody translated them to Spanish).</p>

<p>Apparently these are names, and some of them are followed by a number. Unfortunately I don't recognise any of those names so I'm not sure what is this paper about.</p>

<p>At first I guessed it was some sort of deceased people list (numbers representing their age?). However the fourth name reads ""New Yuubari"", so it sounds like a <em>place</em> rather than somebody... but it lacks a number, so it could actually be a <em>headline</em>, as in ""the following people died at New Yuubari"" - same thing for ""Shinamoto"", which makes sense - but then the first three names lack a headline.</p>

<p>So I'm not sure - <em>what</em> is this paper?</p>

<li><p>We know that when Itachi explained Izanami to Sasuke, he happened to mention why the Izanami was created. It was because the Uchiha folks back then, used Izanagi for all wrong reasons.

Everyone but Sei died, and even then had to be rescued almost at the end of the way.<br><br>
 If they went through all this trouble to just get Ei Sei, it is only strongly implied that Sei's mother, who hadn't been rescued, would be in grave danger, probably geting killed some time soon (since Sei's Zhao pursuers at some point mentioned that it didn't matter if they captured Sei dead or alive), and if not heavily watched and/or tortured and disgraced more harshly that she had been before (since people's logic of those times was so flawed that they would go so far as to blame some innocent person from a nation for the crimes of some other person from the same nation).</p>

<p>Having said that, I am wondering <strong>how the hell did she get out from Zhao?</strong> (seeing as Sei's initially unnoticed escape was barely possible.)</p>

"Why didn't Sarutobi kill Danzo?","<p>As I'm watching these filler episodes, I am wondering, why was Danzo still alive, after doing all the things he did to The Third? He hid a Wood style user, he tried to assassinate Sarutobi (not even once), he tried to lure the Anbu forces to join the Federation, he tried to manipulate the Hokage election after the death of Minato, and so on (just from these couple of episodes, without mentioning the whole ""rivalry"" between them).</p>

<p>The Third was aware of the situations, since he warned Danzo a lot of times. So even if he was a member of the Hokage's council, why did Sarutobi endure the disrespect and danger that came from Danzo? I would've been pleased even with a ban from the Village, but given what he had done, Sarutobi could've eliminated Danzo without any efforts.</p>

The old man then asks Amahiko what his name is and tells him he is called Amahiko too, just before turning into a butterfly (or so it seems from the last scene):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AvrQ2.jpg"" alt=""Amahiko meets the old man""></p>

<p>However in the whole story there isn't any other character named Amahiko so I'm confused about who the old man is, also because I've read various theories on different websites.</p>

<p>The old man and Amahiko could be the same person, however this would create a loop since  Amahiko (old version) would give the magic box to himself (young version) and wouldn't really explain why does he seem to turn into a butterfly.</p>

<p>Another interesting theory is that the old man is God (or some kind of supernatural being) who came on earth to encourage Amahiko who was kind of depressed and didn't want to stand up and recover from the fall, this is supported by the fact that he seems to know a lot about Amahiko (however this is also a good point for the first theory), his face is never shown clearly and he just disappears/turns into a butterfly (and the butterflies have a lot of supernatural meanings in this manga).</p>

<p>There's also the possibility that Amahiko, being lost in his own world, imagined the old man, but he is shown talking to another character at the beginning of the manga so I don't think this is the case.</p>

<p>So, my question is, who is this old man? And whoever he is, what does this character mean/represent? What does the magic box represent since it isn't actually opened by Amahiko?</p>

<p>I really like this manga, but there are so many details I need to clear up a bit!</p>

"Why is it common for anime to lack surround sound?","<p>With all this push for HD video, I would think HQ audio (5.1 surround sound) would be obvious. But I am having trouble finding any TV anime in 5.1; One Piece from Japan is only stereo (movies are an exception), Crunchyroll does not have any 5.1 according to their support, most anime series listed on sale say on Amazon (or even Rightstuf) don't even seem to have a field for the sound type (stereo or surround). </p>

"How do Demon Weapons work in Soul Eater?","<p>I don't understand exactly how they work. I've got the basics, but I want to know the details.</p>

<p>Simply put, a Demon Weapon is a person who can transform into a weapon. Alone they aren't much of a threat, but paired with a Weapon Meister the two are very powerful. But later in the Soul Eater series we see how some Weapons and Meisters pose a serious threat on their own, but they look trained and experienced, so it seems to be more of a guideline.</p>

<p>In the first few episodes there's talk about 100-soul ritual, where a Demon Weapon has to consume 99 Kishin eggs and 1 witch soul. The Weapon is supposed to level up after that somehow, and the effects of that aren't very clear to me.</p>

<p>The only thing that hints at the magnitude of such upgrade is that Death uses Maka's father as his weapon, him being a Death Weapon. It's like the two most powerful guys in the show together, yet not much is apparent about how it affects their power (both Meister and Weapon).</p>

<p>Also, we see some Meisters teamed up with more than one Weapon. They can resonate their souls and it somehow works for them. It seems this is kind of the same as multiple Weapon-Meister combos resonating all of their souls together. But what about combos with only Weapons and only Meisters? Would that work?</p>

<p>I'm also confused about how a basic Weapon and an upgraded one should be called. Are they Demon Weapons or Death Weapons?</p>

<ul>
<li>What does completing this 100-soul ritual do for Weapon and Meister?</li>
<li>What about combos with 1 Weapon and >1 Meisters?</li>
<li>What are the basic and upgraded Weapons called?</li>
</ul>

  <p>It's hard to say exactly what change takes place at Level 24, but for some reason, the mushrooms take their chance and merge into a single organism, taking over the Paras in the process.
