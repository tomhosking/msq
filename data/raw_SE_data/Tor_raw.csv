"Would like to use Tor with _and_ without proxy --> unexpectedly ends program","<p>I am using my laptop at home (with proxy) and outside my home (without proxy).
I have set Tor to use proxy.
Then, of course, when I am not at home, it cannot connect to the network.
No problem so far.
The problem is, however, that I do not know how to change the settings. 
The window ""Connecting to Tor network"" closes too quickly for me to click on ""Open settings"". 
Then the window ""Tor network settings"" appears, but it only has the options ""Restart Tor"", ""Contact torproject.org/about/contact.html#support [not a button]), ""Copy log to clipboard"", ""Next"", and ""Close"". (Please excuse me if I do not have the exact names, I am using Tor with German.)</p>

<p>Here are my questions: What do I have to do to be able to use Tor both at home and outside my home? Where can I set the settings so Tor knows not to search for a proxy?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance,</p>

"How is tor traffic exempt from censorship/a country's DNS servers?","<p>This is my understanding around how Tor may be used to circumvent a country's censorship of particular sites:</p>

<p>John lives in a country that has blocked traffic to a particular server (via DNS, I assume?).</p>

<p>John jumps onto Tor, and now his traffic is sent to a different DNS server since his exit node is quite possibly outside of his overly-strict country.</p>

<p>He can have access to the site, great.</p>

<p>The question is, I don't live in a country that has this kind of block in place. But supposing it was <em>me</em> logging onto Tor, is it not possible I could hit an exit node that was from John's country? Thus being subject to the DNS server that blocks traffic to the server to which I'm making a request?</p>

"ISP & LEO tracking on Tor","<p>I realize this will sound like I am beating a dead horse; however, I've read many, many threads and comments on this topic and am not quiet satisfied. Maybe I'm being too specific and need a more specific answer.</p>

<p>This is a two part question.</p>

<p><b>Scenario ONE</b>: Time and again I see the question of whether or not ISPs can see detailed information on users activity and repeatedly see the answer ""No, they can see the URL but nothing more on httpS, etc."" </p>

<p><b>Question</b>: Why can the ISP NOT see what is coming through their servers?
In my mind I see it like this: Hi, I'm Skynet ISP. I see that right now IP#THIS is on http Google and he's looking up homemade taco soup recipes. That IP # is assigned to Hugh Jass.</p>

<p>And here is IP#THAT on httpS Yahoo. That IP is assigned to Pat McCrotch. Even though it is a httpS, I still must be able to decipher what is on the page to make sure I transmit the data properly. Yahoo is delivering an ad about Clash of Clans, Headlines of a presidential assassination and Microsoft going bankrupt. </p>

<p>Oh, Yahoo just delivered video results about college orgies. </p>

<p>And... this is odd, IP#THIS&amp;THAT...assigned to Mike Hunt is on a strange looking URL...   .onion. Oh, he's using Tor. I'm going to open Tor Browser and see what is on that page. Looks like Mike is shopping for unauthorized medicine. I'll log this and save it for law enforcement.</p>

<p>.................</p>

<p><b>Scenario TWO</b>: On the other end is the FBI running DeepWeb markets. One site sells unauthorized medicines. The funds go to support the Bureau in efforts to rout out cyber-criminals. Maybe even bust a few customers here and there since they have their address. Looks good in the papers to see the Bureau busting people for online drug deals.</p>

<p>On another page the FBI runs a photo &amp; video page of underground porn, jihad execution videos, hacker Anonymous video messages, etc. </p>

<p><b>Question</b>: Would it not be possible that embedded in the photo or video metadata could be a homing beacon? Every time the beacon hits an ISP, relay and final destination the beacon would ""phone home"" to announce it's current location thereby exposing the users and relays and final recipients of the requested information?</p>

<p>............................</p>

<p>It seems to me that the only way to be completely secure is for you to produce your own encryption software, hand it to me on disc and I install it on my PC. Then when I go to your encrypted site and the data begins to transfer thru my ISP they have no way of decrypting the data because the decrypt software was never online.</p>

"How does de-anonymization work?","<p>I heard that someone, who can read the traffic of many tor nodes (like the government of a country where many nodes are located) can find out which user is sending/reading data to/from which resource by statistical analyzing those node's traffic. I've read this is done by analyzing the traffic of the first and last node of each route. As I did understand, the middle node seems not to be of interest. Is this true? If yes: Why is the middle node's traffic not useful for statistic analysis?</p>

<p>Each tor route goes through three tor nodes. Can it help to protect the anonymity of tor users to choose only routes where the first and last node are located in different countries? Maybe even different continents?</p>

<p>And what about hidden services? The traffic from a user to a hidden service goes twice through the tor network, so that there are six tor nodes transporting the data. How does this influence de-anonymization? Is it enough to analyze data of nodes 1 and 6? Or is there a need to analyze the nodes 3 and 4 too?</p>

<p>Supposed Tor software already creates only routes where the nodes 1 and 3 are located in different countries: If a user connects to a hidden service, can it be, that nodes 1 and 6 are now in the same country? Wouldn't this allow this countries government to find out quicker to which hidden service a user is connected, than to which normal website?</p>

<p><strong>clarification:</strong></p>

<p>I am not interested in other methods of attacking a users or a service providers anonymity. I am asking about traffic analysis and how it can be influenced by placing Tor nodes over the planet, and if hidden services make it easier or harder to perform such analysis.</p>

"How can a .onion url be routed on the internet on the right server?","<p>Ok, so thank you for taking some time to read this.</p>

<p>My teammates and I are on a university project to understand how Tor functions.</p>

<p>In the context that a client made a request to a normal website (i.e. through public DNS), the request will have a path consisting of exactly three nodes and the last node will make the request to the requested IPv4 address.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if it is an onion address (and this is the question), there will be three nodes for the client, and three nodes for the server who is hosting the onion website requested. Between the client nodes and the server nodes, is the request filtered through Tor's DNS so they can change the onion address to an IPv4 address? And relay the request to the first server node which will transmit it to the others two nodes where the exit node is going to make the request with the IPv4 address that Tor's server changed?</p>

<p>For sure, Tor's server would have encrypted the message three times.</p>

<p>By the way, is the message encrypted with RSA with the three public keys of the assigned node's path? Once a node has the message, does it decrypt it with it's private key?</p>

<p>To summarize a little bit:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is Tor changing an onion url to an IPv4 address in the middle between the three client nodes and the three server nodes?</li>
<li>Is the exit node on the server side making the request with an IPv4 address?</li>
</ol>

"Allowing Flash Player even though its insecure","<p>Sorry but since ""add a comment"" only brought up a sign-up-window this will be a new question.</p>

<p>It is again about allowing flash content to be played within the TOR-Browser. Every one just answers it would be insecure and thus is blocked even if the plugin is enabled and the player installed. Flash may leak the IP-Adress.. to whom? The flash site itself might get to know who I am, but the provider of the internet I'm using will not. And that is still some kind of anonymity wished for as long as flash is still around.</p>

<p>So one answer is 'go VPN instead'. But why do you want to kick out flash users from the TOR-Community? The whole idea was to get lots of people using TOR for normal reasons so that whistleblowers for example can hide in that crowd. And what is a more normal use of internet/TOR than browsing for porn? As long as the NSA-Buildings we all got to see in the Snowden-News are not hosting a majority of all porn content to get the real identity of TOR-Users that porn surfing crowd is helping to hide other more critical guys.</p>

<p>I do think blocking flash is a terrible decision. Warning about Flash is enough. Also No-Script can be just deactivated allowing Java-Scripts leaking the IP adress and no one is blocking that. It just works the way flash used to work in TOR.
Just allow everything every normal web browsing user would expect to work. And allow to go back to full-safe-mode with one click. And that's it. Security for the ones who require it, Comfortability for the crowd protecting that kind of dudes and porn for the ones takeing a break from being full secure without haveing to rely on another product (VPN).</p>

"How feasible is that Directories grant you only compromised nodes to build the circuit from?","<p>I asked <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/82622/how-secure-are-tor-circuits/82631#82631"">this question</a> about Tor and how secure are the first steps before the circuit is made (the guy who answered me, lead me to this site which i didn't know).</p>

<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong (or if the guy is wrong, since I will take his answer as starting point).</p>

<p>Currently the Directories (which are hard-coded servers in the Tor software) download a huge list of nodes. The Tor client is the one who creates the circuit. However: How can one be sure that the Directories are not compromised (after all, they are mainly maintained by the US Defense dept.) and don't bring compromised nodes? I'm aware that Tor does not build a circuit having 2+ nodes from the same ""person"" but ... what if the NSA has spread a lot of nodes and the Directories bring you such nodes? (perhaps your IP address is already being watched by the US dept. for suspicious* activities beforehand, and they only grant you, for that IP, a subset of nodes which are all from distinct identities but all of them compromised in the same way).</p>

<p>How feasible is what I say?</p>

"What is most likely cause of page injections while using Tor?","<p>So, I have a connection from my Linux-64-tor-2.6.3 TBB browser to an entry node in a foreign country.  That country is a very long way from here.  The node is running the latest Tor, so it's using a ECDHE* (supposedly strong) encryption cipher suite.  I look at netstat, and see only the 443 connection from here to the foreign node. While Tor appears to be working OK, I see that junk is injected into my pages (nasty stuff).  I believe the junk may come from a local hostile environment. I did not accept any additional certificates. So, if it's really local,  what's the most likely scenario:</p>

<p>1) The ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES256 suite can be broken on the fly (very quickly)?</p>

<p>2) The certificates for the Tor node are manipulated/compromised?</p>

"Does all direct clients have to talk to Directory Authorities to fetch the consensus at the first step?","<p>I just read a description on <a href=""https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html?graph=userstats-relay-country&amp;start=2011-09-09&amp;end=2015-03-09&amp;country=all&amp;events=off"" rel=""nofollow"">Tor Metrics</a> stating that: ""These estimates are derived from the number of directory requests counted on directory authorities and mirrors"".
So my question is already stated above, but in more details: ""does a directory-request get counted twice if the download from mirrors also counted?""
Because as far as I am aware, all Tor clients only know the Directory Authorities, which are hard-coded into TBB, and have no idea about mirrors (directory-caches). In other words, I imply that all direct users first request the whole consensus document from Directory Authorities, but not the mirrors. Later, Client maintains the validity of the document by frequently fetching only descriptors (from the mirrors) which have different hash-value from the one that they are processing. By this way, the clients do not need to talk to Directory Authorities a second time.
Please correct me if I imply something wrong.
Best regards. </p>

  <p>To address these, we extended the directory protocol so that<br>
  authorities now published signed ""network status"" documents.  Each<br>
  network status listed, for every router in the network: a <strong>hash</strong> of
  its    <strong>identity key</strong>, a <strong>hash of its most recent descriptor</strong>, and
  a summary of    what the authority believed about its status.  Clients
  would download    the authorities' network status documents in turn,
  and believe    statements about routers iff they were attested to by
  more than half of    the authorities.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Instead of downloading all server descriptors at once, clients<br>
  downloaded only the descriptors that they did not have.</strong>  Descriptors
  were indexed by their <strong>digests</strong>, in order to prevent malicious
  caches    from giving different versions of a server descriptor to
  different    clients.</p>

If the answer is basing on ""<strong>what I have highlighted</strong>"", could anyone please give me a hint where I can have a look at those ""<strong>variables</strong>"", given that the recent version of Tor only fetchs micro-descriptors, not the whole server-descriptors.

<p>When I  click the NoScript icon in a non-Tor Firefox browser, it lists all the domains that supply Javascript to the current page and I can temporarily turn on JS for one or more of them until the page is working.
But when I use the Tor Browser, no domains are listed under NoScript.  Does anyone know if this is an intentional feature of the TorBrowser or if it is a bug?</p>

<p>If I click ""Temporarily allow all this page"" and then click NoScript, Options, Whitelist, only the main domain of that page is whitelisted (which usually is not really ALL the scripts on that page).
Often this is enough to get the page working, but some pages still do not work properly.  My guess is that they need JS from other domains to function.  Unfortunately, I don't know what domains they need because NoScript doesn't list them.

"How to restore GnuPG proxy configuration to default?","<p>I was trying to verify TOR package signature with this command:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290</p>

<p>I got this response</p>

<p>Thankfully I was able to do the actual verification by using another computer (both Ubuntu 16.04LTS).</p>

<p>But someone pointed out that my main system's GnuPG configuration is not default, as it's expecting HTTP proxy.  This seemed proven true by moving the same files (package and signature) to another computer with the same OS and giving the same command and it worked instantly.  </p>

"Generating .onion adresses out of public key","<p>Suppose in my node.js app I have a 1024bit RSA key pair., I hashed the public key and derive .onion addres from the hash. </p>

<p>Is it possible to register this exact keypair and the hostname as a hidden service? and if so - how?  I assume that steps wuld be creating a hidden service folder in /var/lib/tor, placing there hostname and privateKey files, and adding this service in torrc... But where to put the public key? should I put signature of the folder? any other steps I am missing?</p>

"How Can I Keep My Tor Relay Stable When I Need To Do A Software Update","<p>I run a TOR relay under the name ""torland"" (<a href=""http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/router_detail.php?FP=8d90596192e548c8c00fa9e82759f95b875dc99e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/router_detail.php?FP=8d90596192e548c8c00fa9e82759f95b875dc99e</a>).

"Hosting Site as Hidden Service","<p>Is it advisable to host a <strong>very lightweight</strong> (less than 300 KiB per page, including all images, stylesheets etc.) general purpose site as a hidden service?</p>

<p>I do not expect there to be many users (<strong>over</strong>estimating 1 GiB bandwidth usage over 1 month)</p>

<p>I am not worried about me nor my users being anonymous</p>

<p>Is this small amount of traffic good for the Tor network?<br>
It adds some noise so that the legitimate users blend in. But it also reduces their available bandwidth.</p>

<p>I am also planning on using server-side processing (PHP in particular).</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can get a semi-custom Onion domain for free/low cost</li>
<li>I can provide better uptime than free hosts on the clearnet</li>
<li>Allows legitimate users that require Tor to blend in with traffic generated from site</li>
<li>Introduces people to Tor and Tor Browser Bundle (eventually some will become relays)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduces the bandwidth for legitimate users</li>
<li>Possibly more likely for me to be D/DoS-ed<br>
(people aren't going to take down a site that is helping them blend in, will they?)</li>
<li>More people trying to hack me (even easier since they can do it anonymously)</li>
<li>Less accessible for people (but that's my problem)</li>

"Replicating onion address algorithim?","<p>By all sources I can find, onion / hidden service ""domains"" are generated by <a href=""https://www.peterbeard.co/blog/post/generating-a-vanity-onion-address/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this process</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Generate a 1024-bit RSA keypair

<p>I have tried to replicate it, by first <a href=""https://pastebin.com/raw/Gpdav49K"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">generating a memorable vanity URL</a> with Scallion, ""zzzzzzycizaamf47.onion"". I then wrote a PHP script to derive the public key from that private key, strip the formatting, hash it, truncate to 10 chars, and base32 encode it. First of all I found three different ""encode as base32"" functions, all which give different results. This is the code, with results commented after the three functions:</p>

<pre><code>$privKey = 'MIIEpAIBAAKC ~snip~ azScNv5A';
$rsa = new Crypt_RSA();
$rsa-&gt;loadKey($privKey);
$pubKey = $rsa-&gt;getPublicKey(CRYPT_RSA_PUBLIC_FORMAT_PKCS1);

$pubKey = str_replace(array(""\r"", ""\n"", ' ', '=', '-----BEGINRSAPUBLICKEY-----', 
    '-----ENDRSAPUBLICKEY-----'), '', $pubKey); //

$pubKey = sha1($pubKey);
$pubKey = substr($pubKey, 0, 10);


echo base_convert($pubKey, 16, 32).PHP_EOL; //Result: 68s3ii2

echo crockford32_encode($pubKey).PHP_EOL; //Result: 60rkjcb365hp2d1j

$base32 = new Base2n(5, 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567', FALSE, TRUE, TRUE);
echo $base32-&gt;encode($pubKey).PHP_EOL; //Result: GAYTSMLDGFRWCNBS

"How is my IP being tracked?","<p>Recently I downloaded some e-books from b-ok.org (formerly known as bookzz). After downloading a few books, the site notified me that: ""more than 5 books have been downloaded from this IP in the last 24 hour, please sign in or register"". Confident the site was merely recognizing my Tor exit IP, I changed my VPN's location, and rebooted Tor with a different identity. But when I returned to the site I was shocked to receive the same warning! How could this site know the same IP was attempting to download this book? I've tried numerous methods to alter/obfuscate my IP address (switched browsers, new identities, new guard node, router reboot, new VPN location), but this site mysteriously still knows it's me trying to download this book.</p>

"Problem with browser or extensions?","<p>Any extension that adds a toolbar button has a problem.  For example, the
link below is the drop-down box for HTTPS Everywhere.  As you can see,
the box is almost empty.  Just to be clear, all other extensions like AdBlock
have the same empty drop-down box.  What I'm calling the ""drop-down box""
is really the GUI for thousands of extensions.</p>

resolved.  The problem reappears after closing and opening Tor Browser.</p>

<p>Should I uninstall and reinstall the browser?  If not, what is the solution?</p>

"What is the purpose of the middle node?","<p>So I'm just trying to understand the functioning of the Tor network from <a href=""https://robertheaton.com/2019/04/06/how-does-tor-work/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Robert Heaton fantastic article</a>. My understanding is that the guaranty Tor tries to give is that <strong>no node knows which source IP is talking to which destination IP</strong>. </p>

<ul>
<li>The guard node knows the source IP but not the destination.</li>
<li>The middle node doesn't know the source IP, neither the destination.</li>
<li>The exit node knows the destination IP but not the source.</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is: what is the purpose of the middle node in ensuring the guaranty? If I remove the middle node from the list above, neither the guard node nor the exit node know about both the source and destination IP, so the system still works.</p>

<p>Of course if I control both the guard and exit nodes at once, I could correlate the logs to construct the logs of a full circuit, but that is also true with 3 nodes if I also control the middle node. In this case, why stop at 3 nodes? The more nodes there are in the circuit, the less likely it is that one entity is controlling them all.</p>

"Why does Tor use more relays when connecting to .onion site than to normal one?","<p>I've noticed that Tor connects to sites on clearnet with 3 relays (see first picture). In this particular example my packets go through relays in Germany, Canada and US. But when I connect to duck duck go on deepweb (see second picture), it uses 6 relays, 3 of which are concealed. Am I interpreting it correctly? If so, why are they secret? And why do I need 3 more to connect to the onion site?

"Are the IP addresses listed for relays in the Tor consensus documents accurate?","<p>I am working on a research project involving the analysis of Tor exit nodes and their IP addresses from a specific time frame using data from TorMetrics. I can see that each relay entry in a consensus document has an associated IP address, like so:</p>

<pre><code>r PDrelay1 AAFJ5u9xAqrKlpDW6N0pMhJLlKs 0f0NYCcVKbQkJCK2ZdZRfxFXtVU 2015-08-31 10:53:35 95.215.44.189 8080 0

s Fast Running Stable Valid
v Tor 0.2.7.2-alpha-dev
w Bandwidth=480
p reject 1-65535
</code></pre>

<p>but also that along with the archived consensus documents there is an archive for exit-lists, which appear to be documents that have the IP address associated with exit relays like so:</p>

<p>(not the same relay)</p>

<pre><code>ExitNode 0011BD2485AD45D984EC4159C88FC066E5E3300E

<p>These exit lists appear to be updated less regularly than the consensus</p>

<p>So my main question is: If I'm trying to associate an exit relay with a specific IP address at a certain time, is it safe to just use the IP address that's listed for that relay in the consensus document for that hour, or are there other considerations that need to be taken into account? Also, if the IP address listed with a relay in the consensus document is accurate, then what even is the point of having exit list documents? </p>

"Hidden Service in TestingTorNetwork connected to non-Exit Nodes","<p>I set up a testing environment made of lxd containers on Ubuntu 18.04. Each container is based on the Ubuntu 18.04 image and runs Tor version 0.4.1.6.
Specifically, I have the following running machines:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 Authorities (named as TorAuthoritity[01,02,03])</li>
<li>3 Exit Relays (named as TorRelay[01,02,03]Exit)</li>
<li>3 non-Exit Relays (named as TorRelay[04,05,06])</li>
<li>1 Hidden Service (named as TorHs01)</li>
<li>1 Client (named as TorClient01)</li>
</ul>

<p>The torrc file has the ""TestingTorNetwork 1"" configuration value.</p>

<p>Moreover, only the torrc of Exit Relays has the following configuration values:</p>

<pre><code>ExitRelay 1
ExitPolicy accept *:*
</code></pre>

<p>whereas all the other torrc files (i.e., Authorities and non-Exit Relays) have the following configuration values:</p>

<pre><code>ExitRelay 0
ExitPolicy reject *:*
</code></pre>

<p>All the Tor relays and hidden service are configured in order to use the three Authorities</p>

<p>However, I noticed that the Hidden Service is always connected to one or more non-Exit Relays whereas I expected to see only connections to Exit Relays.
For example, by running the command ""lsof -i"" on the container providing the Hidden Service, I get the following result:</p>

<pre><code>root@TorHs01:~# lsof -i

</code></pre>

<p>where the last two lines represent connections to TorAuthority03 (which is configured as a non-Exit Relay) and TorRelay02Exit (which is configured as an Exit Relay) respectively.</p>

<p>Generally, the Hidden Service is always connected at least to a non-Exit Relay (e.g., TorRelay04, TorAuthority03, etc) whereas I expected that the Hidden Service was only connected to Exit Relays (in my lxd environment, TorRelay01Exit, TorRelay02Exit, TorRelay03Exit).</p>

<p>Looking at the network traffic through Wireshark, it looks like the Hidden Service is using a non-Exit Relay as an exit node, although the consensus already includes the three Exit Relays in my testing environment.
Is this behavior related to the testing environment only? If yes, do you already know why this happens? Is it possible to avoid this behavior? </p>

"How can I make the Tor browser remember different zoom levels for different sites like the Firefox does?","<p>for the firefox, I can set a zoom level for a domain, and then FF will remember this zoom level for every page of this domain for all the tabs.</p>

<p>However, for Tor, it can only keep a zoom level for a tab, for this tab, any page, no matter from same domain or not, is display in the changed zoom level. But if I open a subpage from a domain I have set a unique zoom level, the new tab always display in the default 100% level.</p>

<p>It seems that in Firefox, the zoom level is bound to domain name; while in Tor, it is bound to tab. How can I change tor to the ""firefox mode"" to remember zoom levels according to domain?</p>

<p>To set them for each time I start Tor (once a day) is acceptable, but I dont want to set the same zoom level for same domain for every tabs of that domain. That drives me crazy.</p>

<p>And will this weaken my anonymous level?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

"TOR Reset Proxy Settings Lost without lose other settings","<p>new to this forum.  i have some tech background but would need a stepped sequence-keystroke answer please, eg:  word, file, save as..
i made some summary notes on the problem below, but guessing the question would be:
is there a way to set / reset tor proxy settings, without affecting my other settings / addons?  -or-  can i do some limited re-install wo crushing the rest of it?  thanks</p>

<p>note:  i undid &amp; restored pc from a tor update.  something funny/ wrong happened:  my tor browser: when on web pages the vertical scroll bar was moved from right side, to about 1 inch in (i cannot accept that, maybe part of problems listed below).</p>

<p>tor, options (what says), nw proxy (connection settings), manual proxy configuration;  http proxy config: port 0,  ssl proxy: port 0
is there a step/ method to repair tor proxy settings?  i do not know the orig settings.</p>

<p>summary:  after a tor upd, viewing youtube, hit with a trojan/ rem'd with ms essentials, restore pc, i have a proxy setting prob for tor.    trojan:BAT/CoinMiner.A (ms essentials resident did not see trojan/ already had to have task manager open &amp; memory values speed cycling 0? to max megabytes; tm icon in tray was flashing hard)</p>

<p>prob:  firefox (tor) is configured to use a proxy svr that is refusing connections.
    check proxy settings to make sure they are correct.</p>

<p>i did about 3 searches, 15 sites to try to find answer, not checked everything yet.</p>

<p>i see a couple of tools, any recommendations to use?</p>

<p>1)  complete inet repair: rizonesoft.com/downloads/complete-internet-repair</p>

<p>2)  connectivity fixer:  badosoft.com/connectivity-fixer.php</p>

<p>i don't know what the proxy settings are supposed to be (unless other probs related to this?).  they seemed to have dropped from the restore process.
i would check to see if the 2 utilities above can include a note or button for tor &amp; sub: reset proxy.  thanks</p>

"Is my relay working?","<p>I am not sure whether or not my relay is working. I see messages in the log file saying something like ""Tor has successfully created a circuit. Looks like client is functioning."" (I'm not sure exactly what it said because it just made a new log file, but I know it said something very similar to that if not that). That message makes me think that the relay is working. But then I get another message: ""Your server has not managed to confirm that its ORPort is reachable."" This message leads me to believe that the relay isn't working. I checked the Atlas, but my relay does not show up there. I have forwarded the ORPort through VirtualBox (I am running the relay on a Ubuntu VM), I have opened the port in my firewall, and I have forwarded it in my router. Am I missing something? Do I have to trigger it instead of forwarding it? I currently have it set as TCP everywhere, it is TCP and not UDP, correct?</p>

<p>He is always complaining about how Tor gives him so many problems, I don't really dive too deep in just say ""Yeah that sucks"" and move on about my day.</p>

<p>I tired using Tor, going to Google was a pain, eBay didnt like me, a lot of sites gave me issues, so much so I didn't use it.</p>

<p>I don't do too much illegal, download some torrents, alone time activities, here and there surfing, not a gamer.</p>

"How to setup filezilla client to access TOR?","<p>So the question is obvious now here's what I did:

"Advertise obfs3 Tor bridge on port 80","<p>I'm currently running a Tor bridge on port 80 (for personal purposes, luckily no real needs). From what I can see in the obfs debug there's no connection other than mine, probably because the bridge is not (correctly) advertised on the Tor network (I guess).</p>

<p>I'm running it with a hack, because I couldn't find a better way to o so. Time ago I found <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/a/560/6573"">an answer on SO</a> which explained how to run a bridge on port 80 via iptables rules, and that's what I do and works fine. But since the Bridge is online it's a shame others cannot benefit from it.</p>

<p>This is my configuration:</p>

<pre><code>RelayBandwidthRate 900 KB
RelayBandwidthBurst 1 MB
ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed
DisableDebuggerAttachment 0
SocksPort 0
ORPort 2000
ExtORPort auto
BridgeRelay 1
ServerTransportListenAddr obfs3 0.0.0.0:9999
ServerTransportPlugin obfs3 proxy public_ip:80
</code></pre>

<p>When started Tor reports the ORPort as reachable, but that's not the obfuscated port. I guess many people can benefit from using a Bridge on port 80. </p>

<p>So two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>is there a non hack-ish way to run a bridge on port 80?
I did some tests in running Tor as <em>root</em> user, but other than being discouraged it was still not working because the control socket was still created as <em>debian-tor</em> user (on Ubuntu), and I stopped there.</li>

"Not forwarding to TOR","<p>I am using raspbian configured as an AP with a Wifi dongle and an ethernet out.</p>

<p>AP works fine, I can connect and get an IP on the WIFI part.</p>

<p>Forwarding seems to work as I can also get a website from a wireless device and a Traceroute also shows me routing from wifi to ethernet, but TOR doesn't seem to be operating.</p>

<p>Status is showing as working fine but if I go to ipchicken it shows my real IP address. </p>

<p>For configuration, I <a href=""https://learn.adafruit.com/onion-pi/install-tor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">followed these instructions</a> but changed the IP addresses for translisten and DNS listen to the ethernet address of the Pi. From a flow perspective, my device connects to the Pi AP, this then forwards to the Pi Ethernet port, which then uses my ADSL router gateway to enter the internet. That works fine but it shows my public IP address still. Am I missing a piece?</p>

"Fingerprint effect of changing TBB default font size","<p>I asked this on tor-talk (no answers) &amp; through Tor email support (also no answer).  Suggested trying here.</p>

<p>Does changing the default font names or sizes used by TBB (3.51 - 3.5.2) for Windows, affect fingerprinting of TBB?  If so, how much &amp; what all ways?
Problem - if one uses default settings for font styles / sizes, then text on some pages is UNcomfortably small for a fair number of users with any sight problems. </p>

<p>I understand the fingerprinting issue - that's why I'm asking.</p>

<p>In Options > Content > Advanced, the <strong>default</strong> TBB settings are used (for Windows, English):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For Proportional -  Serif:  Times New Roman - size16.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimum size font:  size ""None""  (meaning, some pages display tiny text.)</p></li>
<li><p>Checked:  ""Allow pages to use their own fonts...""  (if checked, some pages display tiny or less readable text, i.e., weird font.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What effect on TBB fingerprinting does changing any of these DEFAULT settings have:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-The proportional font NAME or SIZE?.
  -The minimum font size?
  -UNchecking the option:  ""Allow pages to use their own fonts...""?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note:  more recent checking of browser (TBB 3,5,x) characteristics, on <a href=""http://ip-check.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ip-check.info</a> (JonDoNYM), <a href=""http://browserspy.dk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browserspy.dk/</a> or Panopticlick don't show any difference in SCREEN size, whether using TBB default font &amp; size, or not.
AFAIK, No other (reported) characteristics are changed, either.  </p>

<p>That <strong>doesn't mean</strong> changing the font settings won't affect some other ""fingerprint"" characteristic (NOT shown by these sites).</p>

<p>Seems * if * changing font settings <strong>increases</strong> fingerprinting, TBB should spoof ? the values, for everyone (maybe it does?).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Hey I wanted to close that issue.

<blockquote>
  <p>I think for non-general-purpose circuits, we should call that third hop something else. I'm open to suggestions -- one option would be to just call the last hop on a non-exit circuit ""Middle"" also. Another option would be to call it ""Internal"".</p>

<p>There exist one more stackexchange <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/7376/tor-is-making-me-an-exit-node-despite-configuration"">question</a> too.</p>

<p>In conclusion, what I have seen is that TOR made internal circuits and called me the EXIT of them. That is not really a problem because I am not an EXIT of the Tor network itself.</p>

"Measuring current load on a Tor relay","<p>I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on the usefulness of measuring the current load on a router. I have read the bandwidth authority specification, and I have a rough idea on how bandwidth authorities send a file and measure the current bandwidth experienced from the router. I was wondering would it be reasonable to utilize some sort of a packet pair technique to measure the available bandwidth on a Tor relay (or the current CPU utilization) ?  Would it be less or more useful than what directory authorities already publish in the consensus? And if the relative usefulness is not known would this be an interesting thing to attempt? Does the way that current directory authorities measure has some limitations could be worked upon? </p>

<p>I have read some papers that do active probing or similar but those seem to be written before the bandwidth measurement by bwauths were introduced or else introduce a lot of traffic in the network. Are there any research papers anyone can point me towards that particularly talk about the limitations of the current measuring structure? Or give any opinions. Basically, my main question is whether it would be worth it to measure a router's load at any given point, and what sort of ways (if known) may be available. I do not intend to measure the entire set of Tor's router population but maybe just about a dozen (so that might not overwhelm the network). Any advice would be appreciated. </p>

"What is the most appropriate kind of hardware to run a Tor relay on?","<p>In the purpose of setting up a Tor relay that makes good use of a fast FTTH connection, what computer will do the job most efficiently at the time of writing, provided the <strong>following requirements</strong> are met?</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>best <strong>bandwidth usage / power consumption</strong> ratio</li>
<li><strong>must</strong> run Linux, any flavor of it but preferably GNU / free software (proprietary blobs <em>not</em> encouraged)</li>
<li><em>low</em> budget, let's say less than 250 US dollars?</li>
</ol>

<p>The real capacity of the Internet connection is not known, but possibly capped at more than 1 Gbit/s. Not all the bandwidth needs to be made use of, speed / power ratio takes precedence. </p>

<p>Single board computers (Odroid, Raspberry Pi...) seem to be the winners at first sight. However I would like to get answers based on the specifics of Tor reference implementation, which I have no clue about. Would it benefit more from higher CPU clock frequency? Multiple cores? Bigger RAM? <strong>What does Tor need the most?</strong></p>

<p>I tried to identify some of the basics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>cryptographic routines</strong> need:</p>

<ul>
<li>fast CPU</li>
<li>is Tor optimized for specific instruction set (NEON, SSE, AVX...)?</li>
<li>is Tor optimized for several cores?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>connection management</strong> need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gigabit link</li>
<li>lots of memory (2GiB as a bare minimum?)</li>
<li>big CPU cache</li>
</ul></li>

"A few questions about how bandwidth scanners work","<p>I have a few questions related to how bandwidth scanners work. I would appreciate it a lot if anyone could answer any one (or all) of them:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>From what I read in the bandwidth scanners <a href=""https://github.com/tomrittervg/torflow/blob/master/NetworkScanners/BwAuthority/README.spec.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">spec</a>, my understanding is that nodes are first divided into subsets of fastest, fast, slow and slowest. Then each of the bandwidth scanners probe these subsets individually by creating 50-node slices, and creating a circuit using two nodes from each slice. I am confused about how relays are divided into 50-relay subsets. Are they spread out in percentiles according to their bandwidth just as the categorization of fastest, fast, slow and slowest criteria. And are these 50 relays chosen from the subset already assigned to the particular bandwidth scanner or they move across bandwidth scanners. </p></li>
<li><p>Also, I was wondering how directory authorities isolate the bandwidth of a single node using a two-hop circuit. Shouldn't the bandwidth measured using the two-hop circuit give an approximation for the entire circuit rather than the node?</p></li>
<li><p>From the specs it seems that the bwauths have specific criteria for choosing nodes for these two-hop circuits (having Fast and Running flags, leaving out subsets with no exit nodes, /16 subnet different requirement). Is there ever a possibility that relays are left out? And some relays not measured at all. </p></li>

"How to best avoid having unencrypted information logged by an exit node, if encrypted connection is not an option?","<p>There is a role-playing game I would like to play, but I would like to remain anonymous (more like pseudonymous in this case). I want to keep my IP address hidden from the servers.</p>

<p>The main issue I have, if I do this over Tor, I risk having everything that I do in the game captured and logged by the exit node, since the game can't be played through an encrypted connection, as far as I know. That means every action I do in the game could be logged, I am not comfortable with this.</p>

<p>What is the best option I have here?</p>

<p>Edit: I'm looking for the best thing to do privacy-wise, if I'm going to play the game anyway. I considered some options:</p>

<p>Using Tor unmodified, I will get random exit nodes, at least some of them will log.</p>

<p>Using Tor and limiting my exit nodes to more ""trustworthy"" exit nodes that are less likely to log. But are there any such nodes, and how will I find them? Would it be a good idea to look for a specific country they're located in, or a specific organization that operates these nodes? And is this even a good idea at all? I thought it would not be that bad because I would be pseudonymous instead of anonymous in the game anyway (character).</p>

<p>The other options I thought of are not preferable.</p>

"How does the exit node recognize which response from a server is tied to which request?","<p>A Tor exit node communicating with a high volume web server may be sending streams from multiple Tor clients to that web server at the same time.  If the clients used the Tor browser there should be no identifying data sent to the web server. The exit node keeps state for each client and its Tor path.

"How does HTTP/1.1 compare with HTTP/2 when using Tor?","<p>How is are privacy/anonymity affected by the use of HTTP/2? Did anyone look into this yet?</p>

<p>I suppose that timing attacks might be simpler, because HTTP/2 has sever push and not-requested content might be sent, until the browser cancels them. On the other hand the use of a single (encrypted) stream might make that harder, when looked on from the outside.</p>

<p>Does the protocol introduce new possibilities for fingerprinting?</p>

<p>Is there any research on this yet? Does the TBB take HTTP/2 into consideration? If there was no research yet, would it make sense to disable HTTP/2 for now, until implications are better understood (and workarounds for any problems that might pop up are in place)?</p>

"Tor Circuit failed to be created: destroyed","<p>Okay, so I'm running a few experiments on Tor for a course project. I keep on changing different relays to see the effects on response time.</p>

<p>I was reading <a href=""https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/tags/tor-0_2_0_5_alpha/doc/spec/tor-spec.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">Tor's spec-file</a> and found out that it's when the circuit gets destroyed w/o any explicit <code>TRUNCATE</code> message sent by the client.</p>

<p>Do you have any ideas how do I minimize the connections being destroyed? I think there might be a relationship between geographical distance. But then again, if it took too long to establish the circuit the message should have been <code>TIMEOUT</code> and not <code>DESTROYED</code>. So, it's probably due because relays might have to free resources from time to time? Or could be a whole different reason. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Edit: Since one (or more) relays send <code>destroy(circId)</code> messages to destroy the circuit along the path I was wondering if there's any way to figure out which relay initiated the circuit destruction step.</p>

""Your server (3.11.33.113:9030) has not managed to confirm that its DirPort is reachable.""</p>

<p>I have ORPort advertised on 443 and binding to 9001.</p>

<p>If I check netstat:</p>

<pre><code>watch -d -n0 ""netstat -atnp | grep 9001""
</code></pre>

<p>I can see established connections to other Tor relays (I checked the IPs in Atlas).</p>

<p>I tested the port forwarding via YouGetSignal and it says the ports are open. I also tested the ports for outbound traffic via portquiz and they worked fine.
<strong>Is the not managed to confirm error something I need to actively try to fix? <em>If so, how?</em></strong></p>

<p>Router: Asus RT-N66U w/DD-WRT</p>

<p>Here is a copy of the Port Forwarding table on my router:</p>

<pre><code>Application | Protocol | Source Net | Port from | IP Address | Port to | Enable
Tor-Dir     | TCP      | [blank]    | 63118     | 3.11.33.113 | 63118  | Checked
Tor-OR      | TCP      | [blank]    | 443       | 3.11.33.113 | 9001   | Checked
</code></pre>

<p>Relay is being assigned the above IP via static lease tied to it's MAC Address. I have checked the IP address via ifconfig eth0 to confirm it has 3.11.33.113 as it's address.</p>

"How does tor know the return path?","<p>So lets say I connected to xyz.onion</p>

<p>I use this route</p>

<p>me > node 1 > node 2 > node 3 > rendezvous > node 4 > node 5 > node 6 > website</p>

<p>I understand that it uses layers to encrypt the path so each node only knows the next destination and not the full path.</p>

<p>But how does the website send it back? if it sends some random data to node 6, how does node 6 know where this goes? </p>

<p>I know that node 6 remembers the sender route so would know to send it to node 5 but how does it identify where the data the website is sending wants it to go. e.g. node 6 is used by this website for 3 different connections as the exit node. how does node 6 know where each bit of data is meant to be sent if there are 3 paths (because of 3 connections example) and the website only knows node 6's address and nothing else?</p>

<p>So essentially</p>

<p>website sends data saying ""example"" to node 6
website sends data saying ""example2"" to node 6
website sends data saying ""example3"" to node 6</p>

<p>how does node 6 know the path the website wants this data to be sent? does it use a secret code or something?</p>

"How to Detect Tor Usage From Old Network Traces?","<p>As part of some computer forensics work, I have been asked to look at network traces (showing IP addresses and port numbers) from several years ago, to see if someone was using Tor.</p>

<p>I have heard that I can use services like CollecTor and Onionoo to check if a certain IP address is currently an entry node and/or an exit node, but that does not help if those nodes are no longer in use.</p>

<p>From reading Tor documentation, it sounds like Tor nodes often use ports 80 and 443 in order to pass through firewalls, but seeing those as destination ports does not tell me if the user is trying to connect to Tor or just connecting to a Web server. </p>

<p>How about looking for ports 80 or 443 as source ports? The OS would never hand out a port number that low unless the program asked for it specifically, right? And ordinarily only the Web server program would ask for 80 or 443, and then only as a potential well-known destination port for someone else to use, not as a source port.</p>

"Private Tor network, socket explanation","<p>I recently made a private Tor network using virtual machines (with <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20180711234037/https://fengy.me/prog/2015/01/09/private-tor-network/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this tutorial</a>). The network is composed of three nodes: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>goupix</strong> with the ip address 172.26.145.<strong>31</strong></li>
<li><strong>grodoudou</strong> with the ip address 172.26.145.<strong>32</strong></li>
<li><strong>grolem</strong> with the ip address 172.26.145.<strong>33</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, <strong>grolem</strong> runs a directory server too.</p>

<p>The problem is, I have unexpected and yet unexplained opened socket on my VM's.</p>

<p>The nodes seem to communicate with each other, as shown by the following screenshot:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kd6R2.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kd6R2.png"" alt=""Opened sockets on my machines""></a></p>

<p>Why 172.26.145.31 communicate with 172.26.145.32 ? I don't have any client requesting the building of a circuit, and yet two nodes communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Here you can see another screenshot of a tcpdump on goupix ( 172.26.145.31 ) communicating with grodoudou ( 172.26.145.32 ) :</p>

"RSA keys explanations","<p>I am currently reading the Tor Spec (and other Tor-related technical documents) and have some questions about RSA keys. I can't understand why the ""connection key"" is used to establish the TLS connection. 
Which key is used to sign the certificate and which key is present inside the certificate? If the ""identity key"" is used to sign, what is the ""connection key"" for?
I've been looking for this information for weeks, but I can't find anything.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help! :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These are 1024-bit RSA keys:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A long-term signing-only ""Identity key"" used to sign documents and
   certificates, and used to establish relay identity.</li>
  <li>A medium-term TAP ""Onion key"" used to decrypt onion skins when accepting
   circuit extend attempts.  (See 5.1.)  Old keys MUST be accepted for a
   while after they are no longer advertised.  Because of this,
   relays MUST retain old keys for a while after they're rotated.  (See
   ""onion key lifetime parameters"" in dir-spec.txt.)</li>
  <li>A short-term ""Connection key"" used to negotiate TLS connections.
   Tor implementations MAY rotate this key as often as they like, and
   SHOULD rotate this key at least once a day.</li>
  </ul>

"Orbot ""Apps VPN Mode"" vs ""Tor Everything"" on rooted device - which is better?","<p>I know the android VPN settings are not reliable - the VPN connection can drop, and certain system processes will ignore the VPN.

<p>PS: Is there a situation in which if rooted Orbot can't connect to the internet but is trying, or the phone is sleeping, some other (system) app can end up making its own non-tor connection before Orbot has a chance to take over?

"Tor connection in guest OS is being blocked by unknown firewall At Host OS part 2","<p>a few days ago i have posted this:</p>

<p>I am having a problem setting up tor through virtual box and let me give you guys some details: I have installed tor bundle on win xp that is installed on virtual box but when i am trying to activate tor bundle it won't connect, it will get stuck in the ""loading network status"" level. I have malware anti bytes installed on the pc and norton anti virus. malware antybytes will show me message when i am trying to connect to tor like :""website blocked ip:61231 port"" i will get a few messages like this and it just won't connect to tor on guest os. i tried to deactivate norton and malware antybytes but it still won't connect to tor. What else shall i try?</p>

<p>and i have gotten this answer from Alexey Vesnin:
Malwarebytes is blocking Tor - it's a known issue. If I got you right - you have two antiviruses on one PC, it's a bad idea nowdays: I remember 1994 - yes, then it made some sense, but not now. Some network filtering is remaining when the AV is deactivated, and - if your host is also Windows - it can activate windows defender+firewall when disabling other antivirus... Use network bridge for your virtual machine - it should keep you out of trouble. And feel free to ask further if it will not work - together we will solve this, don't worry!</p>

<p>I didn't know if i should respond over there in the answer section or i should just open a new question tab, so that is what i am doing.</p>

<p>So, i have removed malware bytes from my pc and i have stayed just with norton, but still i am not able to connect to tor through the guest os.
n.b what exactly and how exactly do i do the network bridge that you told me?
because when i am trying to bridge the virtual box network adapter it tells me that i can bridge it just to another lan network and my main network is wireless.
please help me.</p>

<p>However, that doesn't work (maybe something has changed since that version?) If I delete the permissions.sqllite file, then Tor just writes it back. Editing the file just seems to show a table definition (I wanted to change the value). If I can change this value to false, and this succeeds in removing this popup, where can I change it?</p>

<p>How can I get rid of this message so that it never again shows up, especially after requesting a new identity?</p>

<p>Believe me, he will sue an email provider to get my location if he can. If he knows the city/state, it's over. I don't have the money to run again should he find me. I'm not a hacker type, but I can follow directions step-by-step if there is a good guide somewhere. I'm using a Mac. Thank you.</p>

<p>I saw that someone flagged my question as a duplicate and went to read what was posted under the other person's question. I appreciate the help, and please accept my apologies for saying so, but I'm not seeing a cohesive, easy-to-execute solution under the duplicate that fits what I'm looking for. It sounds like there's some disagreement on what really works, plus the most detailed answer went way over my head. </p>

<p>Someone suggested going to a local public wifi and using that, the library or a coffee shop, in addition to using TOR, squirrel mail, etc., but my stalker would still be able to figure out the city and state where I live from the public wifi's IP. If I had a car and the money to drive several hundred miles to use a public wifi that wasn't in my state, I would be on the road right now and none of this would be necessary. No need to hide the IP. If he believed I was in that other state, fantastic. Nor, do I need encryption. I couldn't care less who might see the email. My stalker doesn't need to verify the email was from me. He'll know. And the last thing I want to do is exchange correspondence with him. All I needed was a way to safely hide my location when sending him a single, one-way email. A method where him suing the email provider to get my IP would be difficult.</p>

<p>What I have learned from these extensive and thoughtful answers is that it's almost impossible to hide your location, and only someone with a specific skill set should attempt it. Which leaves me out. Thank you to whomever posted the link about TOR/Guerilla Mail. Whew, you saved me there. I was just about to go that route. Bottom line, decided it's better to take the consequences of not sending the email in the first place, than risk being found. </p>

In website log there would be ip which did this thing. If they try find the pc which has this ip they will found it and they will figure out that its exit node of tor. Then they will try to found the previous pc from where this request was sent and they will find it. They will have to do that thing several times and eventually they will find you. Can you please which part of this story is wrong? And one more question when exit nodes are found why police is not shutting it down or arresting the man who owns that pc? thank you. </p>

"URL returns 404 error","<p>I downloaded recently Tor and when trying to access a specific website I get the following:</p>

  <p>What can I do to prevent this in the future? If you are on a personal
  connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your

  a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected
  devices.</p>

"Gmail and Gtalk over Tor suggestions","<p>How should one best access Google communications and social services, like Gmail, Talk/Hangouts, and maybe G+ over Tor?</p>

<p>I'll propose the default threat model for interacting with Google as : We've only one non-temporary identity with Google.  Google should never connect web searches or maps queries with this identity.  Google should never learn our location either.</p>

<p>We could access Gmail and Gtalk by asking the Tor browser bundle for a new identity, but that's error prone and prompts CAPTCHAs. </p>

<p>Instead, we could make our exit node constant for Google by running a second Tor on port 9050 with the config lines : </p>

<pre><code>MapAddress *.google.com *.google.com.foo.exit
MapAddress *.gmail.com *.gmail.com.foo.exit 
</code></pre>

<p>And access Gmail via IMAP/SMTP and Gtalk via XMPP instead of the Tor browser bundle.  We cannot make our exit node constant for the Tor browser bundle in this way because we might wish to use Google search.</p>

<p>In this setup, there remains some risk of CAPTCHAs since foo.exit is a Tor exit node.  We must therefore point a browser at port 9050 at least occasionally.  And we might want G+, Google Groups, etc. too.  </p>

<p>A priori, I'd do this by creating a second profile in the Tor browser bundle that uses 9050 instead of 9150 and disables Tor button?  What else should we do?  What else have I missed?  </p>

<p>How should one select foo.exit?  Just pick an exit with solid bandwidth and uptime from <a href=""https://torstatus.blutmagie.de/"" rel=""nofollow"">the list of tor exit nodes</a>?  Attempt to pick an exit with several alternative exits in the same city? </p>

<p>Does <code>MapAddress</code> support <a href=""http://compnetworking.about.com/od/traceipaddresses/f/google-ip-address.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">IP address ranges</a>?  I could imagine it doing so with a syntax, like <code>MapAddress 64.233.160.0-64.233.191.255 *.foo.exit</code>, but afaik nothing like that works.</p>

<p>Also, I presume the same MapAddress trick cannot realistically be used for financial institutions, like PayPal, unless we've a private exit node that never appears in the consensus, right? </p>

"HTTPS, HTTP Headers, Privacy and Tor","<p>I have several doubts regarding the HTTPS protocol:</p>

<p><strong><em>- First:</em></strong> Are the HTTPS headers encrypted? I mean, HTTPS encrypts the content, but does it also encrypt the headers?</p>

<p><strong><em>-Second:</em></strong> Navigating with, for example, Chrome, through the HTTPS protocol, is it safe for privacy? I mean, imagine that the police are analyzing my network traffic through a sniffer. I am browsing with a normal browser but through an HTTPS page, can the police track me? And Can the police know the server to which I am sending data?</p>

<p><strong><em>Third:</em></strong> The main purpose of Tor is to hide the user through the three nodes. But my question is: If using HTTPS only the connection is encrypted, and the HTTP headers are encrypted, how can the user be tracked if everything is encrypted?</p>

<p><strong><em>Four:</em></strong> Does using HTTPS also encrypt IP?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Forget my English, English is not my mother tongue.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>I add more doubts...</strong>:</p>

<p>I have just opened this thread as a result of this animation (<a href=""https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https</a>). That animation is very explanatory, but it also gives me doubts.</p>

<p><strong><em>First:</em></strong> According to that image, if I only surf with HTTPS, people (Police, NSA ...) can track me. At first, I thought that maybe they could track me because of HTTP headers. But now I know that HTTP headers are encrypted in HTTPS. So I guess they can track me, for example, thanks to the IP, which is not encrypted (among other elements, like cookies or fingerprinting). Right?</p>

<p><strong><em>Second:</em></strong> According to that image, when I navigate through HTTPS, the Police or the NSA can know to which web page I am connecting. Our fellow canonizing ironize has said that ""they know who you are and what site you are using (because) the site you are connecting to is not encrypted. The resource you're fetching from the site is"". I do not quite understand this. I mean, if the HTTP headers are encrypted, the ""Host"" request header is also encrypted. So how do they know the site I'm connecting to?</p>

<p><strong><em>Third:</em></strong> Look at the animation (<a href=""https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https</a>), please. These next questions are very important.</p>

<p><strong><em>A)</em></strong> If I am using Tor and HTTPS simultaneously, according to the image, if there is a hacker monitoring my router he only receives one information: ""Location Tor"". What does this mean? He can not see my information (is encrypted because of HTTPS), but does he know my identity? (Imagine that the hacker is monitoring a router in a huge building with many routers. The hacker does not know exactly which router he is monitoring, he only knows that it is in that building. If I use Tor and HTTPS, the hacker can see my real public IP? I say it because the information has not gone through the three nodes  yet...).</p>

<p><strong><em>B)</em></strong> According to the image, if I use Tor and HTTPS simultaneously, my ISP and a possible NSA agent that monitors the Network BEFORE the first Tor node, can see the same thing as before: ""Location Tor "". Can anyone explain this to me? What does it mean? I think it means that he can know WHO the information comes from, but not WHERE TO GO. But this means that Tor is vulnerable ... In the same way, the first Tor node can see ""Location Tor"" ... What does this mean?</p>

<p><strong><em>C)</em></strong> According to the image, if I use Tor and HTTPS simultaneously, the third Tor node, as well as a possible NSA agent located AFTER the three nodes; the ISP of the site that I connect to and the website can see the site to which a Tor user connects (""Site.com"") and nothing else, right? That is, they can see the site to which a connection is connecting, but they can not know where the connection is coming from, right?</p>

<p><strong><em>D)</em></strong> Imagine this situation ... I am using Tor. The NSA is monitoring ALL submarine cables, as Snowden suggested ... Okay. Then, there is an NSA agent monitoring the Network BEFORE the first Tor node and another monitoring the Network AFTER the third node. They detect all my traffic. According to the image, the first agent receives ""Location Tor"", and the second agent receives ""Site.com"" (the website to which I connect). If they share the information, can they know my identity?</p>

<p><em>I know there are a lot of questions ... I'm sorry, but I think they're interesting. Thank you.</em></p>

"Tor Multiplexing","<p>I'm trying to understand how tor multiplexing work. I went through all their design documentation and original research paper, but there is very little mention of it. Examining Tor source code, didn't do much.</p>

<p> ORPort 443
    Exitpolicy reject *: *
    Nickname ididntedittheconfig
    ContactInfo human @ ...</p>

<p>Okay. <strong><em>First question:</em></strong> But can I configure the ""ORPort"" field with any other port? Port 443 is used for default HTTPS communications; So <strong><em>Second question</em></strong>: does that mean that a person who is browsing by Tor on an HTTP web page (port 80 or 8080) will not be able to navigate through my relay?</p>

<p><strong><em>Third question:</em></strong> Adding these parameters to the 'torrc' file, will I be an intermediate node only? Because I suppose to be an exit node the Exitpolicy field has to be configured with ports too, right? Example: ExitPolicy accept: *: 80, accept *: 110 Or has this changed?</p>

<p><strong><em>Fourth question:</em></strong> This question is <em>extremely</em> curious. In an old example of the 'torrc' file (<a href=""https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/tags/tor-0_0_9_5/src/config/torrc.sample.in"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/tor/tags/tor-0_0_9_5/src/config/torrc.sample.in</a>) this was said:</p>

key fingerprint to the tor-ops, so we can add you to the list of
servers that clients will trust. See the README for details.</strong></p>

<p>In the example of the current 'torrc' file (<a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/config/torrc.sample.in"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/config/torrc.sample.in</a>) this no longer appears. Why?</p>

<p>Also, in the Tor FAQ (<a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en</a>) there is a question that is NOT ACCESSIBLE. Specifically this question: ""So I can just set a nickname and ORPort and join the network?""</p>

<p>However, on a non-torproject web page (<a href=""https://archive.li/K3iJY#selection-1815.0-1815.203"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://archive.li/K3iJY#selection-1815.0-1815.203</a>) this question still appears. And the answer is:</p>

<p>""Yes. But by default users will only use you for the middle hop of their circuits. To become more useful to the network, please send mail to the ops with your key fingerprint and contact information"".</p>

<p><strong>So, the question:</strong> To be an exit node, is it necessary to send an email to The Tor Project? I'm very confused...</p>

<p><strong><em>Fifth question:</em></strong> I have read that once the file 'torrc' has been modified, the directory authorities must vote and approve the node. Is this still so? And in that case, who votes that a node is valid or not? A human administrator? Automatic software?</p>

<p>Next topic: I have read that to be an entry guard, I have to meet some requirements. Well, here are <strong><em>two questions</em></strong>:</p>

<p><strong><em>1.</em></strong> Does the first node (or entry guard) to the Tor network know the IP of the Tor client?
<strong><em>2.</em></strong> I have read that to be an entry guard node it is necessary to have a good bandwidth and be a stable node. Who decides that I am prepared to be an input node? A human administrator, or software?</p>

<p>That's all by now. Thank you Tor Stacks volunteers. I'm learning a lot with you. </p>

"How does the Tor Circuit Map works?","<p>I always wondered how Tor knows all the nodes in the connection path when the Tor Browser connects to a server. I though that the idea behind the onion routing was to hide nodes from each other, so that node A might know node B, but not node C? How does the Tor Browser than know all of the (three) nodes - from me to the exit node and the final server, like in the following screenshot?</p>

<li>Is this useful or stupid - install TOR on a system and connect to a VPN service provider and surf? (i'm pretty sure it's dumb since VPN service provider will keep a record of inbound connections and exit will show directly to wherever I've tried to surf too plus the part of paying the service provider leaves a trail). So secondly, can i use TOR to connect to a VPN service provider and use TOR on the system to surf further? If the server is fully rented to me?

I will remove the hard drive, then another one of the USB ports, and resolved it to the motherboard via a few inches of wire. I will then insert a 1 male to 2 female USB port splitter into the now extended USB port, and put a tails usb stick into one of the resulting female ports. I will keep the cables etc out of the way, with insulation tape in the void where the hard drive was. The remaining empty female USB port will then be used as the original motherboard USB port was (I will position it at the edge of the board, and secure it with tape) so that other usb devices can be connected as they were before.</p>

<p>Then, if I power on the computer, tails will be the only available OS, and it will boot. Right?</p>

<pre><code>ExitPolicy accept 127.0.0.1:80
ExitPolicy reject private:*

<p>There are no <code>ip</code> address limits specified in the consensus according to :  </p>

<pre><code>egrep ""^p6? "" /var/lib/tor/cached-microdescs | grep ':'

<p>I suppose this means ""Tor does not bother to list such exits"", or their operators somehow suppress inclusion, or nobody does this.  </p>

<p>If someone configures this, how does one use the access the local exit created?  Does the server need to set <code>Nickname foobar</code> or whatever.  And the client need to set <code>AllowDotExit 1</code> and then access <code>localhost.foobar.exit:80</code>?  Is there an easier way?</p>

"Do 'window.innerWidth' and 'window.innerHeight' in CSS pass back the values to the webserver?","<p>I have JavaScript turned off, and so no leakage of screen resolution to Panopticlick.eff.org fingerprint testing tool.</p>

<p>However, JonDonym's one - ip-check.info - has an alarming-looking vector down the bottom called 'Browser window'. Even with JS off, this value persists, and reveals even more uniqueness than the 'outer' screen resolution itself can - if you have Firefox's Menu Bar showing, the value changes - if you even zoom in (e.g. use NoSquint add-on on a larger screen), it changes, in fact it's in real-time as you change anything inside Firefox that affects the 'inner' window dimensions itself!</p>

<p>Without using JS, Flash or anything else aside from standard HTML and CSS - does this value get passed onto the webserver and thus can be used as a very serious de-anonymization vector?</p>

<p>The lack of a central authority in the Tor network is such that there is no practical means of removing these entities. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the user to put in place practices which will prevent visits to unintended destinations.</p>

I don't understand why this would change and considering previous postings saying this was due to a Tor version change were posted in Jun/Sep 2015 last year how come versions I have used since January 2016 did not always work this way? By the way this  has persisted despite me demanding around 50 new Tor circuits yesterday and also today (28/5/16) the same - always the same first IP address without fail and I have tested this for .com and .co.uk and .de websites, no change. </p>

"""Trustworthy"" exit nodes","<p>Unfortunately, a secure end-to-end encrypted connection is not always an option in every case. The user's ISP is, in many cases (depends much on the country), probably more trustworthy than a random Tor exit node, which anyone can run. Many exit nodes are potentially malicious, run by spying agencies such as the NSA, FBI, or other malicious organizations. Even if they don't attempt to harm the user directly (MITM), they may spy on the user and log content of the connection.</p>

<p>I have to use an unencrypted connection in this specific case.</p>

<p>I know I cannot get ideal security this way, but I am looking for some exit nodes that are at least as secure to use as a good, reputable ISP. Ideally these nodes should be hosted by a reputable organization committed to privacy and not keeping logs.

"Nature of HTML5 Canvas fingerprinting","<p>I am something of a layperson, and have two questions regarding HTML5 Canvas fingerprinting. </p>

<p>As I understand it, it allows the site to extract certain hardware and software information about the visiting computer, which can be used to uniquely identify that machine. So if I were to visit site A, get finger-printed, then visit site B, and get finger-printed, my activities on sites A and B could be associated. If some identifying information (i.e. IP address) leaked on site B, my activities on site A could also be associated with that information.
Or if I visited site A twice, it could tell that I was the same person. etc...</p>

"Why does Tor Browser sometimes choose one entry guard (most of the time), but sometimes it choose two or three entry guards?","<p>Some days ago <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/14269/currently-how-many-entry-guards-does-tor-choose-and-for-how-long-are-they-maint/14280?noredirect=1"">I opened a thread asking how many entry guards Tor Browser currently picks</a>. I found out, with help from forum volunteers, that the current source code of the stable version of Tor (0.2.9.10) stipulates that Tor has to choose, by default, 1 entry guard. For two reasons: firstly, because the entry guard is chosen by consensus, and <a href=""https://consensus-health.torproject.org/#consensusparams"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consensus parameter</a> <code>NumEntryGuards=1</code> currently stipulates an entry guard. But, in addition, if the consensus did not stipulate the entry guard, Tor by default has to choose one (this appears in lines <a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/or/entrynodes.c?h=release-0.2.9#n79"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">#79</a> to <a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/or/entrynodes.c?h=release-0.2.9#n85"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">#85</a> of the source code).</p>

<p>I saw that, although the source code says that, the <code>Tor directory protocol, version 3</code>, says that Tor has to choose 3 entry guards by default (this appears in the line <a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt#n1837"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">#1837</a> of the Tor directory protocol). The explanation is that, perhaps, the <code>Tor directory protocol, version 3</code>, is outdated. Or at least that line.</p>

<p>Here is the curious part: I have done several tests with my Tor Browser and I have discovered that normally the software chooses an entry guard (this is in line with the current consensus and with the source code), but sometimes in the <code>state</code> file I see that Tor Browser has chosen three or two entry guards, and I cannot find the reason. Why does Tor Browser choose three or two entry guards if the software is set to choose one?</p>

<p>To do the tests, I have reinstalled Tor Browser and I have not changed any settings. I performed the tests under Windows 10 Pro 64-bits and with version 6.5.1 of Tor Browser. I attached the <code>torrc</code> file <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/pduvS"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> so that you can see the configuration.</p>

<p>Next, I attach screenshots of the <code>state</code> file, so you can check how Tor Browser sometimes chooses one, two or three entry guards. To change entry guard, I have deleted the contents of the <code>state</code> file and started the Tor Browser again. The question I want to solve is: Why does Tor Browser sometimes choose one entry guard (most of the time), but sometimes it chooses two or three entry guards? It is very important for me because I'm doing an universitary reserach about Tor and I do not find the reason of this.</p>

"Technical differences between Tor webbrowser and Firefox","<p>I've started to use Tor as my main browser recently. </p>

"Most common TOR browser configuration - panopticlick","<p>Yesterday I put some effort into getting the best ""score"" I can on Panopticlick. The following is my result:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mxv9N.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mxv9N.png"" alt=""panopticlick result""></a></p>

<p>I did several things to get the lowest numbers for ""unique in x browsers"".</p>

<ul>
<li>I looked up what the most common screen resolution is and set my browser to it. It's not the default setting of the TOR browser though.</li>
<li>I've tried several user agent strings and it seems an empty string is way better than others.</li>
<li>I deactivated WebGL, so that the WebGL canvas thing cannot be used.</li>
<li>I got an addon to block HTML5 canvas and that asks me whenever someone tries to use HTML5 canvas on a site - shocking how often that is! But when I use it consequently on panopticlick, the test stops working at the last step, not letting me see the results, so that is not included in the screenshots. (Is there a better way to test my ""uniqueness"" somewhere?)</li>
<li>I can deactivate the JS, but then I'd not see the information about all the things, which can be exploited when I have JS on, so that's also not in the screenshot.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, despite all this effort, it seems I am still unique in 145k browsers. If I am still a unique profile, then all the confusion created by the TOR network is for naught, if someone really wanted to track me. If I multiply those ""unique in x browsers"" numbers together, I'd get the combined ""uniqueness"" when someone considers really all of the listed things there. The number is still sooooo high, I am still far from a not unique fingerprint. Now the question is:</p>

<p>Can I still improve this? If so, how?</p>

"Does Tor latency leak location information?","<p>This might be a general question about any anonymizing service, but I'm new here and curious about, but not super familiar with, Tor.</p>

<p>Suppose there's a service that engages in some handshake with clients that takes the form of a 'call-and-response'. (The client has to make some decision in response to content at an application level. )</p>

<p>It seems like the service should get a full round trip time for packets, all the way back to the source, along with a reasonable location for the exit node (they can traceroute to that point).</p>

<p>Latency can be impacted by so many other factors, (including tor routing) so it's definitely noisy data,

But hidden service traffic stays entirely inside the Tor network, where encryption can be used the whole way, presumably. But occasionally, you see a <code>.onion</code> using HTTPS.</p>

Implements an instruction set. See #microcode for a brief description. Here we mean microcode built in to the CPU. We are not talking about the updates supplied by the boot firmware (libreboot does not include microcode updates, and only supports systems that will work without it) Microcode can be very powerful. No proof that it's malicious, but it could theoretically 
There isn't really a way to solve this, unless you use a CPU which does not have microcode. (ARM CPUs don't, but most ARM systems require blobs for the graphics hardware at present, and typically have other things like soldered wifi which might require blobs)

At some stage Facebook kept blocking me from entry and then my use of core onion solved that. However the past 3 days I can log into fb BUT I can not post directly on my personal page OR any of the pages or groups I admin in. I can only share to them. I am unable to edit any of my shared posts to those pages once I have posted them either. Any attempt to do so immediately crashes TOR and it closes. However I can like, comment and edit on any and all other posts that are not under my admin control. I keep getting crashes and Tor Browser closing after I have moved through several pages on reloads.

"Is this a security flaw?","<p>Now, this seems almost too obvious, so I assume I <em>must</em> be missing something, but I figure I should run it by the experts first to see.</p>

<p>Hypothetical scenario:
At 5:18pm, a user using the Tor network logs on and posts something on WikiLeaks (or some other site wherein anonymity would best be maintained in the interest of self preservation).</p>

<p>Lets say the data leaves country x, bounces off county a to country b to country c, finally arriving at server y in country y.</p>

<p>If regime x really wanted to seek prosecution of whomever contacted server y, wouldn't be as simple as contacting country y and using diplomatic connections to find out the ip of the server in country c which contacted the server y at exactly 5:18pm, contact country c to find out who contacted server c in country b, contact country b and find out who contacted server b in country a, then finally contacting country a to find out who contacted server a in country x? This of course would give them little trouble hunting down server x (you).</p>

<p>x => a => b => c => y</p>

<ol>
<li>get ip of c by looking in y's logs at precisely 5:18 and some milliseconds</li>
<li>get ip of b by looking in c's logs  at precisely 5:18 and some milliseconds</li>
<li>get ip of a by looking in b's logs</li>
<li>kick in your door once they realized your ip contacted server a at exactly 5:18</li>
</ol>

<p>It should be mentioned, that county x would begin the investigation if the data sent to server y directly involved it. but if the data did hurt country x, then it's not a far cry to assume that they would begin an investigation</p>

<p>Of course this whole thought experiment relies on the idea that countries y,c,b, and a would all be diplomatically friendly with country x, but if its a life and death scenario should we really be relying on one countries inability to communicate with another??? </p>

"is the use of both introduction points and rendezvous points redundant?","<blockquote>
  <p>One of the reasons for not using the introduction circuit for actuall communication is that no single relay should apppear to be responsible for a given hidden service. This is why rendezvous points never learns about the hidden services identity.<br />
  <em>from <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me since the location of the different introductory points is published to distributed databases. So naturally, won't said introductory points become tied to the hidden service regardless? Furthermore, if this was such a great concern, couldn't the hidden service simply change its introduction points periodically? Lastly, presumably the circuits that lead from the hidden service to the introductory point must not be static, since there's only a finite amount of relays that can fit the bill to make this possible (stable/high uptime), so if the circuits leading to the introductory point are constantly changing, doesn't that itself hide the hidden service's identity as well as the use of rendezvous point does?</p>

I looked through the documentation for each and neither is very clear on this.  For two machines to communicate, you ultimately need the IP addresses at some level, right?</p>

<p>EDIT: Removing my second question as it is unrelated to my original.  What I'm getting at is: if these anonymous networks are overlays built on top of the existing internet infrastructure, then they must be using TCP/IP protocols for nodes to communicate, right?  So do these cryptographic addresses somehow translate to IP addresses?  I'm not really looking for a Tor-specific or I2P-specific answer, just a general answer on how this works in overlay networks.  I don't understand when the Tor/I2P documentation mentions that nodes communicate without knowledge of the others' IP addresses, only knowledge of their cryptographic address.</p>

"Why do relays not end idle TCP sessions?","<p>I'm running a relay on a 1Gbps connection. However, my relay averages around 3Mbps up/down each after several months. After substantial investigation, I found the cause: my relay sets up TCP sessions with clients and other relays, and NEVER closes them (it simply waits 24 hours for them to expire). I quickly hit my router's NAT session limit and can't build any more circuits. At any given time 99% of my connections are using zero bandwidth, and I can't build more connections because of my router's limitation.</p>

<p>Is this a design decision in tor that has some security properties? It just seems extremely inefficient, like mallocing all your memory and never freeing it, why not end sessions that have not been used in an operator configurable amount of time, e.g. 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The only downside I see is that clients who idle for a very long time (AFK? not recommended using tor!) may have an extra second of load time inbetween idle periods. But by definition, this wouldn't affect people who are actually using tor.</p>

<p>On the upside, it would allow some relay operators (like myself) to increase their bandwidth by factors of hundreds.</p>

"
"Hidden service private key chain","<p>Can a certificate chain be used for a hidden service's private key? It would be nice to be able to periodically re-sign a public key and upload it to the host. This would mean that in the case of the private key on the host being compromised, it is only valid for a short amount of time, due to the manual reauthorization process.</p>

<p>I'm not sure of the correct terminology to use, so I'll try to explain it with some examples and my reasoning behind wanting this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> I am <code>ONION_ADDRESS</code>, my public key is <code>HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code>.</li>
<li><strong>HSDir:</strong> I don't trust that public key.</li>
<li><strong>Host:</strong> Here is the signature from root key <code>ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY</code>: <code>SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on whether the signature has expired:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HSDir:</strong> <code>ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY</code> is valid, and that signature is valid. Go ahead.</li>
</ul>

<p>or</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>HSDir:</strong> <code>ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY</code> is valid, but that signature has expired. Goodbye.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>ROOT_PRIVATE_KEY</code> is stored on a machine under physical control of the hidden service operator. The remote host is considered the weakest point. Should the remote host be compromised, all that can be obtained is <code>HOST_PRIVATE_KEY</code> (and of course <code>HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code>), and the <code>SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code>. Due to the signature being created with an expiry date, the adversary can only masquerade as the hidden service for as long as <code>SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code> remains valid. Should the hidden service operator become aware of the host becoming compromised, he would not renew the signature. Once the <code>SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code> expires, due to the absence of a renewed signature, <code>HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code> will not be trusted, resulting in the adversary's loss of control of the hidden service.</p>

<p>The purpose of this is to limit the impact which a compromise would have. Further, once <code>SIGNED_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY</code> expires, the hidden service operator can regain exclusive control of the <code>.onion</code> address &ndash; it would not be necessary for a <strong>new</strong> <code>.onion</code> to be created.</p>

<p>Are there currently any methods (or any planned methods) which would allow for the host to be given partial/temporary authority to serve as the hidden service?</p>

Where I work there is a transparent proxy which restricts us to connect only to ftp, http and https websites.</p>

<p>I am using Tor and to connect to any other destination port I use proxychains on my Ubuntu machine, things work fine.</p>

<p>Problem:
Now I created a hotspot on my linux machine and want all incoming wifi traffic to be redirected through Tor. (Basically I have a ssh/telnet client on my Ipad which I want to use.)</p>

<p>How can I do this? Is it possible to setup some proxy server on my laptop so it redirects all(ALL TCP traffic) traffic through Tor?</p>

"Tor sometimes manages to connect, sometimes couldn't resolve host","<p>This is a followup of <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1601/521"">Can Tor be configured to run on all outgoing connections on a server?</a></p>

<p>I've successfully placed Tor as a transparent proxy over my VPS, however, I'm getting some trouble.</p>

<p>I am trying with</p>

<pre><code>curl http://icanhazip.com
</code></pre>

<p>Sometimes, it returns an IP which is different from the original one of the server. Sometimes however, it returns ""Couldn't resolve host"".</p>

<p>It seems as though every once in a while, if I wait, then curl, it would give the error, and subsequent calls would return an IP like intended.</p>

<p>What could be the cause? How can I further debug this?</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>curl -v icanhazip.com

"Connect to Tor-Firefox via Ruby/Watir","<p>I am having issues connecting to Tor via Ruby - Watir webdriver.</p>

<p>I use the Tor Browser Bundle. The problem is that when I try to connect via Watir (Selenium) I cannot seem to open Tor instead of regular Firefox. </p>

<p>Looking at similar issues I've tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>require 'watir-webdriver'

profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new

profile['network.proxy.socks'] = '127.0.0.1' #the proxy tor uses
profile['network.proxy.socks_port'] = 9150 #I cannot use 9050, 9150 works when I use Tor
profile['network.proxy.type'] = 1

browser = Watir::Browser.new :firefox, :profile =&gt; profile
browser.goto [an .onion website]
</code></pre>

<p>When I use the before-mentioned code I nonetheless still open the normal firefox browser, and cannot connect to onion sites.</p>

<p>Any thoughts? Is there another way in which I need to connect the Tor browser to my webdriver profile?</p>

"Running a Tor (non-exit) relay behind university firewall","<p>I have a personal laptop connected to a university connection, and reach the Internet through a proxy server. I have configured Tor to use only HTTP/HTTPS (since the firewall seems to reject all other connections as far as I'm aware). </p>

<p>Is it possible to run a non-exit relay under these circumstances? Is it possible for the network administrator to notice that I'm running a Tor relay? I understand that with deep packet inspection it's possible, but if they're just monitoring logs etc. can they figure it out? </p>

<p>I'm only asking because the admin has proven themselves to take very, very unkindly to any ""hacking"" that they see on the network, and using Tor is definitely in violation of the rules.</p>

"How can Facebook's Tor Onion be constantly accessible with the massive bandwidth demand?","<p><strong>Background</strong>: (you can skip if you already know the details of Facebook's Hidden Service)
In 2014, Facebook unveiled their Tor Hidden Service that let people from restricting governments access Facebook freely (because Facebook was being blocked in many key countries).</p>

<p>Tor is a networking protocol that routes any TCP traffic through 3 random servers (that are voluntarily run by any individual so that it remains decentralized) in layers of encryption, slowly stripped down until the exit node, where all Tor-based encryption is finally stripped by the node and sent on to it's destination, which sends data back through the circuit in reverse.
This is what most people use Tor for, however there is another (apparently not very well known) feature called Hidden Services.</p>

<p>A Tor Hidden Service (I call them Onion Services, Tor Onions, or just Onions) is, in a nutshell, a computer that is running the Tor software with certain configurations enabled that allow them to run a Hidden Service (which is as easy as un-commenting 2 lines in the centralized configuration file). This ""opens up"" virtual ports in a virtual firewall that allow anyone with a certain address (a 16-character string of random numbers and letters ending in .onion, calculated by the hash of the Onion Service's public RSA key) to connect to the service anonymously, being routed instead through 6 Tor nodes and meeting in the middle, called a rendezvous (where the connection never actually leaves the Tor network and is truly end-to-end encrypted). This makes it so that the Onion Service knows nothing of the user's location, and the user knows nothing of the Onion's location. For anybody in between, it's practically impossible to detect the location or even interaction of either the user or the Onion service.</p>

<p>The user is able to find the Hidden Service by using the address in the distributed hash table, hosted by Tor Nodes who elect to host them by enabling an ""HSDir"" flag, because the Hidden Service published a ""descriptor,"" a small file that includes very basic information (the Onion's public key, and a bit of signed data that includes very important information [what this question is really about]: <em>introductory nodes</em>).
The introductory node is a very important node (an Onion service chooses 3 of them) that is the only node that is in between all traffic that flows between Tor users and the Tor Hidden Service. It is the node that ""introduces"" the Hidden Service to the network.</p>

<p><strong>Okay now to the actual question</strong></p>

<p>There have been known attacks that can temporarily take down Hidden Services, namely one where any Tor node can set itself up to be a Hidden Service's introductory point at a given time. From there, they can deny all traffic that goes to the Hidden Service, effectively taking it offline.</p>

<p>Now the internet is filled with crappy people.
That being said, why don't people do this to big-name Onions constantly, like Facebook? Or even why don't the governments attempting to block Facebook in their country attempt to take down these measly 3 nodes that control the entire connection to Facebook through Tor?</p>

<p>Okay okay, assuming that this is just because people like facebook and don't want to disrupt it, why isn't this happening with other hidden services, like The Pirate Bay, or The Imperial Library of Trantor? Are there safeguards against this attack of which I'm unaware of?</p>

<p>Assuming that there are safeguards against it that popular Onion Services use, there are still only 3 nodes that control the entire connection to a service, and Tor is known for being extremely low-bandwidth. So how can only 3 (randomly selected) introductory nodes support the massive bandwidth going towards Facebook's Onion?</p>

<p>I mean, the only reason Facebook made this available was so that people from other countries could access Facebook, so there is an entire country-worth of people going through only 3 weakly-connected nodes. How can facebookcorewwwi.onion possibly be constantly available and fast?</p>

<p><strong>--EDIT--</strong>
Apparently I was mistaken; there is no attack that allows a Tor node to place itself in a position allowing itself to become the introductory node of a Hidden Service. I was thinking of a similar attack on Hidden Service Directories instead. This could still have an effect on the uptime of a Hidden Service, as the HSDir could refuse to serve the descriptor, but with the use of a program such as <a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/cooking-onions-finding-onionbalance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OnionBalancer</a>, this becomes increasingly difficult as more HSDir nodes hold the descriptor.

"Why would an .onion have different URLs for different users?","<p>I was recently invited to join a hidden bulletin board. In the note that was sent to me about it, the sender specified that the URL given to me was unique to me. A friend from Reddit was sent the same invitation bearing a different URL, unique to them, obviously.</p>

<p>Both URLs resolve to the same site, an innocuous phpBB install. I logged in and it seems to be a functioning phpBB site with different levels of access and nearly all posts blocked from new registrations but there's a few things I've noticed that send up red flags. It leads me to believe that this is some kind of elaborate phishing scam or some byzantine means of installing malware.</p>

<p>The thing is, registration only ever asked for a username and password that I don't use anywhere else on the internet. They were specific about this. I was never prompted for any further info that might identify me or be used in a way that could access other accounts linked to me. I've looked over the client-side source code and there's nothing obvious in there nor do I know of any malicious PHP.</p>

<p>But no one ever seems to be logged into the site. Post view counts never seem to increase. It's like I'm alone on this board and I'm trying to figure out its angle, if it even has one. Why would the URL be unique to me? Is this a common thing among .onion sites?</p>

"Not able to access .onoin sites - because I left tbb open for a while?","<p>I've seen a few questions asking/commenting about the availability of .onion sites.  I've never tried to use them before today adn I was surprised to see that the first 4 or 5 I couldn't access.  All but the first were links from a wikipedia article about .onion sites, so I expected them to be available.</p>

<p>The few questions here seem to have people saying not to worry about it, and one had a technical problem of their time being off.</p>

<p>I normally keep my browsers open for lengthy periods of time with many tabs and only close/restart them when I run into problems.  Is that bad practice for tbb?  Will that cause problems?  Are there security, anonymity, or privacy concerns that I should be aware of?  I didn't think there were, but if leaving a browser open for lengthy periods of time could cause .onion routing to have problems, who knows what else it might do.  Browsers are like mini-OSs nowadays...</p>

<p>I've noticed that NoScript's behavior in tbb is different than Firefox proper, does that have something to d with this behavior?  Or is this a setting of the DuckDuckGo search provider?  Is there a way to force the regular/javascript-enabled version of the site to be used?</p>

"Why is the NoScript in TBB different than Firefox?","<p>I was excited that The Tor Browser Bundle was essentially Firefox and that it already cam with several useful extensions.  I had put off using it because I didn't want to sacrifice things like NoScript, HTTPS Everywhere, Privacy Badger, Ad Block Plus, and a few other extensions.</p>

<p>However, much to my horror, the NoScript extension included with tbb was essentially turned off.  I had to compare this to my default Firefox install and reset NoScript to actually be useful and actually block scripts by default.</p>

<p>Is there a reason(s) for NoScript being configured the way it is for tbb?  I did a quick search but didn't find explanation(s), though I do find plenty of instructions on how to make NoScript ""more secure"" by essentially turning it on.  I first started with a version 4.x of tbb, though I don't recall the version.  I think I've been using tbb for 3 or 4 versions now.</p>

<p>Edit:  I found this question: <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/4006/noscript-and-latest-tbb-v3-6-4-recommended-modifications-to-default-setting"">Noscript and latest TBB (v3.6.4) — recommended modifications to default settings?</a>, but there's not much in the way of technical data.</p>

<p>At least part of the reason NoScript acts different is that tbb runs in FIrefox's private mode, so you have to go into NoScript and enable the permanent allow option if you want to permanently allow scripts on certain sites.  Those few settings make it harder to use tbb as your daily driver browser IMO.</p>

"Can tor nodes (entry, exit, others) store IPs?","<p>I'm a new Tor user. And I want to ensure several questions. </p>

<p>I think yes. And the tor routers can be configured (hacked) to store IP and target server information. So when all points belongs to one owner (eg. network provider, NSA, etd.) then he can know what page I want to see and from which IP. Correct?</p>

<p>I understand, that they cannot see the content due to HTTPS.</p>

"Multi-VPN hopping Advantages/Disadvantages over Tor","<p>I was told that using Tor and/or a VPN is always a tradeoff of privacy and anonymity. I'm wonder what combination of Tor, VPNs (paid or free), and proxies can help minimize this risk.</p>

<p>For example, if you use <strong>ISP -> VPN -> Tor</strong>, your ISP won't know you're using Tor, and your VPN provider won't know what your traffic is (encrypted), only that it's going into Tor network. However, the <strong>Tor exit node</strong> will see all your traffic in plain-text, depending on HTTPS use, and if that's really a secure option you should trust.</p>

<p>So, I'm wondering, would it be better to do <strong>ISP -> VPN -> Tor -> VPN</strong> to hide traffic from the <strong>Tor exit node</strong>? Does that gain you anything, or expose you in anyway? Basically with the first VPN you can hide your Tor usage from your ISP, with Tor you gain anonymity, and with the second VPN you hide your data from the Tor exit node.</p>

<p>But does this have any advantage over just using a second VPN? For example: <strong>ISP -> VPN -> VPN</strong>. It seems like your first VPN would hide your origin from the second, and the second would hide your data from the first.</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I hide my plain-text data from a <strong>Tor exit node</strong>?
<ul>
<li>(Is HTTPS alone an acceptable solution?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is using another VPN an acceptable solution?</li>
<li>Does this have any advantage over just chain-linking multiple VPNs together?</li>
</ul>

"HSDir selection","<p>I'm writing some code to play around with and test some hidden service things.
I need to be able to emulate hidden service directory selection.<br/>
HSDirs are calculated by selecting the three closest onion-routers whose identity hash is larger than the hidden service descriptor's descriptor-id, and who also have the HSDir flag.</p>

<p>Which network status document is used to find the HSDirs of a hidden service?
Is it correct to use the ""cached-microdesc-consensus""?</p>

<p>Additionally how could you get such a document if it wasn't already cached on your computer from Tor?
I found <a href=""https://github.com/DonnchaC/tor/blob/master/scripts/retrieve_hs_descriptor.py"" rel=""nofollow"">this script</a>, however it requires a file, ``cached-consensus'', that I don't have.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong><br/>
<a href=""https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/down_the_rabbit_hole.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The Stem interpreter</a> (which can be accessed using the command tor-prompt) can be used to download consensus documents.
For instance with the command: GETINFO ns/all.<br/>
Additionally, if HSDirs are selected correctly you should be able to check by making the following HTTP GET request:</p>

<pre><code>http://&lt;HSDir_IP&gt;:&lt;HSDir_DirPort&gt;/&lt;DescriptorID&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have not yet been able to replicate HSDir selection using this data, however.
Either the documents aren't the correct ones or there's some nuance to HSDir selection that isn't obvious.</p>

"Why some companies are connected with Tor hidden service and they use the same process ID like Tor?","<p>I installed Tor hidden service, when I use terminal and type <strong>netstat -tapln</strong> (to see all opened ports) I can see foreign established connection and it is not clear to me is it dangerous or not? 
Of course, I can see that mysql port is opened and sshd and so on, it is not problem. 
It is strange for me, I see foreign address (to which server is connected) of companies that have nothing to do with server located in Asia. But all of them use the same process ID (PID) 12973.</p>

<p>One established connection is of course my IP because I use terminal to access server.</p>

<p>Second established connection is french IP.</p>

<p>Third established connection is one web hosting company in Germany.</p>

<p>Forth established connection is one company from the US. Their Global Internet Backbone provides IP Transit. </p>

<p>It is strange that 127.0.0.1:9050 is used by Tor and its PID is <strong>12973/tor</strong>, all this companies have the same PID, for example like this: 
<strong>IPAddress:9001 ESTABLISHED 12973/Tor</strong></p>

<p>It means if I kill PID 12973 I will kill Tor, not only these companies. So, why Tor has the same PID like companies from Europe and USA that are connected with server?
Server is located in Asia.</p>

<p>Is it some Tor directory authority or descriptor or anything similar? 
If it is so, can I choose to which Tor descriptor/authority server will connect? Where to find list of them, to choose whom I want?</p>

When parsing and plotting the results, I only managed to retrieve the 'results-timing' graph. How do I parse and retrieve results to measure more performance characteristics, such as network throughput? Below are the steps I've taken to get the 'results-timing' graph:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd shadow-git-clone/resource/scallion-hosts/
$ tar xaf tiny-m1.large.tar.xz
$ mv tiny-m1.large tor_test
$ cd tor_test
$ scallion
$ python /home/ubuntu/shadow-git-clone/contrib/analyze.py parse --output testing scallion.log
$ python contrib/analyze.py plot --title ""Test 1 Tor"" --data testing/ ""testing"" 
</code></pre>

<p>Can I use the file-transfer plug-in alongside scallion? The <code>scallion --help</code> input does not show how to switch between measuring different types of performance characteristics.</p>

"Voted and applied relay flags","<p>I've set up a exit, according to consensus-health.torproject.org it got voted Fast and Exit (I guess Flags shown as RED means that they were voted?).</p>

<p>I was monitoring the relay with arm and realized that my Connections tab was only showing Inbound/Outbound connections and no Exit. So, I checked consensus-health again and the flags were not applied yet (voted 24hrs ago).</p>

<p>Is it normal that it takes that long for flags to be applied? I've read 'lifecycle of a new relay' and according to it, it's also normal that your relay gets roughly no use in the first 3 days. I was concerned at first because my Advertised Bandwidth was only around 140kb/s -- but I've set no limits and according to the ISP it's 100mbit/s unmetered. I dont think they are throttling, but I will keep an eye on that after the 0-3 day timeframe anyways.</p>

"Is it possible to have more than one server hosting the same Tor Hidden Service?","<p>If I ran a Tor Hidden Service on a server, would it be possible to mirror it on one or more other servers, and use the same onion-address for all?  I was thinking having the mirror(s) periodically checking the main server, and then start-up it's own Tor-service and http-daemon if it couldn't connect to the main-server for several tries.</p>

<p>What I'm really asking, is if it's possible to have several servers reveiling hidden services with <em>exactly</em> the same onion-address?  </p>

<p>If it's possible, what would I have to copy from the main-server to the mirrors?  Some config-file for Tor?  The main-servers host-keys?</p>

"So once I download Tor, do I get rid of other browsers?","<p>I guess I have a lot of reading to do, but as someone who is not a computer specialist, I often don't understand the instructions.  My main issue is how to use Tor if you have another browser installed on your computer.  </p>

<p>How do I get my email to open its links in Tor and not safari?  </p>

<p>Am I supposed to uninstall other browsers once I downloaded Tor?</p>

<p>Is there a ""what should I do now"" page for ordinary people using Tor for the first time?</p>

<p>Now there is more circuits. Why? Then I go to TorStatus site and search for fingerprint of <code>31.172.30.1</code> node. Now I know that it is a latest node at circuit number <code>16</code> with fingerprint <code>48B1B47BD189B86EFD67D93AB6904DAEFFE81B82</code> and <code>chaoscomputerclub18</code> router name. It is a final conclusion. So, the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it right conclusion?</li>
<li>Why Tor created a more circuits and not uses circuit at number <code>14</code>?</li>
<li>How I can get Tor bootstrap status via telnet, without a reading notice log file?</li>

"How to block local ports and get a working Tor version","<p>I've been trying to block torrent downloading on a mac computer using WaterRoof. I create rules that block ports 1025-65535 except 9150 which is the Tor control port, If I'm correct, but Tor Browser opens say either that Tor unexpectedly crashes or that it could not connect to Tor control port. I used the activity monitor to see which port it's trying to use and most of the times it says something like this localhost:50172 localhost:9150. Why is Tor reaching to other ports first and then 9150? I even selected ports 80,440 as the only ports that my firewall allows but nothing. Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>Update: I fixed the issue. It turns out that I selected IP as protocol when I was making the rule in WaterRoof. I chose UDP and now Tor is working fine. Weird thing though is that I cannot connect to the Internet from normal web browsers. I tested the rule on my Macbook but no problems there. Any thoughts on this?</p>

"Can technicians track my computer which has an image on it if I use Tor?","<p>My laptop is imaged on a school network, which allows the technicians to remotely connect to it, locate it and track what I'm doing if I'm connected to their network, if I use Tor at home (or any different network), can they track what I've been doing on my computer if I later connect to their network when I use it at school?
They can locate my computer even if I'm not on their network because they have data of my computer (such as serial no.) so they can ping it (idk exactly) even if I'm not connected but can they track my activities if I'm not on their network and if I'm using Tor?</p>

<p>Thanks for the answers, however as far as your answers are concerned, you're under the assumption that ""malware"" is installed on my computer to track my activities, I have sent private emails and had private conversations with my friends and these conversations involve trouble that we've been in with the tecnicians themselves, I doubt that there is programs on my computer to track my activites because then they would be able to uncover the real culprit in those situations but they mentioned nothing about it. I know that if they look at my private emails/conversation, it is illegal because they are breaching my privacy so that could've been the reason they did not mention it however the real question is that if I access a site using tor, will there be traces on my computer that I've been on that site?</p>

<p>There must also be a limit in terms of what programs they can install on my computer, as one of you have said, they can see and track every single one of my actions, that would be an invasion of my privacy which would be illegal because they don't have legal rights to see emails I've been sending because they're confidental or when I use IM</p>

<li><p>VirtualBox</p></li>
<li><p>Whonix (both VMs in VirtualBox)</p></li>

<p>There has been alot of talk about Intel hardware having a backdoor in it. Obviously we can neither confirm/deny this information as we don't have access to it, we only have speculation but logically newer hardware would more likely have it since, unfortunately, we are going downhill when it comes to freedom and privacy.</p>

<p>So what would be an ideal notebook that is cheap and can run Whonix and everything on the notebook smoothly without lagging and glitches. We don't need to get specific about models, just specs and most importantly CPU models. RAM is cheap and upgradable so it is irrelevant as it would be 8GB. Would the CPU at least have to be an i3/i5/i7 model or can it be a late model Core 2 Duo? Again this is not a question of what can run this setup, it is what can run this setup very smoothly and without lagging. </p>

"I'm running a Tor Relay on my Raspberry Pi, is it safe to use the Raspberry Pi as a proxy for all the machines on the LAN?","<p>Recently I've been reading lots of comments stating it's not safe to use your own Tor Relay as a proxy into the Tor Network, but typically none of these conversations have any evidence to substantiate their claims.  I'd be willing to write it off as FUD, but for something as important as Tor I wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something unnecessarily stupid!</p>

<p>So, my setup is really simple;  I have a <a href=""http://www.raspberrypi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Raspberry Pi</a> which is running the Tor Relay and has been doing for the past three or four months without any significant problems.</p>

<p>After some reading, I set the following options in my <code>torrc</code> file which I believe restrict access to the proxy only machines on my local network.  Is that right?</p>

<pre><code>## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests that reach a SocksPort. Untrusted users who
## can access your SocksPort may be able to learn about the connections
## you make.
SocksListenAddress 192.168.0.34
SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
SocksPolicy reject *

<p>So for every device or application on my LAN that needs access to the Tor Network, I just point them all to the SOCKS5 Proxy running on the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi's IP address is 192.168.0.34, so I point every device to: 192.168.0.34:9050.</p>

"Which one of the relay nodes need to get compromised for client de-anonymization?","<p>Tor can't protect against traffic confirmation (also known as end-to-end correlation), where an attacker tries to confirm an hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math. The question is: Is it enough for the adversary to compromise any two of the three nodes to be able to de-anonymize the client? Specifically consider the following:</p>

<p>Guard (compromised) + Middle node (compromised) + Exit node (not compromised) = Result in Client de-anonymized</p>

<p>Guard (compromised) + Middle node (not compromised) + Exit node (compromised) = Result in Client de-anonymized</p>

"Problem getting Tor exit node from a bash script","<p>I have been trying to get the IP address of the <code>tor</code> exit node from a <code>bash</code> script. I have tried <code>torify</code>ing the usual methods found in various posts in forums for getting one's local IP address. For example:</p>

<pre><code>torify wget -qO- http://ipecho.net/plain ; echo
torify curl -s https://check.torproject.org/ | grep ""Your IP address appears to be:"" | grep -o '\(\d\{1,3\}\.\)\{3\}\d\{1,3\}'
</code></pre>

<p>All these methods return a different IP address than that given by <code>check.torproject.org</code> or any IP identifying site from the browser configured to use <code>tor</code> as a proxy.</p>

<p>I modified the <code>stem</code> script from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/17130011"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/17130011</a> to get the exit relays and compare the results with that given by the <code>bash</code> shell command:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

from stem import Signal
import os
import time

from stem import CircStatus
from stem.control import Controller

with Controller.from_port(port = 9051) as controller:
  controller.authenticate()
  controller.signal(Signal.NEWNYM) # get new tor identity

time.sleep(5)

print
print ""Exit relays:""

with Controller.from_port(port = 9051) as controller:
  controller.authenticate()

  for circ in controller.get_circuits():
    if circ.status != CircStatus.BUILT:
      continue

    exit_fp, exit_nickname = circ.path[-1]
    exit_desc = controller.get_network_status(exit_fp, None)
    exit_address = exit_desc.address if exit_desc else 'unknown' # get relay IP

    print exit_address

print
print ""wget:""

os.system(""torify wget -qO- http://ipecho.net/plain ; echo"")
os.system(""open 'https://check.torproject.org/'"")
print
</code></pre>

<p>and I find that the first address is usually the correct address of the exit node and the second address is usually that given by the <code>bash</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>Exit relays:
178.63.97.34
5.104.224.5
188.138.1.229
128.204.203.103

"In what ways can private relays be used?","<p>There are applications where private relays, not listed in public consensus directories, would perhaps be useful. For example, one might use four-relay circuits with private entry guards and exit relays.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/1376/how-to-create-a-private-exit-node"">How to create a private exit node?</a>, <code>weasel - Peter Palfrader</code> notes: ""The routing protocol allows for [private exit nodes], but there is no support in Tor or its directory layer for what you ask."" However, I see in the manpage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PublishServerDescriptor 0|1|v1|v2|v3|bridge,…  </p>
  
  <p>This option specifies which descriptors Tor will publish when acting as a relay. You can choose multiple arguments, separated by commas.  </p>
  
  <p>If this option is set to 0, Tor will not publish its descriptors to any directories. (This is useful if you’re testing out your server, or if you’re using a Tor controller that handles directory publishing for you.) Otherwise, Tor will publish its descriptors of all type(s) specified. The default is ""1"", which means ""if running as a server, publish the appropriate descriptors to the authorities"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I set <code>PublishServerDescriptor 0</code> in a relay, it won't appear in any directories, right? But a client can still specify it as an exit, right?</p>

<p>Also, in that case, will information about my relay be forwarded beyond any adjacent relays in circuits specified by clients?</p>

<p>And just to be clear, is it true that none of the considerations discussed in <a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The lifecycle of a new relay</a> apply to unlisted relays?</p>

<p>The entry-guard piece seems trivial: bridges, perhaps obfuscated. But there is some ambiguity. I see in the manpage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BridgeRelay 0|1  </p>
  
  <p>Sets the relay to act as a ""bridge"" with respect to relaying connections from bridge users to the Tor network. It mainly causes Tor to publish a server descriptor to the bridge database, rather than publishing a relay descriptor to the public directory authorities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I set <code>PublishServerDescriptor 0</code> and <code>BridgeRelay 1</code> in a relay, will it be usable as a bridge, and yet not appear in any public directory? </p>

<p>For using it as a bridge, I see in the manpage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bridge [transport] IP:ORPort [fingerprint]  </p>
  
  <p>When set along with UseBridges, instructs Tor to use the relay at ""IP:ORPort"" as a ""bridge"" relaying into the Tor network. If ""fingerprint"" is provided (using the same format as for DirAuthority), we will verify that the relay running at that location has the right fingerprint. We also use fingerprint to look up the bridge descriptor at the bridge authority, if it’s provided and if UpdateBridgesFromAuthority is set too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If <code>UpdateBridgesFromAuthority</code> is not set, will the Tor client check the fingerprint by directly accessing the bridge, without ""look[ing] up the bridge descriptor at the bridge authority""? In other words, will the client use bridges that aren't in the bridge authority?</p>

<p>From the arm tool, however, this is what I see:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wxvN9.png"" alt=""Tor Relay Arm Snapshot""></p>

<p>Notice the measured speeds. The average speeds are way above the speeds I set in the torrc-file, and sometimes I've seen the burst rate exceed 3 mb/s. It is a requirement that the maximum average speed in kb/s is fixed at 500, and that it's working, else I will eventually run dry of bandwidth from my ISP.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea of what went wrong and how to fix it?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Another fun observation is the highlighted (grey) text in the screenshot: </p>

<p>Where does this information come from? I'm not even able to neither download nor upload with 16 Mb/s. I have a measured speed of 111.6/22.5 kbit/s.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update...</strong></p>

<p>According to the logs in the following screenshot, tor only uses a few hundre kb/s of bandwidth, yet the arm tool reports an average bandwidth of 1 mb/s. This 1 mb/s doesn't add up to the total amount of data send/recieved, though!</p>

"Why can't I connect using an older version of Tor?","<p>My college has one or two facilities enabled with WiFi. I've been provided with complete access to the Internet. A few websites were blocked by the router (say Twitter, YouTube, probably any site that's fun!). I was using Tor (v2.3) to access those sites. I used v2.3 because I like the Vidalia Panel, the details, logs, customization etc. are quite charming, until...</p>

<p>Last week, something terrible happened. Whenever I try to connect to the network, it's stuck here, at <em>""Establishing an encrypted directory connection""</em>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vzPBo.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>Then, I tried using v3.6.3. It connects (within a few seconds) as usual. I'm able to browse those sites. So, what's the big deal? Why's there a conflict between both of these versions? I'm curious why this happened all of a sudden.</p>

"Use of Orbot on Mobile","<p>I read that using Personal Accounts like Gmail, Facebook etc (with real Personal Information) on Tor is not anonymous or safe.
So if I installed Orbot on un-rooted android mobile then even I browse anonymously using Orweb, but the other apps like my Email Client, Stackexchange app or even Play Store itself on my phone does/can connect to internet using my external IP (the real one). Doesn't it reveal my identity??
I am using ""NoRoot Firewall"" (noroot firewall is an app for un-rooted android devices which block or allow internet access to certain devices by creating a virtual VPN) for blocking internet access of some apps but running Torand Noroot Firewall simultanously makes a bigger mess (running simultanously Orweb shows You are not connected to Tor even when Orbot saying you are connected to Tor i.e. may be orweb connects directly to internet with my real IP address).
I also tried edit my mobile APN setting to local host and 8118, but may be that allowing all apps to connect through Tor including Gmail account via Email Client.</p>

<p>So how can I use Tor on android while blocking internet access to other apps like email client and other apps which use my real identity?
Is there any other option other than rooting my phone?</p>

"Avoiding exit-nodes with ISP-/country-based blocks of a site?","<p>Is it possible to avoid exit-nodes where a site is blocked by the exit-node's ISP (or - I guess - government)?</p>

<p>So my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can specific exit-nodes be ""turned off""?</li>
<li>Can groups of exit nodes be ""turned off"" based on top-domain and/or on location (ie. country)?</li>
<li>Is it possible to do the above <em>only</em> for specific sites (maybe specified by using regular expressions); Ie. ""turn it off"" only when visiting sites known to be blocked, but leave them ""on"" for other (not blocked) sites?</li>
</ul>

<p>If it's possible, how would I proceed to do it?</p>

"Mac: how to run multiple instances of Tor browser at the same time with different exit nodes?","<p>I made two profiles of Tor Browser from the command line and I followed <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/6235/how-to-run-multiple-tor-browsers-simultaneously-and-independently-with-different"">this</a> but it didn't work for Mac. I can run both Tor Browser.app and Tor Browser2.app from different ports now, but somehow I can't run them at the same time.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is to run one instance of Tor Browser with the default settings, while running another with an exit node of a designated IP address. Is this possible on a Mac? If so, how? I looked into ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data but there was no separate torrc file for each of the profiles I have: there was only one that seemed to be shared across all the profiles. </p>

<p>Edit: although I said I followed the post I linked, there were some steps that can't be followed in my environment. These options didn't exist in my Tor browser's about:config settings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Modify extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_port to a new port (eg. 9152
  for Tor Browser 2) Modify extensions.torbutton.custom.socks_host to
  127.0.0.1 Modify extensions.torbutton.proxies_applied to false</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as for this step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edit torrc-defaults in \TorBrowser\Data\Tor </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I edited that torrc-defaults in /Applications/TorBrowser2.app/Contents/Resources/TorBrowser/Tor/torrc-defaults</p>

<p>And my torrc file is in ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Tor/torrc</p>

<p>My profile data is in ~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/[myProfileID].[myProfileName]</p>

<p>And there are folders like bookmarkbackups, extensions, gmp, HTTPSEverywhereUserRules, preferences and bunch of files but not torrc here. (i.e. there are no separate torrc files for each profile, just one shared across all profiles.)</p>

<p>Also, in <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/2006/how-to-run-multiple-tor-browsers-with-different-ips"">this post</a>, there's another Answer by mirmir, but a step in it can't be followed on Mac too. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now open the second Tor browser then TorButton Preferences. Select ""Use custom settings"" then change the SOCKS Port to 9152 and click OK. Browse <a href=""https://check.torproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://check.torproject.org/</a> and verify that you're using Tor.</p>

<p>There's no TorButton Preferences in my TorBrowser.app!</p>

"Howto to install a Tor middle relay on a working Windows VPN Proxy?","<p>I've looked through the existing descriptions and tried many ways to do this - but don't believe it's ever worked for me.</p>

<p>I have a Windows 7 pro machine which has been running for years with only two applications - Open VPN and Privoxy. Both run from a guest account and supply web access &amp; DNS to all other PCs here. This machine runs 24/7.</p>

<p>Would like to install a manually started tor middle relay, but it sems everything I try fails to get the torrc recognized by the tor.exe file. But when I manually start tor.exe with admin priviledges from that same guest account - it indicates it can build working circuits from it's default.</p>

<p>I don't need tor access (have other ways for that) - just wish to provide relay capacity while keeping these activities hidden from our ISP (who I detest). Have a second identical gateway going to a different VPN which I might be willing to convert also - if I could just get the first to work.</p>

<p>Believe I found the main problem....torrc had a hidden .txt suffix (rolling eyes). Now it shows to be reading the configuration. </p>

<p>New problem? It claims I haven't inserted contact information - but I believe I have.</p>

"Turning off the proxy part of Tor","<p>I would like to use the tor browser but without the Proxy / Onion element of it. The reason why I would like to do this is because I'd like to use Tor as my main go to browser for normal activities and I have more trust in Tor than in Google Chrome or Mozilla regarding sending private information back from the browser itself (AKA application-level privacy/security).</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> How can I disable the Proxy part of tor WITHOUT disabling the rest of the security features Tor has?</p>

<p><strong>WHAT I HAVE TRIED SO FAR:</strong></p>

<p>______<strong>[</strong> ATTEMPT# <strong>1]</strong>______</p>

<p>Open Menu <strong>></strong> Add-ons <strong>></strong> Extensions <strong>></strong> Disable TorLauncher</p>

<p>After doing this and trying to go on any random URL, I get the following error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The proxy server is refusing connections</p>
  
  <p>Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.</li>
  <li>Contact your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is working.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>[IMPORTANT NOTE] I already did try disabling the Torbutton add-on as well, and the same error happened. HOWEVER I do not want to disable the Torbutton add-on since it provides important application-level security, which I would like to keep. I just tried disabling it to see if it was causing some indirect issues.</em></p>

<p>______<strong>[</strong> ATTEMPT# <strong>2]</strong>______</p>

<p>Open Menu <strong>></strong> Options <strong>></strong> Advanced <strong>></strong> Network <strong>></strong>  Settings <strong>></strong> Selecting ""No proxy""</p>

<p>This was done together with keeping <strong>TorLauncher</strong> disabled. Now I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unable to find the proxy server</p>
  
  <p>Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that can't be found.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Check the proxy settings to make sure that they are correct.</li>
  <li>Check to make sure your computer has a working network connection.</li>
  <li>If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Tor Browser is permitted to access the Web.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems that the browser is still looking for a proxy server to connect to, even after I disabled that option in the Network Settings.</p>

<p>I have been trying to find something else that might get the job done, but without success. I am still looking. Would anyone happen to know the solution?</p>

Until you fix the underlying problem and restart Tor, Tor Browser will not start."").</p>

<p>According to the Tor manual, I have written the following lines in the torrc file:</p>

<pre><code>HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1

<p>However, when I write this and start Tor, Tor crashes. I think I should disable all client-side services, but I do not know how to do it. Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>Well, I'm going to tell you several things (although I have not been able to solve my problem).</p>

<p>First: Through Tor Browser (and running Tor Browser with administrator privileges), I changed the address of<code>HiddenServiceDirectory</code> to <code>C:\Users\Usuario\Desktop\Ser_Oc</code>. However, I had the same problem: everything works fine, but when I add to the file <code>torrc</code> the lines <code>HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1</code> and <code>HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1</code>, Tor Browser does not start, and displays the following error window: <code>""Tor exited during startup. This might be due to an error in your torrc file, a bug in Tor or another program on your system, or faulty hardware. Until you fix the underlying problem and restart Tor, Tor Browser will not start""</code>.</p>

<p>I leave here the configuration of the file ""torrc"" when I did this new test:</p>

<pre><code># This file was generated by Tor; if you edit it, comments will not be preserved
# The old torrc file was renamed to torrc.orig.1 or similar, and Tor will ignore it

<p>On the other hand, in the <code>HiddenServiceDir</code> directory (C:\Users\Usuario\Desktop\lkfajsdflkasjf), I can see three files: <code>hostname</code>, <code>private_key</code> AND <code>onion_service_non_anonymous</code>. So, I think everything is well configured.</p>

<p>However, when I access my to my hidden service from Tor Browser, and I see the circuit, I see six relays yet! Three relay which correspond to my Tor Browser, and then three relays which appear as ""(relay)"". My question is: if my hidden service is configured in ""Single Onion Service"" mode, why do these three relays appear? That is, theoretically my hidden service would have to connect directly to the rendezvous point, right? So, why do these three relays appear?</p>

"Why do entry nodes not know the originator?","<p>I stumbled upon the following text in the article about onion routing on Wikipedia: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this example onion, the source of the data sends the onion to
  Router A, which removes a layer of encryption to learn only where to
  send it next and where it came from (though it does not know if the
  sender is the origin or just another node). Router A sends it to
  Router B, which decrypts another layer to learn its next destination.
  Router B sends it to Router C, which removes the final layer of
  encryption and transmits the original message to its destination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I am wondering how the entry node can not know that it's talking to the originator. Couldn't it simply check the list of all tor nodes and see that the IP is not a tor node? Or did I misunderstand the concept of tor clients... I thought clients are not automatically nodes. </p>

<p>And are the data packages that are being sent between the node always of the same size? I guess otherwise I would be pretty easy to check what is going on.</p>

<p>Please help me and sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"Getting WebRTC built into TOR","<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>

<p>I have been trying to get WebRTC onto the TOR Browser. <strong>I Know</strong> this might sound stupid at first, I explained my reasons on why I wanted to do this in my previous post: <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/14660/getting-webrtc-on-tor?noredirect=1#comment16304_14660"">Getting WebRTC on TOR</a></p>

<p><strong>Current Progress:</strong></p>

<p>After no luck with finding already made plugins, I decided to try to build it into TOR myself. I'm using the latest version of Ubuntu btw (Xenial 16.04). What I have done so far is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Download a fresh version of TOR but without installing it</p></li>
<li><p>Download the version of firefox that the previous TOR version was based off of (firefox 45.9.0), only downloaded, didn't install.</p></li>
<li><p>Located relevant WebRTC files in the firefox:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>firefox-sdk/include/mozilla/media/webrtc/WebrtcGlobal.h</p>

<p>this file has a few <code>#include ...</code>s at the top, which are files that are also located within the firefox downloaded bundle, and some of these refer to other files, and so on.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>If I copy all the files that are related to the WebRTC file <code>WebrtcGlobal.h</code> would that compose all the necessary files in order to implement WebRTC into tor? If I need more please let me know which, and if I don't need all the ones included, which ones are the only ones I need?</p></li>
<li><p>After having the right files, where in TOR should I include them? Do I need to modify certain configurations, like <code>media.peerconnection.enabled=false</code> into <code>true</code>, amongst others?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there anything else I would need to do? <strong>As you can see</strong>, I am kind of learning as I go along, any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!</p></li>

"How to specify ExitNodes in Linux?","<p>You can edit <code>torrc</code> file in Windows version and add something like <code>ExitNodes {US}</code>. And this will make your Tor Browser connect to .us proxies only.</p>

"Tor and Exit nodes - just a question","<p>Given the fact that exit nodes seem to be implicated with just about every bad story covering Tor - why have them?</p>

<p>Could not the clearweb be left to just continue it's evolution into a corporate cesspool, while onion services evolved to handle everything else (both legit and criminal...but supportive of non corporate interests)?</p>

<p>As I see it, Tor keeps getting a black eye from people who use it to inflict harm on others. Eliminating the exit nodes would remove this trouble and might actually make it safer for Tor users? No chance of accidental exit where attackers congregate.</p>

<p>Those new protections for onion sites have real potential, but this potential is likely drowned out by the continuing propaganda LE quarters use to justify their bullshit jobs. Elimination of exit nodes would eventually ""cut such people off from the money"".</p>

<p>What's the worst that can happen? Hackers being forced to build their own string of VPN links so they can attack clearweb sites? Why would anyone within the Tor organization care? What's in it for them when they protect such people? What is the cost of providing such protection?</p>

<p>Right now, the only way to avoid exit mistakes is to use a VPN provider supporting in house Tor2Web. And of course, that leaves one vulnerable to personnel changes at that VPN provider. Onion clients which ""stayed within Tor"" would be very useful.</p>

"Why aren't the biggest bittorrent file sharing sites using Tor yet?","<p>From what little I know about how Tor works (I might be wrong about some things), it seems like if more users were incentivized to use Tor for downloading and sharing files, the number of endpoints would increase, making it less likely that your traffic would end up in an evil logging/scanning/sniffing endpoint, and the increased amount of traffic would make it harder for malicious third party to sift through so much data to find someone's specific data packets.</p>

<p>I've seen installers which simplify setting up VPN and whatnot that would benefit user, but which would deter new users if they had to configure everything manually. So it can be done, and regular users may only need to hit ""install > yes > yes > ok"" and everyone on the Tor network would benefit tremendously. It seems they only need to say ""we're moving to Tor!"" and it's as good as done.</p>

<p>So why isn't this a thing in 2017? Are there some hidden downsides to inviting millions of new users to join Tor? And are there some problems associated specifically with bittorrent filesharing traffic over Tor? And if Bittorrent is not a desirable way to share data over Tor, what would be?</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Does restricting the guard nodes Tor chooses actually have a negative effect on anonymity?</p>

<p>Since a Tor user usually connects to the same guard node using a non-anonymous IP address, it seems this should have little effect on anonymity.</p>

So my follow-up question is now: What would be the better alternative for the purposes of file-sharing anonymously over Tor, preferably retaining Bittorrent's advantages like:</p>

<ul>
<li>no central host from which nobody would be able to download if it stops working</li>
<li>not having to have a complete downloaded file to share what you already have</li>

"How can I configure my network so that when Tor is running no other traffic can leave the box?","<p>One of the fundamentals of Tor is that it can only really hide you if, when Tor is enabled and in use, you're using it exclusively.</p>

<p>Agents wishing to de-anonymize you can examine requests to different endpoints and look for common or synchronized requests, which suggests that the traffic from a proxied IP address is related to the traffic from the actual endpoint.</p>

<p>So to prevent other components on my laptop from disclosing my location, I'd like to configure the system so it blocks all traffic that isn't going through the Tor relay. For instance, Skype, Gmail, Spotify, or anything else that makes requests to the Internet must be disabled?</p>

<p>How can I configure Tor, or my network, so that only components using the Tor relay can make requests to the Internet? I've used firewall UNIX tools like ufw and ipfw, but automating this would reduce the potential for making mistakes and forgetting to close or block something.</p>

"Aside from disabling Javascript in Firefox, how can I make Tor Browser Bundle more secure?","<p>In a recent <a href=""https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html"">Tor security advisory</a>, Roger Dingledine writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider disabling JavaScript (click the blue
    ""S"" beside the green onion, and select ""Forbid Scripts Globally"").
    Disabling JavaScript will reduce your vulnerability to other attacks
    like this one, but disabling JavaScript will make some websites not work
    like you expect. A future version of Tor Browser Bundle will have an
    easier interface for letting you configure your JavaScript settings [11].
    You might also like Request Policy [12]. And you might want to randomize
    your MAC address, install various firewalls, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He makes a few other suggestions, like not using Windows and switching to a LiveCD such as <a href=""https://tails.boum.org/about/"">Tails</a>. My question, though, relates to the ""etc."" in Roger's statement that ""you might want to randomize
  your MAC address, install various firewalls, etc."" Besides disabling Javascript, installing RequestPolicy, and following Roger's other recommendations, what else can/should I do to harden Firefox?</p>

<p>As Roger states, ""JavaScript is one big vector for attack, but many other
  big vectors exist, like css, svg, xml, the renderer, etc."" Okay, so I should probably disable images and CSS then? Short of using a text-based browser like Lynx, what can I do?</p>

<p>I am less concerned with linkability/fingerprinting than I am with security, i.e. maintaining the anonymity of my IP address by not getting owned.</p>

<p>The security advisory quoted above also touches on stuff Tor users can do at the OS level to increase security. This could involve using Tails or possibly a VM-based approach (examples are <a href=""http://qubes-os.org/trac"">Qubes</a> or <a href=""https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Main_Page"">Whonix</a>). There are plenty of other OS options, like OpenBSD, Hardened Gentoo, and so on, each with its pros and cons.</p>

<p>Let's just focus on Firefox, though - regardless of OS. </p>

<p>Even then, this is a pretty broad question. Maybe it should be split into more than one question?</p>

"Securely hosting a Tor hidden service/site","<p>There are some detailed instructions for setting up a Tor site at torproject.org<a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en"">1</a>. It seems that it would be most secure to use a dedicated machine for this task if possible. I've read elsewhere that <code>thttpd</code> might be preferable to Apache and its likely more secure to go with a GNI/Linux over Windows.  </p>

<p>Any thoughts on this? Is there a ""standard"" distro and/or web-server that would be best-suited for this task? Or is that merely a matter of personal preference?</p>

<p>Also, what are appropriate and effective security practices, both technical and operational? What can we learn from the recent compromises of Freedom Hosting (perhaps the largest .onion hosting provider) and the Silk Road? According to Wired<a href=""http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi/"">2</a>, ""the FBI yesterday acknowledged that it secretly took control of Freedom Hosting last July"". The article notes that ""[i]t’s not clear how the FBI took over the servers"". However, the comment that ""the bureau was temporarily thwarted when Marques somehow regained access and changed the passwords"" is suggestive. As details come out in the trial, it would be prudent to identify relevant technical and/or operational failures.</p>

<p>In the case of the Silk Road, it's clear from the Maryland complaint<a href=""https://ia601904.us.archive.org/1/items/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311/gov.uscourts.mdd.238311.4.0.pdf"">3</a> that vulnerabilities in Tor were not instrumental in the site's compromise. Even so, did technical and/or operational failures contribute to the takedown, and how might they be corrected?</p>

<p>As new hidden service sites fill these market niches, at least some of the underlying technical and/or operational improvements may become public. There is much to learn about doing this right.</p>

"Suspcious IMAP traffic between my machine and a Tor entry node","<p>I was running Wireshark and noticed that my machine sends IMAP requests to 37.187.22.131, which, according to my TorBrowser, is the entry node I'm connected to. Likewise, my machine seems to be receiving IMAP responses from that IP as well. The responses seem to often happen in as low as ~30ms from the request. When I ping the entry node, the latency seems to be ~31ms. This leads me to believe that whatever requests my machine is sending, it is the entry node that is responding to them.</p>

<p>I installed another copy of TorBrowser, using a different entry node, and that doesn't seem to have the same problem. Also, when I'm not running a TorBrowser, there is no problem. The data that is being sent and received does not seem to be plain text either, so I don't think this is actual email traffic.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what is going on? I don't think I have any email services running in the background. Even if I did, why would the entry node respond to the requests? Is it possible that the 37.187.22.131 (and one of my copies of TorBrowser) is compromised? Or is IMAP (or IMAP looking) traffic normal for Tor behaviour?</p>

<p>The 2. attack: The attackers saved all this page informations and several times goes back some certain links which can contain major information like: User information,website public change information,. They have been saved and fallowed this status.</p>

"My hidden service fails to load as long as the Tor Browser is open on the same host","<p>I use my hidden service as a way to access my home computer from my phone securely and regardless of any IP changes.</p>

<p>Today, I installed the Tor Browser. After I launched it, the hidden service became unavailable both from the computer and the phone. The moment I closed it, I could access the service from my phone again.</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a conflict.</p>

<p>Up until now, I used <code>tor</code>. I configured it to run automatically as soon as the system loads. I don't even remember how I did that, and I mean it. Which is also part of the issue, because I can't find any of the configuration files (with the exception of <code>torrc</code>), otherwise, I might have solved the problem by now.</p>

<p>Now, there's a <code>torrc</code> file in <code>/etc/tor</code>. Apparently, the Tor Browser also has one. Could that be the source of the problem? How do I resolve the conflict?</p>

<p>I suppose, I could just ignore the problem and not use the hidden service when I'm using the Tor Browser, but what if I forget to close it and try to access the computer later?</p>

<p>Edit: renaming <code>./tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/torrc</code> to something else helped, but that's trial and error, I still am not sure what kind of consequences this can cause. Besides, maybe it's just a single line that causes the problem?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is the solution or simply a workaround that doesn't actually help to solve the real problem.</p>

<p>That's what I eliminate by essentially removing the <code>torrc</code> file</p>

<pre><code>DataDirectory /opt/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor
GeoIPFile /opt/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Tor/geoip

"Exitnodes: safe?","<p>I've configured the torrc file to use a specific exitnode with strictexitnode 1.</p>

<p>I want to know if this compromised my privacy in any way. If I understand it correctly, Tor would still have two different entry and middle nodes, regardless of the exit node setting in the torrc file, which would mean that 99.99999% of the time the entry, middle node and exit node would not be the same and there would be no way to know my real IP address, even to the exit node owner?</p>

<p>Also, I have sent personal information with HTTPS services, using that node, but since it was HTTPS, if I understand correctly, the exit nodes owners would not be able to see it?</p>

<p>And my last question, the receiver of the personal information could see I have used a tor exit node, is that completely legal? if I wasnt doing anything wrong but just using Tor for anonmity?</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who answers my questions</p>

"Update system tor","<p>I'm currently running system tor, and its version is <code>0.3.1.1-alpha-dev</code>. Every once in a while it asks me to change it by either downgrading it (to 0.2.x)? which sounds mildly reasonable, or upgrading it to <code>0.3.1.2</code>, which at the moment of this writing, as far as I can see, doesn't exist.

"Why isn't my tor starting?","<p>I saw OrBot in Google PlayStore and decided to give it a shot. Once I enabled apps VPN mode and Bridges (just to see...) I started getting a lot of captchas. When I searched online for what could be done, I read somewhere that this can be solved by requesting different bridges from tor (they said it was due to lot of traffic from the bridge I was using). So I took some new bridges from tor. But now, when I start tor, it doesn't start. The log says this:</p>

"Can you create a SSH, OpenVPN, or stunnel tunel from Whonix where the other party is a non-Tor machine and pipe Linphone traffic through this tunel","<p>Basic problem of lets say a whistleblower is that he may not wish the person he is communicating with to know his real public IP and often the 3rd party is a non-Tor user so the use of hidden services is not possible as that person cannot access them if he/she is not connected to the Tor network.  Correct me if I am wrong in this, for example if I were to setup a SIP or XMPP server as a Tor hidden service on my local Tor m/c under Linux, could a non-Tor user make connection to my server without being part of the Tor network?</p>

<p>The 3rd party may be technically incapable of coping with Tor or may be unwilling due to not wanting to draw attention to themself that they are using Tor and thereby automatically raising suspicion in oppressive regimes.</p>

<p>So my requirement is I wish to remain anonymous from the gov, and not reveal my real public IP to the 3rd party I am communicating with by using Tor at my end.  To be more specific by using a Whonix Workstation to access the Tor n/w via the Whonix Gateway (both running on the local m/c in seperate VMs under a Debian host OS.  Of course this question is Tor generic and not specific to Whonix.</p>

<p>I wish to create either a SSH, OpenVPN or a stunnel tunnel between my Tor m/c and the 3rd party's non-Tor m/c.  The 3rd party could be running Debian Linux, Windows XP or Windows 7, it shouldn't matter to the overall concept here.  Once I have an encrypted tunnel, I can then use Local Port Forwarding in SSH or stunnel to run whatever servicei I wish through the tunnel.</p>

<p>In my case I wish to use Linphone SIP Softphone at both ends to make encrypted P2P VoIP calls. </p>

<p>If I were not using Tor at my end, I would have setup my own SIP server on my machine and allowed the remote user to connect to it using any SIP client/softphone.  Alternatively I could use a SIP proxy such as the service provided by Linphone where you get a public number ex: tom@domain.com which means you do not have to worry about your public IP address changing, the 3rd party is routed to you via the Linphone service.  I don't really wish to use any 3rd party serice as I do not wish to introduce additional attack vectors via potential side channel attacks which may allow the SIP proxy operator to do a MiTM attack on my SRTP traffic and he would certainly know the real IP of both communicating parties even if he could not attack the crypto.  If anyone knows of any potential risks/attacks in using a Linphone type SIP registration serice, please let me know to help me better understand the process.</p>

<p>In any case AFAIK only the SIP signalling goes via the SIP provider, the actual data in the form of SRTP if its an encrypted session goes P2P in which case the gov would at a minimum know the IP address of both communicating parties.  Please correct me if my understanding is not
correct here.</p>

<p>So returning to the issue.  If I could run the SSH or stunnel server on the 3rd party's m/c I can see that it may be workable as I know his/her public IP and can initiate the session from my SIP client to their SIP client or SIP server.  As an aside, when Tor switches circuits say every 10 mins does the exit node get changed too and thereby a new IP address is seen by the remote server you are connected to.  If its a HTTPS session, am I correct in thinking your session is not lost even if your IP changes?  Imagine if you are connected to fb via https, via Tor, and your exit not changes, obviously fb can use cookies to track you so it can ignore the IP address change, but if the application say a SIP or XMPP session is using ZRTP to do authentication, will it not think a MiTM may be taking place as the IP has changed?  Or the session key, unless its stolen by the attacker, is only residing on the 2 machines at the time authentication took place so if a MiTM took place that attacker would not have the session key so the connection would be dropped by the application or at least the user warned that the session key has changed?  SSH for instance would be affected if the session key changed?</p>

<p>Am I correct in thinking that I cannot have the SSH or stunnel server running on my local machine if I am behind Tor and the other party is not using Tor, as they cannot know my IP address to make a connection to?  Any techniques I am missing which would allow a reverse SSH or HTTPS connection from the 3rd party machine back to my server?  Same argument if I wish to use my own XMPP server instead going down the SIP route to have voice/video conversations.</p>

<p>If you can think of any NAT issues as both parties will be behind domestic WiFi routers which use NAT and in my case I am NATing a Whonix Gateway VM to the host OS which uses a WiFi connection for the Internet.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance, apologies for the long winded question, however this is certain a configuration issue which would be very useful to many Tor users, I have certainly been thinking about it for years as to how to keep a local attacker from finding out the real IP of the 3rd parties I communicate with because if they know their IP then they can put pressure on them to reveal my real ID and location.</p>

"Is Tor responsible for content on websites?","<p>I enjoy using Tor very much since discovering it. I find the biggest problem is the prevalence of child exploitation on various .onion sites, while looking for adult porn which I already feel ashamed of looking at. I didn't intend to use Tor for porn reasons and I hopefully have nailed the last nail in the coffin of this bad habit, but it makes me wonder:</p>

<p>Although Tor itself isn't responsible for this content on the websites, but at the same time is the only gateway to them, is not some responsibility in removing child pornography and other exploitation of innocent people partly their/our responsibility?  I don't agree with closing down other services, but to take the innocence of childhood and mix it with the other sections of this website is abhorrent to any decent human, and those that have problems with this need to get help.  I don't know how, as I believe that those who have this problem will find most avenues disciplining them rather than helping them overcome it, due to the stigma, even though it is an illness that needs working with.  Back on subject though, if the perspective was ""fix it or lose it"", would Tor be more inclined to remove access to these sites that do this?</p>

"What about Tor light?","<p>Recently unscrupulous marketers in the U.S. were allowed to collect data from all their customers and resell that data. That's why I'm using Tor for pretty much everything I do.</p>

<p>However, I only need a light type of privacy. In my case my data doesn't have to go from The Netherlands to Canada and from there to Germany (and back).</p>

<p>Would it be a good idea to introduce a light version of Tor? My data would only go to one foreign IP address (and back). </p>

<p>The advantage would be that Tor light should work faster since my data only needs to go to one foreign IP address. Another advantage would be that there's less Internet traffic as well, also because my data doesn't have to visit three countries before getting where it should be.</p>

<p>I imagine that, when installing Tor, users could choose whether or not to use Tor light, but that that choice could be changed later in the settings.</p>

"What is passed to the Onion Proxy in terms of the OSI model?","<p>I'm trying to understand at what layer does the SOCKS proxy receive. For example, if I visit a website and make a HTTP get to the web server it is passed through via SOCKS to make the request. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>At the SOCKS server or Onion Proxy, after the circuit creation, key exchanges, etc., what does it receive and how does Tor package/wrap the HTTP get request into its cell. I ask this because I created a SOCKS server and read the buffer and it outputted the application data (host, user-agent), so does Tor split those (application byte stream) into 512 bytes cells and add the respective cell headers?</p></li>
<li><p>Then what about the TCP handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) or TCP data transfer. Do those need to be packaged into cells as well? I ask this because does the client connect the TCP handshake or does the exit node handle that? I never quite understood the initiation process. If it's the first, then are the syn, syn-ack, ack packets sent via onion routing individually or if its the latter then does the exit node just pass the data down the stream, so that there is two connections: client onion routing to exit and exit to web server?</p></li>
<li><p>Relating to questioon 1, how does the web server receive and interpret those cells? I'm assuming the exit node's SOCKS proxy server handling the incoming (?) and outgoing traffic somehow strips the cell data. But not really sure on the details.</p></li>

My question is: does Tor choose nodes from nearby countries by default?</p>

<p>I understand that maybe this is due to latency: if I am in a European country, and Tor always creates circuits like: Argentina - Azerbaijan - South Africa, the connection will probably go very slowly.</p>

"How to keep (or import) the Tor Browser's history, when updating from an older version to TBB 5.0?","<p>Is it possible to keep (or import) the Tor Browser's history data (not the bookmarks) when updating from an older version to TBB 5.0? And if so, then how?</p>

<p>Background: Using TBB as my ""default browser"" for almost one year now with LinuxMint, I somewhen decided to switch on the browsing history, as well as address completion and decent caching (due to data limits on my mobile internet connection).</p>

<p>I haven't agreed to update ever since though, because the former manual TBB update process would dispose of all the convenient history and completion data :-(</p>

<p>While trying out the new TBB 5.0 I discovered that it has a nice+smooth Auto-Updater (similar to the normal Firefox-Updater) which will probably keep 
these data from now on. Now that is great work, Thanks a lot! - But still, how can I transfer my old browsing history into the new version 5.0?</p>

<p>P.S. In case there is NO way - then how can I start-up the old TBB in an ""offline mode"" (i.e. without connecting to the Tor network), to use it just as a reference when searching for an old page address I can't remember any more?</p>

"Can Tor nodes know their position in the circuit?","<p>It is documented <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorFAQ#WhichTornodeknowswhat"">which node knows what</a>.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the nodes in the circuit know their own relative position. For normal three relay paths, they certainly can infer their position: the exit knows -since it's connecting outside- the middle knows since it's connecting two known nodes, the entry knows since it's connecting a (unknown) client with a known node.</p>

<p>Now, were you to build a 4-hop circuit, would the two middle ones know whether they're in position <code>#2</code> or <code>#3</code>? My guess is that they would, specially since guards are only used as guards and exits are only used as exits.</p>

<p>From that, it follows you'd need at least 6 hops for some nodes not to know their position, but how is data framed? Can a node infer how many nodes are ahead of it, just from the encrypted payload size?</p>

<p>But I just came across <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/17336/cloudflares-new-onion-dns-resolver"">this question</a> regarding CloudFlare's new access channel to their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver over a Tor Hidden Service, and the appearance of the address shocked me: <a href=""https://dns4torpnlfs2ifuz2s2yf3fc7rdmsbhm6rw75euj35pac6ap25zgqad.onion/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dns4torpnlfs2ifuz2s2yf3fc7rdmsbhm6rw75euj35pac6ap25zgqad.onion/</a></p>

<p>How on Earth is the address that long? I don't have the resources to test right now, nor have I found any explanations online, but this looks like the result of the Tor Project implementing longer RSA keys for hidden services. Is that true? If not, what is going on here? The address is valid and accessible, I was able to check that.</p>

"Configuring my Tor browser to use more than three relays (nodes)","<p>The title of the question speaks for it self. Can I configure Tor to use more than three relays (nodes)? I suppose that it won't be possible inside the native Tor Browser, because that can only use three. However, is there maybe another browser, which can connect to the Tor network and use e.g. four relays or more?</p>

"Detailed Understanding of Tor's connection establishment","<p>I am really new to Onion Routing and Tor and I have just started reading about the topic on Wikipedia and the Tor Protocol Specification. Most of the concepts are explained very well but I have problems understanding some of the more complex points.</p>

<p>To begin with, how exactly does the connection establishment work?</p>

<p>In the torspec it says that there are at least three possible handshakes (v1, v2 and v3) that differ in the way they exchange the certificates.
But do the relays (or the client and a relay) really exchange the certificates upfront or do they perform a TLS handshake first?</p>

<p>In a Tor-design paper (see link below) in section 4.2 (page 5) there is a figure that shows a (simplified) two-hop-circuit. The figure focuses on the encryption of the circuit, which is very interesting to see.
What I would like to do is (mentally) draw a figure that includes all communication paths during the connection establishment, e.g.: the TLS handshake, the certificate exchange, the ClientHello, the Tor protocol version that is used, and so on.</p>

<p>Are there any other figurs, specifications or papers that clarify that process? Or can anyone explain this in a short, but detailed way?</p>

However, I am not clear about the attack power that such a bridge has.</p>

"No traffic on obfs4 bridge","<p>I am running an obfs4 bridge on my raspberry pi since 10 days now and haven't seen a single client since then.</p>

BridgeRelay 1
ControlPort 9051

<p>From the logs I can read that the obfs4 service is listening on port 39147, so I have port forwarded it along with port 9001.</p>

<p>Is this completely normal behaviour and due to the fact that bridges are not listed publicly? Are there simply not many obfs4 clients around? Or is it a misconfiguration?</p>

"Is it useful to use ISP's DHCP to regularly change IP address of bridge relays?","<p>I maintain a few Tor middle relays on different broadband connections, so I’m relatively familiar with running the Tor software on small Linux and FreeBSD servers.</p>

<p>My next project might be to set up a bridge relay, since I assume they’re a quite scarce resource. I want the Tor network and its users to get the most out of the bandwidth I can donate, so here's a thing I've been pondering.</p>

<p>To my understanding, bridges have a tendency to get blacklisted by oppressive entities relatively quickly.</p>

<p>So I’m wondering: would I provide a useful service to network at large by hosting a bridge relay and then changing its ip address every now and then, for the purpose of having a ""fresher asset"" to offer the network?</p>

<p>Specifically: it would be trivial for me to set up a bridge relay on a broadband connection. I could do something simple like presenting a different MAC address on the WAN interface to get a different ip address from the ISP’s DHCP service, and perhaps even automate this process to take place at random every 30-90 days.</p>

<p>I mean: Is there a sufficiently large variation in how sophisticated adversaries are in blocking bridges for users who need them, for the Tor network to make actual use of bridges with IPs that fluctuate within a single ISP’s regional address space?</p>

<p>Or is this a futile exercise that just would get traffic to and from my ISP’s entire customer IP address space filtered and scrutinized by the kinds of networks that already force its users to rely on Tor bridges? </p>

I have read all the specs, and i looked up the tor source code, but its really hard, because it is using very low-level C.

microdescriptors ( there are 10 hardcoded, but 1 is serving only the

<li><p>2) Connect to dir server, fetch a consesus document<br>
/tor/status-vote/current/consensus/ using HTTP protocol, close the<br>
connection.</p></li>
<li><p>3) Parse the list of onion routers, construct the    curicuit from 3
nodes.</p></li>
<li><p>4) Parse the entry node with the attributes    <code>Fast Guard HSDir
Running Stable Valid</code></p></li>
<li><p>5) Parse the exit node with    the attributes <code>Fast Exit HSDir
Running Stable Valid</code></p></li>
<li><p>6) Parse the    random middle node? Is it just a OR in the list
without <code>Exit</code> or    <code>Guard</code> attributes? Or any OR with attributes
<code>Exit</code> or <code>Guard</code> can    also be used as a middle node?</p></li>
<li>7) Create a tcp socket and connecto to    the parsed entry node with
the given ip port. Then Create a <em>cell packet</em> with the command <code>CREATE</code> with the payload of Diffie-Hellman handshake. Receive a command <code>CREATED</code> wit the encryption key.</li>
<li>8) Form a <em>relay cell</em> packet with command <code>RELAY_EXTEND</code> containing
the ip port of the middle node, and encrypted  half handshake for the
middle relay, with the key we parsed from previous action, send it to
the connected entry node, receive an answer as <code>RELAY_EXTENDED</code>
packet, parse new encryption key from it. And use it later to encrypt
last diffie hellman handhskae payload.</li>
<li>9) Do the previous action, send <code>RELAY_EXTEND</code>, to the guard node, but with the address of the exit node, and encrypted diffie helman handhskae with the key we received from middle node.</li>
<li>10) I guess that is it? The curcuit is ready? Now i can use a relay
cell packets,sending them to my guard node socket connection, encrypted with the key i received from exit node with <code>RELAY_BEGIN</code> to connect to hosts, <code>RELAY_DATA</code> to

<p>To connect to Tor I specified the proxy as automatic and to the Raspberry Pi's IP, which in this case was 10.0.1.14.</p>

<p>So together the url was <a href=""http://10.0.1.14/proxy.pac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://10.0.1.14/proxy.pac</a></p>

<p>This works perfectly to mask my IP and DNS, but .onion is not available</p>

"Does tails have a penetrable firewall?","<p>Does tails have a penetrable firewall?</p>

<p>Currently tails firewall has a very complicated structure to it. It is difficult to say if the firewall is penetrable or not. One might think it is not when it is.</p>

<p>Currently tails firewall allows both encrypted and unencrypted TCP data to go through it. This is evident as tails still has the unsecured browser. Tails may be made a more secure OS by preventing the firewall from allowing unencrypted data. This may prevent a local hack against tails or an attack directed against tails from the ISP or an attacker hacking the ISP to hack a tails OS. There are some OS that are used on routers that  can route based on protocol. It may be possible to route of TLS/SSL data. This is called policy based routing. Policy based routing is present in DD-WRT routers. This routing method combined with dropping all the packets that are not in the policy may result in a pure encrypted data. I am not saying to make tails a routing OS but use something similar to this function to make tails OS more secure. Using this in tails OS or something similar like that may prevent the unintended (unencrypted) data packets from getting through the firewall in tails OS. This may make tails a more secure OS. Yes this will mean that the unsecured browser will need to be removed from the tails OS. I believe that the Unsecured browser is hardly used on tails and would not be missed. I for one have  never used it. If you need to keep the unsafe browser for captive portals then you could may be have it be included as an option on start up like the browser used for hidden services and start tails in an unsecured mode.</p>

<p>Would it be more secure if tails were to drop all TCP unencrypted data? Could this be done to tails firewall?</p>

<p>Here's my torcc config file:</p>

<pre><code>## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
## Last updated 9 October 2013 for Tor 0.2.5.2-alpha.
## (may or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
##
## Lines that begin with ""## "" try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just ""#"" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the ""#"" symbol.
##
## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
## for more options you can use in this file.
##
## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc

## Tor opens a socks proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set ""SocksPort 0"" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
#SocksPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
#SocksPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.

## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SocksPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests that reach a SocksPort. Untrusted users who
## can access your SocksPort may be able to learn about the connections
## you make.
#SocksPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
#SocksPolicy reject *

## Logs go to stdout at level ""notice"" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
## you want.
##
## We advise using ""notice"" in most cases, since anything more verbose
## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
#Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
## Send every possible message to /var/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
#Log notice syslog
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr

## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
RunAsDaemon 1

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
#ControlPort 9051
## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.
#HashedControlPassword 16:872860B76453A77D60CA2BB8C1A7042072093276A3D701AD684053EC4C
#CookieAuthentication 1

############### This section is just for location-hidden services ###

## Once you have configured a hidden service, you can look at the
## contents of the file "".../hidden_service/hostname"" for the address
## to tell people.
##
## HiddenServicePort x y:z says to redirect requests on port x to the
## address y:z.

#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80

#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/other_hidden_service/
#HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
#HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22

################ This section is just for relays #####################
#
## See https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay for details.

## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
#ORPort 9001
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
## follows.  You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
## yourself to make this work.
#ORPort 443 NoListen
#ORPort 127.0.0.1:9090 NoAdvertise

## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
#Address noname.example.com

## If you have multiple network interfaces, you can specify one for
## outgoing traffic to use.
# OutboundBindAddress 10.0.0.5

## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
#Nickname ididnteditheconfig

## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
## be at least 20 KB.
## Note that units for these config options are bytes per second, not bits
## per second, and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10, 2^20, etc.
#RelayBandwidthRate 100 KB  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
#RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KB # But allow bursts up to 200KB/s (1600Kbps)

## Use these to restrict the maximum traffic per day, week, or month.
## Note that this threshold applies separately to sent and received bytes,
## not to their sum: setting ""4 GB"" may allow up to 8 GB total before
## hibernating.
##
## Set a maximum of 4 gigabytes each way per period.
#AccountingMax 4 GB
## Each period starts daily at midnight (AccountingMax is per day)
#AccountingStart day 00:00
## Each period starts on the 3rd of the month at 15:00 (AccountingMax
## is per month)
#AccountingStart month 3 15:00

## Administrative contact information for this relay or bridge. This line
## can be used to contact you if your relay or bridge is misconfigured or
## something else goes wrong. Note that we archive and publish all
## descriptors containing these lines and that Google indexes them, so
## spammers might also collect them. You may want to obscure the fact that
## it's an email address and/or generate a new address for this purpose.
#ContactInfo Random Person &lt;nobody AT example dot com&gt;
## You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:
#ContactInfo 0xFFFFFFFF Random Person &lt;nobody AT example dot com&gt;

## Uncomment this to mirror directory information for others. Please do
## if you have enough bandwidth.
#DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
## DirPort (e.g. to advertise 80 but bind to 9091), you can do it as
## follows.  below too. You'll need to do ipchains or other port
## forwarding yourself to make this work.
#DirPort 80 NoListen
#DirPort 127.0.0.1:9091 NoAdvertise
## Uncomment to return an arbitrary blob of html on your DirPort. Now you
## can explain what Tor is if anybody wonders why your IP address is
## contacting them. See contrib/tor-exit-notice.html in Tor's source
## distribution for a sample.
#DirPortFrontPage /etc/tor/tor-exit-notice.html

## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor relay, and add the identity
## key fingerprint of each Tor relay you control, even if they're on
## different networks. You declare it here so Tor clients can avoid
## using more than one of your relays in a single circuit. See
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#MultipleRelays
## However, you should never include a bridge's fingerprint here, as it would
## break its concealability and potentionally reveal its IP/TCP address.
#MyFamily $keyid,$keyid,...

## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
## to last, and the first match wins. If you want to _replace_
## the default exit policy, end this with either a reject *:* or an
## accept *:*. Otherwise, you're _augmenting_ (prepending to) the
## default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default, which is
## described in the man page or at
## https://www.torproject.org/documentation.html
##
## Look at https://www.torproject.org/faq-abuse.html#TypicalAbuses
## for issues you might encounter if you use the default exit policy.
##
## If certain IPs and ports are blocked externally, e.g. by your firewall,
## you should update your exit policy to reflect this -- otherwise Tor
## users will be told that those destinations are down.
##
## For security, by default Tor rejects connections to private (local)
## networks, including to your public IP address. See the man page entry
## for ExitPolicyRejectPrivate if you want to allow ""exit enclaving"".
##
#ExitPolicy accept *:6660-6667,reject *:* # allow irc ports but no more
#ExitPolicy accept *:119 # accept nntp as well as default exit policy

ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed

## Bridge relays (or ""bridges"") are Tor relays that aren't listed in the
## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even an
## ISP that filters connections to all the known Tor relays probably
## won't be able to block all the bridges. Also, websites won't treat you
## differently because they won't know you're running Tor. If you can
## be a real relay, please do; but if not, be a bridge!
#BridgeRelay 1
## By default, Tor will advertise your bridge to users through various
## mechanisms like https://bridges.torproject.org/. If you want to run
## a private bridge, for example because you'll give out your bridge
## address manually to your friends, uncomment this line:
#PublishServerDescriptor 0

"How does Tor transparent proxying work?","<p>I would like to configure my wireless router as an ""anonymizing middlebox"" for guests. I have read the directions <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter/OpenWRT_setup_notes"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The tutorial, as I understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creates a wireless network and assigns it to a firewall zone named 'transtor'.</li>
<li>It then adds rules to REJECT all incoming and forwarding traffic.</li>
<li>ACCEPTs incoming traffic to UDP port 67 for DHCP.</li>
<li>ACCEPTs incoming TCP traffic to Tor's transparent proxying port and DNS proxy port.</li>
<li>Then configures PREROUTING redirections (using firewall.user) to REDIRECT all DNS requests to Tor and all TCP traffic to Tor's transparent proxying port.</li>
</ul>

<p>The thing I don't understand is in the last bullet. As far as I understand:</p>

<ol>
<li>The client wants to connect, say, to google.com:80, therefore it looks the address up. The DNS request gets redirected to Tor's DNS port, which then returns Google's IP.</li>
<li>The client then tries to connect (IP of Google):80, which the firewall REDIRECTs to (IP of Google):9040. The SYN packet then gets rejected by the router, because it would be forwarding traffic.</li>
<li>If (by some miracle or DNS trickery) Tor would actually get the packet, how would it know to what port the packet was originally destined to? Or to what host, for that matter; the packet now has (router's IP):9040 as its destination.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't ask for a solution to a problem, I just want an explanation on how this particular setup is supposed to work and what I am missing. In the 3rd point I considered the case in which Tor's DNS always returns its own IP, but then how does it know what host:port the new incoming SYN is for?</p>

"Multiple adversaries able to deploy large numbers of relays; do they dilute each other's effectiveness?","<p>I note that when researchers analyse some particular types of attacks on Tor security, they assume a SINGLE adversary who is capable of deploying a significant number of relays that will eventually be selected as guards and exit relays. If that is a realistic assumption to make for the purposes their analysis, then out in the real world there are probably at least three adversaries interested in attacking Tor, each of which is capable of deploying large numbers of relays for that purpose. </p>

<p>The interesting thing about this is that these ""big"" adversaries are likely to be attacking real client groups who will have very little overlap in their membership. If that assumption is true then it seems at first glance that the more ""big"" adversaries out their deploying relays, the smaller is the percentage of relays any one actually controls. Is that dilution effect significant?</p>

<p>Put another way, a client who is worried about being attacked by a particular, ""big"", adversary actually benefits when other ""big"" adversaries add large numbers of relays. It gives our client a better chance of selecting a guard NOT controlled by their adversary. It does not matter if the selected guards are controlled by other adversaries since we assume they are not interested in our client.</p>

Yesterday, just out of curiosity, I clicked on ""view the network.""
In the ""connection"" box, I see my circuits. About 5, 6 circuits each with 3 different nodes.
Then I realised something : only the 2 last nodes are different, the first is always the same IP.
So I click on ""new identity"" and guess what ? Same first node again. Exit node have changed, very well, but the first relay is the same.</p>

<p>Is that how it's supposed to work?</p>

<p>So... I click on one, and instead of taking to the download for Photoshop, it takes me to a download for ""ilivid"" download manager. Why? Do I NEED to have ""ilivid"" to download the new Photoshop? </p>

<p>I keep my ""private Firewall 7.0"" on while using Tor, is that OK? or could that be causing my problem with my links being hijacked? </p>

<p>I must say that I'm totally new to ""Tor"" I never heard of it before tonight. I used to always use Warez websites, and chatrooms, like www.needfullthingz.com but I'd really like to become an integral part of this. I don't understand the lingo yet either. </p>

"Uninstalled Tor, now can't even get to the site to dl again","<p>I was having problems I already asked about (2 Tors in my apps folder and dock), so I decided to uninstall everything and start over. Only today I've been unable to access the Tor site, from any browser (Firefox and Safari) or search engine (Google, Yahoo, Bing). All I get is the spinning wheel and then a can't find the server/problem loading page error message. Tried thru CNET and PCMag and got a TextEdit file. IsItDown tells me repeatedly there's no problem with the site. I have read that ComCast is blocking Tor, but I have Time Warner - are they blocking it too? Is the site under maintenance since it's Sunday? But why wouldn't I then be at least able to get to the site and get a maintenance message?</p>

<p>I fixed it. I had to change my DNS - for some reason the TWC one stopped working - does this mean TWC is blocking Tor? I changed to Google's open DNS. All of a sudden I could access the site and download TBB. Now I have Firefox ESR 24.8, and only one Tor in my apps folder and dock. Yay! For some reason, the Tor icon in the apps folder has the No sign over it, but no matter, it works! Took me quite a while since I'm no techie, but I read somewhere changing the DNS might work, didn't even know what a DNS was, found out I didn't have to change it for my network (my wife would kill me), just for my computer. I still have Tor on my laptop - wonder if I have to change the DNS there too. Anyway, I got it back - I use Tor for privacy, not because I do illegal things, but because I think it's creepy to be followed around and reported on. Big Brother and 1984 and Neuromancer and Snow Crash etc....</p>

"Will routing Tor through a proxy help avoid cloudflare (and how to do it w/ TBB?)","<p>I've been running into cloudflare issues quite a bit when browsing with Tor and it seems to be becoming more and more of an issue. Sometimes I get captchas, sometimes I don't, but regardless it's becoming quite a headache just to try to casually browse semi anonymously. I don't particularly trust proxies and VPNs are as good as their privacy policies I guess but I figure that if I am trying to keep myself private and not so much data traveling back and forth (I do not log into sites etc or do other serious stuff with the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB), I save that for TAILS).</p>

<p>So, this is a two parter:</p>

<ol>
<li>Would running Tor -> Proxy help hide the fact that I am using tor from cloudflare? (It seems to me it would but I wanted to check)</li>
<li>How does/can one setup the TBB to route Tor traffic through a proxy? I of course found the option ""this computer needs to use a proxy to access the internet"" and the Preferences -> Proxy Settings but (and forgive me, I do not really understand this stuff) it sounded to me like those would give me a Proxy -> Tor setup which would still give me the cloudflare problem.</li>

"transparent proxy .onion firewall rules","<p>I am configuring a tor hardware router as an anonymizing transparent proxy using the info <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter"">here</a> and the good news is everything is working as it should; I can connect and browse sites, dns is forwarded to port 9053 and everything else tcp is forwarded over tor on the router port 9040. I go to <a href=""https://check.torproject.org"">https://check.torproject.org</a> to test and it says tor is running and configured properly. </p>

<p>The only thing is I would also like to browse hidden services (.onion)  and so far have not been able to get it to work. When I am connected to the tor hardware router and I troubleshoot from the command line .onion domains resolve to the false ip addresses as they should:</p>

<p>Those are all addresses with the VirtualNetwork as configured in my torrc which looks like this:</p>

AutomapHostsOnResolve 1
TransPort 9040
TransListenAddress 127.0.0.1
TransListenAddress 10.192.0.1
DNSPort 9053
DNSListenAddress 127.0.0.1

</code></pre>

<p>And I have added a firewall rule (this may be where I done goofed) like so:</p>

<pre><code># allow ssh access over port 99 from LAN
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p tcp --dport 99 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 22
# everything else goes over tor
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p tcp --syn -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040
# udp traffic for DNS (port 53) is sent to tor 9053
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9053
# everything else udp is dropped.. not working yet
#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br-lan -p udp --syn -j DROP
# resolve onion domains (this is the rule in question)
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 10.192.0.0/10 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 9040
</code></pre>

<p>I know .onion domains do not have ip addresses to resolve to, but when my browser queries the router 10.192.0.1:9053 for an onion domain it comes back with a seemingly random ip within the 10.192.0.0/10 range, and then when my browser requests that ip (say 10.192.254.7:80) it should be redirected via iptables back to the router 10.192.0.1:9040 right? Or am I doing it wrong?</p>

<p>Everything is working fine except .onion domains...</p>

"Is the “Ron's Coffee” Tor-related hack technically possible in episode 1x01 of Mr. Robot?","<p>In the episode 1x01 of <em>Mr. Robot</em>, Elliot confronts the owner of <em>Ron's Coffee</em>. He basically states that the man is hosting illegal (child pornography) content served in the form of a website that the customers of his coffee shops can access from the shops' Internet connections. Elliot also briefly describes the owner's use of “Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous”. So, the details are not known, but we can imagine that the guy set his website up as a hidden service.</p>

<p>What bugs me is the moment when Elliot states that he could trace traffic between the coffee shop and the illegal servers, saying: “Whoever is in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me the one in control”, implying that he runs one or more Tor exit nodes himself, and that he managed to do either or both of those 2 things:</p>

<ol>
<li>somehow “forcing” the traffic from the coffee shop to go through the exit node(s) he runs;</li>
<li>monitoring packets going through the exit node(s) he runs and tracing them back to their original senders.</li>
</ol>

<p>Either of those is impossible if I get Tor's innards correctly.</p>

<p>I mean, as far as my understanding of Tor goes, it's not possible to trace a user from the exit node back to his/her origin address, and that's precisely the point of onion routing. The only origin address you can get at the exit node is the address of the direct previous node in the chain. So even if you control an exit node, you can't tell who the incoming packets really belong to. You'd have to control a pretty heavy bunch of nodes for the routing of a user to hypothetically pass only through your nodes from entry to exit. That wouldn't even be as simple as that, because the selection and order of the nodes in the chain are random, aren't they? So you'd have to own a really big number of nodes in order to get only a very, very slim chance to trace a user from A to B.</p>

<p>So, is Elliot's hack really technically feasible the way he says he did it? Couldn't it be some kind of counter-propaganda to undermine Tor and its efficiency (especially given that anti-Tor proponents' main argument is that Tor can be used to cover up criminal activities)? Or maybe this is just some kind of simplification for dramatization's sake (which would be a little lame, even though I guess most of the show's viewers are not tech-savvy)? Or maybe I'm missing something about Tor's general flow of operation?</p>

"Why is Tor button for Chrome so much faster than the official Tor browser?","<p>I use regular Chrome, Chrome Canary with Tor button (connected to tor from MacPorts) and Tor browser on the same computer. Obviously regular Chrome is the fastest but Canary/Tor button is just slightly slower (like you would be using an average mobile broadband connection rather than 100 Mbit fiber). However, Tor browser is significantly slower. Why is that?</p>

<p>I don't ""push"" Canary nor Tor browser by having tens of windows and hundreds of tabs open, instead I use one window in either browser, always with less than 5 tabs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Tor browser regularly hangs. You just can't open a new window or tab, clicking links or other common tasks. It is currently in this state and the only (?) thing that works are the menus - they work as expected but when you select a commando there, nothing happens. My copy of Tor browser also frequently use a lot of CPU and the only way to fix this is to kill the daughter process.</p>

<p>Why this big difference in general speed between Canary/Tor button and Tor browser? And more generally, is Tor browser unstable? I use Firefox occasionally and it never shows the instability I experience with Tor browser.</p>

"Could I run the hidden service software(e.g webserver) in a different system than the one Tor is running?","<p>Running a hidden service in a secure way can be a really complicated matter. </p>

<p>Ideally the system where the hidden service software (e.g. a web server) lives should not have a publicly routable IP address on any of its network interfaces and should not be able to learn its real public IP address. That leaves out the solution of NAT since a system behind NAT although has not a publicly routable address can easily find its real address.</p>

<p>A solution would be an isolated system with all its connections routed through Tor. For example another box running Tor could server as middle-box/router for the isolated hidden service host. </p>

<p>If a user followed the traditional way to set up a hidden service in the isolated box then she would end up running Tor in both machines, routing one tor instance though another thus having terrible effects on latency and bandwidth.</p>

<p>My question is: Is there a way to check that the pluggable transports are actually working as advertised while you are browsing?  (I'm assuming that if I click on them and the browser goes to where I ask it to, then the transport is working).</p>

<p>However, I'm a wee bit concerned that if the transport doesn't work, does the Tor Browser Bundle simply default to 'basic Tor' instead, thus making me visible for using Tor?  Or will it simply just not work at all?</p>

<p>And on the same theme, if I start using pluggable transports and some time during the session it stops working, will the browser revert to 'basic Tor' or will it stop completely, forcing me to start the whole Tor Browser Bundle again using some other transport?</p>

Do I have wrong settings in noscript? Or is it a bug?

<p>For now it looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

</code></pre>

<p>When the right password is given, it works, it displays the Tor version as it's supposed to do.
When there's no password I get the message I'm expecting : Please configure the 'torpassword' environment variable</p>

<p>The problem is when I'm trying with wrong passwords to see how it reacts, but I get different messages everytime and I'm bit confused about that.
For example :</p>

<p>In my opinion the last message should be the one I get all the time.
Is it a problem in the Tor server ? Not handling a wrong password the right way ? (not so likely in my opinion)
Is it a problem with the stem library ? (could be, but I doubt it)
Is it a problem with my code ? (much more likely, but I can't see why)</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.

Edit following canonizing ironize answer :</p>

<p>I did try creating a new controller before the second attempt to authenticate, I did try to use the reconnect method
Finally I tried to only let the second authenticate part alone.
All these produced no effect. </p>

"Tor encryption combination","<p>I'm trying to understand exactly how Tor builds a circuit with encryption. I've read the <a href=""https://www.onion-router.net/Publications/tor-design.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tor design literature</a> and have a pretty good grasp on it, however I'm left with the following misunderstanding.</p>

<p>When Alice, the client, goes to build her circuit, she will choose a node, say Bob, from the list of nodes distributed by Tor. She will find Bob's corresponding ""onion key"", which is I believe a public 1,024 bit RSA key (please correct me if I'm wrong). Alice generates the first half of a Diffe-Hellman key exchange, encrypts it with Bob's onion key then sends it to Bob, who decrypts it, generates his half of the DHKE and sends this to Alice along with a hash of the new symmetric key which they will use to encrypt future messages, which is known as a ""session key"". </p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: Does Bob send this message back to Alice in plaintext? I know that by nature of a DHKE even if an eavesdropper obtains Bob's half of the exchange he still cannot determine the secret key so I'm not sure if there is a need for encryption from Bob back to Alice at this point but if so, what type of encryption is it?</p>

<p>Also, if my understanding of the Tor encryption model is way off or there are any errors in my explanations, please let me know, if you can. Thank you.</p>

"How does Tor hide IP address if IP is essential for routing","<p>To establish connection with Tor node I need to send my IP address. Otherwise it will not know where to send reply. How is this better than ssl connection over proxy? Is this only helpful as obfuscation scheme because it's impossible for government to have access to all tor nodes?</p>

<p>I read about encryption of application layer. But some node needs to receive unencrypted version for the whole onion routing to initiate. If government would ask access to this node the whole process would be exposed.</p>

"Can Tor's IP sharing be dangerous?","<p>I am novice to Tor, but before using it I have gone through lot of websites. An article explained that Tor is dangerous the following reason:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consider an IP 1.2.2.2 which was assigned by Tor to user X and he used it for an illegal activity then he closes his Tor circuit after accomplishing it,</li>
<li>Later an innocent Y comes in and is assigned the same IP 1.2.2.2 by Tor,</li>
<li>If user X is a government suspect and the IP he got at the time of doing illegal activity (1.2.2.2) was targeted by the NSA, what would happen to Y when Y retains that IP for a day? Could he be arrested by the NSA  because of having 1.2.2.2 though he claim himself as innocent?</li>
</ol>

<p>This lead the article's author to conclude that Tor is dangerous.</p>

"A weird Tor relay","<p>This might feel funny or you might think I have gone crazy but I want to share this anyway.</p>

<p>Yesterday I have just turned on my Orbot and saw the logs to know what are all the relays I have been connecting with. Here comes a creepy thing, my logs shows the below while forming Tor circuit which I bet could trigger questions to any common man:</p>

<pre><code>Circuit (4) BUILT: NationalCrimeAgency
here comes some checksum like bits then
CLOSED :NationalCrimeAgency
</code></pre>

<p>What Orbot have to deal with NationalCrimeAgency???? It makes me crazy (it should for everybody). I just closed that session and then reopen it then I got different logs like:</p>

<pre><code>Circuit (7) BUILT: beirchangaming
Circuit (8) BUILT: beirchangaming &gt;PirataEsse&gt;blanqui
NOTICE:Tor has successsfully opened circuit........
</code></pre>

<p>You may say it was just a name of Tor rely it is not a real NationalCrimeAgency or whatever. Here the question is I have read in most article say Tor is even difficult for NSA to crack but again the question is what happen if spy agency or hackers with mischievous claw run a Tor relay and spoof all data of innocent peoples which it came across? Are we in the illusion of Tor privacy but not in actual privacy?</p>

"Security for relay on Home network","<p>I want to host a relay to help out the network. I am looking into the possibility of doing it on my home network. Two concerns have come up during my research. The first is I would potentially be using a computer that I currently use has a HTPC. I am wondering how much the information presented on the link below would apply to my situation. Is encrypting the rest of my files necessary? If they aren't necessarily confidential? Would it be unwise to say login to my bank account on this computer once I am running a relay? I guess I am just wondering am I somehow increasing my attack vector if I am running a relay? Or is it just additional attention that makes security important?</p>

<p><a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/OperationalSecurity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/OperationalSecurity</a></p>

<p>My second concern is in regards to having my IP blocked by certain websites. Is there anything I can do to combat this or reduce the effects? From the information I have read it seems like website blocking isn't that widespread but I just I am just apprehensive to run a relay if I might be blocked by websites I need to visit such as my bank. (this might be a poor question feel free not to answer if its too opinionated.)</p>

<p>From what I've gathered it does seem preferred to just rent a VPS and I might consider doing that but I guess I would like to know the viability of using my home network since I have a server already running 24/7.</p>

"How safe are Tor users?","<p>Given that Silk Road was just shut down, an article was published stating that:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Another article - nearly a month older, claims something similar:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not Even Tor Is Safe From The NSA’s Prying Eyes ... The problem boils down to this – around 90% of Tor users are still using older software which can be hacked. The good news is that the latest version of Tor, version 2.4, isn’t believed to be ‘crackable’ by the NSA, as it uses something called elliptical curve Diffie-Hellman ciphers that are thought to be beyond its capabilities at the moment. - <a href=""http://siliconangle.com/blog/2013/09/09/not-even-tor-is-safe-from-the-nsas-prying-eyes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reference</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, another states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users, somebody's going to notice. So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on. - <a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/yes-we-know-about-guardian-article"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reference</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Are the articles referenced above true in their claims?</li>
</ul>

<p>What I can gather from this is that safety boils down to the habits of a user themselves.

"Why isn't there any such option - middle-relay behind NAT?","<p>Why is it still required have two open ports, <strong>DirPort</strong> and <strong>OrPort</strong>, for a relay?</p>

<p>It is obvious that the anonymity of a relay operator, while browsing, is much better than the client's.</p>

<p>This should be enabled by <em>default</em> for high-bandwidth connections.</p>

<p>Why do I point out the possibility of incoming traffic to such a middle-relay? I'm just fortuitously found for myself, that the onion hidden service isn't required in any open ports.</p>

<p>In the same way, with <strong>only one hop</strong>, not a three hops, any relay behind the NAT router would share its bandwidth with the network. That means, the bandwidth of the whole network will grow 100 times and the anonymity of such clients-middle-relays will grow!</p>

"malicious entry nodes & obfs4 briges and DPI censorship","<p>i need to use tor under tight DPI censorship situation.
I need to be able to hide the fact i'm using Tor both from my gvt's DPI GFW and from my ISP.
The only way for me to get Tor working is through the meek_azure bridge (as long as it lasts) or an obfs4 bridge. These supposedly wrap my SSL traffic in a http layer, right, allowing my to bypass the GFW.</p>

<p>Now: how good this really is for hiding me using Tor?
1. how can i be sure the entry node or bridge isn't malicious ? And if it is, what information can it get ? Just my ip address ?
2. what information my ISP or GFW can get when connecting by meek or obfs4. How can i be sure they really don't know this is hiding Tor traffic?
3. if i wanted to be sure, should i use a VPN before connecting to Tor? Are there obfuscating VPNs? 
4. Is there a way to obfuscate my real ip from my ISP (by spoofing)?</p>

"Is it possible to choose a version of TOR that works with a site?","<p>Question from a newbie. </p>

<p>Here's what's going on. I updated to the latest version of TOR, and then at the site I most visit, they would not even recognize the latest version as a ""Firefox"". They asked me to log in again from the previous device I used (which was of course, the same device, but with an earlier version of TOR).</p>

<p>Other issues I faced associated with the latest version: </p>

<p>(1) the network I choose, (after left clicking the blue ""choose a new Tor network"" button once) changes the network not once but 2 times after I press the button, making it difficult to choose a preferred exit node. </p>

<p>(2) Like I mentioned before, the site does not even recognize latest TOR as a ""firefox"", making it difficult to log in. Asks security questions a couple of times, then didn't allow me in.Never happened with earlier versions.</p>

<p>(3) Some of the dialogues like whether I want to block HTTP canvas cookies never show up!</p>

<p>What I did: dumped the latest version of TOR, went back to the TOR 4.5.1 (luckily I had that exe installer file still on the device) and though the site allowed me in, many functionalities at the site are gone. Difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>Question(s): Can I choose to update to a somewhat higher version of TOR, without upgrading to the latest version? </p>

<p>Can I pick and choose which version I want? Is there any place where I can get more recent (but not the latest) installer exe files?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>So is Tor's Bridge-getting system or are we all being spied on?</p>

<li>Any captcha can be cracked through manual human labour</li>

We're behind the Great Firewall of China, which blocks access to all known Tor nodes.

<li>Why can't the Great Firewall be modified to block access to the Tor Project's website? I understand that it uses SSL, thus cannot necessarily be directly blocked, but firewalls can be configured to spoof a DNS request and return an invalid IP address, can they not? This would block users from accessing the Bridge Database and they would not be able to access Tor without someone from outside the firewall sending them bridges in some other way.</li>

"Probability for using a malicious entry-relay with and without Entry-Guards?","<p>Im trying to figure out, what the <strong>probability for choosing a malicious entry-guard, depended on the amount of Relays and the fraction of malicious Relays</strong>, is. </p>

<p>In the <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards"" rel=""nofollow"">tor-faq</a> it says for using NO Entry-Guards:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose the attacker controls, or can observe, <em>C</em> relays. Suppose there are <em>N</em> relays total. If you select new entry and exit relays each time you use the network, the attacker will be able to correlate all traffic you send with probability <em>(c/n)²</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So w/o Entry-Guards its pretty easy: A OP has the probability for choosing a malicious Entry-Relay of <em>(c/n)</em>. </p>

<p>And for using Entry-Guards it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) Thus, the user has some chance (on the order of <em>(n-c)/n)</em> of avoiding profiling, whereas she had none before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that this probability for using Entry-Guards is for NOT choosing an malicious Entry-Relay as a Guard. But this cited probability is not making that much scenes to me. Can somebody explain to me? </p>

<p>Or, to give it a general touch again: Whats the probability for choosing a malicious Relay with the use of Entry-Guards depended on the amount of Relays (n) and the fraction of malicious Relays (c) ?</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I know there is a lot of literature about that topic. Especially the paper ""<em>Changing of the Guards: A Framework for Understanding and Improving Entry Guard Selection in Tor</em>"" is good for understanding up- and downsides of guard-nodes (<a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters"" rel=""nofollow"">This Tor-Blog</a> article is a good place to start, too! And for the start of all this you need to review the paper '<em>Locating Hidden Servers</em>'). 
But all the statistics in the literature I found about it, were differing between variable guard-parameters and what I am looking for is the difference between using and not using guards. I know that there won't be a easy answer, because this differs between just named guard-parameters. But I guess and hope that we can abstract from them.</p>

As soon as I add the ssh socks proxy, I am seeing the following behavior: the first web page usually loads fine; in one of the next pages Torbrowser seems to load forever on some of the elements; after the 3rd or 4th page, it hangs on the entire page, loading forever (well, too long for me to wait anyway). Doing the same with Firefox 52 ESR works fine; only Torbrowser 7 has this problem.</p>

<p>Any ideas why this might happen? Maybe it is due to the socks extensions in tor?</p>

<p>Let me emphasize that I am <em>not</em> trying to run tor over ssh or vice versa. Essentially what I am trying to do is to use an ssh tunnel in place of the tor network.</p>

"Optimal configuration for an obfs4 bridge","<p>In response to the blocking of Tor in even more countries and organisations, I decided to set up a (private) bridge. I would like the bridge to:</p>

<ul>
<li>be accessible to users with strict outgoing connection filtering (in particular, blocking of access to non-standard ports)</li>
<li>be as difficult to discover as possible (consider scanning of known ports for Tor protocol)</li>
</ul>

<p>What would be the configuration of the bridge to best address these goals?</p>

<p>Namely:</p>

<ol>
<li>What numbers to choose for OR and obfs4proxy ports?</li>
<li>Does opening a DIR port on a bridge make sense, and if yes, on which port?</li>
<li>Which ports to forward on the router?</li>
<li>Does using IPv6 provide any benefit over just IPv4?</li>
</ol>

"Clarification of Risks to Anonymity","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AEGF0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/AEGF0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>My goal is to get a clear sense of what is required to maintain anonymity.  In a sense I'm mapping the flow of traffic in my head and trying to understand how certain traffic might interact in ways that aren't obvious.
This is to say nothing for topics such as statistical analysis and analyzing totally disparate traffic streams.</p>

<p>For example, I've seen a number of people answer questions about Tor Browser and P2P and I want to know if I've correctly identified erroneous thinking.  Here's what I've understood:</p>

<ol>
<li>Q: Where does encryption and connection begin? Your ISP is your ISP.  Unless your connection begins elsewhere then that is the point of concern. Tor connection runs encrypted through your ISP. Using other programs in conjunction should generally not affect anonymity of Tor Browser.  Basically all the Tor traffic is anonymous. The traffic from another browser or program may be unencrypted.  Encryption has to begin on the system you are using. So there are several handshakes between different relays.  What does my ISP see?</li>
</ol>

<p>My first concern here is that when I use Test Tor Network settings (about:tor), I do get various IPs that are not assigned by my provider.  However, after entering several urls directly, with Google as search provider, I was directed to a captcha at Google asking to identify as a human, showing my IP.  At first I thought that it was my actual IP but I realized it was various changing IPs including IPv4 and v6 (Onion menu).</p>

<p>I ignored them and I can go to google.com search page with TLS 1.2, but once I enter a search query, whether from this page or url bar, I am directed to either the captcha, or if I ignored the captcha, then I get</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network. Please try your request again later. Why did this happen? (link)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure if I should keep answering captchas identifying my address to Google, or if this is unnecessarily paranoid because I'm just letting Google know that it is legit traffic.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>My connection with my ISP isn't private.  For that would I have to configure a VPN directly from my cable modem, meaning all my headers would look like a connection from me to VPN and that's it?  Or what would this mean?</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>As mentioned any program outside Tor Browser is operating normally.  A lot of people have asked about torrents. This would run from the client and is not private. But I understand PHE (protocol header encryption) options are available for different clients.  </p></li>
<li><p>How are layers added to my anonymity? 1. I'm on my computer 2. using Tor Browser 3. insert VPN 4. What if My VPN is at 2 and Tor is at 3, what does my ISP see?</p></li>
<li><p>I created a mail account I use only with Tor.  All accounts I use are separate from those I use on other browsers.  Although I use a password mgmt pluggin. I think I should also avoid logging in from Tor with the same account.</p></li>
<li><p>What are some ways to analyze my traffic and remain anonymous while doing so?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Realized there is a lot I don't understand.  If anyone could deliver answers in an ordered list to paint a picture of how this works that would be great.  I will continue reading documentation.</p>

<p>Also links are appreciated.</p>

"Circumvent methods when Directory Authorities censored","<p>I recently become interested in researching about the Tor network and as I read, there are 9 directory authorities which are hard-coded into the Tor software and they are like phone-book which gives the client a random list of tor relays and servers and a list of them is also available at : <a href=""https://atlas.torproject.org/#search/flag:authority"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://atlas.torproject.org/#search/flag:authority</a></p>

<p>In other document I read about if all of this Directory Servers become compromised then relays work as a cache to give the clients a list of Tor servers so it is probably not possible to shutdown Tor network completely without Directory Authorities (another article said that clients also have a small cache of Tor Servers addresses).</p>

<p>So my question is what could they do to circumvent filtering of above addresses in countries which completely filter Tor Network traffic ?</p>

<p>In other words what do obfuscation methods (like obfs4) do to get a list of Tor relays and servers when the above hard-coded addresses is censored and the client never talks to Directory Authorities before ?</p>

"How to kill Debian-gdm user processes?","<p>I am using tails under a VM. I am having problems when the keyboard buffer sharing stops working, and I have looked into the process list and I see two instances of the spice /usr/bin/spice-vdagent. One of them is owned by the currently logged in user amnesia and the other is owned by the the Debian-gdm user. And each user has their own Xserver running.</p>

<p>Is this normal? Why doesn't the Debian-gdm user die after login? Is there a way to make it exit? Logging in as root and killall -u Debian-tor helps, but is there another way?</p>

<p>Where I can found documentations or articles similar to the article about lifecycle of a new node?</p>

<p>I check this <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/423/what-are-good-explanations-for-relay-flags"">post</a>. It says for the exit node:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A router is called an 'Exit’ iff it allows exits to at least two of the ports 80, 443, and 6667 and allows exits to at least one /8 address space.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means a new node configure it's machine with these ports open and enough adress, it's become automatically a exit node?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I havn´t used Tor for the last two weeks so I am not sure but assume that the problem could be the Win update.</p>

"How do I take my Tor node offline permanently?","<p>I run a Tor node on a virtual private server, and for various mundane reasons I do not want to continue operating this particular VPS. In other words, I will be removing a Tor node from the network. Are there any steps I should take in advance of shutting down this node for the last time? E.g. any way to advertise to the network that the node will no longer be available? (If there would even be a point to that)</p>

<p>The server in question is not an exit relay at this time, but in general, I'm interested in knowing the answer for both exit and non-exit relays, if there is any difference.</p>

"Daily or monthly traffic limit recommended?","<p>If I can only offer a small amount of traffic e.g. 20 GB per month for my middle relay would you recommend to set a monthly limit or a daily limit?</p>

<p>Setting the traffic limit to 20 GB would mean the relay is running one or two days and hibernating most time of the month. Setting it to 660 MB per day would make it run every day for approx. 2 hours and hibernating the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Would you recommend to set the monthly limit and let TOR do the balancing or give a small daily portion?</p>

"A server behind a physical Tor gateway to hide its location","<p>Is is technically possible to run a server, that is accessible only through Tor via SSH, and be able to hide its physical location from an adversary who happens to gain a root access?</p>

<p>In my world-view a common technique to discover a physical location of a computer is by looking at its ""public"" IP and query a geolocation database. A computer is unable to determine its ""public"" address unless he asks another computer on the Internet.</p>

<p>So is it safe to assume that by placing the server between a physical Tor gateway (i.e. OpenWrt router) and a router I could protect it from being discovered since all traffic would go through the gateway?</p>

"Can Tor connections between hidden services be aggregated using ifenslave? (... and might Mevade be doing this?)","<p>Using ifenslave on two endpoint Linux servers, it's possible to aggregate (aka bond or team) multiple tun or tap interfaces (e.g., tun0, tun1, ...) into a single link, combining bandwidth (less overhead) and improving reliability. SSH or OpenVPN can provide requisite tun interfaces, and either can be routed through Tor between hidden services.</p>

<p>Four questions come to mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>Would this work?</li>
<li>If it would, how many such tun interfaces could be aggregated?</li>
<li>Might this be what all those Mevade bots are doing?</li>
<li>Is this hypothesis about Mevade testable?</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit:</p>

With multiple targets, source servers can push ~200 Mbps. It's obviously not very anonymous. But it's probably more anonymous than using VPN services. That's for servers with gigabit uplinks, by the way. Methods are <a href=""https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSp8p6d3Gxxq1mCVG85jFHMax8pSBzdAyBL2jZxCcCLBL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Tor does not aim to hide the fact that one is using Tor, but it aims for unlinkability. Websites can however try to identify a visitor and then link session by simple technologies such as cookies. Does the Tor Browser or something that gets shipped in the bundle prevent session linking through cookies?</p>

<p>Cookies are familiar to most people, but the browser provides lots of other ways to enable a website to link sessions. Does the Tor Browser or another component prevent session linking through device fingerprinting?</p>
"
"Why is a longer guard rotation period with fewer guards better than the other way around?","<p>Tor introduced guards, which are - oversimplified said - relays the client picks and holds for some time as the first hop, to protect the client against the so-called 'predecessor attack'. Entry guards prevent the client from connecting to the majority of the network in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>Now there's some planning towards increasing the guard rotation period and reducing the number of guards a client picks for that time-frame.</p>

<p>How are fewer guards per client better then more guards? Why is a longer rotation period (a client sticks with its guards longer) beneficial for the client?</p>

  <p>On June 20, 2011 ICANN's board voted to end most restrictions on the generic top-level domain names (gTLD) from the 22 currently available. Companies and organizations will be able to choose essentially arbitrary top-level Internet domains.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to a search on <a href=""https://gtldresult.icann.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://gtldresult.icann.org/</a>, no one tried to register <code>.onion</code> in the last application period. I’m not sure, but I guess ICANN will open the application system again, sometime.</p>

<p><strong>Does the Tor project plan to register the <code>.onion</code> TLD with ICANN?</strong> </p>

<p>Would the Tor project have any privilege to claim this TLD, so that no one else may register it beforehand?</p>

<p>If someone else would register <code>.onion</code> and create domains matching those of hidden services, we’d have two incompatible systems. </p>

For free it offers two important things to the attacker:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nice amount of exit relays</li>
<li>Anonymity</li>
</ul>

<p>The low bandwidth attacks do need neither high bandwidth nor low latency which would be problematic for many other types of DoS / DDoS attacks. On the other side the list of exit relays is known so it makes blocking of an ongoing attack easier.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there any other serious obstacle for such attacks over Tor?</li>
<li>Are there known cases when was the Tor network abused for a successful low bandwidth attack?</li>
<li>Were any counter-measures against such abuse considered? I can imagine for example limiting number of exit-relays a single Tor client can create circuits to though such a limitation could be overcame by modifying the Tor client or running multiple instances of it.</li>

"How are the exit and non-exit packets in the Tor relay system recognized?","<p>Relay setting in Vidalia has two options for relaying: ""for the Tor network"" and ""inside the Tor network"". The options enable relaying either just inside the Tor network or additionally out of the Tor network (exit).</p>

<p>How does the Tor relay recognize if the incoming/outgoing packets are going to leave the Tor network (exit)? Do non-exit packets have a special form different from the exit packets?</p>
"
"Why is the amount of incoming/outgoing traffic different on a non-exit relay?","<p>I noticed something when letting a relay (non exit) run for a few days: The amount of traffic sent is larger than the amount received.
This is confirmed by looking at the tor log and also by looking at <code>ifconfig</code>.
Examples of one day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[...]I've sent 556.92 GB and received 456.66 GB.</p>
  
  <p>[...]I've sent 670.04 GB and received 546.71 GB.</p>
  
  <p>[...]I've sent 861.17 GB and received 687.35 GB. </p>
  
  <p>[...]I've sent 1060.14 GB and received 849.68 GB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is that? From my understanding the relay has to forward any traffic it receives from a client or an entry node to the next relay or the exit. Any reply will also flow through the relay the other way around. Shouldn't the amounts of data roughly match?</p>

"How to protect against DoS but not harm Tor users","<p>Often when websites want to protect themselves against Denial-of-Service attacks, they will limit the number of requests one IP address can make in a given span of time. Sometimes this practice adversely affects Tor users because the high volume of traffic coming from one exit node may look kind of like a DoS attack. Human visitors to this site who use Tor will then get a message telling them that they are not humans at all but vicious attack robots. This is bad for Tor because Tor users doing nothing wrong can't go to sites they like. This is bad for websites too because those websites lose visitors (and clicks). </p>

<p>Is there any way for websites to protect against DoS attacks in a Tor friendly way? Is there any way for Tor traffic to be less DoS-y?</p>

"Are Google’s captchas often downright impossible to solve for Tor users because reCAPTCHA is *lying* to them?","<p><em>(Stack Exchange’s system tells me that my question appears to be subjective and is likely to be closed. But judge for yourself if this is the case.)</em></p>

<p>Do you remember when Google used text captchas only? When you were confronted with them whilst browsing with your normal browser (for example the normal Firefox browser), they were usually pretty easy to solve and did not cost much of your time. But once you were using a Proxy server or a Tor exit node, things <strong>could</strong> have become very complicated. Some text captchas were downright <strong>impossible</strong> to solve because it wasn’t even possible for a human to decipher the letters reCAPTCHA wanted you to enter. Unfortunately, I cannot find an example on the Internet right now which shows how they looked like but they consisted of unreadable computer-generated gibberish – and the characters were distorted to utter disfigurement.</p>

<p>Today, things tend to be different since Google uses its Street View pictures for captcha generation. But the problem still remains to be (pretty much) the same.</p>

<p>That is, when browsing with your normal browser, solving a captcha like this should succeed most of the time:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GD3Jf.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GD3Jf.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>If the squares are numbered as</p>

<pre><code>1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
</code></pre>

<p>, I pick <code>1</code>, <code>4</code> and <code>9</code>.</p>

<p>The next step looks like this</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ig3G.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ig3G.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>and I pick <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>After clicking on <code>1</code>, it looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RuEKH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RuEKH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The captcha has <strong>obviously</strong> been solved <strong>correct</strong> and I click on <code>VERIFY</code>. But what does Google give me as an answer?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiVia.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiVia.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>This happens <strong>more often than not</strong> when using Tor. Sometimes I have to solve four or five captchas in order to proceed. It <strong>rarely</strong> happens during normal browsing.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore</strong>, I suppose that reCAPTCHA is <strong>lying</strong> to Tor users and making it artificially and unnecessarily harder to solve captchas. This has <strong>nothing</strong> to do with “stronger protection mechanisms”.</p>

<p><strong>Do you think that this assessment is correct?</strong> And if it is correct: What can we as Tor users do about it?</p>

<p><a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/1229/how-to-chain-proxy-after-tor/"">This question</a> is very similar, but it doesn't specify browser, and Firefox has too wide of a fingerprinting surface for my application.

<ul>
<li><code>cd Browser; torsocks ./firefox --safe-mode</code> would work in theory if you changed the proxy settings, but in practice, it never actually launches.</li>
<li>Web-based proxies are right out.  I need an SSL handshake with the remote host to even consider conducting business over the network.</li>
<li><code>cd Browser; proxychains ./firefox --safe-mode</code> is liable to leak DNS information, isn't it?  I recall reading that <code>proxychains</code> doesn't use remote DNS resolution, and just runs a regular <code>dig</code> command.</li>

<p>Any suggestions?  If there's something like <code>proxychains</code> that runs as its own proxy server and I can just set the proxy to that in <code>--safe-mode</code> that might just solve the problem, but for the life of me, I can't find that.</p>

"Iterate through List of Exitnodes","<p>I am working on some kind of Exitnode Scanner (Like SoaT from Mike Perry).

<p>I am mostly using Python for this. I use the stem module to get a new identity:</p>

<pre><code>def newc():

        controller.authenticate(PASSWORD)
        controller.signal(Signal.NEWNYM)

<pre><code>proxychains wget ARGS -O PATH URL
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you very much and have a nice day =)</p>

<p>Edit:
So I found 2 possible ways, both not working at the moment. One is using the ""ExcludeExitNode"" option in the torrc. I tried starting tor with ""launch_tor_with_config"" but I will get an error stating that Tor is already running. If I kill Tor, I get no such response anymore.
To workaround this problem, I edit the torrc file and add one line (adding one IP at the end for every iteration). Sending the HUP signal (to make tor reload its config) results in 'received empty socks content'. Any ideas to resolve this?</p>

<p>The 2nd option was going with the .exit (dotexit) address. It tells Tor to use this specific exit node for a chain. Problem here is that Tor needs to resolve it with its own DNS-Server (not the one that my system uses), which I couldn't configure. So I stepped away from this idea as well.</p>

<p>Where Wix is supposed to be an Exit Node in France.</p>

<p>I figured this out by first listing the current circuits inside <code>tor</code>, and then using a script to list down the exit node currently being used (Both by using Stem's API). Since the Exit node being used for my connection was Wix, I figured that this was indeed the circuit being used. </p>

<p>However, suddenly, after a a minute or two, I decide to fetch another request, and this time, the exit node came out to be a node in Germany: </p>

<p>And then when I repeat the request again, Tor switches back to the Wix circuit. Here's an image of that:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GK8AG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/GK8AG.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>When I listed down the circuits at that particular time, I noticed a one-node circuit with this particular (which <a href=""https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/80DCBB6EF4E86A7CD4FBCBDEE64979645509A610"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is listed</a> as a Guard node on Atlas) in the list:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eK1gB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/eK1gB.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>A similar thing (as in a sudden switch between the normal French exit-node being used) happened with another node (named clive above). This node too had a one-node circuit, and in addition it was present as a Guard node in all the other circuits in the list. </p>

<p>Could anyone please let me know what could be going on? Why doesn't Tor's circuit stick to the node in the country that I had specified in the torrc file? Why does it suddenly switch to a node in Germany? Or Lithuania in the case of the other node. Does Tor use one-node circuits sometimes on its own? Does this kind of thing normally happen?</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>EDIT: My torrc file:</p>

<pre><code>## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
## Last updated 22 September 2015 for Tor 0.2.7.3-alpha.
## (may or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
##
## Lines that begin with ""## "" try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just ""#"" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the ""#"" symbol.
##
## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
## for more options you can use in this file.
##
## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc

## Tor opens a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set ""SOCKSPort 0"" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
#SOCKSPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
#SOCKSPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.
ExitNodes {fr}
StrictNodes 1
## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SOCKSPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests that reach a SOCKSPort. Untrusted users who
## can access your SOCKSPort may be able to learn about the connections
## you make.
#SOCKSPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
#SOCKSPolicy accept6 FC00::/7
#SOCKSPolicy reject *

## Logs go to stdout at level ""notice"" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
## you want.
##
## We advise using ""notice"" in most cases, since anything more verbose
## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /var/log/tor/notices.log
#Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
## Send every possible message to /var/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug file /var/log/tor/debug.log
## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
#Log notice syslog
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr

## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
#RunAsDaemon 1

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
#DataDirectory /var/lib/tor

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
ControlPort 9051
## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.

################ This section is just for relays #####################
#
## See https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay for details.

## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
#ORPort 9001
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
## follows.  You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
## yourself to make this work.
#ORPort 443 NoListen
#ORPort 127.0.0.1:9090 NoAdvertise

## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
#Address noname.example.com

## If you have multiple network interfaces, you can specify one for
## outgoing traffic to use.
# OutboundBindAddress 10.0.0.5

## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
#Nickname ididnteditheconfig

## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
## be at least 20 kilobytes per second.
## Note that units for these config options are bytes (per second), not
## bits (per second), and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10,
## 2^20, etc.
#RelayBandwidthRate 100 KBytes  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
#RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KBytes # But allow bursts up to 200KB (1600Kb)

## Use these to restrict the maximum traffic per day, week, or month.
## Note that this threshold applies separately to sent and received bytes,
## not to their sum: setting ""40 GB"" may allow up to 80 GB total before
## hibernating.
##
## Set a maximum of 40 gigabytes each way per period.
#AccountingMax 40 GBytes
## Each period starts daily at midnight (AccountingMax is per day)
#AccountingStart day 00:00
## Each period starts on the 3rd of the month at 15:00 (AccountingMax
## is per month)
#AccountingStart month 3 15:00

## Administrative contact information for this relay or bridge. This line
## can be used to contact you if your relay or bridge is misconfigured or
## something else goes wrong. Note that we archive and publish all
## descriptors containing these lines and that Google indexes them, so
## spammers might also collect them. You may want to obscure the fact that
## it's an email address and/or generate a new address for this purpose.
#ContactInfo Random Person &lt;nobody AT example dot com&gt;
## You might also include your PGP or GPG fingerprint if you have one:
#ContactInfo 0xFFFFFFFF Random Person &lt;nobody AT example dot com&gt;

## Uncomment this to mirror directory information for others. Please do
## if you have enough bandwidth.
#DirPort 9030 # what port to advertise for directory connections
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
## DirPort (e.g. to advertise 80 but bind to 9091), you can do it as
## follows.  below too. You'll need to do ipchains or other port
## forwarding yourself to make this work.
#DirPort 80 NoListen
#DirPort 127.0.0.1:9091 NoAdvertise
## Uncomment to return an arbitrary blob of html on your DirPort. Now you
## can explain what Tor is if anybody wonders why your IP address is
## contacting them. See contrib/tor-exit-notice.html in Tor's source
## distribution for a sample.
#DirPortFrontPage /etc/tor/tor-exit-notice.html

## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor relay, and add the identity
## key fingerprint of each Tor relay you control, even if they're on
## different networks. You declare it here so Tor clients can avoid
## using more than one of your relays in a single circuit. See
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#MultipleRelays
## However, you should never include a bridge's fingerprint here, as it would
## break its concealability and potentially reveal its IP/TCP address.
#MyFamily $keyid,$keyid,...

## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
## to last, and the first match wins.
##
## If you want to allow the same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules
## using accept/reject *. If you want to allow different ports on IPv4 and
## IPv6, write your IPv6 rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules
## using accept/reject *4.
##
## If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end this with either a
## reject *:* or an accept *:*. Otherwise, you're _augmenting_ (prepending to)
## the default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default, which is
## described in the man page or at
## https://www.torproject.org/documentation.html
##
## Look at https://www.torproject.org/faq-abuse.html#TypicalAbuses
## for issues you might encounter if you use the default exit policy.
##
## If certain IPs and ports are blocked externally, e.g. by your firewall,
## you should update your exit policy to reflect this -- otherwise Tor
## users will be told that those destinations are down.
##
## For security, by default Tor rejects connections to private (local)
## networks, including to the configured primary public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses,
## and any public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on any interface on the relay.
## See the man page entry for ExitPolicyRejectPrivate if you want to allow
## ""exit enclaving"".
##
#ExitPolicy accept *:6660-6667,reject *:* # allow irc ports on IPv4 and IPv6 but no more
#ExitPolicy accept *:119 # accept nntp ports on IPv4 and IPv6 as well as default exit policy
#ExitPolicy accept *4:119 # accept nntp ports on IPv4 only as well as default exit policy
#ExitPolicy accept6 *6:119 # accept nntp ports on IPv6 only as well as default exit policy
#ExitPolicy reject *:* # no exits allowed

## Bridge relays (or ""bridges"") are Tor relays that aren't listed in the
## main directory. Since there is no complete public list of them, even an
## ISP that filters connections to all the known Tor relays probably
## won't be able to block all the bridges. Also, websites won't treat you
## differently because they won't know you're running Tor. If you can
## be a real relay, please do; but if not, be a bridge!
#BridgeRelay 1
## By default, Tor will advertise your bridge to users through various
## mechanisms like https://bridges.torproject.org/. If you want to run
## a private bridge, for example because you'll give out your bridge
## address manually to your friends, uncomment this line:
#PublishServerDescriptor 0

<p>What is strange, both <code>dig</code> and <code>host</code> are using the <strong>same functions</strong> with the <strong>same flags</strong>:</p>

<p>dig:</p>

<p>As you can read from my first question, I'm catching DNS-requests with Wireshark on <code>lo</code>-interface. <code>dig</code> to <strong>*.onion</strong> domains - redirected to <code>lo</code> by iptablres well, but other <em>network-tools</em> - not.</p>

<p>Why does iptables redirect works with every other domains, but does not works with <strong>*.onion</strong> and requires <code>nameserver 127.0.0.1</code>?</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>My question may sounds like: Why does <code>nameserver 127.0.0.1</code> exists in TransparentProxy configuration, if iptables already configured to redirect every DNS-request to any IP-address to <code>loop-back</code>:53?</p>

"Xmission Tor node Warrant info?","<p>I have a client who is thinking of switching to Xmission (a local Utah company) for website servers, and was reading a Guardian article about Xmission's stance on privacy, and I'm very impressed.

<p>They have a webpage that shows the requests they get and the outcome, such as but I noticed some of them say ""No Info"" and they're only for anon.xmission.com, which is a Tor ""exit"" node, whatever that means. I don't use Tor, but I'm curious what ""No Info"" means, why it's only for those requests, and what exactly Xmission is doing in regards to that. Are they complying to warrantless searches or are they being honest that they have no info on it? I'm not even sure what info exactly they don't have (contextually). They would know what their response and its outcome would be.</p>

<p>Here's their outcome page: <a href=""http://xmission.com/transparency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmission.com/transparency</a></p>

"Tor & dns cached","<p>On linux with wireshark I saw a lot of dns activity including a request for a site I am pretty sure I visited with Tor browser bundle earlier a few days ago.
Not visited with regular firefox. However dns request made without Tor browser bundle running. Coincidence ? My mistake seeing things not there ?</p>

<p>After looking into the strange (lot of) dns activity it seemed to me it was caused by nscd. After removing nscd from the system, traffic went relatively quit as far as dns. 
Also I set both</p>

<p><strong>network.dnsCacheExpiration</strong> and

That being the case, why the very high count?  Is it a 'legacy' URI that is no longer valid, but being requested by older clients?  (I know it's at least v2 because it's behind /tor/.)</p>

"How to mitigate layer 7 attacks on hidden services?","<p>I've observed the following:</p>

<li>It is not easy to monitor the connections for malicious traffic, like an unusual large number of requests from

"control tor via perl script","<p>I installed <code>tor</code> on a ubuntu-server with the command</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install tor
</code></pre>

<p>and I also installed socks:</p>

<pre><code>sudo cpan LWP::Protocol::socks
</code></pre>

<p>After this i wrote a perl script to read websites using the tor network, which works very well (simplified example):</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use LWP::UserAgent;
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new('agent' =&gt; 'any user agent string'},
);
$ua-&gt;proxy([qw/ http https /] =&gt; 'socks://localhost:9050'); # Tor proxy
$ua-&gt;cookie_jar({});
my $response = $ua-&gt;get('http://www.example.com/');
print $response-&gt;content;
</code></pre>

<p>As said before, this works very well, but there are some servers who block some tor exit nodes. Instead of sending the expected content with http-status <code>200 (ok)</code> they send the status <code>403 (forbidden)</code>. But some minutes later the same server sends <code>200 (ok)</code> together with the expected content, so I'm pretty sure that the problem are exit nodes who's IP addresses are blacklisted.</p>

<p>I know, that <code>tor</code> itself changes the route (and so the exit node) as far as I know every 10 minutes. But in the case, that a server sends <code>403</code> because it has made bad experiences with the concrete exit node that I'm using in this moment, I don't want to wait 10 minutes to get another exit node that hopefully is not blocked.</p>

<p>I want to change my perl script into something like this: </p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use LWP::UserAgent;
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new('agent' =&gt; 'any user agent string'},
);
$ua-&gt;proxy([qw/ http https /] =&gt; 'socks://localhost:9050'); # Tor proxy
$ua-&gt;cookie_jar({});


my $code = 403;
my $content = '';
while ($code &gt; 399) {
    my $response = $ua-&gt;get('http://www.example.com/');
    $code = $response-&gt;code();
    if ($code &gt; 399) {
        #####################################
        #  TELL TOR TO USE A NEW EXIT NODE  #
        #####################################
    } else {
        $content = $response-&gt;content;
    }
}
print $content;
</code></pre>

<p>Note, that this example is simplified: Not all http-status above 400 are usefull to change the route, and there are also some other reasons, that make it necessary to tell <code>tor</code> to use a new exit node.</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>a) How can a perl script tell <code>tor</code> to change its route?<br>
b) What other possibilities are there to control <code>tor</code> from a perl script?</p>

"Location fetch of a website via Firefox while mobile hotspot is ON throghTOR","<p>I understand that for best security Tor needs to be used along with Tor browser. Sometimes I do not use Tor browser and I configure Firefox to use SOCKS5 proxy. The following happened while I was using Tor via a SOCKS5 Proxy with Java scripts etc enabled. I do this <strong>only</strong> when I am not concerned of my privacy. </p>

<p>I had given my PC a wifi hotspot through my mobile phone and I visited this Microsoft Maps link refereed by a Facebook page. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.here.com/directions/mylocation/Bayleaf-Restaurant:6.909295,79.871307?map=6.909295,79.871307,12&amp;ref=facebook&amp;link=directions&amp;fb_locale=en_US"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.here.com/directions/mylocation/Bayleaf-Restaurant:6.909295,79.871307?map=6.909295,79.871307,12&amp;ref=facebook&amp;link=directions&amp;fb_locale=en_US</a></p>

<p>In this link was a request by Firefox that asked if I like to allow my location to be shared with this particular webpage. This webpage was supposed to provide me directions to a dining place.</p>

<p>I curiously pressed ""allow"" and surprisingly the exact location of my home was pointed out. I would still like to emphasize the fact that I was using Tor as a SOCKS5 proxy with DNS too routed.</p>

<p>My laptop does not have a GPS device but my phone which offered the Wifi hotspot did. But effectively, my mobile hotspot which was powered by mobile service provider Dialog has given away my true location to my PC. I am keen to know how this transfer has happened. </p>

<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>P.S: 
I also found out my mobile Wifi hotspot leaks its location to Firefox on laptop via a location service provided by Mozilla as well.
<a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/geolocation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/geolocation/</a>
I was able to precisely get my location (pointing right to my home) from this. </p>

<p>P.P.S: 
I believe this situation is more specific. The mobile phone gets location from a method called cell tower triangulation. I want to know if my mobile phone can leak out its location (which is figured from cell tower triangulation) through its hotspot to Firefox. </p>

<p>Let me please prove my view point that Andriod Wifi Hotspot has leaked my data. 
 1. while being in the same place, I used my home Wifi routers accesspoint to locate my self via Mozillas Geolocation service. The perimeter of my area pointed was extremely large! <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMgxx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wMgxx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Then I did the same while through my Wifi hotspot of the andriod device keeping the home routers Wifi ON. It was pin poiting right at my home. </li>
</ol>

<p>Is this proof that Andriod Wifi hotspots leak location information via Cell Tower Triangulation?</p>

"Data saved in Onion Routers","<p>I’m an aspiring writer, working on a spy-thriller novel with Tor as part of the plot. Is it hypothetically possible to hack an individual Onion Router to discover the location of the previous router?</p>

<p>In the novel, the bad guy will communicate using Tor. The good guy will then discover the bad guy's identity by backtracking through the bad guy’s Tor circuit, hacking each router, one-by-one, until he reaches the bad guy’s computer. It is essentially a ‘treasure hunt’ with Onion Routers as clues.</p>

<p>Moreover, I want the protagonist to physically travel to each router to hack it. That way I can fit in cool locations. For instance, the exit router could be in the mansion of a Russian mobster. So the protagonist travels to Moscow and breaks into the mansion and hacks the router. The exit router then tells him where to find the middle router: an opera house in Vienna. So he goes to Vienna and tries to break into the opera house. Etc., etc., until he reaches the bad guy’s computer.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, is it possible (even hypothetically) to hack each router individually, after the data has been sent? Please help! I realize that this is an atypical request, but I would be grateful for any advice!</p>

<li>Hacker News now shows my username at the top right. I also check the exit node by clicking the onion button.</li>
<li>Close the tab showing Hacker News. Tor Browser is still running with other sites loaded, but no tabs have Hacker News loaded.</li>
<li>Open a new tab, without changing identities, and load <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://news.ycombinator.com</a>.</li>
<li>Hacker News shows my username at the top right. Click the onion button to check the route and exit node: Sometimes no route is shown at all (?!); other times it shows a different route and exit than in step 3.</li>
<li>Check cookies: Tools > Options > Privacy shows: <em>Always use private browsing mode</em> and <em>Accept cookies from sites</em> are both checked. Click <em>Show Cookies</em>, which shows no cookies at all. Also, via NoScript, JavaScript is disabled for ycombinator.com (and no other hosts try to load any JS).</li>

The Chromium Project is open-source, and therefore arguably safe from government interference and backdoors, and user tracking should be a simple matter to remove. The blog post claimed that a good deal of work had been done to this effect, and that if the APIs were completed, the functionality would in fact be much simpler to implement than in Firefox.

<p>CloudFlare and all the similar services are the new-generation of trackers: with the excuse of being protective against all kinds of DoS attacks, they are quickly conquering a very big slice of the internet! And whenever you try to visit a site that they serve, your request will go straight to them first, and therefore logged and shared too. There is no way to block this unless you avoid visiting all the websites it serves, of which there are quite a lot actually....</p>

"Brave Browser's Bundled Tor reveals browser through search, is this a privacy issue?","<h2>Description</h2>

<p>When using private window Tor mode I was surprised to see that Brave passes a browser identifier in the url of the search.</p>

<p>It seems having <code>&amp;t=brave</code> in the url makes identifying the user easier.</p>

<p>Since any tor nodes monitoring the URL address can tell which browser you're using <em>(and Brave currently only has around 5 million active monthly users, of which only a small percentage use Tor)</em>.</p>

<h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>

<ol>
<li>Open private browsing window with tor</li>
<li>Right click on highlighted text</li>
<li>Click on ""Search DuckDuckGo for""</li>
<li>View url and see <code>&amp;t=brave</code></li>

"Does suspending TAILS then removing the USB drive increase security?","<p>Let's suppose my goal is to prevent someone from tampering with my TAILS session while I'm absent from my laptop, and let's suppose that shutting down every time I go for a walk isn't an option.</p>

<p>The lock-screen password is good, but let's suppose that it is not enough for me. There could be a security hole that bypasses the lock-screen or someone could know my password.</p>

<p>Does suspending the laptop then physically removing the USB drive provide better security? On a first glance, it seems pretty secure:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the lid is opened without inserting the USB drive first, the laptop will immediately shut down, and the attacker wouldn't even know why (they could just assume I used the webcam or something else to detect unauthorized persons). </li>
<li>If I notice the laptop is turned off when I come back, I will be alarmed and I can check for signs of tampering or consider buying a new laptop.</li>
<li>If they install a 'fake TAILS' on the laptop and turn it back on, I will notice that all my session state is gone and I will also be alarmed.</li>
<li>If someone wants to open the laptop without triggering shut-down, they'll need to a) know that I am using TAILS in this way, b) own the same brand of USB-drive that I used, and c) know which USB port I plugged the USB drive into. Even after this, they'll still need to break the lock-screen.</li>
<li>Installing a hardware backdoor surely must be a bit more difficult while the hardware is still turned on, and if they ever accidentally open the lid just a little bit, it's game over.</li>
<li>No one can install malware on my TAILS USB if I carry it with me at all times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I missing anything? Why isn't this a widely recommended practice? The only minor downsides that I see:</p>

<ul>
<li>you could accidentally trigger shutdown yourself.</li>
<li>the session RAM can still be read physically on the hardware-level (but this could be prevented if there was an option to suspend to the USB stick instead of to RAM).</li>
</ul>

"Differences between Onion Routing (Public Key) and Tor-Circuit (Session Key)","<p>I have a hard time understanding how a message is transmitted, when the Public Keys are used and when the Session Keys.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tor Client connects to a directory server to get a list of active relays &amp; exit relays with their policies (address, public key). I verify these list.</li>
<li>Tor Client automatically chooses three relays with a compatible exit policy</li>
<li>I start building my Tor-Circuit One-Hop at a time.</li>
<li>I send a <em>Create Cell</em> to the Relay 1 <strong>(Is this encrypted with 1 Layer through the Public Key of Relay 1?)</strong></li>
<li>The First Hop and the Tor Client establish a temporarily Session Key through the Diffi-Hellmann-Key-Exchange</li>
<li>The Tor Client requests Relay 1 to extend his Tor-Circuit with another Hop to Relay 2 <strong>(Is this encrypted with 2 Layers through the Public Key of Relay 1, Relay 2?)</strong></li>
<li>A second Session Key is established between the Tor Client and Relay 2, trough the Tor-Circuit. <strong>(Also encrypted in 2 Layers?)</strong></li>
<li>The Tor Client requests Relay 2 to extend the Tor-Circuit with another Hop to Relay 3 </li>
</ol>

<p>If this step isn't encrypted with 2 Layers (with the PK of Relay 1 &amp; Relay 2), Relay 1 would know the address of Relay 3, or does it encrypt the <em>Create Cell(R3)</em> with the temporarily Session Keys.</p>

<p>If it uses the Session Keys to encrypt why would we need the Public Keys, to identify the Relays?</p>

<p>I thought the Session Key is only used for the response and the Public Keys for the Request, or do I understand something completly wrong?</p>

<p>In my current view the Request has three layers of Encryption with the Public Keys, on each layer it reveals the next target to forward the message. <strong>(but the relay already knows the next target, since it had to establish a tor-circuit)</strong></p>

<p>The request is encrypted at each relay with the temporarily Session Key, the Client then can decrypt all three layers since it established these Key with the respective relay.</p>

<p>I'm no nativ english speaker, so I hope its understandable.</p>

"De-anonymization in Tor, just a matter of time?","<p>Simple question. Doesn't the way Tor works make a de-anonymization more likely the longer you use/run Tor?</p>

<p>From my understanding, you are fully de-anonymized when X controls both Entry Guard Node  and Exit Node.</p>

<p>With the way Tor works, you are tied to a fixed Entry Guard for quite a reasonable time. If you are unlucky, you might get connected to a bad Entry Guard Node owned by X. From now on, it is only a matter of time until you are randomly connected to a bad Exit Node, also in control of X. This is due to Tor keeping the Entry Guard stable for a reasonable time but very frequently changes the Middle- and Exit Node.</p>

<p>Did I made any error in my thinking? If not, unluckily beeing connected to a bad Entry Guard Node would just need a certain amount of time until Tor randomly connects you to the bad Exit Node belonging to the malicious Entry Guard Node.</p>

<p>I hope someone can clarify.</p>

This is due to Tor keeping the Entry Guard stable for a reasonable time but very frequently changes the Middle- and Exit Node.</p>

<p>I have been wondering why Tor doesn't come with a solution for this by default.
For example: If I would be connected to an Entry Guard Node from the UK, wouldn't it be a very smart move to go to</p>

<p>StrictNodes 1 ""

<p>If the destination address given to my next node is its predecessors address, how does the node after know where to transmit the packet afterwards? And how would the Exit relay know to which IP it is to finally route the traffic to?</p>

<p>Could you please recommend a tutorial or a simple explanation online from which I can gain a proper insight about how TCP/IP packet propagation really works in Tor.</p>

"Does Adding or Removing Search Engines in TB's Search Bar Affect Annonymity?","<p>Suppose I add or remove a search engine from Tor Browser's search bar; will my anonymity be compromised?</p>

<p>I've tried to research this by running Panopticlick before and after installing a search engine.  Although my Panopticlick ""score"" (number of bits of identifying information) seems vary a bit every time I run it, even with no changes at all to the browser (the uniqueness of my screen-size-and-color-depth setting changes by a few hundredths of a bit each time, even if I don't alter the setting at all), I see no consistent change in score before and after installing an engine.</p>

<p>This holds regardless of whether installation of the engine entails installing an actual add-on, as, for example, the S3.Google Translator does.  So I conclude that Panopticlick probably is not capable of answering my question.</p>

<p>In the same vein, does adding bookmarks to my TB compromise anonymity?  What about changing a setting, such as the name or location of the download directory?</p>

"Is the Tor project interested in implementing support for Capsicum?","<p>One great new feature of the 0.2.5.x branch is support for Linux seccomp. There is a similar project that's cross-platform (FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, Linux for now) called <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/"" rel=""nofollow"">Capsicum</a>.</p>

<p>It is a project supported by University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, grants from Google, the FreeBSD Foundation and DARPA. Its goals are similar to seccomp, but the Capsicum project utilizes approaches quite different from how seccomp does things, potentially preventing a different set of attacks.</p>

<p>While the FreeBSD implementation is the furthest so far with Linux development  still not being in mainline yet there are a number of applications (ping, tcpdump, gzip, Chromium (wip)) already supporting Capsicum. According to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raNx9L4VH2k"" rel=""nofollow"">a presentation  of the project</a> adding support for Capsicum tends to be easier, than for adding seccomp support.</p>

<p>Is anyone working on this right now? Are there any plans on supporting it? And most importantly is there any reason to not support it?</p>

"Pacimonie and Tor Browser Bundle in Debian","<p>When using Tor in Debian Wheezy for multiple applications, what is the preferred setup?
I have installed Parcimonie (<a href=""https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/parcimonie"" rel=""nofollow"">https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/parcimonie</a>) so GPG gets key updates through Tor. This installed the Debian Tor package as a dependency. However, for web browsing I want to use the Tor Browser downloaded from the official website as recommended by the Tor Project. Since the Tor Browser ships its own Tor binary, will this mean I have two Tor binaries/processes running when I launch the Tor Browser, and if so, will this create any problems, e.g. how will Parcimonie and/or the Tor Browser know which process to pick? I suppose the versions of Tor may even be different. Should I be adding the Tor Project's own package repository or will this further mess things up?</p>

"Using Tor Proxy through other aplications","<p>Before I proceed, I would like to mention that I understand that Tor browser integrates unique features such as not loading certain html canvases, scripts and a whole bunch of additions to make browsing more anonymous. I always use Tor when complete anonymity is required although I don’t use it as my daily driver, yet!</p>

<p>As long as I am <strong>okay revealing my IP</strong> to anybody else, it is tempting to use other applications through Tor proxy as I have a belief doing so prevents my ISP from reading my data that travel encrypted through the Tor network which otherwise are sent/received unencrypted. I also appreciate the special feature that can route all DNS requests through Tor. I believe this feature improves  anonymity by a massive step and stops ISPs from logging where we go on the internet as both data and DNS are encrypted! </p>

<p><strong>Question 0:</strong></p>

<p>Would there be others methods ISPs can use to track where we go on the internet?
(I don’t mean installing spyware or forcibly installing any malware) </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>

<p>If I use Tor proxy 127.0.0.1:9150 through Firefox,Chromium will there be any traffic leaving my browser unencrypted that can be viewed by someone else the middle (MITM)? </p>

<p>As per my knowledge, SOCKS5 + SSL + Remote DNS through Tor Network should encrypt all my Firefox traffic unless evil add ons, Adobe Flash or Java content reject to adhere the SOCKS5 Proxy I forced my Firefox to listen to. Please be kind enough to share your knowledge or correct me in this regard.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>

<p>I understand the Tor browser traffic is more anonymous than the Firefox traffic that uses Tor. 
But is traffic coming out from Firefox (using the Tor proxy) easier to be <strong>decrypted</strong> than the traffic coming of the Tor browser? </p>

<p><strong>Question 3 :</strong> </p>

<p>Would those packets coming out of Firefox too (using SOCKS5 Tor proxy)  will hop through the same Tor circuit with the same exact hops as Tor browsers' traffic?</p>

"sudden change in port number of closest relay when changed to pasing traffic of Firefox through Tor network","<p>I understand to obtain the complete successful results out of Tor, is it mandatory to use Tor browser bundle. But sometimes, for a general user, Firefox is much tempting to use for many reasons as a daily driver and TorBB when complete anonymity id required.  </p>

<p>I have been monitoring my traffic and I’ve noticed some changes when TBB runs and when Tor is used with Proxychains + Iceweasel(firefox).(Note:the entry point may change every 2 weeks approx, comments welcome as to <strong>why</strong>)</p>

<p>When TBB is running the entry point relay always has port: 9001. (the ip changes but it is always on the same port) But when some other application uses TOR network the entry point relay is different from the TBB's. It tries to establish connection on the same ip but a different port.</p>

<p>Usually Proxychains(also privoxy) or firefoxs' TCP/IP packets connect to relay whose port is 443.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> 
What causes this change?</p>

"Reason behind ""clearnet warning"" when posting URL links on onion websites","<p>When browsing onion websites e.g. discussion forums, quite regularly I will encounter links to clearnet http/https addresses along with an explicit <strong>Clearnet Warning</strong> along with the URL. </p>

<p>What is unclear to me is what precisely the warning is referring to. The frequency with which I see it makes me wonder if I'm misunderstanding the threats to browsing with TBB:</p>

<ol>
<li>Perhaps clearnet browsing reflects a threat to anonymity that is not had by ""sticking to onion websites"" only?</li>
</ol>

<p>OR</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Does posting a clearnet link on an onion website give adversaries a new possible vector to exploit and deanonymise Tor users? That is, if the adversary can compromise the server hosting that domain, they have a honeypot for all visitors of this new URL, one which had not existed prior to the new link being created? I presume an individual accessing the URL with an appropriately con</li>
</ol>

<p>OR </p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Does the threat relate to exposing visitors to potential deanonymization via correlational attacks?</li>
</ol>

<p>If explanations 2 or 3 are more correct, is it true to say that the Tor user who first accessed the clearnet URL and posted the link was not vulnerable (at least threat 3), whereas the Tor users who subsequently visit it are? </p>

<p>Moreover, will an appropiately configured TBB e.g. Javascript disabled, mitigate the majority of these dangers from the offset? I apologise for the peculiar question -- from the context in which read them, it seems that posting clearnet URLs is tantamount to a faux pas.</p>

"Stetting up a Tor Bridge in Amazon EC2 - Amazon AWS","<p>Its been around 2 months since I had been using Tor and I am in love with it. </p>

<p>I want to try running a Tor relay using the Amazon EC2 account I signed up today. I am pretty new to this service but after proper understanding of the tutorial on <a href=""https://cloud.torproject.org/#get_started"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.torproject.org/#get_started</a> which isn't exactly up to date with the new Amazon interface but is of course understandable what needs to be done to set up a proper Tor relay I sort of have the need to run a Tor relay.</p>

<p>I am on the free year, so I think running this machine int too hard to afford as Amazon provides 720+ hours of free monthly up time for an instance  for all new user for one whole year. This I believe creates great opportunity for people who cannot contribute to the Tor network with cording to truly support the community. </p>

<p><strong>Question 0:</strong></p>

<p>But the keyword here is 720 hours of up time for one month. This is almost the amount of hours in a month. So for a first year free Amazon user, running a single instance that has Tor in it is all he/she can run for free for a month. Am I right? 
Or is there a way we can run two? i.e. one dedicated to Tor and keep another n ON state? (disregard expenses that might occur on both due to processing which are unpredictable)</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong></p>

<p>I followed the guide provided on the <a href=""https://cloud.torproject.org/#get_started"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloud.torproject.org/#get_started</a>
 and noticed that we are only </p>

<ul>
<li>creating a linux virtual server</li>
<li>Creating Key pairs to SSH the virtual machine later</li>
<li>Applying security settings to allow SSH,HTTPS, 40872 and 52176 ports.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I haven't noticed Installing Tor in any of those steps recommended. So how come allowing these ports will actually Enable me to run a Tor relay? Does any Linux flavor has Tor build in? </p>

<p>Does it mean when I am running Tor in my Laptop (running Tor version 2 which I received for Trisquel version 7 - latest) is actually running as a Tor relay too? 
Yes, I do use the browser bundle whenever complete anonymity is required. I just find it easy and so convenient when Tor automatically loads at system start up without any browser. </p>

<p>Is there a specific flavor required to be chosen During the Amazon Instance creation? I couldn't find the place it was recommended on the previous Tor guide to create a Tor relay. </p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong></p>

<p>I am still understanding Tor and I am a newbie. I also know that Tor works based on encryption and not on trust. So I too would like to run a Tor Exit relay on my Amazon EC2 account. I mean its my server and I think Amazon shouldn't have any problem me running a Tor Exit node on it. yes I know the increased amount of data that it may cause me but If I successfully run it, probably I may have a chance convincing some people who are heavy Amazon users to run exit nodes. 
so the question is, should I follow the same procedure that is provided on the Tor website for creating a Tor Exit relay to prepare a Tor exit instance in my Amazon EC2 account?</p>

## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
ORPort 9001
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
## follows.  You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding


## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
## follows.  You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
## yourself to make this work.
#ORPort 443 NoListen
#ORPort 127.0.0.1:9090 NoAdvertise

## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
#Address noname.example.com

## If you have multiple network interfaces, you can specify one for
## outgoing traffic to use.
# OutboundBindAddress 10.0.0.5

## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
Nickname QwertyCoolGuy

## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
## be at least 20 KB.
## Note that units for these config options are bytes per second, not bits
## per second, and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10, 2^20, etc.
RelayBandwidthRate 100 KB  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KB # But allow bursts up to 200KB/s (1600Kbps)

## Use these to restrict the maximum traffic per day, week, or month.
## Note that this threshold applies separately to sent and received bytes,
## not to their sum: setting ""4 GB"" may allow up to 8 GB total before
## hibernating.
##
## Set a maximum of 4 gigabytes each way per period.
AccountingMax 4 GB
## Each period starts daily at midnight (AccountingMax is per day)
#AccountingStart day 00:00
## Each period starts on the 3rd of the month at 15:00 (AccountingMax
## is per month)
AccountingStart month 11 15:00

"If everyone used Tor, how would websites protect themselves from malicious traffic?","<p>This question came after seeing CloudFlare captchas, forums outright banning Tor IPs to protect themselves from malicious traffic, and all manner of hurdles where sites simply don't want Tor traffic.</p>

<p>This gave me a theoretical question - if everyone was using Tor, and sites couldn't distinguish between users based on IP, how would they protect themselves from spam and malicious traffic? Would they simply have to accept that there is nothing they can do?</p>

<p>Or would it be in such an alternative reality world that you need to enter a captcha for every site you visit?</p>

<p>I found some similar questions, such as <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/476/how-to-protect-against-dos-but-not-harm-tor-users"">How to protect against DoS but not harm Tor users</a> and <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/3537/how-to-best-help-site-operators-protect-themselves-from-tor-based-abuse"">How to best help site operators protect themselves from Tor based abuse?</a>, but I believe that mine is a little different because I'm curious what would be done in a theoretical scenario where everyone uses Tor, so blocking it is not an option.</p>

"Orbot VPN App on Android Keeps Restarting","<p>MODS: If you want this on Android Enthusiasts, please migrate.</p>

<p>I am using the Orbot Tor VPN app on Android, and periodically while browsing, I will get a system message at the bottom saying ""App Restarted"". Then: ""Cannot Establish VPN (App Not Prepared)"". The app thenrestarts, and traffic resumes through the VPN according to the onion icon in the system panel. I have not run any tests, but it seems to happen when the processor/ram gets overwhelmed. I imagine this is beyond my control, so my primary question is about data leakage, and there is a secondary for any recommendations on how to fix or prevent this from happening, short of an update.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I am browsing a site while this happens, does data leak out in the time it takes to restart the app? Either to the website or to the ISP?</li>
<li>What may be causing this? RAM, resources, conflicting apps?</li>

"How can Wget be configured to work with Torify securely?","<p>How can I find out how to configure wget to work securely with torify? The official documentation for doing it seems outdated.</p>

<p>I'm using Ubuntu Linux 16.04, with tor installed from the repositories, but using the stand-alone browser bundle is accepteable as long as it can be used through the command line/scripts.</p>

<p>I know that I can use <code>torify wget [url]</code> and it will download file/s, and I know that using the suggested method from this post <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/95910/command-for-determining-my-public-ip"">(getting public IP address)</a> that running this:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://ipinfo.io/ip -qO -
</code></pre>

<p>and then running this</p>

<pre><code>torify wget http://ipinfo.io/ip -qO -
</code></pre>

<p>do successfully return different IP addresses.</p>

<p>But a lot of sources always imply that it's not that simple and other identifying information could be leaked by wget.</p>

<p><a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Misc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This link</a> (which seems official) specifically mentions <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Misc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">configuring wget for torify</a></p>

<p>There it says for Unix/Linux to edit <code>/home/user/.bashrc</code> and add these lines:</p>

<pre><code>http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8123/
HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
export http_proxy HTTP_PROXY
</code></pre>

<p>And then it says to edit <code>/etc/wgetrc</code> and add these lines:</p>

<pre><code>http_proxy = http://localhost:8118
use_proxy = on
</code></pre>

<p>But doing that causes <code>torify wget</code> to fail with this error:</p>

<pre><code>Connecting to localhost (localhost)|127.0.0.1|:8118... [Sep 06 21:55:50] WARNING torsocks[3680]: [connect] Connection to a local address are denied since it might be a TCP DNS query to a local DNS server. Rejecting it for safety reasons. (in tsocks_connect() at connect.c:186)
failed: Operation not permitted.
Retrying.
</code></pre>

<p>I really have no idea what that error message or those config lines mean. What do they mean? Is this still the right way to configure wget for use with torify? Because really the main problem here is that <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Misc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the link</a> that recommends those configurations clearly states that that is all <strong>""Old Advice (outdated).""</strong></p>

<p>Is there any new, <strong>up-to-date</strong> advice?</p>

<p>What about Tails? Is any of this configuration necessary to make wget work securely running in Tails?</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that I don't know much about advanced networking and the inner workings of tor. Beginner-friendly advice would be preferred, but any information would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

"Simple questions about logging in to sites over Tor","<p>I'm a Tor newbie that wants to use Tor to log in to a few communities online, and I have a few questions about the safety of it. Before you say anything, I won't use sites like Facebook that know my real life identity, or sites that are very important (like online banking). I'm generally not doing anything too interesting over Tor and don't expect to be especially targeted by hackers or law enforcement.</p>

<p>As I understand it, when logging in to a website, my username and password can be stolen when I send them through Tor. What is the likelihood of this, and steps can I take to minimize such risk?</p>

<p>If I change my password immediately after logging in, will that prevent hackers from getting in, or will Tor continue to transmit these details while I use the website?</p>

<p>I understand Tor reroutes my traffic every 10 minutes. Will this also re-transfer my details, making it more likely to get routed through a malicious node the longer I stay on the site? Can I prevent re-routing, so that only 1 exit node can potentially see my details, instead of 100+? Besides, some websites automatically log out if the IP address changes, which is just annoying.</p>

<p>Can I store a cookie with my login details on my computer, so that I don't have to log in every time I start the browser? I understand that this will somewhat reduce my privacy.</p>

<p>Or would it be better to leave the Tor browser running throughout the day, so that I only have to log in once? Would that not compromise my anonymity, in other words, the longer I stay on the site, the more likely the NSA or someone else will connect the start node and the end node?</p>

"Additional Tor security at the client's network perimeter","<p>I have been studying Tor and its related security issues recently, and have some questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Aren't the most effective recent attacks on Tor, actually attacks on the browser (or plugins), rather than the Tor network itself?  My understanding is that the recent exploits involve a script or malware forcing the user to make a direct connection outside of Tor, using his or her own IP address.  Following this, </p></li>
<li><p>Couldn't these attacks be prevented by using a packet filter at the network perimeter?  In other words, whitelist the Directory Authorities and the entry node, and block everything else at the client's network perimeter.  I've tried getting Tor to operate this way and it seems functional, once the TBB loads the relay list and makes an initial connection.  If I enable the filter before starting Tor, however, then the relay list doesn't populate (Vidalia), and the connection doesn't initiate.  Finally,</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a way to configure Tor such that it will operate automatically upon startup through a packet filter like this, without having to temporarily disable the filter to get it started?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Something like this wouldn't defend against end-to-end timing correlation attacks, but my questions concern security on the client's end of the network.</p>

<p>Edit (09_15_2016):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Yes, I understand that the network itself is going to be a weak point that can't be solved by a security appliance at the client's end of the network.  I have tremendous respect for our friends at the 3-letter acronym agencies, and have no sympathy for the people snared in the described sting operations.  At the same time, I'm concerned that the attack was too easy.  I believe that uncovering a user's identity should be costly enough in resources and effort that it will cause law enforcement to think twice before attempting it.  It shouldn't be a trivial operation that can be carried out on large numbers of people on a whim.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm reading this carefully to make sure that I understand.  Yes, I see now that I overlooked the obvious direct connection between the client and the directory authorities.  Good catch.  If traffic to any one of them could be viewed, then the connection itself could be used by malware to encode information, revealing the client's IP address.  I've used Tor before with only one directory authority white-listed.  In this case, I suppose the malware would have to signal to all nine DA servers, and the attacker would have to hope that the server(s) they could see would be the one(s) that is(are) white-listed.  The direct connection to a DA server is a weakness, since there are only 9 of them, they are well-known, and hard-coded into Tor.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a follow-up question for you:  After loading the relay list on startup, is it possible to block access to all the DA servers?  Would this prevent Tor from building new connections properly?  Unfortunately I can't test this right now (haven't gotten approval from IT to run Tor yet).  If it works, then this would force such possible malware to try other means for signaling.  It could try identifying the guard node from within the system (if the compromised system is the same one running Tor or handling the network connection) and then exfiltrating this information and compromising the server's connection as before; or alternately by signaling to all guard nodes, with the attacker hoping that he's monitoring the one that happens to be white-listed (there are a lot more guard nodes than DA servers).  Am I missing anything in this scenario?</p>

<p>In the interest of disclosure, we (at work) are looking into what we can offer the Tor community.  I'm doing some initial background research to see if we can justify putting internal funding towards it.  Initially the thought is to start at the client network perimeter with a hardened packet filter, then progress inward incrementally towards a stripped down and custom hardened OS.  Obviously I still have a lot to learn.</p>

<p>Edit (09_15_16):</p>

<p>I think you're judging me too harshly.  I wouldn't be entertaining this project if I liked the way things were being done.  If everyone who accessed Freedom Hosting was filtering their network connections like we're discussing, then probably none of them would've had their IP addresses snagged, even with an outdated TBB...on Windows no less.   At the same time, Tor is about freedom of speech and association to me, not the freedom to trade dirty pictures of children.  I don't like to discuss this, and I really wish I knew better examples of a Tor user's local network or system (not the Tor network as a whole necessarily) being compromised that didn't involve these indefensible scenarios.  Any ideas?  Both you and I know that the same types of attacks can (and will) be used in the future, but against journalists, people with unpopular opinions, people who generally desire privacy, government agents themselves, and so on.  I'm trying to prevent current exploits, and even ones that haven't been discovered yet.  I can't go to upper management with Freedom Hosting as an example, though.  I'd feel personally nauseated doing that, and I'd get some strange looks anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm going to try Tor on my home system to do some testing.  I'll be using the access control list on my firewall router as the packet filter.  I moved out to the boonies, and only have limited broadband wireless on a hotspot.  However, I can run Tor on computer #1, connect to computer #2 through the router, and then route the traffic through computer #2 to the wireless interface.  At least I hope I can do that...

"Anonymity considerations of HTTP referer field","<p>I was just reading about security risks associated with the referrer field and the ticket generated on Tor to probably disable it for anonymity. But I don't really understand the security risks. I have two questions, both concerning the unlinkability property in anonymization.</p>

<p>Scenario 1:</p>

<p>Let's say I'm using Tor and I go to site A and we are both using HTTPS. The communication between my computer till Exit Node is encrypted by Tor and from Exit Node to website is encrypted using HTTPS. No one can know I'm visiting website A and website A doesn't know my identity. </p>

<p>Now I go from website A to B, website B will know I came from A due to the referrer field. But it wouldn't know my identity. So no linkability. How would this jeopardize my anonymity?</p>

<p>Scenario 2:</p>

<p>Consider Scenario 1 using HTTP. Now data sent should be considered compromised as any one can see it between Exit Node and Website A. But what about my identity? If I don't reveal my identity in the data, they don't know with whom to associate it with. So still no linkability. Am I right?</p>

"How to check if Tor is working and debug the problem on CLI?","

<p>I have installed Tor on a command-line only environment without the browser, so I can't use <code>check.torproject.org</code> with a browser. Tor is used by a script to request data from clearnet.</p>

"Connect directly with Tor Browser (as in, bypass Tor)?","<p>I recently decided to pay for CryptoStorm anonymous VPN as an extra layer to my privacy protection - so that all requests including UDP requests are automatically masked.

<p>However, I would still like to use the Tor browser, as it takes care of many other security concerns - like protection from WebRTC detection and other JavaScript-based vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Is there any way to run the Tor browser without proxying through Tor? I tried setting ""No proxy"" in the network settings, but it just says ""Unable to find the proxy server"" - suggesting the browser is hard-wired to run through the Tor proxy.</p>

"Can Tor make your browsing faster?","<p>Especially using OrBot on the phone Tor sometimes feels faster. Since I am not sure on how to really measure this I have been thinking about what the reason for this could be.</p>

<p>I have the following theories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Everything goes over a single connection and using fewer connections speeds up things, if the exit node is better in handling this.</li>
<li>The exit node might have a DNS cache that already knows about the hostname I am looking up. Potentially it even has an HTTP cache, speeding things up further.</li>
<li>The connection from me through the circuit and eventually  to the website I am accessing is a better path than from me directly to the website. This could potentially be due to the connections between the data centers of the nodes (special lines).</li>
<li>Stuff that Tor or the Tor Browser blocks or requests that don't have responses, because they block Tor.</li>
<li>OrBot/The Tor Browser take fewer resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Has any research been done on that? Are any of those clearly impossible? Is there a good way to measure that? Just doing a small script testing download speed is probably not enough, most websites load a lot of resources, sometimes even third party. Has this probably been measured by OONI? Is there maybe a project related to making Tor faster that analyzes this?</p>

"Can a client accessing a Tor service bypass a firewall, and if so, why is it possible?","<p>I was reading this article ""<a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/nine-questions-about-hidden-services"" rel=""nofollow"">Nine Questions about Hidden Services</a>"". It's an interview with an individual who develops hidden services for Tor.</p>

<p>One of the questions (#4) is ""Do you run an onion service yourself?"" and part of the developers response to this is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, onion services have a property called NAT-punching; (NAT=Network
  Address Translation). NAT blocks incoming connections;it builds walls
  around you. Onion services have NAT punching and can penetrate a
  firewall. In my university campus, the firewall does not allow
  incoming connections to my SSH server, but with an onion service the
  firewall is irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I am interested about the claim that an onion service can penetrate a firewall.</p>

<p>Looking at the developers answer, it seems to me that he is talking about a situation where we have:</p>

<ol>
<li>Server A. This one is on an internal network and runs a Tor hidden
service.</li>
<li>Server B. This one runs a firewall that controls access between the
internet and Server A.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on that the developer says that the firewall is ""irrelevant"", it seems like <em>regardless of the settings on the firewall</em>, the Tor service can be accessed through the internet. To me this seems ridiculous but maybe I am wrong in something.</p>

<p>The questions I wanted to ask:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it true that the Tor service can bypass a firewall, and if yes,
why is that?</li>
<li>If the Tor service can bypass a firewall, how can that be mitigated?</li>

So if I am correct list of Onion routers(OR's) are loaded on client and payload is encrypted and encapsulated, layer by layer. So does that mean if we have 2 OR(OR 1 and OR2) then packet is like [[[[payload]OR2 to D]OR1 to OR2]S to OR1]</p>

<p>Am I right? Also, Is it technically correct statement that we have tunneled multiple times according to OR numbers. I mean is tunneling of packet is technically correct or only term encapsulation can be used?</p>

"What does the logged Tor warning ""Onion address foo requested from a port with .onion disabled"" mean?","<p>I am experimenting with different ways to Torify DNS requests for applications that do not support SOCKS5's <code>RESOLVE</code> or SOCKS4a, themselves. One simple way to do this is to configure Tor itself to resolve DNS requests using <code>DNSPort 127.0.0.1:53</code>, then tell your system that its DNS resolver is the <code>localhost</code> (with <code>echo ""nameserver 127.0.0.1"" &gt; /etc/resolv.conf</code> or whatever is appropriate for your operating system).</p>

<p>In doing so, and then tailing my Tor's logfile (having been configured with <code>SafeLogging 0</code> and <code>Log notice file /tmp/tor.log</code> or similar), I noticed that each time an application that doesn't explicitly use SOCKS4a or SOCKS5 with remote DNS resolution requests DNS resolution of a <code>.onion</code> address, a line appears in my Tor log like this:</p>

<pre><code>[warn] Onion address FOO requested from a port with .onion disabled
</code></pre>

<p>I'm aware that <code>.onion</code> addresses actually don't have IP addresses associated with them (of course) but I still don't understand exactly what the warning means and, oddly, searching for the log output text produces exactly 0 results on various popular search engines.</p>

<p>Thus, two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What does the warning mean to Tor? And is there a way to configure Tor so that one ""enables"" the <code>.onion</code> on this ""disabled"" ""port""…whatever that means?</li>
<li>Also, is there a way to change Tor's behavior regarding this apparent configuration.</li>
</ol>

"Why TOR is considered like asynchronous?","<p>I read a article that describes the caracteristics of anonymous communication protocols.</p>

<p>One of their is the synchronization. A protocoles can be asynchronous or synchronous.</p>

<p>This is the definitions on the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A connection is asynchronous if the establish-
  ment of connections and relaying of messages is
  initiated by a user without any timing coordination
  with other participants.</p>
  
  <p>Connections are synchronous if they begin and
  end at specific timings and messages are also re-
  layed at specific moments in time, based on some
  timing coordination between network entities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Authors claims that TOR is asynchronous but I don't understand why?</p>

<p>TOR is a anonymous network for application in real time like browsing or IRC.It can not be asynchronous for this reason.</p>

"Gmail and Yahoo access using Tor","<p>I used the firefox add-on ""Export Import Cookies"" to import cookies and logs into email accounts like gmail and yahoo with Tor Browser 6.5 successfully, but that does not work in Tor Browser 7.05. In Tor Browser 7.05 I tried the ""cookie Wizard with Witelist"" add-on for import cookies and although cookies are imported, websites behave as if cookies do not exist and I can not get into my email accounts. I can not use a phone number to login because that breaks my anonymity. I need to import some cookies to enter the email accounts using different IPs because without those cookies the security of the email prevents the login if the IP is not the same used in the creation of the account. I do not understand why cookies are successfully imported by the ""Cookie Wizard with Whitelist"" but Tor Browser and the sites behave as if cookies were never imported. I can see imported cookies in ""preferences> privacy> Show Cookies,"" but the sites can not find them. I tested the same add-on on firefox-esr 52.3.0, which is the basis of Tor Browser 7.05, and I was able to import cookies and log in to email accounts normally. Can anyone tell me how to import cookies using Tor Browser 7.0.5? Does anyone have any other ideas on how to access yahoo and gmail email accounts using Tor Browser?

<p>First, I assume (please tell me if I correct or not) that a new set of guards is selected each time a user initiates a Tor session, so the remarks about retaining guards for periods of 6 to 12 months would suggest that some Tor sessions are of extremely long duration. Is that correct, and are there any statistics about the distribution of duration of Tor sessions?</p>

<p>Second, there are several warnings, in other Tor guides, not to mix different identities in the same Tor session. I understand that to mean that, if I use a pseudonymous identity of Frank in one session and access websites that recognize me as Frank, then I should not also use the pseudonymous identity of George (to access the same or different websites) in the same session. Again, is that correct? </p>

<p>Third, how does one reconcile the apparent desirability of maintaining guards (and, therefore, presumably a session) with the ""don't mix identities"" warnings.</p>

<p>I would very much appreciate some clarification both of whether my understanding is correct and of the apparently competing risks/benefits. Alternatively, if there are particular documents that I should read to clarify a misunderstanding or to answer my own question, then I would appreciate a pointer to those docs.</p>

"Tracking User Location using Entry Guards?","<p>Let's say that someone moves a Tor instance [1] from one internet access point [2] to another one. And let's say that an adversary is logging traffic from both access points. The adversary could log, that some user Tor client has chosen X entry guards out of Y available entry guards.</p>

<p>How unique is that Tor instance's set of entry guards?</p>

<p>When the user moves to another internet access point, couldn't the adversary be pretty sure, that it's the same user?</p>

<p>This is getting problematic if the adversary can at some point link the identity of a specific user to a set of entry guards, because the adversary can now monitor from which location this user connects to the Tor network?</p>

<p>Would it be better to have a separate installation of Tor (and therefore set of entry guards) per internet access point?</p>

"How to connect to a remote socket through Tor in Python?","<p>Using normal sockets I can stream a list of numbers (updated every second) from a server to a client. This works perfectly fine. Now I want to do the same using Tor.

So from that starting point, I tried to build a piece of code that connects to a remote socket through Tor like this:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import socks
socks.setdefaultproxy(socks.PROXY_TYPE_SOCKS5, ""127.0.0.1"", 9050, True)
#s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s = socket.socket = socks.socksocket
s.connect(('&lt;the ip address here&gt;', 46956))
s.sendall('Hello world')
print(s.recv(1024))
</code></pre>

<p>If I uncomment line 4 and comment out line 5 it all works fine, but running it like this results in an error saying: <code>TypeError: unbound method connect() must be called with socksocket instance as first argument (got tuple instance instead)</code>.</p>

<p>So my question: What am I doing wrong here? How can I connect to this remote socket through Tor?</p>

<p>Also two other questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there no better way of doing this? By using <code>stem.socket</code> for example?</li>
<li>How would I be able to build the public socket that I want to connect to, using a Tor hidden service?</li>

"Is there a way to defend oneself against a timing attack?","<p>Is there a way for an end user to protect oneself against the timing attack when using Tor?</p>

<p>For those, who are not familiar with it, a timing attack involves an adversary populating the Tor cloud with the nodes under their control, with the goal to likely be the first node that you contact and also be the exit node. The latter part is actually made easier by Tor, since it allows people to opt-out from being an exit node. With such a setup, the adversary begins to record times that you send a packet and also the time when the request packet leaves the exit node, and perform statistical analysis on your traffic and the traffic of the requested resource with the tor network.</p>

<p>Is there a way to introduce an artificial delay or some other mechanism to make a statistical analysis more difficult?</p>

Lets say the attacker <em>Bob</em> uses a 5 ORs, each 1MB/s bandwidth (total bandwidth 5 MB/s).

"How to tell my Tor Browser to use a certain relay as entry point?","<p>I am running a Tor relay on a remote server that is hosted in a professional server farm about 1000 km away from my home.

Both of these anomalies go away if I do anything to resize the window, or even just minimize and restore the window (forcing a redraw) - so the inconvenience is minor, but still, this shouldn't be happening.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DJRZs.png"" alt=""with CTR""></p>

<p>This screenshot shows the changes after installing the Classic Theme Restorer extension and restarting.  First, note that the window is considerably shorter than on the first run; this has nothing to do with CTR and happens on the second run even when the first run is shut down without doing anything.  Why can't Tor Browser properly save and restore my desired window height?  Second, notice that the blank spaces at bottom and right still appear, even now that CTR is creating a new toolbar at the bottom of the window.  Third, notice that the old style of main menu button at upper left that was recreated by CTR does not appear to have enough room for the words ""Tor Browser"".  (Unlike the others, this particular anomaly never does resolve itself, no matter what I do.)  Am I doing something to cause these strange behaviors?  Is there something unusual about my computer that could be causing them?  Is there some sort of incompatibility between Tor Browser and CTR that I'm not aware of?</p>

"Tor can't connect to localhost hidden service","<p>So I just downloaded Tor and I'm trying to set up a hidden service. Not going so well. I'm using Savant web server, and can open up 'localhost' on Chrome, but I put:</p>

<pre><code>HiddenServiceDir C:\Users\Sellar\tor_service
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
</code></pre>

<p>in my torrc file, started up Tor again(Browser bundle, no Vidalia), tried connecting to the hostKey it gave me(and it did give me one), but it says firefox is unable to establish a connection to the server at localhost. I set Savant to localhost and port 80.
Is there something I can change to make this work? is 127.0.0.1 supposed to be my IPv4 or Default Gateway or something, or is it always 127.0.0.1? Anything else that comes to mind that might help?</p>

"Google Play Store detects wrong IP address when using Tor","<p>I use Tor when accessing the Play Store. I have Tor to use US exit nodes only and I've confirmed by looking up my IP while using Tor that I indeed have US IPs. However, when accessing Play Store, Play Store seems to think my IP is from somewhere else -- sometimes it shows prices in euros, sometimes in British pounds, or non-US dollars. What is going on? Why am I not getting US version of Play Store even though I have US IP addresses?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>My configuration includes</p>

<p>ExitNodes {us}</p>

<p>StrictNodes 1</p>

<p>ExcludeNodes {all CC except US}</p>

<p>UPDATE2:</p>

<p>For example, with an exit node with IP address of 204.17.56.42, Play Store is showing me the wrong price for <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a22neko.noisep&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a22neko.noisep&amp;hl=en</a> -- it isn't showing US price of $5.00. On the other hand, exit node with IP address of 162.218.68.130 is showing the proper US$5.00. What the hell is going on?</p>

"Is it safe to stop using Tor after illegal activity? Other security questions I cant find answers to","<p>Is it safe to stop the Tor browser and network, and start using something like internet explorer or google chrome after? Like If I accidentally saw cp and deleted Tor and then started using my normal internet and browsers am I at risk for being caught or getting in trouble etc.? If me and my brother use a laptop each (as in 2 total) and I have Tor and am buying drugs, and he is not and is watching youtube or searching google , am I at risk? LASTLY something particularly worrying happened, after browsing with Tor for a day, I stopped, deleted it, and went back to google chrome and my un hidden use of internet, I went to youtube and noticed all the recommended videos and channels, they were specifically from genres or themes of the sites I had visited, like completely japanese channels and videos, about guns, and various things I had searched about while using Tor... *note I never used google,fb, gov sites or anything like that. So is this a sign I compromised myself somehow leaking my IP address? The recommendations were from only what I did on Tor. Am just lucky not to have been spotted by authorities? </p>

"Relay cell size moving backward","<p>I have been studying the papers on Tor and Onion Routing for my thesis and I have been trying to figure out how the whole cell size works.</p>

<p>In the OR paper it is made clear that when a cell moves in the forward direction, every time an encryption layer is removed, the size is kept the same with the use of padding. This is not mentioned clearly in the Tor paper, but I believe that it is the same there as well.</p>

<p>How does it work in the opposite direction (backward)? In the OR paper it says that in every node, an encryption layer is added on the cell and the initiator receives a cell with multiple layers of encryption. But, is there a use of padding here as well, in order to maintain the size? And how do it work for the second and third node?  Do they remove padding in order to add a layer of encryption?</p>

"Track Tor circuit via ISP logs","<p>I have some question about the very basics of tor, as this keeps bugging me now for some time:</p>

<p>As far as I know every tor node is only aware of the ip address of the following node. For example the guard node knows where the next relay is, but does not know the exit node (as this information is hidden from it by encryption). The same holds true in the other direction, i.e. from exit node to guard node. This ensures that if let's say somebody gets access to the exit node the actual origin still remains hidden.</p>

<p>Now imagine the following scenario:
All three nodes lie within countries where let's say law enforcement or agencies are known to cooperate (maybe the EU). Let's also assume that there is very little traffic over these nodes. Isn't it then possible for an attacker like law enforcement to first acquire logs from an Internet Service Provider for the exit node, figure out to which ip the exit node sent data in a specific time frame, then check the logs for the second node and so on? Does anonymity in this scenario depend on the amount of traffic making correlations in ISP logs difficult or impossible?</p>

Reading this
(<a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#AddTorWorks"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en#AddTorWorks</a>) my
understanding is - there is no bigger difference if I use Tor Browser
via tails or xp win if we are talking about the very fact of visibility
usage of Tor Browser - is just visible that someone, somewhere uses it -
correct me if wrong?</p>

<p>So in that case I wish to configure Brige Relays in my USB Tails Tor
Browser - following this path, it is necessary to hide the fact Tor
Browser - Yes or No?</p>

<p>Then adding bridges in Tor Browser when Tor does work in Tails is not
possible since there is no possible to open Tor Browser's Network
Settings - it shows only: New Identyty, Seciurity Settings, Check for
tor browser update.</p>

need to set briges relays to hide fact of usage.</p>

"Why is the pub-key of diffie hellmann from Alice (OP) to Bob (OR) encrypted?","<p>For building a circuit Alice contacts Bob (OR) and send her pub diffie-hellmann key encrypted with Bobs pub key. Bob sends his public-diffie-hellmann key and the session key hashed (""only"" TLS encrypted...) back to Alice.</p>

<p>Encrypting the diffie-key with Bob public's key makes some kind of authentication because only Bob can know Alice public secret and calculate the correct hash. Why is it done that way? In my opinion it is against the diffie-helllmann protocol where p,g,g^(a) are public and authentication is done by signing.</p>

<p>Bob could just sign the answer and everything would be the authenticated.</p>

<p>Could this be some kind of ""proof-of-work"" to harden against ddos attacks?</p>

"Increasing number of middle relays weakens the anonymity?","<p>Tor nodes build encrypted TLS sessions between neighbors to multiplex circuits of users. Multiplexing helps to anonymize users (?).</p>

<p>With an increasing number of middle relays multiplexing becomes rare (because Guard nodes... and Exit nodes are some ""predefined"" set). </p>

<p>Can it happen that with an increasing number of relays (often middle relays) timing attacks become much stronger? (maybe I could use netflow, etc. ...) Extrem case: each circuit has it's own middle relay.</p>

"Does Tor still monitor ""shadow"" relays?","<p>I've been researching methods to monitor hidden services for a university project. I came across <a href=""https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this paper</a> which talks about injecting relays as hidden service directories to gather onion addresses. To make this affordable, the researchers take advantage of what they call ""shadowing"". </p>

<p>From the paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, by inspecting the Tor source code we noticed
  that while only two relays per IP appear in the Consensus,
  all running relays are monitored by the authorities; more
  importantly, statistics on them is collected, including the
  uptime which is used to decide which flags a relay will
  be assigned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would allow them to get the necessary flags to get the HSDir flag for more than two relays on a single IP.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our approach is based on shadow relays described
  in the previous section. An attacker can use this artifact of
  Tor’s design as follows. She can rent 50 IP addresses and
  run 24 relays on each of them for 25 hours thus running
  1200 Tor instances in total; 100 of them should appear in
  the consensus. The fingerprints of the public keys of the
  relays should fall into every second gap in the fingerprint
  circle. At the end of 25 hour time period all of the relays
  will have HSDir flags but only 100 of them will appear in
  the consensus and the rest will be shadow relays. The idea
  is to gradually make active relays unreachable to the Tor
  authorities so that shadow relays become active and thus
  gradually cover all gaps in the circular list during 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was wondering if this technique is still possible given that the paper is from 2013 and this might have been patched since then.</p>

<p>Additional question:</p>

<p>Now that the ""stable"" flag is a requirement to get the HSDir flag, how long does a relay need to run in order to get the HSDir flag?</p>

<p>From the Tor documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Stable"" -- A router is 'Stable' if it is active, and either its Weighted
     MTBF is at least the median for known active routers or its Weighted MTBF
     corresponds to at least 7 days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that 7 days of uptime is not a requirement for the ""stable"" flag?</p>

The patch is attractive because it is so easy to implement: simply apply the patch to both the OpenVPN server and the OpenVPN client and add a single, identical option to the configuration files for each. Using obfsproxy is more complicated because it involves running another, separate program on both the server and the client.</em></p>

"How would I block exit nodes correctly?","<p>I'm attempting to advise another party on how to block <em>just</em> requests from Tor exit nodes, not non-exit relays. I think I understand the correct data sources to provide to them, but I'd like confirmation that this is the correct approach.</p>

<h1>Constraints</h1>

<ul>
<li>They need the data in bulk, not query-dnsbl-per-request</li>
<li>They need to check the actual request IP, not the advertised IP of the node</li>
<li>While this is primarily web traffic, I'm not sure we can assume just ports 80 and 443</li>
<li>While I'm sure the Tor community would like them to not block Tor exits, I think that's non-negotiable due to their business model. However, getting rid of these false positives is no doubt an improvement for everybody.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Resources</h1>

<ul>
<li>I've found <a href=""https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py?ip=8.8.8.8&amp;port=443"">https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py?ip=8.8.8.8&amp;port=443</a> which AIUI generates lists of IPs based on <em>advertised</em> exit policies and addresses for a given port (call this the Bulk Exit Query for 443)</li>
<li>I've found <a href=""https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses"">https://check.torproject.org/exit-addresses</a> which appears to list the <em>actual</em> outbound IP addresses of exit nodes, I think based on TorDNSEL data (call this the TorDNSEL List). It's not clear which exit ports this is based on, however!</li>
</ul>

<p>What surprises me is that the former is not a subset of the latter. I would expect that some exits do not allow 443, so they'd only be on the TorDNSEL List, but anything on the Bulk Exit Query for 443 list should be included on the TorDNSEL List. It's possible that the mismatch there is due to exits that have inbound and outbound traffic on different IPs.</p>

<h1>Partial solution</h1>

<p>My inclination is to advise the other party to combine the following data sources for their blocklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>TorDNSEL List</li>
<li>Bulk Exit Query for 80, 443, 8080, 8443, and other ports that are relevant to their business, using... what IP?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Remaining questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>How would one get Bulk Exit query data agnostic of destination IP?</li>
<li>Does Bulk Exit use advertised or actual addresses? Their docs imply the latter (and mention using TorDNSEL for this), but then why the mismatch?</li>
<li>Is there anything I'm missing here?</li>
</ul>

"What prevents CircID collision from happening?","<p>When a Tor OP wants to extend a circuit, it sends a relay extend cell to the last node on it. This node then sends CREATE cell to the desired destination node, choosing a new CircID (used to identify the circuit uniquely) not already used between the node sending the CREATE cell and the destination node.</p>

<p>What will happen in the hypothetic case when, say, 2 different circuits with different middle nodes share the same exit node, and the two middle nodes choose the same, colliding CircID when sending CREATE cell to the common exit node?</p>

<p>Following the spec, this should be a possible scenario, because each of the middle nodes doesn't use the randomly generated CircID already to this exit node. The collision happens only on the exit node and there is no way for the two middle nodes to know about it.</p>

<p>How strong is the entropy behind CircID generation and is it the only defence measure against CircID collision?</p>
"
"Unstable websocket over Tor","<p>I'm working on a Java application that uses websockets to communicate with a hidden service. So far I've managed to get it all working but websocket connection is unstable. Here's what I've done:</p>

<p>First, I've installed Tor and added this to <code>torrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:9001 
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a working websocket server on a local machine listening on port 9001.<br>
Next, I need a local HTTP proxy for websockets, not SOCKS5 so I've installed Polipo and added this to it's config file:  </p>

<pre><code>proxyAddress = ""127.0.0.1""
proxyPort = 8118

socksParentProxy = ""localhost:9050""
socksProxyType = socks5
</code></pre>

<p>So I've got Tor with a hidden service, working websocket server, Polipo and a websocket client all on a same machine - for a testing purposes. And at last, here's a pseudo code of what my program is doing:  </p>

<pre><code>val server = ""ws://xe5qeboadaaatzuz.onion:80"" // hidden service on a same machine
factory.proxy.setHost(""localhost"").setPort(8118) // using Polipo HTTP proxy
val socket = factory.createSocket(server)
socket.onDisconnect = wait 5 seconds and reconnect
socket.connect
</code></pre>

<p>And here's an output I'm getting:</p>

<pre><code>[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-5] connecting...
[ReadingThread] socket has connected
[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3] OPEN

...
</code></pre>

<p>On average connection lasts for a minute or so. It also happens periodically when I connect to <code>echo.websocket.org</code>. Is this an inherent property of Tor network or am I missing something here? Perhaps some settings in <code>Polipo</code>'s or <code>Tor</code>'s config could resolve this?  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>
When I test the same setup on Android using OrBot's <code>localhost:8118</code> as HTTP proxy my websocket connection is stable. But my question about how to achieve the same stability in Linux environment still stands.</p>

"Torified IMAP and SMTP","<p>I’m a newcomer to Tor, so please take that into account. :)</p>

<p>I wonder if it is useful to torify (actually, torsocks) programs such as msmtp and offlineimap, which I use to receive and send emails (I use mutt as MUA). The email account is a regular one (no .onion kind of thing), hosted by a big evil company I have no control over (say, for the sake of the argument, a gmail account).</p>

<p>As far as I understand it, the interest lies in preventing people (say, the sysadmin of the wifi network or my Internet service provider) from knowing I’m downloading and uploading emails. But maybe I get something wrong…</p>

"Choosing computer hardware to run Tor relays - (CPU RAM cable HDD SSD etc)","<p>I am thinking of buying a computer to use only for running Tor relays from England in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I am writing to ask for advice on which details of the machine make a difference to the effectiveness of the machine when used only for this purpose.   </p>

<p>I would be installing Ubuntu or another Linux distro on the machine, but am only asking about hardware in this question, assuming that the choice of distro is not related to the choice of hardware.  If that assumption is incorrect, please let me know.      </p>

<p>The internet connection is via a BT Home Hub, and the relevant speeds BT have told me about are 55 Mbps to download and 10 Mbps to upload.  </p>

<p>I am considering buying a Lenovo Thinkcentre M93.  They are office desktop machines which would cost in the region of £100 to £200 secondhand, and have an Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processor.  I would use the passmark.com website to compare the power of the CPUs.</p>

<p>I would guess that the power of the processor will matter, but have no idea how much difference it would make to have a passmark rating of 7000 rather than 4000.  </p>

<p>Is the number of physical or logical cores important, or the passmark score per physical or logical core, rather than the total, if a Tor relay only uses one physical or logical core, as I have seen mentioned somewhere?  </p>

<p>Would the the amount of RAM will matter up to a point?  I do not know if the relevant point is 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB.  </p>

<p>Would the type of ethernet card or connection matter?  </p>

<p>Would the amount and type of storage matter, HDD or SSD?  I would guess that anything over 80GB would be fine, and more would not be better over that level, but again am not sure.  I would presume that SSD is better than HDD, but again am not sure.  </p>

<p>The machine would be connected by cable to the BT Home Hub.  Does the type of cable matter, category 5e, 6, or 6a?  (These are the category labels in the UK).  </p>

<p>Am I thinking along reasonable lines, or should I be looking at gaming machines rather than business ones, or a different family of CPUs than Intel Core? </p>

"Content Delivery Networks and Tor","<p>For a number of reasons not critical to my question, I've decided that my website, currently on the clear web, would serve my users more effectively as an .onion site.</p>

<p>I'm still researching Tor basics and how to bring this to fruition. But there's one aspect I can't seem to wrap my head around:</p>

<p><strong>Q. In the Tor model, what plays the role of CDN (content delivery network, e.g. Cloudlare) ?</strong></p>

<p>My website has a fairly large amount of static HTML/CSS/JS/PNG files. They rarely change. The script embedded in the .js files makes AJAX calls to the site to retrieve data and update the DOM. So the caching of static elements is pretty crucial. I'm using Cloudflare for that task right now.</p>

<p>In the Tor model, what layer/entity would do the caching of static content? I can tell from the explanatory diagrams, that there's an ultimate 'exit node' that would contact my site on port 443 (https). But would it contact my origin server directly without going through a caching layer? If so, presumably I could add additional IIS servers to pick up the load but even then, is there a way to load balance it? In other words, is there a way to point MyDomain.onion to an array of servers instead of just one?</p>

<p>I'm confused as to how to distribute the load if there's no CDN in place. Please enlighten me.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

"Tor file descriptor usage at 100%","<p>I am running a non-exit Tor relay for the last few weeks and it is working but it is not maxing the Internet pipe. (The server is >2 weeks old, so not a problem of age)</p>

<p>The problem is that it seems that Tor's file descriptor usage are at 100%. Nyx shows this:</p>

<p>file descriptors: 4074 / 4064 (100%)</p>

<p>I am running the server on an unprivileged LXC container and it just works fine but this is what is bugging me out. Is that number of file descriptors acceptable, or should I raise it? How does it get filled? Doesn't it get (recycled?) at certain times?</p>

<p>I have enough RAM and CPU as they are idling at 15% usage. By the way, I am running a directory. Don't know if that affects to file descriptors usage.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find any answer to this matter. Hope you can help me.</p>

"How are certain websites able to override the specific exitnode you chose, and can a fix be made to stop it?","<p>I've followed the instructions in the posts about using a specific exitnode, and I've added the following to my torrc:</p>

<pre><code>ExitNodes 719FD0FA327F3CCBCDA0D4EA74C15EA110338942
StrictNodes 1
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I've specified the exitnode by fingerprint rather than IP, which is 185.220.100.252</p>

<p>Now, this works fine when I go to <a href=""http://www.duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.duckduckgo.com</a> or <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.nasa.gov</a> - I get that exact IP address.  However, certain websites like  <a href=""https://ayefiles.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://ayefiles.com</a> are somehow defeating this restriction, sending me to a different IP.  This breaks my use case, where I need (for a short amount of time) all accesses through the same exitnode.</p>

<p>Is this a security hole I have discovered, and if so, can we close it so such sites cannot hack my choice of exitnode?  Or, is it because StrictNodes 1 doesn't apply to ExitNodes and only ExcludeNodes?  If this is the problem, can someone tell me how to specify the same restriction using ExcludeNodes?  I.e. something like this:</p>

<pre><code>ExcludeNodes !719FD0FA327F3CCBCDA0D4EA74C15EA110338942
StrictNodes 1
</code></pre>

<p>so I want to exclude all nodes BUT that specific fingerprint.  Is there a syntax for this???</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"Cycling introduction points","<p>Is it possible to cycle your selected introduction points after X time has passed so new introduction points can be selected? If so, how would I achieve this either within the current functionality of Tor or with some sort of external script/add-on?</p>

<p>You may ask why would I need this? I operate a small hidden service that has been subject to a Tor DoS attack recently, along with some more prominent ones, which was overloading my Tor process at 100% CPU, it was possible to prevent this by excluding the relay the attack was being sent through via the node's fingerprint. The attacker then changed up their method of attack and I do not see anything in my logs anymore, however the service is completely unavailable. I shared debug logs with Tor project and there was nothing identified. It has been suggested that the introduction points could be identified and attacked. I want to test this theory and see what the outcome will be. Please someone with any knowledge on this provide some insight into how this could be achieved, thanks!</p>

"How do we extend our privacy on TOR circuit?","<p><em>The Tor Browser bounces your communications data through distributed network of relays by encrypting traffic in at least three layers
selected from thousands of volunteer computers, thus making incredibly difficult for anyone to trace you and your activity and identity 
that has been masked by Tor.</em></p>

<p>Tor functions like a layered series of proxy servers that route your traffic in a zig-zag around the internet before it reaches your destination (the layers give rise to the name, which stands for The Onion Router).</p>

<p>There are at least three hops through data travels.</p>

<p>The entry node, which inevitably knows your IP address
The middle (or relay) node, which prevents the exit node from finding out which entry node you used and makes it very hard to correlate this information
The exit node, which knows what site you are connecting to, but does not know who you are</p>

<p>What if a malicious Tor node may keep limited logs and that parts of it may be under surveillance.</p>

<p>But since it’s not completely secure, because they previously had to rely on exit nodes. 
Since Exit nodes can also see your traffic and may attempt to modify it. 
But unfortunately it’s unlikely that resources will be spent tracking down your browsing habits running on a high-profile user
and these exit node bandwidth is the scarcest resource in the Tor ecosystem.</p>

<p>What measures should be taken in-order to avoid the above circumstances. What must be the additional softwares needed to be installed to combat against privacy?</p>

<p>How do we need to configure those Exit nodes? Does Onion Service really defend against the above scenario?</p>

<p>The second error message means that the responsible HSDir relays for that specific onion address are pointing to the responsible introduction point(s) (guard) of that hidden service but when the client is waiting for a message from the hidden service (from the chosen rendezvous point) he dont receive one.</p>

<p><a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/a/231/71"">This answer</a> notes that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tor chooses an exit relay which actually allows you to exit the Tor
  network. Some only allow web traffic (port 80) which is not useful
  when someone wants to send emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What happens when a  user is passing traffic over multiple ports? It wouldn't be uncommon to receive email over IMAP whilst web browsing, or even to visit a page serving a mix of HTTP &amp; HTTPS content. Would Tor have to find a single Exit Relay which allows all ports needed, or is it possible that traffic might exit a different node for each port?</p>

"How to calculate optimal Relay Bandwidth & Throughput","<p>Setting up a Tor relay on a VPS/cloud is a relatively straightforward process, which is great for people who enjoy that <sub><sup>warm-fuzzy-i'm-making-a-difference</sup></sub> feeling we get by contributing bandwidth to the network. However, most providers have a monthly limit on how much bandwidth you can contribute before charging extra, and that's something most of us would like to avoid.</p>

<p>Luckily <code>torrc</code> includes a really handy setting called <code>AccountingMax</code> that will cause your relay to go into hibernation when you hit a certain limit. With a 1000GB/mo VPS plan you could set a conservative monthly limit of 900 GB (or a daily limit of 30 GB) and Tor will automatically stop serving well before you dip into extra costs.</p>

<p>The only downside to this is that your relay won't be very stable. For a certain amount of time every day/month your server will be idle, thereby limiting the amount of consistent help you can contribute. I've used the <code>RelayBandwidthRate</code> setting to limit my bandwidth in an attempt to find a balance where I'm always relaying but never going over my limits. However, as throughput rates tend to fluctuate I'm not really sure if my settings are optimal.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to determine what <code>AccountingMax</code> / <code>RelayBandwidthRate</code> / <code>RelayBandwidthBurst</code> settings are optimal for a given monthly cap? Would traffic ever be consistent enough to to come up with a simple table that could be included in the setup guide?</p>

I'm still a newbie about DNS leaks and using the TorBrowser (correctly) as well as VPN's and still have a lot to learn. With that said, does anyone know if using MadMAC's and/or DNS Crypt at the same time I'm using my TorBrowser will help my anonymity on web surfing or am I just making things worse?</p>

<p>Re: MadMAC's, in summary it's a script to randomize your machine's MAC address (and host name) in Windows on every boot. It was discussed on the IronGeek website. <a href=""http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/changemac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/changemac</a>.

<p>Regarding DNS Crypt, for those unfamiliar, it helps eliminate DNS leaks and appears to eliminate DNS leaks whether I'm connected to a VPN or even just a regular high speed cable connection with my ISP. Please note I have observed when using the website ""DNS Leak Test"" to test my TorBrowser for DNS leaks, I tend to see lots of DNS leaks and become concerned, but maybe that is normal because of the way Tor is set up; there's going to be these DNS leaks and maybe am I just over reacting based on how Tor works? </p>

<p>I do have to say when using DNS Crypt, I'm not sure how much data is going back to OpenDNS to track, though. Couple of other things I do is when I'm not using DNS Crypt, I usually change my Windows 7 preferred and alternate DNS Server Address for IPv4 and IPv6 to an OpenNIC or other public one listed on ShieldsUp website instead of having these configured automatically, which means the DNS Server Addresses are my ISP's. I also turned off my Teredo connection for added security.</p>

"Whonix - How to get Java Plugin installed/working on Iceweasel? + GUI, Troubleshooting questions","<p>I need help installing or messing with certain things on Whonix.</p>

<p>Most important is getting Java to work on it in the browser. I've installed Iceweasel and Chromium, and JRE 8 and JDK6 (long story...), but I don't know how to get a Java plugin installed and working. If I could just install things by double clicking on them or right clicking to get a menu option of having them run as administrator this would be a lot less trouble, which is why I pose this question first. Ubuntu's like this too until you change a settings item or two reachable within the GUI, but I can't figure out a way to do this AT ALL on Debian/KDE/Whonix!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>So, how do you install Java and its plugin properly on Whonix step by step? I installed Iceweasel and Chromium after realizing that Java doesn't work on Whonix's patched Tor browser, so is that it?</p></li>
<li><p>So, how exactly do you install things via the GUI interface like through
double clicking on it as in windows, or can you even make it let you?
And how do you also, for example, do things like run installation files as
'administrator' or root I guess in the case of the Debian KDE Whonix
is based on from the GUI? I'm learning to use commands like ""cd"", "".."" and so forth, but they're still kind of annoying and I'm worried not all apps are best installed via command line.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Secondly, I seem to have issues getting Sip phone clients working on Whonix. I've set Linphone and Jitsi up, but Linphone just says registration is failing and Jitsi's doesn't ever seem to connect either but with no error warning for either, even though the Sip registrars I'm using have worked on my desktop via VPN in the past. I also have issues with setting up VMWare Horizon. It installed seemingly successfully via the commandline according to some instructions I reviewed for Debian but it won't open.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the problem that the Sip registrars don't want to accept
transmissions via Tor?</li>
<li>And is VMWare Horizon not working due to some harsh
limitation of Java on Whonix done for privacy reasons or can Horizon
be made to work on it without too much trouble? If these DO work
please link any step-by-steps if you know of any.</li>
</ul>

"Warning!!! Many of directory authorities are compromised and taken down, This is a horrendous security risk, Who has done it and why?","<p><strong>Warning!!!</strong><br>
It appears that many Directory authorities are compromised and taken down, This is a horrendous security risk, Who has done it and Why? There are currently 9 directory authorities. More than half of the authorities must be online and they must reach a consensus on the current state of the network every hour for them to create and publish the hourly networkstatus-consensus (the list of all the known relays). If some of the directory authorities were compromised and taken offline then the remaining DAs will continue publishing the consensus and the network will continue operating normally. The one performance impact will be seen by new clients. When they first try connecting to the network (download and launch Tor Browser for the first time) they will try connecting to one of the directory authorities and download the networkstatus consensus from it. If some of the directory authorities are offline, it may take some time for each connection to timeout (while the client connects to an unavailable authority), but eventually the client will reach an operational authority and it will then be able to use the Tor network as usual.
If more than 5 DAs are taken offline then this is a horrendously large operation and the necessary corrective actions must be taken to ensure the network remains operational.</p>

<p>A new client have tried Tor for the first time on Dec 20 2014, and it took more than 20 minutes to connect to an online directory authority. How many directory authorities are down? Is there any information why so many directory authorities are down? Following please find the partial list of directory authorities that appear to be down and up:</p>

<p>154.35.32.5  appear to be down</p>

<p>86.59.21.38  appear to be down</p>

<p>194.109.206.212 appear to be down</p>

<p>I understand that the address <code>105.237.225.30</code> was verified as an exit node at the instant 2014-10-31 16:03:55, and is guaranteed to have been an exit node at that instant (is that correct?).

<ul>
<li>From the <code>Published</code> time to the <code>LastStatus</code> time (around 8 hours)?</li>
<li>From the <code>Published</code> time to the instant the address was verified (around an hour and a half)?</li>
<li>Or maybe I have no guarantee that the address was an exit node except for the instant it was verified?</li>

"Usage if I don't need anonymity but want to help others?","<p>What is the recommended way to use Tor when I don't need anonymity myself, but want to help increase the anonymity of the whole network so that others can benefit?</p>

<p>I'm not sure I can express my question properly, so let me explain the thinking. There are many guidelines what to do and what not to do in order to remain anonymous. For example, users should not login to Google while using Tor because then the other traffic can be linked to it, compromising anonymity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it seems to me that the whole Tor network becomes more anonymous if there is as much ""normal"" traffic as possible. So should users like me (who are personally not bothered about anonymity) follow different recommendations and use Tor for as much normal activity as possible, to make it easier for others to hide? Or is that not wanted because it wastes resources but doesn't help anybody?</p>

<p>I couldn't really find any guidelines for users who just want to increase the overall network anonymity but <em>don't</em> need anonymity themselves personally.</p>

<p>Edit: I already run a relay without problems, can also recommend it as a way to support the Tor. So I don't need help with setup, just clarification about my own client usage and how it affects the anonymity of others.</p>

This created an internal VPN, and all my internet traffic is now being routed and monitored through another offsite location. This also has compromised my ability to connect to the Tor network. I have tried using a L2TP connection to Private Internet Access (at their recommendation), but that didn't work as well. I am going to set up a whonix VM station, but I doubt that will work as well, since it uses Tor exclusively.</p>

<p>Does anyone have experience with these types of devices or recommendations for keeping my browsing private? Is there any way I can use Tor or a VPN?</p>

<p>Multiple VPNs can be tricky apparently, and I (sys admin locally) do not have control of this device.
I know it a place of work, and they have every right, but I can't help myself... keeping myself secure is peace of mind. Link below is pdf of the device in question. I will answer any question I believe won't subvert the security of my company.</p>

"""New circuit"" not working right?","<p>I set out to do an experiment that required me to do searches without cookies or location biasing the results.  I wanted location, however to always be somewhere in USA, so I set ExitNodes accordingly.</p>

<p>If I open a new tab, the exit node is the same as before.  If I closed the window, i.e., all tabs, and open a new one, I still get the same exit node.</p>

<p>If I select ""new circuit"" from the menu, I get a different middle node, but the ExitNode does not change.</p>

<p>If I exit Tor and re-launch, I do get a different ExitNode.</p>

"Possible buffer overflow in compat_libevent.c?","<p>first of all let me say that I started to study the C three days ago. As exercise I'm reading source code as much as I can. I thought I'd start with Tor and, in this file <a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/common/compat_libevent.c"" rel=""nofollow""><code>src/common/compat_libevent.c</code></a>, I found something that has puzzled me (<a href=""https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/common/compat_libevent.c#n33"" rel=""nofollow""><code>n = strlcpy(buf, msg, sizeof(buf));</code></a>):</p>

<pre><code>STATIC void
libevent_logging_callback(int severity, const char *msg)
{
  char buf[1024]; //size of buf
  size_t n; //store the maximum size of n
  if (suppress_msg &amp;&amp; strstr(msg, suppress_msg)) //if suppress_msg is not NULL and in suppress_msg there is msg...
    return;
  n = strlcpy(buf, msg, sizeof(buf)); //here I'm confused: msg, for example, of 2048 bytes will lead to a buffer overflow... or not?
  if (n &amp;&amp; n &lt; sizeof(buf) &amp;&amp; buf[n-1] == '\n') {
    buf[n-1] = '\0';

"Another question about Tor exit node","<p>I read this on another question</p>

<pre><code>Entry-Node (Knows your address and relay nodes address)
Relay-Node (knows entry-node and exit-node address)
Exit-Node (knows address of relay-node and webserver)
</code></pre>

<p>But,what if Entry-Node send my ip address to Relay-Node,which will send it to Exit-Node ?
Then will the Exit Node have both my IP Adress and what i am sending ?</p>

<p>In this principle it looks like the each node can send ip adresses he knows  <strong>outside Tor</strong> and where he get it to another nodes (like DHT) in some software or just by IP packets.</p>

<p>Like this</p>

<pre><code> Me                 Entry-Node                 Relay-Node           Exit-Node      Server
 Data(Tor) -------&gt; -------------------------&gt; -------------------&gt; --------------&gt; ----

 My Data            Encrypted Data             Encrypted Data       Decrypted Data
</code></pre>

<p>Well,the nodes will have to use some special kind of software...</p>

<p><strong>And one more thing,can anyone with Tor become a exit node ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Or Tor accept only 'verified' entry and exit nodes,and the other can become just a relay ?</strong></p>

"Routing Bittorrent through a Tor relay...","<p>I am running a non-exit Tor relay on my Windows 10 machine. I have the ORPort as 443, while the SocksPort and ControlPort are 9050 and 9051, respectively. I devote 800 Kbps average, and 950 Kbps to bursts. My DNS settings are set to non-ISP DNS (both my router and my own computer) and they don't log. </p>

<p>I use the Tor Browser Bundle (always updated) for my general onion Internet surfing. I only use the TBB when surfing onion sites, but close the TBB when done. I keep the relay going 24/7. </p>

<p>I know all the controversy regarding BitTorrent over Tor so please spare me the comments against, etc. I actually run the relay partly to defray the load I put on Tor via BitTorrent. </p>

<p>So, since I set my Vuze proxy settings for '127.0.0.1' and 'port: 9050' and 'Socks5' for both tracker and peer to peer, my thinking is that having all this Tor relay traffic co-mingling with the BitTorrent traffic would make any sort of traffic analysis of my Internet much more complicated. Especially analysis of anything I do while using the Tor Browser Bundle. Any comments on this? </p>

<p>Also, when I set my Vuze to use those proxy settings, the SOCKS icon is green in Vuze while the firewall icon turns red (meaning firewalled). I have UPnP in my router and my Vuze. I am able to download files with the Vuze status as such. But I'm not seeding very much, and it's messing up my ratio. Also, I have Vuze set to randomize TCP/UDP listening ports and to use same ports for TCP/UDP. But when I use the 'NAT/Firewall Test' for my Vuze ports, it says the TCP port ""timed out"" or the connection is ""refused,"" while the UDP port is ""OK!"" In fact, any port I test will always come back ""refused"" or ""timed out."" But once I un-proxy Vuze, the firewall icon turns green almost instantly. </p>

<p>How can I get Vuze to work right with Tor? I'm thinking it's a matter of the half-open connections limit? I have Vuze set to 20 ""max simultaneous outbound connection attempts,"" and 950 ""max outstanding outbound connections.""</p>

"been tampered? been filtered ? or just a network settings messing around?","<p>I'm using qubes for some times now.
<p>
after some weeks to correctly configure my setup, I want to figure it out why sys-whonix is not working correctly with my setup.
<p>
so I closely look at the other threads with one same criteria, the message in the logs : (""server rejected connection"")
<p>
<a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/9809/please-review-my-connection-log-errors"">one</a> in particular attracted my attention. So I've tested some advices on this same website. So I've connected through the wifi access point from my phone and through my LAN wired network. The differences are heavy.
<p>
first some informational point: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the LTE data network and my VDSL2 Line are from the same provider which is Proximus in Belgium (important point to dissipate any doubt about the fact if I'm in a restricted area or not).  </p></li>
<li><p>My LAN Network is organised with VLANs through managed switches and then through a router which is connected wiredly to an ISP box/router but its my router which does the PPPOE connection not the ISP box.  </p></li>
<li><p>I didn't do a DMZ zone for this qubes client but the router/firewall rules are pretty basics</p></li>
<li><p>My work/personal life are sort of mixed with the justice department and to my knowledge there are no specific filters from ISP in belgium but I could be wrong if I am don't hesitate to correct me.</p></li>
<li>I have pinged all the bridges and all except one answered. </li>
</ul>

<p>So here are the logs through the LTE access point:</p>

<p>So with the LTE network I had immediately a connection. Between the two tests I've of course restart tor and ask it to reconnect. When I was on the wired network like always, I had some but mostly no connection. You can notice it in the logs and through the timestamp too.
<p>
So is it my ISP preventing me to go to Tor? Is it a problem with my router setup ? Is it something else in my wired networked? Does these messages of server rejected connection come from the bridge itself or is it a generic message from ARM? What should I do to have access permanently to Tor through my wired network? Which tests should I do and how to proceed? Should I add pages and pages of bridges? </p>

"Configuring Tor to provide relays for users in specific countries","<p>I have looked for a relevant answer to this question and not found it, so am asking the question myself.  </p>

<p>I am asking this question because my most important motive for setting up a Tor exit relay is to help people in countries where censorship and surveillance mean that it is really difficult or dangerous for them to use the internet to discuss historical, political and religious issues, however non-violent their approach or activity.  </p>

<p>One key background experience which explains my view of this issue is that in the 1960's I lived in a country where it was illegal for bookshops to import and sell ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" in English by George Orwell, or any other book written by him.  It was not illegal to own a copy, or read it.  This was in Europe, but not in central, southern or eastern Europe, in case anyone is wondering.  Of course this did make me pay attention to the novel when I was lent a copy of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"".  </p>

<p>Is there any effective way that I can specify the countries where internet users can use my relay?  I would not be aiming to stop internet traffic passing through any countries, just ensuring that the users of my relay are in some countries that in my judgement have a greater need to use Tor more, rather than others that I would judge need it less.  </p>

<p>Or does the way Tor works as a system overall mean that any narrowing of the range of countries where users will use my relay will be automatically compensated for by the Tor system, so any change of this sort to my relay can have no overall effect on users, even if many other users made the same changes as those I am asking about?  </p>

<p>So do I just have to accept that helping some people to watch cat videos in a secure, private and anonymous fashion, or others to do something I would regard as rightly illegal as well as morally wrong, as the inescapable dead-weight cost of helping others to achieve the ability to discuss and learn about important issues as free adults?  </p>

<p>I can accept that there might be nothing more that I can usefully do to increase the objectives that led my to run a Tor relay, but I definitely would like to know whether that is true or not.  </p>

<p>It would be useful to know the answer when other people question or challenge me about my Tor relay helping criminals to hide their nefarious activities.  </p>

"How to configure Tor Browser to run securely?","<p>A couple of months ago, I was looking at a youtube video and there were some steps to make Tor secure. For example it was suggested that the users should check that pop up windows are blocked, choose never remember history, select the option warn me when sites try to install add-ons, select block reported attack sites and block reported web forgeries. Furthermore, it was suggested that the users deactivate from the No-script options Java, Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight, other plugins, /, ,  and @font face. </p>

<p>Today I visited the website of Tor and looked at the security tips, <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#Warning"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en#Warning</a>. 
In the first tip it says "" It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you're browsing with Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor.""</p>

<p>Does this mean that I don't have to apply any of the aforementioned changes? Is this because there was a recent update of Tor? Or the above changes do not make any difference?</p>

"Ubuntu 16.4 LTS and arm lockout","<p>My question evolves around tor arm the controller used with tor. I hope I'm posting in the correct area as I'm not at all sure where the fault lies; either with Ubuntu or arm. If I'm in the wrong place apologies!</p>

<p>My relay has been in operation for little better than two weeks. I am new to tor relay. I've experienced the same problem several times. For the most part the relay takes care of itself with me checking it's operation periodically throughout the day. Until it happens.. I lose all Administrative functions with arm. Meanwhile, the relay seemingly continues to function as normal. The only solution I've found so far is to stop tor, and arm and do a hard restart. It's then good again for who knows how long until it happens again.</p>

<p>I've intentionally left out computer specifics as the computer itself is not the issue. It's software related either arm or Ubuntu OR both. How to sort it out, I am at a loss.</p>

Someone already mentions this in a comment on the accepted answer.</p>

<p>I have followed all steps: I have in my case 4 torrc files with seperate ports, 4 datadirectories (permissions are fixed), I start 4 different Tor servers all loading different config files.</p>

<p>I wrote a small app in nodejs to show that it doesn't work.</p>

<pre><code>## Configuration file for a typical Tor user
## Last updated 22 September 2015 for Tor 0.2.7.3-alpha.
## (may or may not work for much older or much newer versions of Tor.)
##
## Lines that begin with ""## "" try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just ""#"" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the ""#"" symbol.
##
## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
## for more options you can use in this file.
##
## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc

## Tor opens a SOCKS proxy on port 9050 by default -- even if you don't
## configure one below. Set ""SOCKSPort 0"" if you plan to run Tor only
## as a relay, and not make any local application connections yourself.
#SOCKSPort 9050 # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
#SOCKSPort 192.168.0.1:9100 # Bind to this address:port too.

## Entry policies to allow/deny SOCKS requests based on IP address.
## First entry that matches wins. If no SOCKSPolicy is set, we accept
## all (and only) requests that reach a SOCKSPort. Untrusted users who
## can access your SOCKSPort may be able to learn about the connections
## you make.
#SOCKSPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
#SOCKSPolicy accept6 FC00::/7
#SOCKSPolicy reject *

## Logs go to stdout at level ""notice"" unless redirected by something
## else, like one of the below lines. You can have as many Log lines as
## you want.
##
## We advise using ""notice"" in most cases, since anything more verbose
## may provide sensitive information to an attacker who obtains the logs.
##
## Send all messages of level 'notice' or higher to /opt/local/var/log/tor/notices.log
#Log notice file /opt/local/var/log/tor/notices.log
## Send every possible message to /opt/local/var/log/tor/debug.log
#Log debug file /opt/local/var/log/tor/debug.log
## Use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles
#Log notice syslog
## To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug stderr

## Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
## --runasdaemon 1 on the command line. This is ignored on Windows;
## see the FAQ entry if you want Tor to run as an NT service.
#RunAsDaemon 1

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
#DataDirectory /opt/local/var/lib/tor

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
#ControlPort 9051
## If you enable the controlport, be sure to enable one of these
## authentication methods, to prevent attackers from accessing it.

################ This section is just for relays #####################
#
## See https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay for details.

## Required: what port to advertise for incoming Tor connections.
#ORPort 9001
## If you want to listen on a port other than the one advertised in
## ORPort (e.g. to advertise 443 but bind to 9090), you can do it as
## follows.  You'll need to do ipchains or other port forwarding
## yourself to make this work.
#ORPort 443 NoListen
#ORPort 127.0.0.1:9090 NoAdvertise

## The IP address or full DNS name for incoming connections to your
## relay. Leave commented out and Tor will guess.
#Address noname.example.com

## If you have multiple network interfaces, you can specify one for
## outgoing traffic to use.
# OutboundBindAddress 10.0.0.5

## A handle for your relay, so people don't have to refer to it by key.
#Nickname ididnteditheconfig

## Define these to limit how much relayed traffic you will allow. Your
## own traffic is still unthrottled. Note that RelayBandwidthRate must
## be at least 20 kilobytes per second.
## Note that units for these config options are bytes (per second), not
## bits (per second), and that prefixes are binary prefixes, i.e. 2^10,
## 2^20, etc.
#RelayBandwidthRate 100 KBytes  # Throttle traffic to 100KB/s (800Kbps)
#RelayBandwidthBurst 200 KBytes # But allow bursts up to 200KB (1600Kb)

## Use these to restrict the maximum traffic per day, week, or month.
## Note that this threshold applies separately to sent and received bytes,
## not to their sum: setting ""40 GB"" may allow up to 80 GB total before
## hibernating.
##
## Set a maximum of 40 gigabytes each way per period.
#AccountingMax 40 GBytes
## Each period starts daily at midnight (AccountingMax is per day)
#AccountingStart day 00:00
## Each period starts on the 3rd of the month at 15:00 (AccountingMax
## is per month)
#AccountingStart month 3 15:00

## can explain what Tor is if anybody wonders why your IP address is
## contacting them. See contrib/tor-exit-notice.html in Tor's source
## distribution for a sample.
#DirPortFrontPage /opt/local/etc/tor/tor-exit-notice.html

## Uncomment this if you run more than one Tor relay, and add the identity
## key fingerprint of each Tor relay you control, even if they're on
## different networks. You declare it here so Tor clients can avoid
## using more than one of your relays in a single circuit. See
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#MultipleRelays
## However, you should never include a bridge's fingerprint here, as it would
## break its concealability and potentially reveal its IP/TCP address.
#MyFamily $keyid,$keyid,...

## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
## to last, and the first match wins.
##
## If you want to allow the same ports on IPv4 and IPv6, write your rules
## using accept/reject *. If you want to allow different ports on IPv4 and
## IPv6, write your IPv6 rules using accept6/reject6 *6, and your IPv4 rules
## using accept/reject *4.
##
## If you want to _replace_ the default exit policy, end this with either a
## reject *:* or an accept *:*. Otherwise, you're _augmenting_ (prepending to)

</code></pre>

<p>As you will presumably notice, I Exclude <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Decoding_table"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ALL <em>other</em> possible two-letter codes</a> {= 676 -- including ??, and leave out the one country that I wish to exit from {US}}.  {That's only about twice as many as those in actual use [= 249], if the ""User-assigned and Reserved"" [+ 81] are included too [= 330].  It's that way <em>because</em>: it's much clearer that all are listed, and thus easier for anyone else to modify to suit their needs; it's also slightly future-proofed as codes come and go; it prevents an adversary from using those against Tor by claiming to <em>be</em> one of those ""unused"" codes.}</p>

<p>Then I enter <code>systemctl restart tor</code> which causes Tor to recognize the newly modified <code>torrc</code>, and to remove the circuits generated prior to the restart.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Tor will invariably build two US-exit circuits, as desired; <strong>BUT</strong> it will <strong>ALSO</strong> invariably build the next two exits in Europe.  Then as I watch circuit usage, Tor doesn't <strong><em>seem</em></strong> to use those European circuits unless I access hidden services.  Tor will then continue to build primarily US circuits, but seems to nearly-always keep at least a couple European ones open.</p>

<p>So it may be that Tor in fact is NOT <em>using</em> those circuits for the rest of my traffic.  </p>

<p>When I first read what may be the relevant portion of the [manual, included below], {And I had read and noted [Roger Dingledine's comment]: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2  ""(Re Sam's comment above, StrictNodes no longer applies to the ExitNodes config option. It only applies to excluding nodes.)"" – Roger Dingledine Feb 8 '15 at 10:22} </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I presumed that <code>StrictNodes 1</code> would apply to <code>ExcludeExitNodes</code> as well as to <code>ExcludeNodes</code>.  <strong>However, it now seems to me that Tor is behaving as if</strong> <code>StrictNodes 1</code> <strong>DOES NOT APPLY to</strong> <code>ExcludeExitNodes</code><em><strong>!</strong></em></p>

<p><strong><em>If that is currently the case, PLEASE switch it back!</em></strong>  Users will retain much more anonymity, if they <em><strong>have to</strong></em> exit from a specific country, if Tor allows their circuits to merely exit in that specific country {by using <code>ExcludeExitNodes</code>} instead of forcing users who need to exit in a specific country to exclude ALL nodes outside that country {by using <code>ExcludeNodes</code>}.  Or else choose to be tied to a specific exit by using <code>.exit</code>, which might limit anonymity more, and would also break https {I was told that by sigaint support, and that's a no-go for me}.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>StrictNodes 0|1</p>
  
  <p>If StrictNodes is set to 1, Tor will treat the ExcludeNodes option as a requirement to follow for all the circuits you generate, even if doing so will break functionality for you. If StrictNodes is set to 0, Tor will still try to avoid nodes in the ExcludeNodes list, but it will err on the side of avoiding unexpected errors. Specifically, StrictNodes 0 tells Tor that it is okay to use an excluded node when it is <strong>necessary</strong> to perform relay reachability self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a hidden service to a client, fulfill a .exit request, upload directory information, or download directory information. (Default: 0)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when I reread again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ExcludeExitNodes node,node,…</p>
  
  <p>A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to never use when picking an exit node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network. Note that any node listed in ExcludeNodes is automatically considered to be part of this list too. See the ExcludeNodes option for more information on how to specify nodes. See also the caveats on the ""ExitNodes"" option below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ExitNodes node,node,…</p>
  
  <p>A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address patterns of nodes to use as exit node---that is, a node that delivers traffic for you outside the Tor network. See the ExcludeNodes option for more information on how to specify nodes.</p>
  
  <p>Note that if you list too few nodes here, or if you exclude too many exit nodes with ExcludeExitNodes, you can degrade functionality. For example, if none of the exits you list allows traffic on port 80 or 443, you won’t be able to browse the web.</p>
  
  <p>Note also that not every circuit is used to deliver traffic outside of the Tor network. It is normal to see non-exit circuits (such as those used to connect to hidden services, those that do directory fetches, those used for relay reachability self-tests, and so on) that end at a non-exit node. To keep a node from being used entirely, see ExcludeNodes and StrictNodes.</p>
  
  <p>The ExcludeNodes option overrides this option: any node listed in both ExitNodes and ExcludeNodes is treated as excluded.</p>
  
  <p>The .exit address notation, if enabled via AllowDotExit, overrides this option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It still seems to me that the behavior that I am seeing by Tor is NOT that which is described in the manual.</p>

<p>However if Tor actually ONLY uses the countries listed in ""Onion Circuits"" {which should have been excluded by <code>ExcludeExitNodes</code>} to build <em>otherwise</em> ""NECESSARY"" circuits, I would prefer hearing that from someone who <em>knows</em> that to be the case.  And it would maybe be less painful to other noobs if the manual was updated accordingly so as to be very specific regarding <code>ExcludeExitNodes</code>.</p>

<p>Or maybe I've found a bug that should be reported??</p>

<p>P.S.  There were six links above, but Stack Exchange does not allow noobs to write competently here.  They state: ""You need at least 10 reputation to post more than 2 links.""  I removed the last four.</p>

"Tor bridges and how they avoid censorship","<p>Censorship to the tor network is an option as the ISPs can detect an attempt of connection to one of the known tor nodes, as these are public.
But if I as a user of the tor network can gain access to the ip addresses of the bridges how comes that the ISPs \ companies who makes the censorship cant?
As i understand it, when using a bridge the packets should go through an additional station which is the bridge, which makes the bridge the ""entry node"", which means that my ISPs can see that i try to talk to an ip address which is a bridge and block me the same way they do with the normal tor relays.</p>

"onion.id question","<p>Recently I went to visit a clearnet site ""deepdotweb"" and was met with a seizure notice. Not surprisng.

<p>I downloaded tor browser on my macbook to see what all the buzz was about...surf the forums etc. Had a hell of a time getting it going. Still doesn't work right in my opinion.</p>

<p>So I was poking around on another clearnet site and double clicked a .onion link on accident and the webpage loaded. Of course the URL was titled ajdklfjal.onion.id. (safari) I then clicked on the forum link that was on the page and was met with an error through cloudflare that showed my IP address pretty plainly and when entered into my url box sent me to the page to change my router settings (yikes). Left immediately. </p>

<p>I then visit the same site that had the url on it...only difference now is that I was accessing it in the tor borwser bundle. So I just kinda did the same thing, double clicked the link etc. However the url is still fdsoifusdnl.onion.id. Clicked the forum link and was sent to a similar error page only this time my IP seems to be hidden. IP entered into the URL box and says ""This is a tor exit node"" </p>

<p>My question &lt;&lt; Clearly it looks like my IP address is hidden through tor. But is it really though?? The actual site realated to the forum I was trying to access still shows klajdfkd.onion.id. And forum still shows an error. </p>

<p>Im familiar with the ""anything.onion.id"" security risks...""id"" obviously means identification or identifier. But does that risk disappear when loaded through the tor browser or does the "".id"" still reveal information???</p>

"My hidden web service requires calls to multiple servers. Better to differentiate by hostname or port?","<p>I'm currently running a clearweb service accessible at <a href=""https://www.mydomain.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.mydomain.com</a>.</p>

<p>The site links to content, both static (e.g. images, jquery libraries), and dynamic (e.g. ajax calls) on other servers in the same domain. So, for example, the site may retrieve data from:</p>

<p>ajax.mydomain.com
static.mydomain.com
etc.</p>

<p>It's become apparent that for my own protection, and the protection of my users, we'd be better served if the site were made available via Tor as a .onion site instead of hosting it on the clearweb.</p>

<p>Here's the issue though:</p>

<p>It appears that the Tor protocol has no concept of a ""subdomain"" -- which leaves me with a couple of options for handling the multi-server access issue:</p>

<p><strong>(1) Use three private keys</strong></p>

<p>In this scheme, I'd have three private keys and hostnames:</p>

<p>abcd.onion (formerly www.mydomain.com)</p>

<p>efgh.onion (formerly ajax.mydomain.com)</p>

<p>ijkj.onion (formerly static.mydomain.com)</p>

<p>I could make this work but I do have a couple of concerns:</p>

<p>First off, Tor has no way of knowing that these three domains are owned by the same entity so presumably cookie sharing between domains would be an issue, since a cookie from abcd.onion would be treated as ""third party"" to efgh.onion.</p>

<p>Also, wouldn't Tor have to spin up a totally different route for each of the .onion domains? If so, wouldn't this significantly increase load time ?</p>

<p><strong>(2) Use one domain, but three separate ports</strong></p>

<p>In this scheme, I'd have only one domain but three ports:</p>

<p>abcd.onion:80 (formerly www.mydomain.com)</p>

<p>abcd.onion:81 (formerly ajax.mydomain.com)</p>

<p>abcd.onion:82 (formerly static.mydomain.com)</p>

<p>tor.exe and torrc file would be housed on a single/dedicated VM and configured to route ports 80, 81, and 82 to the appropriate servers on the VLAN.</p>

<p>I'm leaning toward option #2 since there's only one private key to deal with but is that the optimal solution for a single website that requires access to multiple .onion servers ? </p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>This is not related to architecture or OS nor to my network or even to machines owned by me. Also the problem is not limited to check.torproject.org and it has nothing to do with JavaScript.</p>

<p>When testing this I found that the number of new identities that are needed to reproduce this varies. Sometimes it happened first time other times I spent 10-15 minutes creating new identities in order to 'break' circuit view.</p>

<p>This has been happening over multiple versions of Tor Browser and doesn't seem to affect anonymity because the ip addresses are always Tor nodes. So it is <strong>not</strong> 'breaking Tor', just the circuit view. </p>

<p>I <strong>activated</strong> this feature and it didn't worked. I also tried the <strong>cancel</strong> button and it would just not work. Any idea how might I fix it? </p>

<p>Should I need to post the side logs which we get in the app? </p>

"Decrease number of hidden service hops?","<p>Is there any way to reduce the length of a hidden service's path to the rendezvous point?</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Bob's hidden service &lt;---&gt; Introduction Point</code></li>
<li><code>Alice &lt;---&gt; Introduction Point</code> tell Bob to contact me at <code>Rendezvous Point</code></li>
<li><code>Bob &lt;-&gt; Rendezvous point</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes, Bob's hidden service does not need anonymity, but wants to be accessible via Tor anyways. (For example, <a href=""http://ahmia.fi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ahmia.fi</a> is also accessible as <a href=""http://msydqstlz2kzerdg.onion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">msydqstlz2kzerdg.onion</a>). In such a case, it might be beneficial to limit the length of Bob's circuit to 1 (as indicated by the length of the arrow in step 3). Is that possible?</p>

<p>This is similar to <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/1312/how-to-decrease-number-of-tor-hops?rq=1"">How to decrease number of Tor hops?</a>. and <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/6271/accessing-tor-hidden-services-over-a-single-hop-circuit/6386#6386"">Accessing Tor hidden services over a single hop circuit</a>, but those wanted to limit the number of client hops.

"All connection default to .onion.to Why cant I get just .onion","<p>I am now running tails. The latest version. </p>

<p>Before Xmas I could browse .onion sites easily just by downloading the tor browser on to my linux system. Since the New Year, I have found some sites are not available and I get a banner across the top of the pages of those sites which are available, from Tor2web.</p>

<p>Research tells me that tor2web is a web proxy service for tor. I didn't install it, or ask for it and it is the same problem on all devices I use on my network. Can I assume that my ISP is now directing tor traffic through Tor2web?</p>

<p>Research also suggests there are many other proxy sites for tor out there and they convert my .onion addresses to cached .onion.to addresses (or a similar extension). Research suggests that I should the remove the extra .to extension and a direct connection can be made. That didn't work for me. </p>

<p>I have used bridges with obfs4 and still get to onion.to sites. I have now installed Tails (rather than just the tor browser) with bridges and obfs4 and I  still cannot get through to .onion sites, I can only get onion.to sites. Does anyone have any more ideas of what is going on and how to solve it, that is, to get a direct Tor connection to .onion sites?</p>

<p>I have scoured for answers to this, but can't find any. Let me know if you can direct me to a comprehensive solution.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"Tor connection from 1st to 2nd computer, then from 2nd computer, a 2nd Tor connection to browse web (for increased untraceability)","<p>Requirement: set up a two-leg Tor connection (using Tor twice). End user works on 1st computer, connects thru Tor to a 2nd off-site computer (could go thru VPN, SSH, or SSL as well), and then from that 2nd computer, goes thru Tor a second time to browse the web anonymously.</p>

<p>Intended purpose: to increase the level of untraceability and anonymity. The set up is this:</p>

<p>End user on 1st Computer > Tor Connection > 2nd Off-site Computer > 2nd Tor Connection > Browse the Web</p>

<p>The 2nd computer is at an off-site location, and the 2nd computer would be impossible to trace back to the end user, even if it were found. So this means if the 2nd Tor connection (between the 2nd computer and the websites being browsed) gets hacked, only the 2nd off-site computer will be found, but not the 1st computer.</p>

<p>So this set up uses Tor twice in 2 legs as a double precaution against being traced. This set up is like using Tor with a virtual machine, but using a physical 2nd computer in place of a virtual machine, and using Tor twice, in two legs.</p>

<p>What is the best way to set this up? Any suggestions?</p>

<p>The 2nd computer will be a Windows 10 or Android device.</p>

"Tor circuit display in Tor Browser - how can it?","<p>If all the nodes in a Tor circuit aren't supposed to know about each other, how can the Tor Browser display the whole circuit? If it knows all the addresses in the chain, can't someone else pull that same information out of the packets and make the relay thing moot? Would that be how some agencies have been able to ""break"" Tor by placing what they call ""malware"" on websites to backtrace the origin IP?
I know, a lot of questions but I think they're all related and I'm trying to understand how all this stuff works.</p>

<p>What is stopping these updates and new add-ons? What can I do to fix it?</p>

<p>PS: I tried a fresh install of TBB, but the same issue prevails. It seems to have crept in somewhere as new versions of TBB were produced. </p>

<p>PPS: It would be good if a Tag was available for HTTPS-Everywhere.</p>

<p>Additional info: OS is Windows 8. Tor installation is on external HD. Updates to Tor itself are successful, but I'm stuck with outdated add-ons. If anybody knows a way to force TBB to accept the add-on updates I'd very much appreciate it.</p>

<p>More info: I copied my Tor Browser folder to a different external device and ran it from there, but the add-ons have still failed to update. I conclude this problem is not specific to a particular external device. As I had the same problem on a fresh installation, I also conclude it's not due to peculiarities in my installation. Ron, thanks for your suggestions (I don't have the ability to Comment underneath) but I'm not sure how they apply to my situation. No other versions of Firefox have trouble updating add-ons. I don't use Zone Alarm. Downloading the updates is not a problem. Applying the downloaded updates is the problem. I'd be happy to hear your further suggestions or clarifications, but StackExchange makes it very hard to respond to each other. What I'm doing now, editing the initial post, seems the only mode available for me to communicate.</p>

"Can someone use WiFi snooping to see data I send through Tor Browser when I'm not using SSL?","<p>(NOTE: I've read other similar questions, but I'm not at all certain about this, therefore I'm asking.)</p>

<p>I travel a lot, and I generally use public WiFi spots and hotels/hostels/boarding houses etc. access points.</p>

<p>I'm a reporter. Sometimes I send my communications to email services and websites which don't use SSL cryptography (no https, just http), and though I KNOW this is not smart, I have no alternative.</p>

<p>What I want to know is if someone locally sniffing the network could read what I send to unprotected (no https) websites. If I send multimedia, pictures, audios etc., can they see/listen to them? Can they see what sites exactly I'm loading?</p>

<p>If so, what would take them? Just being connected to the same network? Having direct access to the router?</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do about it?</p>

<p>Again, I'm talking about people using the same network, snooping locally, and thinking about the data just after it leaves my PC and after it leaves the end node.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

"Attempting to undertand Tor and it's relationship with SSL","<p>I'm a mathematics student trying to understand Tor. I have little knowledge of networks and how exactly they function.</p>

<p>Up to now I (think I) understand the basic functionality of Tor. A route is generated first from the consensus list, and the packet (the message) is sent through that route. The packet is encrypted multiple times using the public keys obtained from the consensus list, and each relay strips away a layer of encryption before sending it on to the next relay (side question: how does this work with bridge relays? Is the message sent to a bridge relay first and then into the public Tor network, or does it move exclusively through bridge relays?). This means that the destination IP and IP of the sender are never in the same header of the packet and this is what gives Tor its relative anonymity.</p>

<p>Very often however I notice that SSL is brought up when discussions regarding Tor are made. I understand that SSL encrypts the data sent between the client and the server. But if this is the case I don't see how SSL is related to Tor, since they seemingly function on a different layer.</p>

<p>Edit: More specifically, I'm reading about how Iranian and Chinese authorities did ""Deep Package Inspection"" (i'm assuming this means that they looked at the contents of each packet) to look for SSL. Is this because SSL is used by default with encrypting the different layers in an onioned packet? If so, is there a reason that looking for SSL was enough to indentify a Tor connection?</p>

"Browser configured but still unable to unblock websites","<p>I have downloaded and installed Tor. Now, I wanted to use Tor to visit some of the blocked websites that our government had mistakenly blocked. So, I changed the proxy settings in my Firefox to point at localhost:9150. </p>

<p>If I use the Tor Browser Bundle, however, I am able to visit the site. </p>

<p>So what is the difference in the settings in my Firefox and the Tor Browser??</p>

"How is data sent back from exit node to me?","<p>I understand how the client sends the data through Tor to the sever. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing#Onion_creation_and_transmission"">Onion routing</a></p>

<p>Basically, it selects a set of nodes to form a circuit, say nodeA nodeB nodeC.</p>

<p>It then encrypts the data this way:</p>

<pre><code>1. Encrypt it using nodeC's key, append server's address.
2. Encrypt it using nodeB's key, append nodeC's address.
3. Encrypt it using nodeA's key, append nodeB's address.
</code></pre>

<p>The data then travels the circuit this way.</p>

<p>Me -> nodeA (decrypt it) -> nodeB (decrypt) -> nodeC (decrypt) -> Server</p>

<pre><code>1. I send the data to nodeA. nodeA decrypts it and will now know where to send the data next.
2. nodeA sends the data to nodeB. nodeB decrypts it and will now know where to send the data next.
3. nodeB sends the data to nodeC. nodesC decrypts it and will now know where to send the data next.
4. nodeC sends the data to the server.
</code></pre>

<p>What I don't get is, when the server replies, how is the data encrypted and/or sent back to me.</p>

<pre><code>1. Does the exit node know who I am and sends the reply back the way I send the data to the server (construct a circuit)?
2. Is the session maintained, if so, how is the data encrypted between the nodes?

"Will disabling caching in Tor Browser increase anonymity, or decrease it?","<p>I have stumbled upon the idea of <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/safecache/reviews/"">disabling cache</a> - <a href=""http://geekswithblogs.net/AskPaula/archive/2011/05/19/145440.aspx"">completely</a>.</p>

<p>On one hand, I am thinking that due to having to load all elements afresh when visiting a page, I appear more like a fresh 'New Identity' (thus decreasing linkability and trackability across Tor IPs within one Identity), EVERY single time I load a page; but then I'm wondering how much of a fingerprinting issue it also raises, <em>decreasing</em> anonymity instead.</p>

<p><strong>Is it a case of an anonymity trade-off?</strong> (An analogy would be: using an email masking service where you're trading having 1000 websites all knowing your email address and having it stored on all of their vulnerable, breachable servers, for ONE website having the outline to your entire digital life and storing those same 1000 sites in one solitary but juicy basket, on THEIR potentially, equally breachable server.)</p>

<p><strong>Would it be a similar trade-off here?</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps it depends what other anti-tracking add-ons and settings you have enabled. For me, I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>NoScript set to global blocking</li>
<li>Third party cookies blocked via FF settings</li>
<li><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/"">Self-Destructing Cookies</a> with default set to expire 'after you close the tab' (so I assume with such cookie sanitizing I will more properly look like a truly fresh user on <em>every</em> given page)</li>
<li><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refcontrol/"">RefControl</a> with default set to 'no referrer' (again, making sure that I truly come across to every page as if I've literally entered the URL into the address bar and visited the page for the first time, ever)</li>
<li><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/"">RequestPolicy</a> to massively sandbox every domain I visit to keep other domains from knowing I'm visiting that domain (via blocking third-part cross-site images, scripts, css, scripts, objects, etc.)</li>
<li><code>layout.css.visited_links_enabled</code> set to <strong>false</strong> in <code>about:config</code> (to plug <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2010/03/31/plugging-the-css-history-leak/"">this</a> in case you have enabled history)</li>
<li><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/flashblock/"">FlashBlock</a> and <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/"">BetterPrivacy</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/http-nowhere/"">HTTP Nowhere</a> to block EVERY HTTP connection in the entire Tor Browser (short of direct handshakes to establish a domain's HTTPS with the Firefox default trusted CA store)</li>
</ul>

<p>And the only exception to all this stringent blocking, is custom (often temporary) whitelisting/unblocking for sites I want to use more functionality on, which largely thanks to <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/"">RequestPolicy</a> are still very much sandboxed even with things like JavaScript and session cookies enabled.</p>

<p>So although it's very unusual behaviour, I'm guessing that it still gives stronger anonymity for <em>each individual site</em> I visit, via my stringent blocking of cross-site object tracking. I simply come off as a phantom user, someone maybe visiting the page from a saved bookmark, just with a Tor IP / User Agent / HTTP_ACCEPT Headers, no previous identifiable cookie, and a few other 'blank' returns that just make me look like a total unlinkable (but unique) ghost, to that <em>one</em> site.</p>

<p>To me, that's anonymous, IF that unique behaviour can't be linked, by that website's sysadmin, to other sites, which unless there was some collaboration or communication between the two (and it would have to be so for every single site on the web, two-way), I don't think is likely. </p>

<p>Or is the issue, that parties like the <em>NSA</em>, who are hoovering EVERYTHING up in their servers, will be the ones that can detect this extremely unique fingerprint across multiple sites, and so this being useless against the NSA and I should just fall back to 'crowd anonimity' once more?</p>

<p>Is it a case of, would I rather look more anonymous to the NSA, or more anonymous to each website that I visit on the Internet?</p>

<p>If so, is there a set of behaviours that can then combine the best of both worlds, with more knowledge of how TBB's <em>default</em> crowd behaviour of cache expiry, cookie settings, session length (how quickly things are 'reset' by default in TBB <em>already</em>), and other such fingerprinting considerations, work?</p>

"How can we get more community-operated (non-NSA) Tor relays set up?","<p>One of the greatest threats I can see to the anonymity of the Tor network and its users, is NSA/GCHQ (etc.)-operated Tor nodes.</p>

<p>No matter how state-of-the-art 'good practice' a Tor user adheres to - in <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO"" rel=""nofollow"">not mixing modes of anonymity</a>, keeping fingerprinting and trackability to a minimum, and using encryption to a maximum - if the NSA has enough nodes under their belt, then they can (<em>some</em> of the time), piece together the dots of the anonymity network and de-anonymize communications taking place in it.</p>

<p>The obvious best thing to fight such NSA compromise of the Tor network, is to use 'people power' (there are more of us than in the NSA), to create as many of our <em>own</em> non-NSA relays (even if on small pipes and not always having 24/7 up-time), and hold as much of <em>our</em> own stake in the network, as possible.</p>

<p>What can one do apart from already hosting a relay yourself?</p>

<p>Is there a foundation to which one can donate (or even partner on charity events) which then sets up Tor community-controlled nodes to expand the network outside of NS control?</p>

<p>What activism, evangelism, or community-building could one do, or join?</p>

<p>(This would be activism/evangelism specifically for more non-NSA <em>nodes</em> being hosted mind you, not so much more Tor users, even though that would be of great benefit to Tor anonimity and potentially indirect benefit to more relays being set up anyway.)</p>

<p>Further to this, is there some big decision that the Tor Project could make that automatically increases the amount of community-hosted relays (thus everyone outside of NSA's anonymity) - such as making all Tor users contribute a bit of (p2p-style) <strong>middle node</strong> bandwidth to the network whenever they're connected, which might be in such a way that the user's browsing isn't even slowed down?</p>

<p>Perhaps this final idea is one of the best we could do to truly combat NSA Tor network takeover: a vast increase in Tor Browser instances of end users hosting the middle node infrastructure, where there's <em>by virtue</em> of the size of the very Tor user base, <em>more</em> control of it by the community, than by malicious sniffing adversaries such as the NSA.</p>

"Is it possible to have ""username@site.onion"" addresses and FULLY avoid DNS with email?","<p>I'm only just starting to look into email on Tor - and so far I'm only finding either email hosts whose <a href=""http://s4bysmmsnraf7eut.onion/webmail.php"" rel=""nofollow"">sites</a> (including webmail login) are hosted on .onion addresses, or whose <a href=""https://help.riseup.net/security/network-security/tor/hs-addresses-signed.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">POP, IMAP and SMTP servers</a> can clearly be connected to in the .onion namespace (even from your thunderbird mail client) - but how about having a <strong>.onion</strong> address in the email address itself - and doing away with DNS entirely?</p>

<p>Is it possible to have an email address like <strong><code>username@servicexxxxxxxxx.onion</code></strong>, and thus have full .onion &lt;--> .onion email address correspondence?</p>

<p>I can think of obvious advantages, such as avoiding <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/11727/"">privacy and security issues</a> associated with the standard DNS infrastructure (with sniffable DNS lookups, or spoofing), as well as relying less on or even completely doing away with the <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/51461/21377"">less secure system of HTTPS</a> SSL/TLS certificate trust validation entirely, as well as further obfuscation and safety (from both the Clearnet in general and specifically <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/a/51459/21377"">malicious Tor exit nodes</a> required to use it), by being fully insulated within the Tor network itself - especially if the .onion email services were configured solely to be a hidden service and not be DNS-referencable at all.</p>

<p>Has it been done before - are their services that indeed offer it now - or has the idea not actually been explored before?</p>

<p>There still is a use and need, for non-real-time, long-storage (until message retrieval), text correspondence - so OTR instant message (or even IRC using persistent BNCs) surely cannot satisfy the need for all 100% Tor, DNS-free, reliable text communication of this type - especially when people are used to email and clients like Thunderbird.</p>

"Does hosting a Tor hidden service also on clearnet DNS reduce privacy/security for the Tor user?","<p>I am wondering about the anonymity and security differences in visiting an .onion site, <strong>from the user's perspective</strong>, between one that is ONLY a hidden service, and one that also points the same webserver to clearnet DNS - whether its DNS face has HTTPS or not.</p>

<p>(Also - some .onion sites / URLS offer HTTPS with the .onion URL anyway, and it's a self-signed certificate - I assume - on TOP of the HSP <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en"">end-to-end encryption</a> that already exists.)</p>

<p>There are many sites which offer an .onion URL counterpart to their clearnet domains:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Riseup.net</strong> <a href=""https://help.riseup.net/security/network-security/tor/hs-addresses-signed.txt"">has an .onion equivalent</a> for all servers and URLs they offer and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Tor Project</strong> itself has an official .onion address to access its site, <a href=""http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion"">here</a>. (at least it doesn't work at this time, perhaps it has been removed or for the time being is inactive.)</li>
<li><strong>Whonix.org</strong> <a href=""https://www.whonix.org/blog/hidden-service-taken-offline"">until recently, (and not again until a certain issues with hidden service scability are fixed)</a>, also offered their site to be accessed via a .onion URL.</li>
<li><strong>The Pirate Bay</strong> has an official .onion mirror which it has been operating since 2012.</li>
<li><strong>Wikileaks</strong> from time to time have also had mirrors set up by either an endorsed partner of theirs, or possibly other supporters.</li>
<li><strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> has an official .onion URL from which to use <a href=""https://duckduckgo.com/"">its service</a>, <a href=""http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/"">http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But when a connection is made between a Tor user and a hidden service that also hosts that same webserver in non-anonymous DNS namespace (i.e. revealing the hidden service's outfacing IP), involving DNS lookups outside Tor, and with security protocols totally separate to Tor, do any of those clearnet 'compromises' somehow translate to the user connecting only to the hidden service side of the webserver? How insulated is the Tor-facing 'side' of the webserver from the clearnet-facing 'side'?</p>

<p>I can't imagine DNS lookups occur (and thus DNS metadata being snoopable by standard backbone sniffing), but I can think of data on the server database (user account details) being more vulnerable due to having less hops (or no hops) between its domain name and its real server IP (and no Tor encryption compared to simple server proxying either), and also wonder whether serving HTTPS on an .onion domain somehow translates to the user downloading the self-signed certificate from  the server's DNS space instead of onion space too.</p>

<p>If the service can manage only operating in .onion namespace, is it advantageous, from the users' point of view?</p>

<p>The first example of this image (Tor -> VPN), the Tor exit node would only see the previous node, and the Entry one(me) would be safe. Right? The VPN would never find out about me.</p>

<p>In the second example, the VPN knows who I really am and that I'm connected to a Tor network. Could they in anyway trace a profile of me and know everything I do? </p>

"censorship and tbb exit nodes.","<p>The three gifts that tor and tbb give are anonymity, privacy and no censorship or so I believed. For last few days/weeks I have been observing that quite a few domains don't work on tor anymore. While part of the answer may lie in domain takedowns and I suspect many are, but does censorship apply to rules of exit node. Just for e.g. let's say I'm sitting in Sri Lanka, using tor circuits out of any of the 140 countries where tor has a presence, for e.g. say using Germany as the exit node by chance. Now would censorship of Germany be applied to the requst for a site or am I mis-understanding something ?  I do know that in-between it's all encrypted communication through and through (https) but still is some leakage possible ?</p>

"Tor router and exit nodes","<p>I just finished <a href=""https://twit.tv/shows/know-how/episodes/301?autostart=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a project to make a Raspberry Pi into a Tor router</a> and I am curious about technical aspects of Tor that I do not understand. I know how to switch the exit node in Tor Browser during a single browsing session and I think the exit node changes whenever I close and open the browser. However, when one uses Tor for something like the router example, when and for what reasons might the exit node change? For obvious reasons, I am concerned that the exit node would remain constant and degrade anonymity. In an ideal world, I would prefer to have the router change exit nodes at a random internal of up to 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Two questions.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Whenever I take a look at <a href=""http://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/</a> I regularly see illegal downloads listed besides all legal torrents I am seeding. Is it possible that because I am running an Entry Guard, my IP address is somehow identified as the host downloading the torrent? I was thinking that maybe a bittorrent client reports its current IP address to the tracker, which in case TOR is used, maybe is the IP address of the Entry Guard? Or do I need to check with my housemates if they have anything to do with this.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to validate whether this is the case I thought of temporarily disabling my server being an Entry Guard. However, when checking the configuration/manual/StackOverflow, I cannot identify any setting which makes it possible to disable this. Is there such setting so my server literally only runs a relay and not also an Entry Guard?</p></li>

"How sending form data over HTTPS using TOR works","<p>I understand in general how TOR works, with creating a circuit from the client using 3 random nodes in the TOR network - the entry node, some internal node, and an exit node.</p>

<p>My question is about how HTTPS works with TOR, and specifically whether or not the data sent to the end server is actually secure.</p>

<p>The way I assume it works, the HTTPS session is created between the exit node (the 3rd node in the circuit) and the target server, but that means this 3rd node can actually see all the data I'm sending as cleartext, including any form data (e.g. credit card numbers, passwords etc.), it then takes that cleartext data and uses the HTTPS/SSL protocols to send it securely to the target server.</p>

<p>Am I wrong/missing something?
Is all the data I'm sending to the end server visible to the TOR exit node, even when browsing to an HTTPS connection?</p>

<ul>
<li>To be 100% clear - I'm talking about a case where I'm using TOR to connect to an HTTPS website OUTSIDE of TOR, as connecting to .onion addresses already ensures e2e encryption without the need for HTTPS.</li>

"Making Data Transactions Ambiguous","<p>I just signed up on the TOR StackExchange. Let me preface my question by warning everybody that I am not a technical expert and apologizing in advance if some of my assumptions are incorrect or naive.</p>

<p>From what I understand about TOR, a user could potentially be de-anonymized in the following scenario (however improbable it may be):</p>

<p>A TOR circuit consists of 3 nodes connecting the user and the clearnet. If, hypothetically, all 3 nodes were compromised (or even the entry and exit node), being operated and monitored by an adversarial entity, then it could be ascertained that a certain file of a known file size was downloaded from the exit node. If several milliseconds later your Internet Provider has a record of you downloading a file of the exact same size and this information can be statistically determined, well, your anonymity is more or less compromised.</p>

<p>My question is, couldn't something along the lines of the following scheme be implemented to combat this?</p>

<p>Suppose at every node, as well as on the user's computer a random amount of ""noise"" data was tacked on to the packet before its encryption. Too prevent too much data from being appended and causing lag within the system, the data would need to be within a determined range, between some minimum and maximum value (a minimum value would not hide the actual size of the meaningful data packet well enough, one might argue). Then, at every step in the proxy chain, the data is unscrambled by a random amount (again within a given range of permissible values) is subducted and/or added on to the noise, repackaged, and sent along. Would this be possible to implement, and would it successfully spoof adversaries endeavoring to conduct malicious statistical analysis?</p>

<p>I do not know if what I have proposed is nonsense, technically impossible to implement, due to some consideration of which I am simply not aware. My ignorance may be apparent. But if it is possible, why not implement this as part of the TOR infrastructure? It would serve to strengthen anonymity in this increasingly Orwellian madhouse of a world.</p>

<p>Of course, someone has probably thought of this all before. It would then have been rejected for good reason, I'm sure. I appreciate any feedback on this matter. Thank you.</p>

"ZeroDay exploits and how do we stay safe from them","<p>Tor is a browser that guarantees anonymity if used properly. But today I stumbled upon a piece of code which is claimed to be a Zero day exploit for Tor browser.</p>

<p>It can be located by the following link.
<a href=""https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-November/042639.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2016-November/042639.html</a></p>

<p>As a person who takes privacy very seriously, I am scared to use Tor and Tor like services simply because I can be easily exposed should any of these vulnerabilities are exploited. But, we have no choice other than these services either. Right now, this exploit is still active and working.</p>

<p>My question is specific. Can there be a method to use the internet securely without failing under these zero day exploits?</p>

<p>p.s. in a case like this, shouldn't we at least put a notification via Tor Browser to its users asking them to refrain using the service until everything is fixed? I understand it may take away the trust from some users, but its better than exposing them.</p>

"Why does Tor Browser auto-reset DisableNetwork setting to 1 after Tor Browser Exit?","<p>1.) Why does my Tor Browser auto-reset the <code>DisableNetwork</code> setting to ""1"" after Tor Browser shutsdown for a clean ""Exit""? </p>

<p>2.) How should I stop this settings auto-reset behavior so I do not have to re-edit the <code>torrc</code> configuration file every time I want to start Tor Browser?  </p>

<p>3.) Does my manually resetting <code>DisableNetwork</code> to 0 before I restart Tor Browser harm my Tor online security settings in any way?</p>

<p>I run WinXP Home SP3 with local Administrator rights &amp; the latest MS patches are up to date with the latest Tor Browser version 5.5.1.  As far as I know, the McAfee Anti-Virus software I have installed does not interfere with Tor Browser or its settings.  I have enabled the MS Security Center to enable ports 80, 443 for Tor Browser and <code>obsf4</code> use.  </p>

<p>Whenever I successfully open Tor Browser and eventually close Tor when I am finished, the <code>DisableNetwork</code> setting always auto-resets from 0 to 1 for no apparent reason.  All other Tor Browser settings and changes are correctly saved, but not the <code>DisableNetwork</code> setting.  No file or app error is listed in the WinXP system/app event log and <code>DisableNetwork</code> is not located in Firefox's <code>about:config</code>.  The only Tor Browser listing for <code>DisableNetwork</code> is in <code>torrc</code> settings file.  This unannounced <code>DisableNetwork</code> settings change prevents me from restarting Tor Browser unless I manually edit the <code>Torrc</code> file.</p>

<p>As a result, I only have 2 or 3 options to successfully restart Tor Browser.  </p>

<p>The first option is to edit the text file <code>c:\documents and settings\test user\desktop\tor browser\browser\torbrowser\data\tor\torrc</code> to change the <code>DisableNetwork</code> setting from 1 to 0.  Tor Browser will then run correctly after I make the <code>DisableNetwork</code> setting change. However <code>DisableNetwork</code> will later change back 1 when the Tor app is closed.</p>

<p>The second option is more tedious &amp; time consuming, where I have to reinstall Tor Browser through a TorProject.org update or upgrade. Upon successful startup, I then have to reconfigure Tor Browser as if it is a totally new install of the software.</p>

<p>A third option after Tor Browser shutdown could be to create a batch file to copy a pre-saved <code>torrc</code> file that includes <code>DisableNetwork 0</code> to overwrite the original <code>torrc</code> file.  However, this is a temporary workaround and not a solution to why the <code>DisableNetwork</code> setting changes.</p>

<p>Any suggestion would be appreciated!  I have experienced this same <code>DisableNetwork</code> settings problem when using Tor for the past several years...</p>

"Me -> My own VPN -> Tor","<p>I know there is a lot of question regarding VPN+Tor and this is a bit different.</p>

<p>I use a VPN to connect to the internet for multiple reasons, mostly to encrypt my traffic on local networks (public wifi, ...). The VPN is on a dedicated server I own and run a linux distribution I fully control. I am the only one to have access to that server.</p>

<p>The problem is that my VPN IP address is strongly linked with my identity : the IP address is linked (with direct and reverse DNS) to a domain name related to my name (eg. john-doe.com) . So whenever I use my VPN the website I visit can know my identity. Thus all my online activities can be linked (and easily, just with my IP) to my real identity.</p>

<p>I could remove the DNS informations but it's usefull for various services I use on that server.</p>

<p>I could also set up a fresh server with no DNS name but in that case it would still be possible to track me (with fore efforts) by contacting the server hoster which has my payment data.</p>

<p>My Idea is to use Tor on that server so all internet from the VPN connection would be routed by Tor. Will it be a good idea ? How to do that ? Should I use a fresh server with no DNS information or I will be safe with my current VPN ?</p>

All I see in it is ""Temporarily allow all this page"" and options to disable already enabled sites. If I want to enable it on the current site, I have to permanently enable all the page and then disable what I don't want, and these exceptions are not stored permanently. Plus it is time consuming.

"Configuring Firefox to access Tor network and SSH tunnel server","<p>I would like to access the Tor network (hidden services/.onion sites) and Http sites using Firefox. I currently route Firefox and a download manager to access Http sites through an SSH tunnel server. I can also access the Tor network with the <strong><em>Tor Browser</em></strong> and access .onion sites. But I haven't figured out how to route Firefox to access both the Tor network (.onion) and Http sites seamlessly. I  have tried to configure ProxyCap (Freecap for Mac) to do this but am not sure how to configure it to enable Firefox to do this. Everything I've tried has only been partially successful. I've read that generally you want to route traffic according to this protocol ...Firefox -> Tor -> Proxycap -> SSH server to prevent DNS leaks, etc. Is this correct? If so what are general configuration settings? </p>

"Tor dying on Raspberry Pi (circuit creation storm, out of memory)","<p><strong>UPD:</strong> this question was regarding an older version of Tor (0.2.4.24). With a newer version (which was 0.2.7.2-alpha for me) the problem disappeared.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am running Tor (0.2.4.24) relay on Raspberry Pi (Raspbian). Once every 5-10 days the Tor daemon disappears and I have to restart it manually. I looked into the recent occurrence and found the following.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Atlas says there were bursts of activity before the disappearance:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ARLRv.png"" alt=""Atlas plot of relay activity"">
The bursts occupied the entire relay bandwidth (80k).</p></li>
<li><p><code>dmesg</code> says there were too many connections:</p>

<pre><code>[Thu Jan 29 16:24:22 2015] smsc95xx 1-1.1:1.0 eth0: kevent 2 may have been dropped
...  several lines like this ...

[Thu Jan 29 16:50:49 2015] net_ratelimit: 3123 callbacks suppressed
</code></pre>

<p>This repeated several times before <code>oom_killer</code> was invoked and killed <code>tor</code>. (80 is my dir port.)</p></li>
<li><p>The last heartbeat lines in the Tor log before the killing were:</p>

<pre><code>Jan 30 13:59:14.000 [notice] Heartbeat: Tor's uptime is 6 days 6:00 hours, with 2110 circuits open. I've sent 2.17 GB and received 4.69 GB.

</code></pre>

<p>Before the bursts started, the log was saying:</p>

<pre><code>Jan 29 13:59:14.000 [notice] Heartbeat: Tor's uptime is 5 days 6:00 hours, with 140 circuits open. I've sent 1.17 GB and received 1.28 GB.

</code></pre>

<p>Note the difference in TAP and NTor values in just one day.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Was it an attack? Or was it just a normal burst of load?</p></li>
<li><p>How to configure Tor relay in Raspbian to avoid it dying like this? Would it help configuring parameters such as <code>MaxOnionQueueDelay</code> and <code>MaxMemInQueues</code>?</p></li>
</ol>

"Is (provider rotating) DNSCrypt inside Whonix superior privacy-wise to defaulting to Tor exit nodes' DNS?","<p>I use Whonix.</p>

<p>I am interested in making clearnet traffic as private from third parties other than the sites I visit, as possible. This not only includes the NSA, but also third-party DNS providers which may log, and even likely be willing to share this information with NSA (such as Google's DNS or OpenDNS), but even just by virtue of hte traffic being unencrypted over the Internet and thus, no matter how well-meaning, still sniffable by anyone on the pipes between you and the DNS provider(s) used by your particular Tor exit node at the time.</p>

<p>Whonix's <a href=""https://www.whonix.org/wiki/FAQ#Can_I_use_DNSCrypt_in_Whonix.3F"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki advice</a> on running DNSCrypt within the VM makes a good point that using DNSCrypt for Tor browsing may not be as advantageous as one may first think.</p>

<p>But if you trust a DNS provider (or a rotating array of them, such as the DNSCrypt community), who not only promises to be logless/less logging and is smaller, security-focused, generally donation-based, AND uses a protocol that at least doesn't broadcast your queried sites with a megaphone on the wires while you communicate with it, wouldn't it still be better?</p>

<p>The question is: do I share what websites my (rotating) Tor IP addresses visit, with MANY highly insecure DNS providers (distributing the inevitable across many providers, even though it's totally sniffable, poisonable, and most likely logged), or with ONE highly secure DNS provider where the traffic is indeed far less likely to be leaked, logged, or sniffed?</p>

<p>It is mind-boggling to think through the ramifications of either choice, privacy and anonymity-wise. NSA would have more information with unencrypted DNS requests to later match to other inevitable clearnet metadata like HTTPS requests between your rotating Tor IPs and the servers you request to start HTTPS sessions with - and of course, all other unencrypted TCP traffic you may visit already. (like apt-get updates)</p>

<p>My idea is to make a simple script (in configuring and restarting dnscrypt-proxy) to rotate through <a href=""https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv"" rel=""noreferrer"">different DNSCrypt providers</a> each day or logon session (or activity that I want to seriously de-correlate to other ones, if uncomfortably close in time to  each other), distributing the 'power' and required trust aptly warned on the Whonix wiki, to several providers and not just one.</p>

<p>Could that be combining the best of both worlds and be the <strong>very best</strong> solution for DNS privacy and security, on Tor?</p>

"Hosting Tor and Web service on separate machines security issues","<p>I've read that it's best to host Tor and your website service on separate machines and then point your torrc file to your web host (host where website files are stored). It's quite possible that my Tor machine and web host will be geographically separate. Assuming my web host has a public IP of say 41.14.44.11, I would change my Tor host machine settings to:</p>

<pre><code>HiddenServiceDir /Library/Tor/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 80 41.14.44.11:8080
</code></pre>

<p>My question: Does this mean that my Tor machine will have to go out onto the clearnet to connect to my web host and then receive the data back from the host and then serve it to my visitors, essentially making it a sort of ""exit node"" to connect to my web host?
This would be very bad for security and anonymity. The data between the Tor host and web host will also be plain text unless SSL is implemented between the two, correct? Or how would you ensure encryption for the data from the web host back into Tor?</p>

<p>Would it not be possible (and better) to also set up Tor on the web host machine and then point the Tor host machine to the .onion link of my web host, thus keeping all the traffic inside the Tor network and essentially turning the Tor machine into a sort of proxy while still making it secure so that if my Tor service was to be compromised my webhost would still be safe? Like so:</p>

But using this latest browser it did not say this any longer, the short link just went through ok.</p>

<p>When I downloaded it from the TOR link, when I said I could not see the scripts option on the left, it was because on the version I downloaded it was on the right of the window??</p>

<p>Now if I go to the link you posted and download from there the window is back to how it used to be with the scripts option on the left next to the green onion?
<a href=""https://torproject.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://torproject.org/</a></p>

<p>Also if you go to both options to download and then click on the Home tab the headers/banners are different?

In either one of them I download. all the changes I made to security etc is still the same on either download. A bit confusing if you can follow all that.
I should say Im on a Mac running Yosemite.</p>

<p>EDIT 2
I have downloaded the browser using both options and they are both the same now. but the were definitely different slightly. Wish I had taken a screen capture now.
Do you think the one could not have been the real browser bundle? but woth went to the same download url
One the first one the privacy slider was at the top like it has always been on the older versions, but on the link you gave the slider is at the lowest setting.
Funny how the privacy slider was at the top but the main browser window was different with the script option on the right of the screen</p>

<p>Last Edit
Ok last question..I hope and I do really appreciate your help.
If I delete the tor browser bundle and also delete the tor browser bundle and secure delete them on my mac, is there any trace of tor left on my mac, as in thumbnail images etc (nothing dodgy) 
I may re-enstall it at a later date.

"DNS in Tor and Tor Browser","<p>If I look for DNS leaks when using Tor Browser, I find none. For example, if I connect to <a href=""https://dnsleaktest.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dnsleaktest.com</a> in Tor Browser, using even the most lax of the <a href=""https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">security settings</a>, the DNS servers that are reported are all completely different than those I usually use from my ISP. In fact, I get the impression that the DNS is provided by the usual DNS service of whatever Tor Exit Node I'm routed through.</p>

<p>In contrast, VPNs on Linux <em>always</em> seem to leak the DNS. Despite testing the advice of numerous different purported solutions (such as <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/434916/how-to-fix-openvpn-dns-leak"">this</a>, <a href=""https://www.pcsuggest.com/check-and-fix-dns-leak-linux/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=293887"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>) I have found none that works, perhaps because the answers to the questions are (or appear at least) to be provided by people who have found ad-hoc solutions rather than by experts in OpenVPN. In particular, no modifications of the relevant OpenVPN config files seems to inhibit leakage of the DNS. Although cursory check with <a href=""https://dnsleaktest.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dnsleaktest.com</a> often suggest that the DNS is <em>not</em> being leaked, using the more extensive test that's provided shows that the DNS is actually being served by my regular ISP.</p>

<p>In Windows, the situation is a bit better with regard to using a VPN. The supplied desktop applications of several VPN providers have an option to use their own DNS servers, and no leakage is apparent. Likewise, inserting <code>block-outside-dns</code> into the relevant OpenVPN config file (under Windows) seems to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Questions: (1) Does Tor itself prevent the DNS leak, or is it the total environment provided by the Tor Browser bundle that prevents it?
(2) How is the DNS leakage prevented? (3) Is the method transferable to preventing the DNS leak when using a VPN with Linux?</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I'm not the least bit interested in running <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorPlusVPN"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tor in conjunction with a VPN</a>, either before, or after the Tor connection.

"Tor usage in North Korea as a foreigner","<p>I'd like to ask your opinion on whether it's a good idea or not to use the TAILS operating system (which comes with Tor buit in) while on my trip as a tourist to North Korea.

"Why is my Tor bridge relay not getting any traffic?","<p>I used to run a Tor bridge on Windows at home, where I have a 300/150 Mbps ISP. This Windows has memory leak and crashes after some hours, ad I believe that was making my bridge never get traffic.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I moved it to a Ubuntu server, also at home. I use uptimerobot.com to monitor if its port is reachable from outside and healthchecks.io to monitor if traffic entering from its local SOCKS port is reaching check.torproject.org. It's always up and reachable.</p>

<p>But nyx reports it's rarely getting any traffic, and its bandwidth never surpasses 1KB/s. Its log heartbeat reports very little download and upload and always claims to has seen 0 unique clients. But how come, if my healthchecks.io monitor's curl call uses it every few minutes?</p>

<p>metrics.torproject.org reports correct dates and uptime. Advertised Bandwidth is 58KB/s, way above what nyx reports. Flags are Fast, Running, V2Dir, Valid.</p>

<p>What might be wrong? Or is it normal for a Tor bridge relay be this idle? This is my torrc removing identifiable data.</p>

"Hidden services : clear text, or not, at the rendez-vous point?","<p>Most common descriptions, including nice looking graphics, of the communication with Tor hidden services are framed in terms of high-level ""<em>Tor circuits</em>"" which obscure rather than help understand the underlying mechanisms, in this questioner's naive opinion. In this question instead let's please focus on the contents of TCP/IP packets exchanged :</p>

<p>Assume <em>Tor-user</em> retrieving some clear text file, <em>hello.text</em>, from server <em>qw…rty.onion</em>, using some unencrypted protocol over TCP, say, the HTTP. Let's peek - like, with that <em>ethereal</em> thing - at the data packets which are part of this transfer along the whole path (excluding the end-points). Are the contents retrievable in the clear <em>anywhere</em>, in particular, at the ""<em>rendez-vous</em>"" point ? Or does Tor ""onion"" layered  encryption somehow apply over the whole (2 ""circuits"") path ? Please explain...</p>

<p>Edited after suggestion by C.I. that this may be a duplicate. I do not think so. The other question was about encryption of requested hidden service URIs, this is about the encryption of contents. Also, the other question said : ""I understand that all of the communication between a client and a hidden service (.onion) takes place within the Tor network and is therefore end-to-end encrypted."" - but this is exactly what is in doubt with this here question : are data really encrypted end-to-end by the onion protocol (that would be six-level deep onion encryption) ? Or rather are they decrypted (in the clear) in the middle, at the junction point (rendez-vous), before being reinjected, reencrypted for the other ""circuit"" (3 level deep encryption)  ?</p>

"Can I prevent Tor from building single-hop circuits?","<p>Despite the manual's declared defaults [below], <code>Onion Circuits</code> shows single hop circuits being ""Built"" by Tor. So I have edited my <code>torrc</code> to specifically include <code>ExcludeSingleHopRelays 1</code> and <code>AllowSingleHopCircuits 0</code>. Yet <code>Onion Circuits</code> <em><strong>still</strong></em> shows them being <em>""Built""</em>.</p>

<p>Careful observation of the (often four?) initial one-hop circuits that are built at Tails boot (presumably used to ""build consensus"" as to which of them will continue on to be my ""guard"" for that session) tells me that the one-hop circuits that Tor will <em><strong>still</strong></em> build later in that particular session <em><strong>ARE</strong> from</em> those initial four [at least the ones where I've noticed a later one-hop].</p>

<p>So I guess I can see why Tor builds those initially. While I understand that my IP is known to my ""guard"", why do those other potential candidates check in again later, and <em>build one-hop circuits?</em></p>

<p>I am using Tails 2.9.1, and the <code>torrc</code> file at <code>etc/tor/torrc</code>. Other edits to that file function.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">manual</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ExcludeSingleHopRelays 0|1</p>
  
  <p>This option controls whether circuits built by Tor will include relays with the AllowSingleHopExits flag set to true. If ExcludeSingleHopRelays is set to 0, these relays will be included. Note that these relays might be at higher risk of being seized or observed, so they are not normally included. Also note that relatively few clients turn off this option, so using these relays might make your client stand out. (Default: 1)</p>
  
  <p>AllowSingleHopCircuits 0|1</p>
  
  <p>When this option is set, the attached Tor controller can use relays that have the AllowSingleHopExits option turned on to build one-hop Tor connections. (Default: 0)</p>

"How can I explain the meaning of Tor to my grandma?","<p>I wrote a book about Tor, and my proud grandma wanted to have a copy. So she got it, said ""What a beautiful picture on the cover!"" and - ""What is this, Tor?"".</p>

<p>She doesn't know a word about cryptography, never used a computer. But she uses a web browser from her smartphone. How can I explain what makes Tor special to a non-technical person? I don't mean introducing in using, and the existing question ""What is Tor?"" with its answers is still much too technical.</p>

<p>Such challenges are not rare. I need to explain to my boss why I request some days off to go to a Tor conference, and soon my daughter will want to know why daddy is so excited about his Tor Browser. My girlfriend needs to understand why I spend so much time researching Tor.</p>

"VPN over Tor Firewall Config","<p>I'm looking for some help with accessing my VPN over tor.  A little background..</p>

<p>I have a router at home that I can connect to which routes all of my traffic over tor.  The router uses port 9030.  My VPN is hosted on DigitalOcean.  Using OpenVPN on an Ubuntu 14.04 droplet.  I'm using tunnelblick to access my VPN. I'm also using uncomplicated firewall (ufw) on my VPN on DigitalOcean.</p>

<p>Here's the issue; I've tried opening port 9030, 9040, 9001 etc. on my firewall for my VPN but tunnelblick's status just says ""Waiting for authorization from server"" and never gets any response back.  I think it's my firewall but when I checked the firewall logs I can never find the exit node IP that connects to the VPN.  </p>

"Tor is only assigning circuits from a very limited subset of exit nodes","<p>I am researching Tor, and as part of my research I was curious how many distinct exit relays a real-world client would include in building circuits. For my purposes, I am only interested in US exit nodes.</p>

<p>I found this project: <a href=""https://github.com/mattes/rotating-proxy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mattes/rotating-proxy</a>, which load balances proxy requests across multiple Tor instances. Specifically, HAProxy load balances over N polipo instances connected to the SOCKS port of N tor instances:</p>

<pre><code>                          &lt;-&gt; Polipo 1 &lt;-socks-&gt; Tor Proxy 1
Client &lt;-http-&gt;  HAproxy  &lt;-&gt; Polipo 2 &lt;-socks-&gt; Tor Proxy 2
                          &lt;-&gt; Polipo n &lt;-socks-&gt; Tor Proxy n
</code></pre>

<p>I modified the Tor arguments in order to maximize the diversity of exit nodes:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/sbin/tor
    --SocksPort {PORT}

    # Allow creating new circuits after 30 seconds
    --NewCircuitPeriod 30

    # Never reuse a circuit older than 120 seconds
    --MaxCircuitDirtiness 120

    # Only use exit nodes in the US
    --ExitNodes {us}

    # Do not operate an exit relay
    --ExitRelay 0

    # Allow exit nodes not in the consensus
    --RefuseUnknownExits 0

    # Operate in client mode only
    --ClientOnly 1

    # Interpret the above ExitNodes argument strictly (nly US)
    --StrictNodes 1

    # Allow exit nodes supporting single hop circuits (idk if this does anything)
    --AllowSingleHopCircuits 1

    --DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/10011
    --PidFile /var/run/tor/10011.pid
    --Log warn syslog
    --RunAsDaemon 1
</code></pre>

<p>The test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start the rotating proxy with 100 tor backends</li>
<li>Repeatedly request <code>ipinfo.io/json</code> through the rotating proxy, log the IP address</li>
<li>Sort the resulting file by unique IP addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>Result after 30 minutes:</p>

<ul>
<li>1581 total requests</li>
<li>66 unique IP addresses</li>
</ul>

<p>Checking the haproxy stats page confirms that requests are being load balanced across all 100 tor instances.</p>

<p>Given that there are 500+ unique exit relays in the USA, I would expect far more unique IP addresses. </p>

<p>Why are there only 66 unique IP addresses? It appears that Tor is not rebuilding circuits as often as it should be, according to the arguments. Or it is rebuilding circuits, but keeping the same exit nodes.</p>

<p>Could it be because polipo is keeping a persistent socks connection?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I made some improvements and am now seeing better performance. I am still curious if I'm missing anything.</p>

<p>Improvements I made:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>polipo was caching the ipinfo.io requests for each proxy, which obviously makes it hard to test if the IP is changing... I fixed this by adding <code>ipinfo.io</code> to <code>/etc/polipo/uncachable</code> and doing all further tests on my own test server that explicitly forces clients to NOT cache responses</p></li>
<li><p>I enabled the control port on each tor instance so that the daemonized docker script can periodically force a circuit change by sending the <code>newnym</code> signal to the control port ) via <a href=""https://www.thesprawl.org/research/tor-control-protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thesprawl.org/research/tor-control-protocol</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the new args:</p>

<pre><code>""--NewCircuitPeriod 15"",
""--MaxCircuitDirtiness 15"",
""--NumEntryGuards 8"",
""--CircuitBuildTimeout 5"",
""--ExitNodes {us}"",
""--ExitRelay 0"",
""--RefuseUnknownExits 0"",
""--ClientOnly 1"",
""--StrictNodes 1"",
""--AllowSingleHopCircuits 1"",
</code></pre>

<p>So far the test has sent 175 requests, with 61 unique IPs... far better than before, in terms of percentages. We'll see.</p>

<p>In this case, the traffic is fully end to end encrypted, but is it only the data that are encrypted, or the onions address also ? For me, the onion address is a metadata, and not usefull information, so maybe it's not encrypted and we could get these metadatas ?</p>

"Security Risk or Not?","<p><p>Given the server foot-printing that MIT has recently discovered, and the fact that we know that they have been found to be in cahoots with at least one intelligence service (i.e. The FBI) Whats to say then that they aren't ongoing in their escapades? And further, given MIT's methodology of rogue nodes, whats to say that several intel services of various countries don't act in concert, providing part of the necessary rogue nodes in order to pull a sibyl / traffic confirmation attack, or any other theoretical attacks, for that matter, by simply sharing information, thus allowing the rogue nodes to appear less suspicious?</p><p> and yet Tor doesn't appear to have any defense against this sort of thing. It would seem to me that the best thing to do would to be to block government agencies from using Tor all together, but yet this may be interpreted as some to go against Tor's anti-censorship mission.</p><p>What do you think about this? Is Tor doing enough to protect it's users, or does it seem the whole concept needs to be overhauled?<p></p>

<p>This problem is that my python program would access various different websites, and <strong>one of them is even in the LAN.</strong></p>

<p>By default, Tor will reject access to local addresses, and therefore I'll need to use its public IP/DNS. But What I really want is that <strong>Tor would just redirect the requests to the normal un-torified network</strong>.</p>

"Detect Tor from a LAN proxy","<p>I have a quick question I hope has not been asked yet.</p>

<p>Let's assume there is a network such this: there is a pc (let's call it X) which is part of a wide LAN; to connect to the internet, it must go through a proxy which blocks (and logs) connections to forbidden IPs.
Now, on the pc X there is Tor; it must use the proxy to work as well, but when it tries to connect the proxy blocks Tor IP; therefore it is set up with bridge relays (got by email, not the public ones). In such a way, the connection to any of the forbidden IPs is successful (the proxy doesn't block the relays IPs).</p>

<p>The question is: even though the PC X is reaching an IP which shouldn't be reached, since the proxy logs ALL traffic, is there a way to know from logs that the PC X is using Tor?
What kind of traffic does the proxy see actually? Is the traffic encrypted or something?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>adversaries (like the NSA) that can see large segments of the Internet

<p>Will Guard ( first node ) try to hide next hop from global adversaries ? 
E.g. by sending 3 or more similar messages to the next nodes, where only one of them is a real middle-node ( second node ) ? </p>

<p>Is Tor network making any noise to confuse global adversaries ?</p>

<p>I'm talking about <code>timing-attack</code>:</p>

<p>Say, delays on transmissions would help, but would increase latency and aren't currently supported by TOR.</p>

<p>Would <code>noise traffic</code>, say increase load of network in 3x, be helpful against <code>timing attack</code>? <code>One in / Four Out</code>....  <code>One in / Fourteen out</code>... <code>One in / Forty out</code></p>

"Custom cryptography for Hidden services","<p>Tor support AES for symmetric cryptography which is fine but for asymmetric cryptography we might prefer something else (I guess now its RSA1024 which is almost broken and proposals are saying to replace it with ECC in the future). </p>

"Do Tor hidden service directories (HSDirs) see the REAL IP of users who visit .onion sites?","<p>I'm reading <a href=""http://www.antitree.com/how-tor-does-dns-the-breaking-bad-way/"">here</a> about Tor's 'DNS' resolving mechanisms (for both clearnet and hidden services) .</p>

<p>The mechanism for connecting to a hidden service itself (via a rendezvous point in a 7-hop circuit without the need for an exit node), I am clear on.</p>

<p>But, the step before that is finding out what its 'location' is (or rather, instructions for how to initiate a connection with the hidden service you're looking up), in the first place - Tor's equivalent of DNS.</p>

<p>In the afore-mentioned link, this line greatly bothered me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Aaron’s client</strong> checks the <strong>Hidden Service Directory Server</strong> to see if the address exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After more searching, I found <a href=""http://donncha.is/2013/05/trawling-tor-hidden-services/"">this excellent 2013 research</a>, which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A client who would like to retrieve the full HS descriptor will calculate the time based descriptor id <strong>and will request it from the
  responsible HSDir’s directly</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the official Tor HS protocol outline page <strong>(https:// torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en)</strong>, the info is more vague, stating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After [first learning about its onion address], the client can initiate connection establishment <strong>by downloading the descriptor from the distributed hash table</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gives the impression of a decentralized distribution of descriptor information like Freenet, but maybe it is only distributed between HSDirs and that still says nothing of whether real IPs are linked to descriptor lookups or not.</p>

<p>So what are the facts here?</p>

<p>Is there any part of the process in which the original, non-Tor IP address of a Tor user, <strong>directly</strong> contacts a Tor HSDir (or another node for that matter), for the purpose of a direct request and retrieval of the descriptor of a given .onion address? If not, then which node in the chain does the HSDir see for that request, and is the original client's IP obfuscated to that node which has to know the onion address themselves?</p>

<p>If yes, this would be an <strong>extremely serious breach of anonymity for the <em>entire</em> Tor network</strong>. It is one thing to know virtually every .onion site in existence by operating a HSDir (under the current code anyway); it is another to know all the real IP addresses of those who visit them.</p>

<p>It would be ironic if Tor protected the IP addresses of users on clearnet by having DNS requests performed by the same IP as is doing the browsing (i.e. the Tor exit node), but not for hidden services themselves. If so, it would make sense to apply the same 'layered encryption' onion mechanism to descriptor requests also. (So have the exit node, or the same node as will be the rendezvous, make them.)</p>

<p>And on a related note, are the request (and response) packets between the client and the HSDir <strong>encrypted</strong> (similarly to HTTPS or DNSCrypt), or are the requests transported as plaintext directly to the HSDir server and thus readable by the user's ISP, global wiretapping adversaries and all other usual MITM suspects?</p>

"Blocked Tor exit nodes","<p>I know of several services that block traffic from Tor exit nodes including, as of a couple of months ago, the <a href=""http://www.austlii.edu.au"" rel=""nofollow"">Australian Legal Information Institute</a>. It's a sad state of affairs given that there are people whose countries block their access to information about the law of other nations and who try to use Tor to circumvent censorship, now only to find themselves stymied by the host that they are trying to reach.</p>

<p>I am familiar with the development by Tor researchers of means of circumventing censorship and giving access to Tor guards. Is there any similar development relating to the exit nodes? For example, one could envisage a changing series of hosts (a kind of ""exit bridge"" similar to existing bridges) that <em>only</em> accepted traffic from Tor exit nodes ... before passing the traffic on to intended sites.</p>

<p>Am I foolishly hopeful, or is the concept either (i) dead in the water for reasons that I can't envisage, or (ii) already developed? </p>

"Tor no longer secure, but can this be fixed?","<p>In a recent episode of a podcast called Security Now (#493: Tor: Not so Anonymous), they claimed that traffic can be delayed in unique ways to identify which client IP address on one side of the Tor onion is communicating with which server IP on the other side. So basically they insert gaps in the data transfers and look for gaps going to client IPs. Somehow or other Cisco's Netflow feature is involved.</p>

<p>Here's an idea:</p>

<p>To solve this deanonymization problem, why not have Tor clients simply always be uploading and downloading packets at a steady beat e.g. every 10 milliseconds, regardless of whether any meaningful data is really being sent? Of course the exit node would have to play along with this charade, accepting and sending packets even if there is no need. The tor process running on the client would have to be able to drop incoming ""dummy"" packets, as well as send them; same for the exit node's tor process.</p>

<p>Would this fix the Tor deanonymization problem?</p>

"Uniqueness of your PC comparing Tor vs JonDo","<p>When checking my PC on Panopticlick, I could see that even using Tor does not make my PC more anonymous...</p>

<p>...using JonDo, however, and visiting Panopticlick, my PC was less identifiably unique than when using Tor.</p>

<p>JonDo mentions things like using different fonts.</p>

<p>Is it possible for Tor to make similar changes so that your PC is less identifiable?</p>

<p>I'm not a computer geek, so maybe I'm getting something wrong here?</p>

<p>P.S. I tagged this post with ""tag"" because I was not allowed to use relevant tags, like JonDo, Uniqueness, Identifiable, Fonts etc.</p>

<p>==================================================================================</p>

<p>re  two answers so far:</p>

<p>""Try JonDoFox with Tor""? > Meaning? In what way? They're two separate browsers.</p>

<p>""Tor Browser also erases browser uniqueness, but maybe it leaks more than JonDoFox"" >
My test was using each browser at Panopticlick. Tor's access showed that my PC was unique. Following the advice in the 2nd reply, below, I change a font and had my anonymity marginally improved. JonDo's access significantly improved my identifiability...i.e. more computers like mine when accessing that site. Roya's link to JonDo test is where I got info re fonts from beforehand. It mentioned choosing Arial, Sans serif and Helvetica (from memory) as ones to choose. Only see Arial though in settings.</p>

<p>As stated, I'm not tech minded. Not sure how Tor's/JonDo's safety re IP address hangs with issue of how identifiable your PC is. In other words, if your IP address is not your own, is that protection enough? What if a site can see that you have a unique computer? What about MAC idenitifiablity?</p>

"TOR Hidden Service: IP anonymity","<p>Suppose that a Tor client wants to access a certain hidden service. According to the protocol, instead of submitting a request directly to the server IP (which is hidden<sup>[1][2]</sup>), this client submit a request via a series of relays. </p>

<p>However, at some point, there will be a final relay in charge of delivering the client's message specifically to the server running the hidden service. In order to do so, this final relay must know the IP of this hidden server, otherwise the current internet infrastructure cannot deliver the message.</p>

<p>If the aforementioned steps are indeed correct, this means that in order to host a website using TOR Hidden Service you must reveal the IP address to a final relay. Therefore, Tor network does not hide the IP address of hidden services.</p>

"What encryption is actually used by tor circuits?","<p>I'm trying to determine what encryption (asymmetric and symmetric) Tor actually uses these days for client circuits.

Enabling the highest level of logging in my Tor client doesn't reveal anything either.  I also see mentions of elliptic curve and chacha20 support, but can't tell if that is being used in practice.  Other changelog entries suggest that AES256 is favored over AES128.</p>

<p>So, my question is assuming I'm using the most recent version of the Tor client, what asymmetric encryption algorithm is used, and what symmetric encryption algorithm is used?  Is it x25519 for key exchange and AES256 for the symmetric cipher, for example?</p>

"Run TOR relay with ipv6 only (""DualStack Lite"")","<p>I am a unfortunate customer of a provider that uses a so-called <em>DualStack Lite</em> (I can't post more than two URLs - check Wikipedia for detailed information on <em>DualStack Lite</em>). Short: My router can't be reached via <code>ipv4</code> easily. After I've switched to the new provider (I didn't realize the consequences) my TOR relay quit working (it's still configured with <code>ipv4</code>-ports only, so it's clear why it can't work). <a href=""https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/IPv6RelayHowto"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This howto</a> says that it's not yet possible to run a <code>ipv6</code>-only TOR relay.</p>

<li>Is it possible to use a <a href=""http://www.static-access.net/dslite-ipv6-portmapper/universal-portmappers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">service like this</a> to work around the limitations and run a TOR relay?</li>

<p>I assume that the answer to the latter question will be <em>no</em> because - as I understand - my relay registers itself at some TOR database with an outgoing <code>ipv4</code> address and the configured <code>ipv4</code> ports. If using a <code>ipv4</code> -> <code>ipv6</code> portmapper, a specific URL is used - one the TOR relay doesn't know about. Thus I think it's not possible for other TOR clients/relays to connect to my TOR relay.</p>

"Tor Relay questions (equipment, router hardware, DSL)","<p>I would like to contribute to the cause by running a Tor Relay. After spending the last week researching, I am still unable to answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are the MINIMUM COMPUTER requirements? May I run the relay on an older MacBook Pro? How about an older iMac? Do I need something high-end ($$$)?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the PREFERRED ROUTER requirements? Do I need to upgrade from my generic ISP router, or should I purchase something more specific to support the cause?</p></li>
<li><p>I live in the boon-docks and must connect to the Internet through DSL with the only cable/telephone company that services my area. Will a Tor Relay work with DSL service?</p></li>
<li><p>I do not have the software/hardware expertise to do this, but willing to donate equipment and time to help. Is there someone within the Tor community that can help me get things up and running?</p></li>

"Can I add hidden services to an existing traditional web server?","<p>I have several virtual hosts on traditional Nginx and Apache servers. They listen on ports 80 &amp; 443. I would like to also make those sites available as hidden services (e.g. <em>""This site is also available at XYZ.onion""</em> in the footer) by installing Tor on those same servers.</p>

<p>Is there a practical way to do this? Put differently, does serving Tor hidden services require a separate server or can it be used in tandem with a traditional LAMP server?</p>

"How often does a Tor change rendezvous point with hidden service?","<p>I understand how a Tor client connects to a hidden service, but can anyone explain to me how long a rendezvous point is used?</p>

<p>According to numbers  <a href=""https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/672/how-do-onion-addresses-exactly-work"">10-16 on this post on Tor stack exchange</a>, the client determines the rendezvous point and sends an ""introduce message"" to the hidden service, containing the information of the rendezvous point and a one-time-secret/cookie request, via one of the hidden services introductory points, in order for the hidden service to know how to communicate with the client. The hidden service then sends the one-time-secret/cookie to the rendezvous point, where the rendezvous point forwards it to the client. The client is then informed that a connection is established. </p>

<p>Now this is where I was confused, number 16 states: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Client and hidden service talk to each other over this rendezvous
  point. All traffic is end-to-end encrypted and the rendezvous point
  just relays it back and forth. Note that each of them, client and
  hidden service, build a circuit to the rendezvous point; at three hops
  per circuit this makes six hops in total.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand this, I am simply wondering how often this changes. </p>

<ul>
<li>Do you change rendezvous points and repeat this whole process everytime you switch to a different page, even on the same hidden service? </li>
<li>Do you use the same rendezvous point the whole time you are using the hidden service, even when you switch to a different page on that hidden service, and only change rendezvous point and repeat this proccess when you leave the site and come back? </li>
<li>Or does none of this change until you completely shut down the Tor browser and re-open it?</li>
<li>Is the same rendezvous point used for every hidden service you visit in a given browsing session until you restart Tor?</li>
</ul>

"Tor's encryption confusion and client to first node encryption","<p>From what I've read the onion routing process goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>The client encrypts its traffic to the destination server and sends it to the first node (encrypted);</li>
<li>The fird node encrypts it again and then sends it to the seconds node;</li>
<li>And so on until the decryption process starts (the amount of nodes the traffic goes through and the layers of encryption can vary. i think.)</li>
<li><p>The last node completely decrypts the traffic and sends it to the destination server unencrypted</p></li>
<li><p>The server encrypts its response to the client and sends it to a node and the cycle of encryption and decryption starts again, just like the client did in the beginning</p></li>
<li>The client receives the traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does the server's response reach the client encrypted or unencrypted? Is the cycle exactly the same for the client's request as it is for the server's response?</p>

<p>1.1 If unencrypted, wouldn't my ISP or anyone else be able to spy on me?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does the traffic on the last node go to the destination server fully unencrypted? What prevents it from being encrypted?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks</p>

"How does selecting new guard relays work?","<p>I've been told guards are selected when a client first connects to the Tor network and used until they <i>disappear</i>.</p>

<p>What constitutes <i>disappearing</i>?<br/>
Do all guards need to disappear (and then the whole set is replaced) or just one (and only that one is replaced)?</p>

<p>Would it be possible to get selected as a target's guard by DoS'ing random guards until you get chosen?</p>

"Bridge to improve anonymity","<p>Tor official page says “Tor  fails when the attacker can see both ends of the communications channel.”</p>

<p>Then,setting up a bridge on pc A and using it myself as entry node on pc B (with vpn to change ip)can make this attack impossible?
(Because attacker can never be the entry node in this case.)</p>

<p>Or, asking reliable friends to be the bridge each other is also effective to improve anonymity?</p>

"Testing my own relay without being evil to the network","<p>I have implemented some additionnal functionnality to my Tor relay such as more bandwith control than what is possible with the <code>torrc</code> configuration file.</p>

<p>Howewer, I would like to try it because this one isn't stable and could crash due to some errors in my code. I firstly thought about bridge, which is nothing more than a private entry node, but it cannot be applied to midde/exit node.</p>
