"Is there any way to help color blind people feel the true color like normal people?","<p>I am Mild Deutans by taking a color blind test.</p>

<p>Deutans is defined by a result as
""Deutans are people with deuteranomaly, a type of red-green color blindness in which the green cones do not detect enough green and are too sensitive to yellows, oranges, and reds.
As a result, greens, yellows, oranges, reds, and browns may appear similar, especially in low light. It can also be difficult to tell the difference between blues and purples, or pinks and grays.""</p>

"Do pharmaceuticals which increase dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain significantly increase histamine levels?","<p>I imagine any medication that has an effect on catecholamines would in some way increase histamine levels as well, just for the fact that histamine is part of the 'fight or flight' response and seems to go along with catecholamine activation. (I'm not super knowledgeable on neurophysiology, so please excuse my ignorance of its complexities and the extent of different pathways). </p>

<p>Q 1: If an individual has problems with high histamine levels related to frequent stress response activation and subsequent cortisol spikes, would medications such as adderall and other stimulants greatly exacerbate histamine related physiological imbalances? Note: high histamine levels prevail in spite of antihistamine use.</p>

<p>Q 2: If, as I suspect, stimulant medications do have too much of an effect on histamine levels, what alternatives are there for remedying low dopamine levels and poor executive functioning due to depression and ADHD? </p>

"Research On Chinese Medicinal Treatment For Anxiety?","<p>I have been searching for analysis &amp; preferable scientific review of Chinese medicinal treatment of psychological disorders... in particular anxiety.</p>

<p>Detail: Passing by, I walked into a Chinese Medicine shop yesterday for the first time in my life &amp; enquired about chinese treatment for anxiety. The Dr.Wang behind the counter asked me to show her my tongue, which I did. All it took was a second for the spectacled doctor to inspect from a distance of about 5 feet &amp; diagnose that I had poor liver function &amp; blood circulation, particularly to the head. Curious, I asked her for the treatment &amp; she prescribed two medications. I do not have the name of the medicines (everything was in Chinese), however, the dosage was interesting, one to be taken three times a day, eight tablets at a time. The other one is 10 tablets, twice daily. The first prescription is suppose to last 9 days at a cost of £25 &amp; I presume it needs to be carried on for a few weeks atleast.</p>

<p>This has been on my mind since &amp; to be clear, while I am very intrigued to the point of going for it, if only to see the results after a few weeks, however, I am conscious that this is not a cheap treatment &amp; coming from a family of doctors, I have been quite sceptical of Chinese, Arabian, Ayurvedic, Eastern etc treatments. However, reading online, there appears to be some posts on people finding relief through this treatment where Western treatments have failed.</p>

<p>So, is there any study / research / literature on these Chinese treatments, relating to psychological / psychiatric treatments? Has any proof ever been found for the body energy they call Chakra / Qi energies?</p>

"Will flying potentially damage my ears further?","<h2>Some Context...</h2>

<p>A couple years ago my friend shouted into my ear very loud at a concert (stupid move, but I guess he just wasn't thinking), and ever since, it has been prone to getting blocked and is more sensitive to loud noises.</p>

<p>I have a number of flights in a row to complete tomorrow. I am flying from Australia to Brazil. I had a short flight, about <code>50 minutes</code> across states today (<code>Melbourne to Adelaide</code>) </p>

<p><code>1. Adelaide to Dubai</code> </p>

<p>then</p>

<p><code>2. Dubai to Rio De Janeiro</code></p>

<p>over 23 hours or so.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>While coming down to land on my flight today I started feeling quite a lot of pain and swelling in my ear canals. When I massaged between the behinds my ears to just underneath the joint of my jaw, I felt that the tube was so swollen that it had become rock hard. </p>

<p>Ever since the flight - about 3 hours from writing this, my ear on the right side (the one that was shouted into) is completely blocked, and there is a tight sensation in my sinuses, on that side of my face and I am experiencing mild nausea.</p>

<p>I will be trying to book an emergency appointment to see a GP today, but if they can't book me in, I'll have to take the advice of medical stack exchange and make a decision whether or not to fly further, for risk of damaging my ears. </p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<p><strong>Is it safe for me to fly today? Is there any chance that flying will injure me further?</strong></p>

However, most sites also mention that it's normal for athletic people to have heart rates as low as 40, and that people should try to <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/features/5-heart-rate-myths-debunked"" rel=""nofollow"">keep it below 70</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Myth:</strong> A normal heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute?</p>
  
  <p>That's the old standard. Many doctors think it should be lower. About <strong>50-70 beats per minute</strong> is ideal, says Suzanne Steinbaum, MD, director of women's heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital.</p>
  
  <p>Recent studies suggest a heart rate <strong>higher than 76 beats per minute</strong> when you're resting may be linked to a higher risk of heart attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is rather conflicting, since 76 is at around 40% of the 60-100 range, implying it even gravitates to the ""fitter"" range? Is the <strong>""new standard""</strong> correct?</p>

<p>Furthermore, regarding RHR calculation, my fitness tracker calculates the RHR as the first heart rate after waking up, while still lying in bed (it tends to be slightly below 60 on average). But this is really my lowest rate during the day (sleeping excluded), and while sitting at my desk during the day (I am a programmer), it will stick around 70 bpm - I am obviously not as fit as I would want to be. Is the <strong>in-bed resting heart rate</strong> really the ""correct"" indicator of fitness?</p>

"What are the long-term side effects of intramuscular oil injection?","<p>Intramuscular injections of oils such as synthol is sometimes used in amateur and professional body-builders to enlarge their muscle volume. What are the long-term side effects of intramuscular oil injection?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Synthol consists usually of oil, benzyl alcohol and lidocain. It consists of 85% of oil (normally it is oil built by medium-length MTC chains because it gives the best effects), 7,5% of lidocain (painkiller), 7,5% of alcohol (to sterilize the mixture). Synthol is a substance used by body builders as a temporary implant which is injected deeply into the muscle. The enlargement effects are immediate. Synthol is used in small groups of muscles to enlarge their volume (for example triceps, biceps, deltoids, muscles of the calf). Some serious drawbacks can be visible while using synthol. The muscles deform and become unnaturally shaped. The side effects of synthol are manifold and they can also cause a damage of nerves, oil embolic of the pulmonary, occlusion of the pulmonary artery, myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke and infectious complications.</p>

  <p>Introduction: Synthol is a site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders to
  boost the cosmetic appearance of muscles. Here, we describe the case
  of a patient with severe side effects following repeated intramuscular
  injections of synthol in his right biceps muscle.</p>
  
  <p>Case presentation: A 29-year-old Middle Eastern male bodybuilder,
  following intramuscular injections of synthol five years ago,
  presented with painful pressure in his right upper arm. On
  presentation to our clinic, his muscle appeared disfigured. Magnetic
  resonance imaging revealed scattered cystic fatty lesions in the
  muscle. The affected part was surgically removed and histopathology
  showed inflammatory changes with fibrosis and a so-called Swiss cheese
  pattern.</p>
  
  <p>Conclusion: Synthol injections that are used for the short-term
  enhancement of muscle appearance by bodybuilders bear the danger of
  long-term painful muscle fibrosis and disfigurement.</p>

  <p>Intramuscular oil injections generating slowly degrading oil-based depots represent a controversial subject in bodybuilding and fitness. However they seem to be commonly reported in a large number of non-medical reports, movies and application protocols for 'site-injections'. Surprisingly the impact of long-term (ab)use on the musculature as well as potential side-effects compromising health and sports ability are lacking in the medical literature. We present the case of a 40 year old male semi-professional bodybuilder with systemic infection and painful reddened swellings of the right upper arm forcing him to discontinue weightlifting. Over the last 8 years he daily self-injected sterilized sesame seed oil at numerous intramuscular locations for the purpose of massive muscle building. Whole body MRI showed more than 100 intramuscular rather than subcutaneous oil cysts and loss of normal muscle anatomy. 2-step septic surgery of the right upper arm revealed pus-filled cystic scar tissue with the near-complete absence of normal muscle. MRI 1 year later revealed the absence of relevant muscle regeneration. Persistent pain and inability to perform normal weight training were evident for at least 3 years post-surgery. This alarming finding indicating irreversible muscle mutilation may hopefully discourage people interested in bodybuilding and fitness from oil-injections. The impact of such chronic tissue stress on other diseases like malignancy remains to be determined.</p>

"TReatment for open blisters","<p><strong>TL, DR:</strong> I have a nopen blister. What to do?</p>

<p>So this happened: I steped on a bee and got stung on the underside of my large toe. During the day after the sting, my foot swelled and formed blisters on the upper side, near the sting. I opened the blisters and applied Octenisept (disinfectant) and Dermatol (poweder of talcum and Bismutum Subgallicum) to dry and protect the wound - this is a treatment I remember from my childhood for wounds like this. Since then I kept the area in the open as far as possible (figuring that it heals faster that way) and apply Dermatol occasionally.</p>

<p>The fluid in the blister was clear, yellowish so I figure lymph fluid. No thick yellow fluid, affected foot isnt warmer than the other one and I'm generally fine. Else I'd have seen a doctor allready.</p>

<p>With googling i found out that Dermatol may not be sold in Germany anymore (since 2003 actually) because there's no proof of any effect. </p>

<p>From looking at this answer, the treatment seems to be ""<a href=""http://get%20the%20sterile%20dressing%20on,%20then%20clean%20and%20redress%20(with%20a%20light%20application%20of%20an%20antibacterial%20cream)"" rel=""nofollow"">... get the sterile dressing on, then clean and redress (with a light application of an antibacterial cream)</a>"".<br>
My problem is with the dressing: Blister-bandaids with a gel inside would seem a good idea, but don't fit the area. A packing of light gauze or something would be doable for now, but I will need to wear shoes or boots soon. Any alternatives?<br>
I assume leaving the foot in the open or at least ouside a shoe is god for the healing process. Is this assumption correct?</p>

"Postpartum haemorrhages due to partial placenta detachment or tear","<p>If only part of the placenta is delivered after the baby is born and the rest is still attached to the womb, the mother can lose a large amount of blood via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_bleeding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">postpartum haemorrhage</a>.  There is no haemorrhage from the blood vessels in the womb if the placenta has detached.</p>

<p>Interestingly whilst searching for answers, <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/placental-abruption/symptoms-causes/syc-20376458"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">placental abruption</a> occurs when the placenta partially <strong>or completely</strong> separates from the inner wall of the uterus <strong>before delivery</strong>. This can decrease or block the baby's supply of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother.  What is the difference after childbirth?  Maybe it is hormonal but I cannot confirm it and anyhow, I cannot see how hormones can help the blood clotting when the flow is so high.</p>

"Why after 140 years, is the primary surgical treatment for gallstones to still just chop out the gallbladder?","<p>The practice of completely cutting out the gallbladder to ""cure"" gallstones goes back to 1878 when it was first successfully performed, and which is nearly prehistoric times in medical history and technology.</p>

</ul>

<p>Due to the rise of modern minimally invasive abdominal surgical procedures and use of robots like the Davinci for heart surgery, why hasn't this surgical practice been applied to remove gallstones and simply suture/glue the gallbladder closed again, so that the body can still use the organ?</p>

<p>The gallbladder is far simpler in function by comparison to the heart, yet the primary surgical choice is still the barbaric 1878 excise procedure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete removal of the gallbladder leaves a person with a seriously dysfunctional digestive system that can no longer digest fats effectively. Too much fat (ingested as part of a normal meal for someone with a functioning gallbladder) will instead result in diarrhea as the undigested oils race through the gut, and potentially resulting in uncontrolled and embarrassing anal leakage, loose stools, and fecal odor.</p>

<p>Additionally for some patients, even after complete removal, abdominal pain never goes away but continues after the procedure for the rest of the life of the patient.</p>

<p>Are the additional input of Fat and Muscle enough to make the calculation possible?</p>

<p><strong>Update 22/12/2017:</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/users/2833/bill-oertell"">Bill Oertell</a> Makes a very good ( and on hindsight obvious :-) ) point. I did a little more digging and most references to healthy water percentage ranges are referring to percentage of body water by mass. So given that the Watson Formula is returning water in Litres and 1L = 1Kg we simply need  </p>

<ul>
<li>(Simplistic) Body Water Percent by Mass = TBW/Weight * 100%</li>
</ul>

<p>However this does give us a very simplistic view on water percentage. The original formula I found is not taking into account variances caused by Body Fat and Muscle Mass that the modern electronic fitness scales record using bioelectrical impedance. When I run the data from one such device ( Salter MiBody ) through the given formulas I get results that are close ( +/- 1.5% ) but there is clearly a variance caused by other factors. I think what I need is a more modern Total Body Water formula taking into account Fat and Muscle numbers.</p>

"Hard water and cardiovascular problems","<p>Wikipedia cites <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a121257"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one 1970 study by Voors</a> claiming that drinking hard water lessens the odds of dying from atherosclerosis. The stud itself even makes some bolder claims stratified by race, namely that lithium was protective for whites and vanadium for non-whites.</p>

<p>A much more recent <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265038/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(2008) article by Burton</a> makes no mention of either lithium or vanadium, but says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea that hard water—particularly that with higher magnesium concentrations—helps ward off cardiovascular problems has been around for 50 years. However, due to the ecologic nature of most studies, uncontrolled confounding factors, and the different variables and outcomes measured, no firm conclusions have ever been drawn. The WHO is therefore coordinating worldwide efforts to compare cardiovascular morbidity before and after changes in the calcium/magnesium content of water supplies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Approximately 10 years later, has anything conclusive come out this? Is hard water in general protective of cardiovascular problems? Is any mineral in particular important?</p>

"Can you get infections by washing your body with someone else's water?","<p>I was in a debate with someone about some religious topics. And one of them was a religious treatment ritual that included taking someone else's saliva and throwing water on his back then mixing both (the washing water and the saliva), then the person to treat should bathe using this water.   </p>

<p>I insisted that this is wrong and it can transfer diseases, but my friend was not convinced.   </p>

<p>Am I right? Are there any bacteria or viruses that can be transferred through washing water or saliva? Note that the treated person doesn't drink that. He just uses it to wash his body. </p>

"Can drinking alcohol release stored caffeine?","<p>Several people in my family are sensitive to caffeine. I can't sleep if I have coffee in the afternoon, and dad won't even each chocolate.</p>

<p>A few times recently I've noticed I can't sleep well at night, and I think it's related to times I have wine in the evening in addition to coffee in the morning. It's like I drank a strong coffee at dinner time, except I didn't.</p>

<p>I was thinking that the liver processes many chemicals, and if it filtered caffeine out of my bloodstream but processed it slowly, then maybe there'd be some left at dinner. Then maybe all of it would be released in the evening back into the bloodstream because a more important toxin (alcohol) needed processing. And so then I'd experience the effects of drinking coffee at an odd time hours later.</p>

<p>Is this even possible? I.e. is it possible for:</p>

<ol>
<li>Caffeine to be stored in the body (in the liver?) after drinking it</li>
<li>It to take a long time (6-12 hrs) for the caffeine to be processed</li>
<li>For that caffeine to be released into the bloodstream and start having effects, with the release triggered by a glass or two of wine</li>
</ol>

"Are any 3D printed materials biocompatible (safe for implantation in the human body)?","<p>Are any typical 3D printed (<strong>extrusion based</strong> 3D printer) materials, such as ABS or PLA (or slightly more exotic ones, such as kevlar, fibreglass, or carbon fiber), safe for implantation in the human body? Or in medical terms, are they biocompatible (biofunctionality is not topical for this question)? If not, why not? If most of them are safe, then please explain which ones are NOT safe.</p>

<p>Highly relevant, and perhaps even more interesting is: Are there any peer reviewed medical papers that have investigated what materials are safe for implantation in the human body? A paper which answers this unambiguously would be the ideal answer to this question. Another concern is if the process of 3D printing itself adversely influences the properties of the material in the context of implantation applications.</p>

<p>I've tried to determine the answer to this question myself, but I cannot find any papers or studies which answer it. I can easily find that ABS plastic is ""non-biodegradable"", but I suppose the issue of adverse host responses is more crucial, e.g. causing inflammation or it being a bacterial growth substrate to promote infections seems like plausible concerns. I'm sure there might be other dangerous complications too, which I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>I found a paper dealing with corrosion issues for implantable metals: DOI: 10.1089/end.1997.11.383</p>

<p>I found a paper dealing with silicone-urethane being prone to breakdown: DOI: 10.1021/ma301965y</p>

<p>I found a paper describing the properties and history of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which appears to be commonly used as implants:  DOI: 10.1109/EEIC.2005.1566331</p>

<p>By extension, a 3D printer using UHMWPE might be safe, barring any adverse chemical or mechanical issues as a result of the 3D printing process itself. However, it is not clear to me if any 3D printers can actually reliably print UHMWPE. Furthermore, it is unclear if UHMWPE is a sane choice, as it appears to be useful in applications where strength is required, such as for joints. What about other applications where load bearing properties are not required (e.g. a simple enclosure for implantable electronics)?</p>

<p>I'm aware that titanium appears to be frequently used for implants, and while titanium 3D printers do exist, they are beyond the scope of this question. The valid context is extrusion based 3D printers in the sub $10,000 range (arbitrarily chosen to make the question avoid being tagged as ""too broad"").</p>

"Too low level of HIV virus to be infectious?","<p>I just read about a court case where someone was acquitted for ""being dangerous to the surrounding"" by having unprotected sex when diagnosed with HIV.</p>

<p>The reasoning was that since this person was medicated, (s)he had too low levels of viruses to be infectious. How can that be? 1 virus should be enough to infect someone, shouldn't it?</p>

<p>I understand/guess that the risk of infection ""per virus"" might be very low and that, if you ""want"" the risk for infection to be higher than, say, 1 %, you need to be exposed to millions (or something like that) of viruses. But still, as long as you can transmit more than zero viruses to your surroundings, you must be infectious, mustn't you?</p>

"Truth or fiction: Testing vitamins to take by holding them and assessing strength","<p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in molecular biology and cannot convince my indoctrinated mother and grandmother that you cannot determine whether or not you need to take a vitamin by simply holding it and assessing whether it increases or decreases the strength of your grasping arm.</p>

<p>The story is this: my grandmother became genuinely allergic to most foods and suffered massive immunosuppression, which led her to seek advice from Mayo Clinic, and after extensive testing finding nothing, she was sent home in critical condition eating potatoes and gluten-free flours. She tried 500 ""alternative"" things, and eventually claims that holding cans of vitamins or foods in her hand will strengthen her grasp if she needs to take them or weaken her grasp if she doesn't need them. She has recovered amazingly over the past few years, and now has convinced half of the extended family that this technique is true, which puts a lot of pressure on the three unbelieving M.D's or Ph.Ds in the family (myself included) to explain why this doesn't work. Their theory is that ""frequency"" in the vitamin or food translates to your body, which responds in kind with strength or no strength. I have never tried blinding her to what food or vitamin she was holding, as she is resistant to testing that because she might take something she doesn't need or is allergic to.</p>

"Is water flossing more efficient than string flossing to remove plaques from tooth surfaces?","<p>Is water flossing more efficient than string flossing to remove plaques from tooth surfaces?</p>

<hr>

<p>I present below what I have found so far. In the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Pik,_Inc."" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Waterpik</a> is a manufacturer of water flossing devices. By extension, Waterpik = a type of water flossing device.</li>
<li>oral irrigator =   water flossing device</li>
</ul>

<p>{1} (published in 2013) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RESULTS: The WF group had a 74.4% reduction in whole mouth plaque and 81.6% for approximal plaque compared to 57.7% and 63.4% for the SF group, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). <strong>The differences between the groups showed the water flosser was 29% more effective than string floss for overall plaque removal</strong> and approximal surfaces specifically (p &lt; 0.001). The WF group was more effective in removing plaque from the marginal, lingual, and facial regions; 33%, 39%, and 24%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001).</p>
  
  <p>CONCLUSION:
  The Waterpik Water Flosser and manual toothbrush is significantly more effective than a manual brush and string floss in removing plaque from tooth surfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and {3} (published in 2009) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RESULTS:
  The standard jet tip removed 99.99% of the salivary (ex vivo) biofilm, and the orthodontic jet tip removed 99.84% of the salivary biofilm. Observation of the remaining four teeth by the naked eye indicated that the orthodontic jet tip removed significant amounts of calcified (in vivo) plaque biofilm. This was confirmed by SEM evaluations.</p>
  
  <p>CONCLUSION:
  <strong>The Waterpik dental water jet (Water Pik, Inc, Fort Collins, CO) can remove both ex vivo and in vivo plaque biofilm significantly.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>whereas <a href=""https://www.livestrong.com/article/287399-waterpik-vs-floss/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.livestrong.com/article/287399-waterpik-vs-floss/</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20171228203636/https://www.livestrong.com/article/287399-waterpik-vs-floss/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mirror</a>) says, without citing any scientific study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The downside: <strong>A Waterpik doesn’t remove plaque from teeth as well as floss</strong>. “Flossing scrapes off the sticky film of bacteria, while a Waterpic just rinses it,” Hayes explains. MayoClinic.com <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/dental-floss/faq-20058112"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">says</a> (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20171228203710/https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/dental-floss/faq-20058112"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mirror</a>) using a Waterpik isn't a substitute for flossing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and {2} (published in 2008) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>As an adjunct to brushing, the oral irrigator does not have a beneficial effect in reducing visible plaque.</strong> However, there is a positive trend in favour of oral irrigation improving gingival health over regular oral hygiene or toothbrushing only.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if there now exists a scientific consensus on the efficiency of water flossing compared to string flossing for removing plaques from tooth surfaces.</p>

<li>Getting to know past illnesses of the patient</li>
<li>Getting to know which illnesses are in the patient's family</li>
<li>Asking for previous medication</li>
</ul>

<p>But once the doctor has the history, is there a word for the process of figuring out the symptoms why a patient visited the doctor in the first place?</p>

<p>I imagine that doctors check the following in this process:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the patient have any pain? If so, at which location and how severe is it?</li>
<li>Are there other inconveniences, such as:

"Anorgasmia with SSRI and SNRI prescriptions","<p>I am adding to the beginning of this question the caveat that I am npt asking this for me or anyone in particular.  I am studying counselling and have come across this issue whilst researching and it lead me to try and work out what options are available when helping those who come to me with sexual dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Whilst Higgins, et al. (2010) highlights the problem with sexual dysfunctions whilst prescribed Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs), I am going to split my question in parts for easier answering. This question will be concerning <a href=""http://www.personalconsult.com/pubabstracts/viagrassri.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">anorgasmia</a>.  Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of antidepressants and can have significant impact on the person’s quality of life, relationships, mental health, and recovery.</p>

<p>Higgins et al points out that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sexual problems reported range from decreased sexual desire, decreased sexual excitement, diminished or delayed orgasm, to erection or delayed ejaculation problems. There are a number of case reports of sexual side effects, such as priapism, painful ejaculation, penile anesthesia, loss of sensation in the vagina and nipples, persistent genital arousal and nonpuerperal lactation in women.  The addition of sildenafil (Viagra) will improve erectile dysfunction in men (Rudkin, et al., 2004)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but what about anorgasmia?</p>

<p>The side effects don't seem to be rare from my research online and many patients are not even told to look for it. If a man has premature ejaculations, the side effect of anorgasmia usually helps that nicely, but if it already takes long enough, it might take even longer.</p>

<p>Higgins et al. also points out that with adjunct treatment (introducing another drug to counteract side-effects), clients treated with bupropion SR showed a significantly greater improvement in desire and frequency of engaging in sexual activity; and in a systematic review of medication switching strategies for managing sexual dysfunction, switching from SSRI to non-SSRI antidepressants may produce varying individual responses, and although the sexual dysfunction may recede, the depressive illness may reassert itself.</p>

<p>So has there been any studies which anyone knows of which definitively help with the problem of anorgasmia whilst taking SSRI or SNRI medication?</p>

"What drugs can keep you awake for long time?","<p>I'm writing a story about someone who's poisoned with a drug which makes him not be able to sleep for several days. In order to make my story as realistic as possible I need to know a couple of things:</p>

<p>1) Does this type of drug actually exist? I think that amphetamines or modafinil can keep you awake but,</p>

<p>2) Can these drugs keep the effect for a long time (days)? I mean, the organism would start at a certain point and try to sleep, right?</p>

<p>3) If there's such a drug then after a long period of sleep deprivation the person would start to have certain symptoms. Could be hallucinations one of these symptoms?</p>

<p>4) And now even more complicated: is there any possibility that if the person dies could be no trace of the drug in an autopsy's toxicological analysis?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They work by inhibiting enzymes called cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and 2
  (COX-2). These are involved in a number of internal pathways that
  result in production of hormone-like substances called prostaglandins,
  which promote inflammation and increase pain perception.</p>
  
  <p>Animal studies have shown blocking COX-2 and the subsequent pathway of
  prostaglandin production may have the unwanted effects of increasing
  the tendency of blood to clot inside arteries, and a reduced ability
  of the heart to heal after a heart attack. In the early 2000s, a
  number of large studies found a significant association of negative
  heart events, such as heart attack and stroke, with the use of
  selective COX-2 inhibitors. This resulted in two of these drugs,
  Valdecoxib and Rofecoxib or Vioxx, being withdrawn from the market.</p>

<p>They talk about a lot of products doing the same and taken off the shelves.</p>

"Need help interpreting histology results (punch skin biopsy)","<p>Good day.</p>

<p>About a month ago I've removed a mole (nevus) which accrued on ""clean"" skin (de novo) about 4-5 months ago. It has always been charcoal black and 1,5 mm in diameter.</p>

<p>So the dermatologist did a punch biopsy on it. Results are the following:</p>

<p>*Multiple sections have been examined from specimen submitted.
There is a small central area of melanocytic proliferation seen within biopsy which is subtended by chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in the upper dermis with incontinent melanin pigment.
Trans epidermal elimination of melanin pigment is seen with some melanin present in cornified layers of epidermis.</p>

<p>There is an atypical melanocytic proliferation noted with some extension into the overlying spinous layers of epidermis.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: Atypical Junctional Melanocytic Prolifiration - further wider excision of this area is requested.*</strong></p>

<p>Now, I went to the surgeon and he said it is a melanoma and did the excision with 2cm margins on each side.</p>

<p>What confuses me is the pathologist said it's not malignant while sergion says it is. </p>

<p>What it really is? Is it possible not to have a concrete answer looking at the above histology report? And if not what could possibly clarify it?</p>

<p>Any help is highly appreciated. </p>

<p>UPDATE</p>

<p>I have contacted the pathologist on the phone asking for clarification, and than he mentioned that he does not think it's malignant, but cannot state that on the report as he is not 100% sure.</p>

<p>In any case second excision is sent for a test as well - hopefully it will put some light on this diagnosis. </p>

"Correlation between carbonated drinks and IQ","<p>I was searching the correlation between drinking soft drinks and IQ, because I wanted to verify if countries that drank a lot of coke/soft drinks were more likely to have more intelligent populations (e.g. the basic rationale was that sugar in carbonated drinks would speedup brain faculties, thus having more synapses, and overall better brain performance)</p>

<p>I found in that 2012 <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507933/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NCBI</a> article citing the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A total of 529 children participated in this study, (77.7%) of the
  children have high IQ level. Almost (60%) of the children drink
  carbonated drink daily, while (74%) eat chips every day. The
  association between drinking carbonated drinks, eating chips and
  intelligence level was significant (P= 0.043, 0.001) and prevalence
  odds ratio of 1.5 and 2.4 respectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the study concludes with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were significant associations between carbonated drinks, chips
  intake and IQ score. More regulations on what to sell inside the

  parents, especially the mothers is very important and more health
  promotions should be given regarding children nutrition in the early

<p>While the cause of Alien-Hand-Syndrome is not quite understood, scientists have agreed, more or less, that it is rooted in a neurological disorder or trauma.

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Quinolones are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all age groups</strong>. This side effect is most common in but not limited to the Achilles tendon. Fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy symptoms have occurred as early as 2 hours after the initial fluoroquinolone exposure and as late as 6 months after the medication was discontinued. The most severe form of tendonopathy associated with fluoroquinolone administration is tendon rupture, which in the great majority of cases involves the Achilles tendon. Younger people typically experience good recovery, but permanent disability is possible, and is more likely in older patients. The overall frequency of fluoroquinolone-associated Achilles tendon rupture in patients treated with ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin has been estimated at 17 per 100,000 treatments (three times the rate in people without fluoroquinolone exposure). Risk is substantially elevated in the elderly and in those with recent exposure to topical or systemic corticosteroid therapy. Simultaneous use of corticosteroids is present in almost one-third of quinolone-associated tendon rupture. Other risk factors include patients with kidney, heart and lung transplants, strenuous physical activity during or immediately after treatment, renal failure or previous tendon disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. Some experts have advised avoidance of fluoroquinolones in athletes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The exact pathophysiology of FQ-induced tendinopathy remains elusive; however, some concepts have been suggested. FQs are synthetic antibiotics that act by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II).27 DNA gyrase is directly involved in DNA replication and cell division.10 Theoretically, FQs should not exert a negative effect on human cell lines because the affected bacterial enzymes have little homology with mammalian DNA gyrase.10 However, it is possible that FQs have a direct cytotoxic effect on enzymes found in mammalian musculoskeletal tissue.10 Because animal studies have shown that FQs may damage juvenile weight-bearing joints, most FQs are contraindicated in children and during pregnancy and lactation.39–40 FQs have chelating properties against several metal ions (e.g., calcium, magnesium, aluminum), and have been known to cause direct toxicity to type 1 collagen synthesis and promote collagen degradation.33,35 Experiments on immature laboratory animals (dogs, rabbits, and rats) have shown that FQs cause cartilage damage by inducing necrosis of chondrocytes (36 hours after treatment), disruption of the extracellular matrix, and formation of vesicles and fissures at the articular surface.41 In-vitro studies in cultured tendon cells have confirmed the clinical observation that FQs can increase the risk of tendon rupture.42 Under normal circumstances, the rate of matrix turn-over and tendon fibroblast is low.10 Other precipitating factors, such as age and corticosteroid use, do not allow the tendon to repair adequately, resulting in irreversible matrix alteration.43 It has been theorized that FQs disproportionately affect human tendons that have a limited capacity for repair, such as in older patients or structural compromise (i.e., pre-existing tendinopathy or trauma).10</p>

"Are there objective criteria to define if a diet is ""healthy""?","<p>Recently in Italy there is quite some discussion around a proposed law that concerns the vegan diet.</p>

<p>I am not here to discuss the merits or the demerits neither of the law nor of the vegan diet.</p>

<p>I am here because among the arguments that I have seen thrown around there is one that states (with links to the American Dietetic Association position on vegetarian/vegan diets and a few scientific studies)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The vegan diet is proven healthy, provided that it is integrated with vitamin supplements, in particular B12</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This made me wonder, doesn't the requirement for supplements indicate that the diet is deficient in nutrients?
What are (if there are any) the requirements for a diet to be defined ""healthy""?</p>

"Does the digestive disorders affect the location of aorta beat around navel?","<p>You might have experienced this. If you lie on your back on a flat surface and place your finger or thumb right over navel (men or women), and press softly down, you'd feel the beating just like heartbeats. I checked it with around 10 people and mostly it was right at the place of navel (i.e. vertically down to navel) or varied around 1 inch horizontally.</p>

<p>Now the question is here: If we suffer from any digestion related disease especially constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, does the location of of the beat we feel is affected? I'm asking this because many Indians and Indian blogs say this. They also say that <strong>the location should be almost vertically down to navel if you don't want to suffer from the diseases</strong> mentioned above. How much true it is?</p>

"Can HEPA air purifiers release allergens when particles inside the filter decompose / break apart?","<p>The smallest of pollen grains (~0.6 microns) and other allergens should be trapped by a HEPA filter, however what happens when these decay / break apart? Is the allergen the whole pollen grain or are the allergens really the proteins that make up the grain (which by themselves would be too small for the filter to hold)?</p>

<p>Just wondering because the measures I implemented a couple of months ago (air purifier + a window screen made of polypropylene) seem to have been effective at first, but now it seems to be worse in the ""controlled environment"" than elsewhere. It's difficult to say for sure, but I was wondering if this theory holds any weight. Could it be that the various allergens trapped in the screen and air purifier are now breaking down and passing through the filtration?</p>

This is given as a rationale for why vaccines do not create a strain on the child's immune system.</p>

"Is setting your alarm for a long duration at a lower volume a good way to ensure you wake up in light sleep?","<p>I usually set my alarm really loud so that I will definitely wake up. Usually that is accompanied by disorientation, headaches, etc. However, I read about 'completing the sleep cycle' and that it allows for more fulfilling sleep, along with easier waking up, so I started finding ways to implement that.</p>

<p>One way that occurred to me: what if I set my alarm to 'endless mode' but lower the volume to around 30%? I read that it is very difficult to wake a person in deep sleep, but it becomes easier in light sleep. In this way, when I am in deep sleep I won't wake up, but when I transition into light sleep, then the lower volume will be enough to wake me up.</p>

"Is there a proven way to test if I'm susceptible to the placebo effect?","<p>I know there are tests to check if a single drug is useful or useless by arranging groups of people where half receive the actual drug and half receive the placebo, but those are testing the drug, not the patient.</p>

<p>My question is regarding a test for the opposite (a single patient with a group of pills, from which half would be the actual drug and half would be placebos) It sounds like I just answered my own question, or at least I designed the base experiment, but my question is not on the logic of such experiment, <strong>the real question is, are there any serious studies like the one I just described</strong>?</p>

<p>I'm aware that knowing I'm testing myself may spoil the whole point. So if you can't be unaware of the fact that you are being tested, you can introduce some entropy to the timing of real dosage vs placebo. <strong>So maybe a machine-assisted test?</strong> A machine would give me pills, some days it would be the real formula, some other days it would be a placebo. Every day I'd have to measure the effects, so it would have to be a pill with immediate but temporal effects, something not crucial for my well being, a drug I don't really need, like a muscle relaxant (e.g. Carisoprodol, maybe?) and I would have to <em>measure</em> the results, maybe with electrodes or anything that register actual measurement and not just my biased perception; ""<em>I feel relaxed</em>"" is not very scientific. </p>

<p>I have a question about blood types and seeming hereditary contradictions.</p>

<p>The above image of an Eldoncard blood test, which shows quite clearly that the testee has AB- type blood. (see image!). The sample comes from a person that has a father with blood type A (known from military), and a mother that has blood type O- (known from being a blood donor). </p>

<p>So the question is: how can a person have AB- in this situation (Mother with O-)?</p>

<p>There are a couple of possible scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Eldoncard ABO Rhesus D-test could be wrong, and the testee could have another blood type.</li>
<li>The mother could have a weak manifestation of the B subtype, something which would show her as being O- while in fact being bO-, thus having been misdiagnosed as O-</li>
<li>The father could actually have AB blood type, and in some rare circumstances, there have been examples of inheritance of blood type coming from only one parent. </li>
</ol>

<p>Secondary question, though: If the mother has a weak manifestation of the B subtype, and this is how the testee got one B from her, wouldn't also they also have a weak manifestation of the B subtype - example Ab?</p>

<p>For the purposes of the question, assume that both parents are in fact the genetic parents of the testee.</p>

"Allergy to Vicryl Sutures","<p><strong>strong text</strong>
Can a person be allergic to Vicryl sutures used internally as part of surgery?  I had carpal tunnel surgery and the surgeon used Vicryl sutures inside my hand. After the surgeon removed the exterior sutures, I was still having problems with the wound healing. After another week or so, I noticed something on my palm at the incision site. I picked at the spots and something poked out of the tissue that looked black. I used a pair of tweezers to remove the black thing, which turned out to actually be a purple string. Then I pulled out 3 or 4 more purple threads from the wound area. At this point in time, the area of the incision did not appear to be healing. It looked like the end of a sausage casing that had been over-stuffed with sausage. After removal of the purple threads, the wound continued to heal normally. Was this an allergic reaction? How can I avoid this happening in future surgeries?</p>

  <p>Best Answer:  Salt water can dry up the natural oils in your skin, and
  this in turn can lead to boils and pimples. When you have been in the
  sea, you need to wash off the salt as soon as you can, and as you so
  rightly say, not showering fo a week is gross.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The magnesium in seawater may also help hydrate and improve the
  appearance of your skin. According to a study in the February 2005
  edition of the “International Journal of Dermatology,” bathing in a
  magnesium-rich Dead Sea salt solution helps promote skin moisture.
  People with atopic dry skin, or dryness on the skin’s surface,
  submerged one forearm for 15 minutes in a bath solution containing 5
  percent Dead Sea salt and the other forearm in regular tap water.
  Researchers discovered that the salt solution improved skin hydration
  and significantly reduced skin inflammation symptoms such as redness
  and roughness when compared to tap water. Observed skin benefits were
  attributed to the high magnesium content of the Dead Sea salt.</p>

"Incidence of anisakidosis in Japan","<p>In Japan where raw fish are frequently eaten with no anti-parasite processing the infection of the nematode Anisakiasis became a required reportable diagnosis in 2012. Nevertheless, only 89 cases were reported in 2013. According to a study on the subject they claimed that health insurance records suggested over 7000 cases (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/9/e43/405137/Is-the-Quality-of-Sushi-Ruined-by-Freezing-Raw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/60/9/e43/405137/Is-the-Quality-of-Sushi-Ruined-by-Freezing-Raw</a>).</p>

<p>This seems to be a huge divergence in numbers.</p>

<p>I guess there are two things I don't understand. If it is required to report it, how could they have only 89 reported cases but 7000+ ""insurance"" cases? The other thing I don't understand is that another study I read found Anisakiasis infection in 20% of the mackerels that they examined. If the nematode is so prevalent, shouldn't people in Japan be getting sick on a much larger scale? I mean there are <em>millions</em> of people in Japan eating raw mackerel. If 20% of that mackerel has Anisakiasis larva, then shouldn't we be seeing hundreds of thousands of cases of human infection, not just 7000 or 89?</p>

"Hot water burn management","<p>Background: In an attempt to relieve hemorroids I hurt myself with hot water on the buttocks near crack area, this started only two days ago. The burn area is not exceeding width of two fingers on each cheek, mostly inside the folded cheeks area and not on the exposed cheeks. Burn is red and painful but no blisters, with painful tingling, yet pain is relatively controlled with non-steroidal analgesics. When I clean the burn in the morning it sheds very little blood on the cleaning tissue but bloods stops after I gently swap the burn 2-3 times. I am avoiding sitting down or laying on my back as it worsen the pain. 
Question 1: is this a second degree burn? I clean with saline and apply antibiotic cream three times daily, is this enough? 
Should I also apply an antibiotic spray and or any steroidal cream?
Question 2: I can't cover the burn given difficulty of making the dressing stable with every movement, is this ok?</p>

Anyway, I've been looking for any and all means to help ease the pain, and my boyfriend came across several articles indicating that marshmallows might help. One such articles is here: <a href=""http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20640098,00.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">14 Ways to Soothe a Sore Throat</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although there's no hard evidence that it works, sap from the
  marshmallow plant has been used for hundreds of years—usually in tea
  form—to treat coughs, colds, and sore throats. And while real
  marshmallow bears little relation to the puffy campfire treats that
  took its name, both may have sore throat-fighting properties.</p>
  
  <p>According to anecdotal reports, modern-day marshmallows can help ease
  sore throat pain, possibly because the gelatin coats and soothes.
  ""It's not the wackiest thing in the world,"" Dr. Linder says. ""If your
  throat is really swollen and it really hurts to swallow anything, I
  can see how something slippery and sweet like marshmallows might
  provide some relief.""</p>

<p>I've searched and posted other threads concerning tobacco smoke, and I'm convinced the amount of tobacco smoke on  a road is not insignificant compared to gas exhaust, of course it's less, but it represents more than 1% (at least here in France) and it's really concentrated when you're in.

"Will using fluoride-free toothpaste eventually lead to tooth decay?","<p>I've been using fluoride-free toothpaste for about a year now:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.desertessence.com/store/natural-tea-tree-oil-neem-toothpaste"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.desertessence.com/store/natural-tea-tree-oil-neem-toothpaste</a></p>

<p>While I'm not necessarily averse to fluoride - at least when used topically on the teeth - I'm skeptical of the safety of many chemicals used in typical brands of household products. This toothpaste seems to have safe ingredients, and it's pleasant to use and effective in keeping my mouth clean. I'd still use it if it contained fluoride, but I have yet to find a  ""healthy"" toothpaste that does.</p>

<p>Based on my research, it seems to be the consensus in dentistry that topical fluoride is a necessary part of maintaining tooth enamel. If I otherwise keep good dental habits, can I skip the fluoride and still maintain healthy enamel over the course of my lifetime? Or, should I look for a fluoride rinse, and would that be an effective replacement for toothpaste containing fluoride?</p>

"Can you cauterize a wound with gunpowder?","<p>This question is based off a scene in The Revenant.  In it, a character has a deep laceration across their throat which has been hastily stitched up.  Upon drinking some water, they find that it passes straight through the stitched-up wound.  </p>

<p>The solution presented in the film is to rub some gunpowder (assuming period accuracy, this would be early 1800's black powder, not the modern stuff) into the wound and then ignite it.  Presumably to seal the wound more completely by cauterizing it.</p>

<p>Which leads to my question; are there any documented clinical examples of people cauterizing actual wounds using gunpowder, and if so what was the outcome?  Is gunpowder a plausible method of closing a wound if/when no other alternatives are readily available?</p>

"Is E. coli contagious?","<p>I have a girl that I'm seeing.

"Maximum safe dosage of zinc for 4-6 weeks","<p>After refractive surgery, the doctor suggested taking 1000mg of vitamin C daily to help minimize scarring.  When I went to pick up the vitamins, I also noticed that there was a supplement claiming to be designed to support eye health that also included vitamin C.  Specifically, it has:</p>

<ul>
<li>250mg vitamin C</li>
<li>200 IU vitamin E</li>
<li>40mg zinc (as 50mg zinc oxide)</li>
<li>1mg copper</li>
</ul>

<p>...per tablet.  The recommended dosage is 1 tablet/day, and I'd have to take 4 times that amount to get 1000mg of vitamin C/day.  </p>

<p>From what I can determine 800 IU of vitamin E and 4 mg copper are within safe/tolerable limits, however 160mg of elemental zinc is quite high.  There are only a few conditions I can find where dosages around that level are recommended for therapeutic purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acne (for up to 8 weeks)</li>
<li>Wilson's disease (ongoing)</li>
<li>Macular degeneration (ongoing)</li>
</ul>

<p>So my question is, what's the safe maximum dosage of zinc over a course of 4-6 weeks?  From what I can find, it seems like the biggest risk is that high dosages of zinc lead to copper deficiency (hence why it's used to as a treatment for Wilson's disease).  Does it therefore follow that 160mg/day should be okay as long as it's supplemented with some extra copper and not continued on a long-term basis?</p>

"Can pathogens be transmitted from smelling something?","<p>Long story short, when visiting neighbors the other day, a young child playing outside in the lawn stepped in some fresh animal fecal matter,  and not knowing what it was, ended up taking off their shoe and put it within about 2 inches from their face to sniff it.  The mother panicked, and after two calls to both poison control and the pediatrician, was told by both that as long as the child hadn’t swallowed any of the fecal matter, there was no need to worry about anything.</p>

<p>This made me curious.  By putting something as pathogen-laden as animal fecal matter (or vomit, etc) that close to your face smelling it, wouldn’t you essentially be inhaling all kinds of bacteria, viruses, parasites, etc, assuming they were present?  Or is the vacuum created by smelling something at that distance not strong enough to do this?  </p>

<li>(2) lists a few upsides / positive findings: <br><br>

<blockquote>
  <p>The efficacy of tendon cell use for tendon repair has been verified in a number of in vitro and animal studies, (33-35). Animal studies have revealed
  that implantation of in vitro-expanded autologous tenocytes improved the tendon structure and facilitated the healing process in both an acute
  tendon tear model, (33) and a chronic degenerative tendon disease model, (35). <br><br>
  Clinical applications of Ortho-ATI injections have demonstrated reduced pain and inflammation, restoration of fibre structure, reduction in vascular
  hyperplasia, and improved cellular morphology. This indicates that injection of in vitro-expanded autologous tenocytes alters the progression of
  tendinopathy. (35)""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>(3) also only contains positive results, though I have only be able to access the abstract so far (despite my university library paying <a href=""https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/31605/452"">millions of USD every year for journal subscriptions</a>, and asking a colleague of mine working in one of the largest French medical university): <br><br>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mean final follow-up time for the remaining 15 patients was 4.51 years (range, 3.08-5.17 years). No complications were observed at the patellar tendon biopsy site for any patient. No adverse events, infection, or excessive fibroblastic reactions were observed in any patient at the injection site. Clinical evaluation revealed significant (P &lt; .001) improvement in mean VAS pain score from 5.73 at initial assessment to 1.21 (78% improvement) at final follow-up. Mean QuickDASH, UEFS, and grip strength scores also significantly (P &lt; .001) improved from initial assessment to final follow-up (from 45.88 to 6.61 [84%], from 31.73 to 9.20 [64%], and from 19.85 to 46.60 [208%], respectively). There was no difference in mean QuickDASH and UEFS scores at 1 year and final follow-up (P > .05); however, grip strength continued to improve (P &lt; .001). A validated MRI scoring system indicated that the mean grade of tendinopathy at the common extensor origin improved significantly (P &lt; .001) from initial assessment (4.31) to 1 year (2.88) and was maintained (P > .05) at final follow-up (2.87). At final follow-up, 93% of patients were either highly satisfied or satisfied with their ATI treatment.</p>

</ul>

<p>What are the downsides / risks of autologous tenocyte implantations, if any, aside from:</p>

We first aid guys are not doctors, so we strictly apply this rule before reporting to the medical control.</p>

This happens either when we contact the medical control or when a doctor arrives on the scene by request. </p>

<p>I find this interesting, so the following questions: </p>

<li>Is there a precise pulmonary diseases list that require oxygen therapy to be handled that way ? </li>
<li>Why could a high O2 flow be deleterious for these particular diseases and not others?</li>

"Does consuming xylitol-containing products help prevent dental caries?","<p>Does consuming xylitol-containing products help prevent dental caries?</p>

<p>From the systematic review {1}, the effect is quite inconclusive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We found some low quality evidence to suggest that fluoride toothpaste containing xylitol may be more effective than fluoride-only toothpaste for preventing caries in the permanent teeth of children, and that there are no associated adverse-effects from such toothpastes. The effect estimate should be interpreted with caution due to high risk of bias and the fact that it results from two studies that were carried out by the same authors in the same population. The remaining evidence we found is of low to very low quality and is insufficient to determine whether any other xylitol-containing products can prevent caries in infants, older children, or adults.</p>

<p>Here is an example of some dentist advising to toothbrush before breakfast:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bacteria  begin to metabolize sugars into acids almost instantly. </li>
<li>Salivary calcium levels are lowest in the morning putting your teeth are at a much higher risk of acidic damage from bacteria and dietary acids in the morning than at any other time</li>
<li>Better to brush with fluoride toothpaste before so you have some fluoride left in your mouth when eating. That fluoride will immediately protect your teeth from the acidous attack of consumed carbohydrates and acidic foodstuff. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>arguments for brushing after (waiting >~30 minutes):

<ul>
<li>gentle brushing can help neutralize the pH in the mouth after a meal. Obviously, if you eat something acidic which will temporarily demineralize your teeth, don't start scrubbing away.</li>

I do some light <strong>exercises/Yoga</strong>. Yet, I'm suffering from intestinal gas. Bloating is okay but this gas causes pain in my lower part and I've to go to toilet 2-3 times daily to pass the gas only (most of the times). I <strong>can't evacuate</strong> at single time.</p>

<p>So I want to find the root cause of this gas problem and want to find solution for it.</p>

<p>I have three queries to ask in my case:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does constipation cause intestinal gas?</li>
<li>Do some food cause gas and then gas cause constipation?</li>
<li><p>My stools are not like they should be (sometimes liquid, sometimes hard and color varies, and all with gas).</p>

<p>(a) What can be the reason of this? Bad digestion of food or the constipation   (caused by gas?)?
(b) Is it possible that food is digested properly but gas causes the variations and bad stools?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Two</strong> more thing that can help you answer better is that <strong>1st:</strong> <strong>I think a lot</strong> (I don't actually know if it's normal or a lot) about these problems, search many times on internet for solutions. I think like every <strong>half an hour</strong> about these problems. <strong>2nd:</strong> I'm underweight. Everyone calls me skinny. I even think about it many times a day and feel little ashamed and bad. My weight is <strong>57</strong> Kg and I'm <strong>aged 24</strong>.</p>

<p>Is this thinking is causing all problems and even IBS?</p>

"What is the best probability of recurrent stillbirth with the given data","<p><strong>Summary</strong>: My son was stillborn and I don't know why. My wife and I would like to have another child, but would very much not like to try if the probability of this occurring again is above a certain threshold (of which we have already settled on one). All 3 doctors I have consulted were unable to give a definitive cause of death, nor were any willing to give a numerical estimate of the probability (whether for reasons of legal risk, or something else) that our next baby will be stillborn. I am likely too distraught to properly evaluate my situation and would very much appreciate an independent (from mine) probability estimate of what caused my son to die, and given that cause, how likely it is that our next child will die as well.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: V (L and my only biologically related living son) had no complications during birth, nor has he showed any signs of poor health whatsoever. L has a cousin who has had two miscarriages, and I have an aunt who had several stillbirths followed by 3 live births of healthy children. We know of no other family members that have had similar misfortunes.</p>

<p>J (my deceased son) was the product of a 31 week gestation. L (my wife and J's mother) is 28 years old, gravida 2, para 1. L presented to the physicians office for routine prenatal care and noted that she had not felt any fetal movement for the last five to six days. No fetal heart tones were identified. It was determined that there was an intrauterine fetal demise. L was admitted on 11/05/2015 for induction and was delivered of a nonviable, normal appearing, male fetus at approximately 1:30 on 11/06/2015.</p>

<p><strong>Pro-Con Reasoning</strong>: According to a leading obstetrics textbook1, causes of stillbirth are commonly classified into 8 categories: obstetrical complications, placental abnormalities, fetal malformations, infection, umbilical cord abnormalities, hypertensive disorders, medical complications, and undetermined. Below, I'll list the percentage of stillbirths in each category (which may be used as prior probabilities) along with some reasons for or against.</p>

<p><em>Obstetrical complications</em> (29%)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Against: No abruption detected. No multifetal gestation. No ruptured
  preterm membranes at 20-24 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Placental abnormalities</em> (24%)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For: Excessive fibrin deposition (as concluded in the surgical
  pathology report). Early acute chorioamnionitis (as conclused in the
  surgical pathology report, but Dr. M claimed this was caused by the
  baby's death, not conversely). L has gene variants associated with
  deep vein thrombosis (AG on rs2227589 per 23andme raw data).</p>
  
  <p>Against: No factor V Leiden mutation (GG on rs6025 per 23andme raw
  data and confirmed via independent lab test). No prothrombin gene
  mutation (GG on l3002432 per 23andme raw data and confirmed via
  independent lab test). L was negative for prothrombin G20210A mutation
  (as determined by lab test). Anti-thrombin III activity results were
  within normal reference ranges (as determined by lab test). Protein C
  activity results were withing normal reference ranges (as determined
  by lab test). Protein S activity results were within normal reference
  ranges (as determined by lab test). Protein S antigen (free and total)
  results were within normal references ranges (as determined by lab
  test).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Infection</em> (13%)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For: L visited a nurse's home during the last week of August that
  works in a hospital we now know had frequent cases of CMV infection.
  CMV antibody IgH, CMV IgG, and Parvovirus B-19 Antibody IgG values
  were outside of normal reference ranges. </p>
  
  <p>Against: Dr. M discounted the viral test results as the cause of
  death, since the levels suggested the infection had occurred years
  ago, and therefore could not have caused J's death. Dr. F confirmed
  Dr. M's assessment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Fetal malformations</em> (14%)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Against: No major structural abnormalities. No genetic abnormalities
  detected (CombiSNP Array for Pregnancy Loss results showed a normal
  male micro array profile).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Umbilical cord abnormalities</em> (10%)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Against: No prolapse. No stricture. No thrombosis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Hypertensive disorder</em> (9%)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Against: No preeclampsia. No chronic hypertension.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Medical complications</em> (8%)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For: L experienced 2 nights of very painful abdominal pains that could
  have been contractions on 10/28 and 10/29. L remembers waking up on
  her back a few nights between 10/20 and 11/05 (it is unclear if this
  belongs in this category or somewhere else). </p>
  
  <p>Against: No antiphospholipid antibody syndrome detected (determined
  via Beta-2 Glycoprotein I Antibodies [IgG, IgA, IgM] test). No
  maternal diabetes detected (determined via glucose test on 10/20).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Undetermined</em> (24%)</p>

<p>What is the most likely cause of death? How likely is that cause? Given that cause, if we choose to have another child, then how likely is it to survive its birth? Are there any other ways I could reduce uncertainty (additional tests, etc...) that I haven't listed here? Are there any other forums where these questions are more likely to get good answers? Why won't doctors give probabilities? Help with any of these questions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>If your advice to me is to consult another expert (in addition to the 2 obstetricians and 1 high-risk obstetrician I already have consulted), please also provide concrete tactics as to how to find such an expert and validate their expertise.</p>

"How does the amount of allergen in an allergy shot compare to a 6X homeopathic dilution","<p>I have a bottle of liquid that is meant to build my immunity to ""cedar fever,"" a common allergy in central Texas.  It is a homeopathic medicine which contains the cedar pollen at a 6X dilution, meaning 1 part pollen per 1 million parts water (or alcohol).  The directions say to take 3 drops of this under your tongue 3 times per day.</p>

<p>I'm skeptical that this is going to do anything, but I understand that immunotherapy (allergy shots) work essentially the same way: they expose your body to a small amount of allergen to stimulate the immune system... or something like that.  Anyway, that is a more standard approach that a traditional doctor would prescribe.</p>

"Can one go underweight then bulk afterwards safely?","<p>I am a male, 5'8'' and weight 127 pounds. I still have a little bit of belly fat, approximately 10 millimeters. </p>

"Protocol for prior complications prior to a surgery","<p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

<p>A patient undergoes a surgical procedure (say, total knee arthroscopy). A few days later, the patient is readmitted for a complication, such as a pulmonary embolism or sepsis. The patient is treated for this complication and released. Maybe 20 days later, the patient goes in for another surgical procedure. The following concerns this second procedure, specifically the associated hospital claim form:</p>

<p>Question 1: What is the standard protocol for reporting recent prior complications? For example if the patient originally got sepsis, would it be reported during the second surgery claim as a diagnostic ""present on admission?"" Is there a cutoff (say, 30 days)?</p>

<p>Question 2: Assuming the doctor has access to the patients prior information, what is the standard protocol for deciding whether to proceed with the second surgery? Is there some kind of prior evaluation to determine if the last complication has been treated ""beyond a reasonable doubt?"" More generally, if a doctor proceeds with the surgery, and say, sepsis develops again, would this be considered a negative strike against the doctor (they should have checked the patient's medical history)?</p>

"Does vomiting while feeling nausea from stomach flu make it easier or harder for the body to recover?","<p>I was talking with somebody who believes that when having stomach flu (gastroenteritis) and feeling nausea, you should try to vomit. This person's theory is that the stomach flu virus makes some foods (the ones that cause nausea) toxic to the body. According to this person, the food that has become toxic by the virus is detected by the body as harmful and thus a person feels nausea so that they may vomit the now toxic food. Then, after the toxic food is vomited out, the body is relieved and can recover more easily from the stomach flu.</p>

<p>I thought this was an absurd theory and that you should try to avoid vomiting while having stomach flu to prevent the loss of nutrients. However, I don't know what the actual recommended course of action should be.</p>

<p>How exactly does stomach flu (gastroenteritis) cause nausea? Is the virus making the food we eat toxic? Or it is just making the stomach extra sensitive to anything?</p>

"Recommended size of diclofenac patch","<p>When treating a lateral epicondylitis of the humerus with diclofenac patches, what is the recommended surface of the patch?</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's assume that the entire patch (10x14cm) contains 140 mg of diclofenac (as in <a href=""http://www.medicament.com/378-diclofenac-ratiopharm-1-5-emplatres-medicamenteux-3400935292155.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a>). I understand that reducing its size results in reducing the amount of diclofenac. However, I believe (and may be wrong) one should take into account the distance between the patch and the epicondyle. E.g. if the patch's size is reduced by half, the remaining 70 mg are ""closer"" to the epicondyle than the removed 70 mg (provided that the patch is always placed in such a way that the distance between the patch and the epicondyle is minimized).</p>

<p>So this question could be broken down into two main ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>To what extent does the distance between the patch and the epicondyle matter for the treatment?</li>
<li>To what extent does the diclofenac dose matter for the treatment?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm ok to post them as two separate question if needs be. I don't have any preference.</p>

"Can a sunburn increase your resting heart rate?","<p>I've been using a Fitbit to track my resting heartrate (among other things).  The value has consistently been in the 55-60 range for several weeks (most typical value over the past week or two is 57).  Over the past few days, however, it jumped to around 62; a 10% increase.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPF5C.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPF5C.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The bulk of the increase occurred 2 days ago, and the only thing I can think of that happened within that timeframe is that I got a mild sunburn (from kiteboarding, so primarily on my face/forehead from looking up at the sky all afternoon).  But correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation.  So my question is, can a sunburn lead to an increase in the body's resting heartrate?  And if so, why?</p>

<p><strong>Misc Notes</strong></p>

<p>I know a Fitbit isn't a medically accurate device, and that there's pending litigation over whether they're accurate <em>at all</em>.  However my anecdotal experience with my particular device is that it's quite accurate when at rest (during strenuous exercise the instantaneous readings can indeed be a bit funky and it can temporarily lose count altogether; although the average values that get logged to the dashboard seem reasonable despite the transient outliers/glitches).  So I don't think device inaccuracy/margin of error is the explanation.</p>

"Healing progress of tibia fracture 8 weeks post surgery","<p>I suffered a closed, dislocated comminuted fracture of the extreme distal tibia just above the ankle joint on Feb 19th of this year with surgery the following day. I was treated with an IM nail for the tibia. The injury was caused by slipping on a hill with my foot stuck in the mud; I guess the angle and twisting motion was just right to cause the break. There was an associated fibula break at the same level as the tibia fracture and a second below my knee. The actual ankle joint was not involved at all. </p>

<p>I went for my 8 week xrays, and am slightly concerned at the progress, and was not really satisfied with the answers my OS provided, he seemed in a bit of a rush. On the xrays, the top fibula break showed good callus formation, but the bottom break and the tibia fracture showed no new bone growth. I was cleared to weight-bear as tolerated at week six, and have been doing so in a cam boot while using a walker. My OS did not seem too concerned about this, and did not reduce my weight bearing status. When asked the reason for the lack of bone growth he informed me that the tibia is one of the slowest healing bones in the body, and because of the break's extreme distal location, there is not much muscle and therefore not much blood supply. He said not to worry too much as it's not unusual to have no radiographic signs of bone growth at 8 weeks, sometimes it takes 10 or 12 to show. In addition, he pointed out that the lower fibula fracture showed no callus either, and since the top break was healing well that it was likely just the break's location slowing the healing progress. It is worth noting that the fracture alignment has remained good on all xrays since post op, and I do know that accepted wisdom is that the farther down the tibia you go, the longer it is likely to take to heal. </p>

<p>It just seems odd, as there is no pain on weight bearing, or palpation of the fracture site, and only mild soreness after stressing the leg. Movement is easy, and the leg has achieved a level of somewhat normal comfort, so it seems counter to the radiographic findings. <strong>Is it normal in very distal fractures to take longer than 8 weeks to show signs of callus?</strong> If it was not healing would there be pain and discomfort? I'd imagine there would be, and I experience none.</p>

Even our beloved deep-thinker, Aristotle, pondered this phenomenon: <strong><em>""Why does the heat of the sun provoke sneezing?""</em></strong> And this, my friends, is the question that I present today. Do we know why a large number of people experience the photic sneeze, a sneeze reflex when someone is rapidly bathed in bright lights (esp. when emerging from the dark)?</p>

<p>Is something happening in our occipital lobe, such as the trigeminal nerve, in which the body's wires are essentially crossed? In other words, <strong>can visual stimulation really be a catalyst for a sneeze?</strong> </p>

<p>Or is something else going on here? Is it a nervous, startled reaction from primal times that had some sort of benefit? </p>

<p>Or are there typically more particles in sunlight that can trigger sneezes?</p>

"What is the minimum energy needed to stay alive?","<p>This is a bit of an odd question, but here goes.</p>

<p>Your body needs energy to function. Each organ (brain, heart, etc.) need different amounts of energy to function properly. So it stands to reason that your heart's minimum required energy is higher than that of your spleen (just an example). So here's my question:</p>

<p>""Which organ requires the most minimum energy, and how much energy is the minimum?""</p>

<p>I'm asking this question because I'm trying to figure out ""if energy were removed from a body, such that all parts of the body had the exact same amount of energy, what would be the minimum energy needed to make sure no organs failed"" (this has to do with World Building, to an extent).</p>

<p>Furthermore, it'd be very helpful to know how much energy would be required for said organ not only for survival, but also to maintain a relatively normal, or even active, functionality. Would this equal the energy normally found in a person, or could it be lower?</p>

<p>If I need to clarify further, just let me know. Thank you in advance!</p>

"Is it possible for a healthy person to drown in their sleep without waking up?","<p>In reading about the horrific Battle of Passchendaele during World War One, I came across an anecdotal account of a British officer sheltering in a shell hole in a rain storm. The narrator claims that this officer had no wounds, and had fallen asleep on the wall of the crater while the muddy water it contained was only a foot deep.  The next morning, when the narrator awoke, the officer was still not physically wounded, but the muddy liquid had risen considerably overnight, covering the officer's face and drowning him in his sleep.</p>

<p>I have a hard time believing that an uninjured, healthy person with no neurological or physiological problems would be able to sleep through something like this.  I'm sure many of you have experienced the acute physical discomfort and emotionally jarring panic of unintentionally inhaling water - failing to notice the sensations would be virtually  impossible.  If healthy people could sleep through drowning, the form of torture known as ""waterboarding"" would presumably be unremarkable rather than horrific.</p>

<p>And I know from experience that if you cover your big brother's mouth and nose while he's asleep, he wakes up very quickly (and punches you repeatedly).</p>

<h2>Is the idea of a healthy person with no relevant medical issues  sleeping through their own drowning plausible?  Wouldn't your brain react in such a way as to wake you up so you could save yourself?</h2>

"AED on infants: risks of using adult pads","<p>Until a couple of years ago, in case of cardiac arrest, first-aid guidelines (in France at least) were instructing not to use an AED on infants (&lt; 1 yo), even with pediatric pads or with an energy dose reducer. </p>

<p>Nowadays, it is more and more recommended to use an AED on infants<sup>1</sup>. Preferably using pediatric pads, and even with adult pads should no pediatric pads or reducer be available:</p>

<ul>
<li>What the French guidelines say:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Children and infants</strong>
  <br/>Defibrillation should be performed using appropriate devices (pediatric pads, energy dose reducer...). Should no suitable AED be available, an ""adult"" AED may be used. The pads are in this case applied to the center of the chest for one, and to the center of the back for the other. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><br />The above is a translation I made. The original text is:</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><sup><strong>Chez l’enfant ou le nourrisson</strong></sup>
  <sup><br/>La défibrillation doit être réalisée avec des appareils adaptés (électrodes enfants, réducteur d’énergie...). En l’absence d’un DAE adapté, un DAE «Adulte» peut être utilisé. Les électrodes adultes sont alors positionnées en avant au milieu du thorax pour l’une et au milieu du dos pour

"Can toxins accumulate in the liver?","<p>There are many articles and products that claim that toxins (pollutants from the environment, chemicals from pesticides, heavy metals from drinking water, etc.) can accumulate in the liver and cause adverse health effects. Many times, a ""liver detox"" is recommended to help the liver clear out these toxins.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you inhale or ingest something toxic then the toxins enter your circulation and head directly to your liver. [...] If your liver cannot do its job well or has been inundated with too much work (toxic exposure, illness, etc), then toxic levels rise in your blood and this is considered a significant stress by your body as these toxins can irritate vital organs like your heart, brain, and kidneys as they remain in the circulation too long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(from article <a href=""http://www.wellnessresources.com/health_topics/detoxification/liver.php"">Liver Detox: Get Rid of Toxins</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If “the norm” for you is constant misery and dis-ease, it may be an indication that your body and liver are overloaded with function-impeding toxins. In such instances, the best course of action is to take inventory of your lifestyle to remove the sources of toxins and complement that lifestyle change with a liver cleanse using all-natural, organic methods.</p>

""Using a combination of intense light and radio wave pulses"". (Apparently no UV, no laser and not for hair removal?)

<p>On their marketing page they say that the treatment has the following effects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Antibacterial effect</li>
<li>Reduction of sebum production</li>
<li>Stimulation of blood circulation</li>
<li>Stimulation of tissue regeneration</li>
<li>Reduction of hair follicle blockage</li>
<li>Anti inflammatory</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the hideous state of sufferers and the medical knowledge of this disease as well I was looking for studies on this technique. Claims and praise for its effectiveness seem a bit over the top, indicating a very wide range of application, among them classical acne vulgaris and scars.</p>

Has Bronchitis which is often prevented by normal functioning tonsils been shown to be worse for asthmatics than tonsillitis and are they more susceptible to catching it after having their tonsils removed than before and more so than non-asthmatics?</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.medindia.net/news/tonsil-and-adenoid-removal-may-up-asthma-risk-180084-1.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The following source</a> deals with and indicates there is an increased risk of COPD following tonsil and or adenoid removal but does not deal at all with the case which I am interested in, which is if the the risk increase of incidence in asthmatics is increased after a tonsillectomy as compared to subjects who already frequently get Angina Tonsillitis.</p>

<p>A more detailed review of the study <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/06/180607135151.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">described here</a> breaks down the results further.  Again this does not address my question as the dataset does not sufficiently cover adult males who already suffer from asthma and are prone to getting Tonsillitis already.  I want to know if the risk of getting a COPD disease is increased after a Tonsillectomy for subjects who are already more prone than normal to getting Tonsillitis and if the increased risk of a COPD disease has been shown to have a greater negative impact on subjects measured quality of life than chronic Tonsillitis.</p>

<p>Even better will be any concrete results on the measure of how asthma is affected after having both diseases.</p>

"What's the difference between a fast heart rate during exercise, and a fast heart rate during an anxiety attack?","<p>I'm curious to know what the difference is between having a fast heart rate during exercise and having a fast heart rate say at rest or during an anxiety attack.</p>

<p>It's known that exercise is good for you because your heart is a muscle and benefits from the increased heart rate that you get from exercise such as cardio. So what if someone is having an anxiety attack, and has an increased heart rate similar to if they were running on a treadmill? Do they get the same cardiovascular benefit as if they were exercising? What makes the fast heart rate during the anxiety attack so detrimental, and the fast heart rate during exercise healthy?</p>

"What causes the urge to urinate at a physiological level?","<p>Can someone describe what causes a human the urge to urinate? I understand that it's highly correlated with bladder volume, but it is not causal as bladder spasm can occur even when very little urine is in the bladder. Furthermore, there are apparently foods that can irritate the bladder such that a spasm can occur at low volumes. Thus it appears there may be a mechanical (volume) as well as chemical trigger (irritants). How do both of these triggers occur in the body and how are they related? What causes the detrusor muscle to contract? How does the bladder know when it is full? etc...</p>

"Lesion of the Nn. fibulares","<p>The <em>N. fibularis communis</em> splits at the <em>Caput fibulae</em> into two separate branches. While the <em>N. fibularis superficialis</em> innervates the muscles in the <em>Compartimentum cruris fibularis</em>, the <em>N. fibularis profundus</em> innervates the <em>Compartimentum curries anterius</em> (<em>M. tibialis anterior, M. extensor digitorum longs and M. extensor hallucis longus</em>).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HcHDSm.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HcHDSm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The extensors are responsible for an extension of the upper ankle joint; the fibularis-group are the only pronators of the lower ankle joint. </p>

<p>Thus, I would expect a lesion of the N. fibularis superficialis to result in a club-foot defect (a constant supination of the foot). However, Schulte et al. note that an isolated lesion of the N. fibularis superficialis only affects the sensitive branch of N. superficialis, and there are no motory defects.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an isolated lesion of the N. profundus is affecting both motory and sensory parts and will result in a foot drop and the associated <a href=""https://library.med.utah.edu/neurologicexam/html/gait_abnormal.html#03"" rel=""noreferrer"">steppage gait</a>.</p>

<p>I assume that the motory parts of the N. superficialis probably depart from the nerve very proximal right below the Caput fibulae, and that this results in the different clinical presentations. Am I correct? What is the reason for the motory parts of the N. profundus not departing such proximally? </p>

"Why would the following nutritional scenario lead to hunger etc?","<p>Basically if someone had enough calories(but from mostly from carbohydrates and saturated fat only, with a little protein), why would they still feel hungry?  I know lacking adequate protein and fats can lead to health problems but my question is more about why the body would still by hungry despite this diet e.g. Does the body need an minimun amount of calories from protein?</p>

<p>As an example.  Lets say someone needs 1500 callories to maintain body weight/energy. They live only on some chocolate biscuits.  The nutrition for the chocolate biscuit is as follows and they eat 16 buscuits per day:</p>

<p>1 biscuit/16 per day
<br>calories 116 /(so*16)= 1856 calories per day.
<br>saturated fat 6.0g /(so*16)= 48g fat per day.
<br>Carbohydrate 14g/(so*16) = 224g
<br>of which sugars 9g/(so*16) = 114g
<br>protein  1.3g/(so *16) = 10.4</p>

<p>Note that the diet has no polyunsuturated fats or monosaturated fats.  As you can see it exceed the 1500 calories required, uses both carbohydrate and saturated fat and only has 10.4g protein.</p>

<p>I know this diet would cause helth problems however that is not my question.  My questions is:
Why would the body still be hungry despite well exceeding the calories required?
Is it because the body needs a minimum amount of protein(more than 10.4g), the body needs a minimum amount of polyunstaturaed/monosaturated fats etc?  What is the reason?</p>

The two timelines varied slightly, so I included both sets of times.  The times from the first account are the first listed, and the times from the second account follow, separated by a slash.</p>

<p>?/11:00  Arrives at hospital, unconscious, not breathing, no pulse.</p>

<p>11:15/11:10-11:15:  Lennon pronounced dead</p>

<p>And here are two descriptions of the damage caused by the gunshots: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three of the four bullets that struck Lennon's back passed completely through his body and out of his chest, one of which hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart; nearly all of them would have been fatal by themselves as each bullet hit vital arteries around the heart. As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow-point bullets, Lennon's affected organs (particularly his left lung) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact.<br>
  -  Wikipedia:  The Death of John Lennon </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One round in particular struck the subclavian vein, a primary branch of the aorta and according to the ER team and autopsy the impact caused widespread damage to the major veins of the heart. 
  Quora </p>
  
  <p>Two bullets had passed through his upper left upper arm and entered his chest; two more entered his chest just behind the arm. Travelling through his torso, they ripped through his lungs and arteries. Three of the bullets exited the front of his chest: one under his left clavicle and two on the left side of his sternum. The fourth remained lodged inside his body. </p>
  
  <p>According to Veteran, the worst injury was to Lennon's subclavian artery, a major branch of the aorta, the heart's main artery: ""He was bleeding heavily."" For 20 minutes, Veteran and his associates worked to get Lennon's heart beating again.<br>

"Does eating a sugary multivitamin bring you into the fed state for intermittent fasting?","<p><strong>Intermittent Fasting Overview</strong></p>

<p>I'm doing intermittent fasting. This diet restricts eating to narrow time window to increase fat burn through an increase in the release of growth hormone.

"Is the use of antibiotics justified for respiratory viral infections?","<p>It is a widespread belief that antibiotics should not be used for treating viral infections, as they are effective against bacteria, not viruses (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/features/getsmart/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.cdc.gov/features/getsmart/</a>).

<p>However, antibiotics continue to be prescribed, mostly due to patient demand, and also because of fear of complications (<a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/10/10/bacterial-vs-viral-infections-how-to-protect-yourself-from-antibiotic-resistant.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FoxNews article</a>).

<p>Also, <a href=""http://www.news-medical.net/health/Bronchitis-complications.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> states that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Around one person in 20 with bronchitis may develop a secondary infection in the lungs leading to pneumonia. The infection is commonly bacterial although the initial infection that caused the bronchitis may be viral.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some studies also say that certain classes of antibiotics (e.g. macrolides) have positive anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects (<a href=""http://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2012/649570/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2012 study</a>).</p>

"Does choice of drink affect severity of hangovers?","<p>I'm sure there are big effects from obvious things like amount of alcohol consumed, individual susceptibility, hydration, and so on.</p>

<p>Easily found mass-media articles (e.g. <a href=""http://dhmdepot.com/pages/do-different-types-of-alcohol-cause-worse-hangovers"">this one</a> and <a href=""http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/drugs-alcohol/hangover3.htm"">this one</a>) pretty much exclusively talk about congeners.

"How harmful is it to drink a mix of beverages?","<p>I remember a long time ago (perhaps 20 years ago) that an elementary school textbook on health said ""mixing alcohol beverages exacerbates the strength of the alcohol in the drink, thereby potentially being fatal to those who drink mixed beverages.""</p>

<p>Is this actually true? To my knowledge, basic chemistry dictates that you cannot have more concentration of an element than there was before you mixed the two beverages; for instance, if you mix 100ml of beer(4.5%) and 10ml of spirits(20%), you will only have a 110ml of mixed beverage with 6.5ml of alcohol(4.5%*100+20%*10). In other words, you will have a 110ml(5.9%) drink. Which can't be that much more dangerous than drinking 100ml of beer(4.5%). </p>

<p>So maybe I am remembering the textbook wrongly -- maybe it said that mixing drinks leads you to drink more alcohol? Or is it true that there is a third effect going on -- maybe mixing two different drinks leads to a new, more stronger substance that is greater than the mix of the two drinks? Perhaps because different drinks have different kinds of ethanol mixed into them such that when you combine the two there is a sort of alchemy that makes two seemingly harmless drinks into a sip of poison?</p>

"Why do testosterone / anabolic steroid injection increase the risk of tendon rupture?","<p>In {1}, a physician mentions that testosterone injections increase the risk of tendon rupture. The controlled study {2}, based on  medical histories from 142 experienced male bodybuilders age 35–55, concluded:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AAS (Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid) abusers, as compared to otherwise similar bodybuilders, showed a markedly increased risk of tendon ruptures, particularly upper body tendon rupture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the discussion section, {2} hypothesized that  testosterone injection increase the risk of tendon rupture because ""causes massive hypertrophy of muscles without causing any corresponding strengthening of the associated tendons"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The causes of AAS-associated tendon rupture are still incompletely understood. Two alternative (and not mutually exclusive) hypotheses should be considered. One possibility is that AAS use has little or no deleterious effect on tendons themselves, but merely causes massive hypertrophy of muscles without causing any corresponding strengthening of the associated tendons. Thus, the muscle may simply become too strong for its tendon, increasing the possibility of rupture in response to a sudden stress. Alternatively, it is possible that high doses of AAS, perhaps in conjunction with intense muscular exercise, may damage the structure of the tendons themselves, making them more vulnerable to rupture even in the absence of excessive stress. Evidence favoring the latter hypothesis comes from various animal studies, which have typically found that AAS exposure, usually in conjunction with exercise, led to collagen dysplasia, causing tendons to become stiffer and less flexible, with an increased crimp angle and earlier liability to failure.14, 21, 30–32, 34–39, 52 However, one human study using electron microscopy found no evidence of collagen fibril ultrastructural abnormalities in the ruptured tendons of two AAS users as compared to two non-AAS-using controls.9 Another recent study found no significant difference in maximal strain and toe limit strain in the patellar tendons of 8 long-term AAS users as compared to 8 experienced weightlifters reporting no AAS use, also arguing against the hypothesis of changes in collagen crimp pattern associated with AAS use.47 Thus the evidence for a direct toxic effect of AAS on human tendons remains somewhat inconclusive.</p>
  
  <p>Although our study provides no direct evidence on the above issues, it is notable that we found a markedly increased risk of upper body tendon ruptures in AAS users versus non-using weightlifters, whereas the risk of lower body tendon ruptures was only modestly and non-significantly increased among AAS users. If indeed AAS use causes damage to human tendon architecture, one might predict that our AAS users, with histories of very extensive exposure to very high doses of AAS, would show a uniformly elevated prevalence of all types of tendon rupture throughout the body, rather than primarily an elevated risk of upper-body tendon ruptures. Therefore, our findings might be taken to weigh to at least some degree against a hypothesis of direct tendon damage, and might weigh more in favor of the simple theory that hypertrophied muscles can more easily break their tendons. In favor of the latter possibility, it is notable that AAS users are particularly prone to increase upper body musculature, leading to massively hypertrophied pectoralis, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii muscles, while often showing less of an effect on lower body musculature.43 Thus, it is conceivable that muscle hypertrophy alone might account for our findings without postulating an additional mechanism of AAS-induced tendon damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this study has been published, has there been any progress on the understanding of AAS-associated tendon ruptures?</p>

"What really happens to the heart during cardiac arrest and why is an AED useful?","<p>I'm interested in studying medicine in the future and this question is really bothering me. So most sources would say that Cardiac Arrest occurs when the heart 'stops functioning normally' and hence cannot pump blood effectively to our organs, including the brain which causes us to lose consciousness and breathing. We also know that a defibrillator cannot be used to restart a heart that has no rhythm, only to reset a chaotic one. So why then, is an AED useful if cardiac arrest causes the heart to stop? (assuming that that's what happens during cardiac arrest...) Does the rapid CPR cause it to start having some sort of rhythm again? Or is it that cardiac arrest actually doesn't STOP the heart completely, but the slightest ventricular fibrillation could cause oxygen deficiency in the brain and cause us to lose consciousness? </p>

"Should I get my kids have pre-exposure rabies vaccination due to our cat","<p>I live in Texas, USA. There is plenty of wildlife around here, and thus considerable records of rabies incidents transmitted by them. We have a cat less than a year old, and had 1st rabies vaccination. He goes out almost daily and sometimes even spends the night out. He has an independent nature, and trying to restrict him indoors is likely to cause him abandon us. I have 3 kids ages ranging from 3 to 10. They all love to play with him. He is very playful. But he sometimes bites either as part of playing or to express displeasure, e.g., if my 3 year old held him against his will. It does not cause bleeding but it is likely to penetrate the skin. There are also rare incidences of scratching that cause bleeding. Should I have my kids have pre-exposure rabies vaccination as a preventive measure?</p>

<p>Based on what I am reading, even if the cat is exposed, rabies would not make its way to his saliva because he is vaccinated. But then, there is the chance of his rabies vaccination did not work. Even if it did work, I assume it could be possible to carry and transmit externally, e.g., nails and teeth. </p>

<p>Overall, if there is 1% chance over the course of say 10 years, I would take it as a considerable chance because it is a life and death matter and we may not notice our kids exposed before it is too late. In that case, would the cost and side-effects of vaccination for kids worth it?</p>

"Long-term effects of lens removal as the vitreous ages?","<p>In a case of pediatric cataract surgery where the lens was not replaced, there is no lens to serve as a barrier between the aqueous and the vitreous.  I once asked an ophthalmologist what keeps them from mixing together in that case -- are they of different viscosities, like oil and water, for instance?  She said it's something like that, but that with aging the vitreous gradually thins (causing floaters, among things) and they end up blending together.  She said this isn't really a problem in practice, as each humour's main function is to deliver nutrients to the right parts of the eye and they can still do that.</p>

<p>I understand that the aqueous drains through a duct, so that part isn't a closed system.  But the vitreous usually is a closed system, as I understand it, which is why floaters don't go away.  A remedy for floaters that is sometimes brought up is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitrectomy"" rel=""nofollow"">vitrectomy</a>, but that carries risk of retinal detachment (according to Wikipedia, and I think I remember hearing that from an ophthalmologist too).</p>

<p>Putting all of these together, it seems possible that with aging, as the vitreous becomes less distinct from the aqueous, some of the vitreous might end up draining through the same duct that the aqueous drains through, in an eye with no lens to serve as a barrier.  Is that the case?  And if it is, does it carry with it a higher risk of the things that can go wrong with vitrectomy (especially retinal detachment)?  Or does the risk that comes with that procedure not arise with a slow, gradual aging process?</p>

<p>Update: I've seen a reference to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_membrane"" rel=""nofollow"">hyaloid membrane</a>, which, in addition to the lens, sits between the vitreous and aqueous.  I don't know if this membrane is also removed when a lens is removed or if it remains.</p>

<p>I’ve been to a few health talks, and they have always suggested that with my lifestyle, I should be gaining a lot of weight. However, I am not only not gaining weight, but actually losing weight at a slow pace over the last few years. My BMI is close to perfect.</p>

<p>I live a normal life, apart from the fact that I tire easily. This is the reason I don’t exercise. I once attended a yoga class where the instructor claimed that after some light yoga in the morning, participants would feel energized all day. Whereas other participants reported that this was indeed the case with them, I would go home and need to sleep (presumably from exhaustion). From childhood, I have always been described by friends and family as having a ‘weak constitution’.</p>

<p>However, I stress that as long as I don’t explicitly exercise, I function perfectly normally, and probably come across as a generally energetic individual, though I still seem to need more sleep than average (8.5 to 10 hours). I do not have any medical problems at all (assuming that ‘weak constitution’ does not qualify as a disease or medical condition).</p>

<p>Why is it that I can eat fattening foods, not exercise, and yet not put on weight? I have been told that this is due to a ‘high metabolic rate’. I have an intuitive idea of what this means, but what are its consequences? Is it a good or bad thing? If both, what are the positive and negative aspects of it? Should I try to exercise? How can I do so without exhausting myself?</p>

"Did the emergence of H1N1 flu in 2009 significantly increase overall spread of influenza in humans for future years?","<p>According to the quick info on this search link: </p>

<p>H1N1 (swine) flu started with pig, bird, and human flu viruses mixing DNA into a 2009 pandemic strain. Since then, H1N1 has been a fixture of annual flu reporting, and according to the link above, it's now considered a seasonal flu right next to  H3N2 influenza A.</p>

<p>Additional references: spread and mutation patterns</p>

<p>According to the study in the link above, H3N2 flu strains are constantly being transmitted and mutated around in east and southeast Asia, quickly spreading to other nations (usually through plane travel) in their respective flu seasons. Each strain of H3N2 typically causes a wave of infections outside the east/southeast Asia region and then dies out (source: the Vox link above).</p>

<p>H1N1 behaves more like an influenza B strain in mutation and infection patterns (source: the Business Insider news link above). It doesn't mutate as quickly and tends to remain local, although it can persist for years in the same geographic neighborhood.</p>

<p>The metrics:
Define the number of flu infections for a year in a country as the sum of the total number of times a person caught the flu in that country. For example, if you got the flu (different strains) 3 times in your home country over a season, you add 3 to this metric for your country. This number of points gets counted over every person in each country. </p>

<p>Overseas infection rule: If you are visiting another country and are infected with a flu virus, this counts against the country you are visiting for purposes of the above metric.</p>

<p>International travel rule: Flu infections received on a plane, international mass commercial transit, or a port used for such transit count against the country where the source originated. For example, if a visitor from Country 1 with an active flu infection travels via plane to Country 2 and infects a number of people there at an airport terminal, all of the people infected at the terminal are counted against Country 1.</p>

<p>Define the total number of global infections in a year as the above metric summed up across all countries for the given year.</p>

<p>The question:
Does the existence of H1N1 as a seasonal strain significantly increase the total number of global flu infections each year according to the above metric? In particular, does H1N1 throw in additional misery (in terms of total number of global flu infections) each year, or would the slack have been made up through extra spread and dominance of traditional flu strains if H1N1 never existed?</p>

"To what degree does tactile stimulation affect muscle tone?","<p><em>Hard to find the appropriate board for this, but I'm after an answer from a neuro-perspective.</em></p>

<p>A <a href=""https://naprapater.se/en/naprapathy/about-naprapathy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Naprapath</a> once tested the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tone</a> of different muscles concluding that I was, quoting, (globally) ""hypertonic"". My question(s) specifically regards this test/assessment of tonicity that roughly went as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Asking the patient to <strong>resist the practitioners force</strong> with some muscle, e.g. trying to force the patient's arm downwards while the patient is pushing it upwards.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong><em>Stimulating</em></strong> another muscle or part of the body (nociceptors/<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_nerve_ending"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">free nerve endings</a> in the skin above/around some muscle or other part of the body) by <strong>gentle touch</strong> such as scratching; palming; flicking; and even snapping ones fingers above the skin (to <em>""create sonic waves affecting nociceptors over a larger area""</em>);</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Repeating step 1</strong>.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><em><strong>Example 1</strong>: Asking the patient to force the head forward (backward) into the practitioners hand, which pushes back to even out the force. Then gently flicking the patients nose upwards (downwards) and repeating the same task again. Possibly, the second time, the muscles would have a significantly (noticeable by this test) higher tone.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Example 2</strong>: Asking the patient to lie on her back, resist the practitioners force which pushes the right or left leg inwards (by pushing outwards); Then asking the patient to hold one hand (gently) on her chin, and then repeating the resisting of the same force. (If there had been some trauma to the chin, this had apparently shown in the muscle tone in a significant way.</em></p>

<p><strong>The purpose</strong> is to see if the muscles can be made less tonic or relaxed (weaker) this way, by stimulation of nociceptors. </p>

<p><strong>Loose explanation from the practitioner</strong>: ""Stiffness of muscles are almost always caused by some trauma or damage to the body; I am trying to find the surface of your body where this damage is located (by gently touching it while asking you to resist my force to see if the tone of the muscle changes)"". By 'tone' here, they seem to loosely mean that a high tone would imply that I can quickly ""lock"" my muscles and thus resist quickly, and my resisting is perceived as strong, while low would be the opposite. And in this part of the assessment it doesn't seem to matter what muscle they're testing the tone of, it would supposedly affect most muscles if I touched the right place.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question(s)</strong>:</p>
  
  <p>Are there any <strong>neurological basis</strong> for a procedure like the one described above? i.e. How could such gentle touch of the skin affect muscle tone somewhere else in the body? (Perhaps if there's prior, healed, damage to the place of touch.) Would you refer to some explanations, and/or studies?</p>

"Inhaling pills possible?","<p>A friend of mine told me some time ago that it actually can be dangerous to take pills (the process of taking it), which to me seemed like a pretty bold statement -- swallowing a pill doesn't seem to be that hard.</p>

<p>The idea was that if you are not careful enough and for example start coughing while taking the pill and then try to swallow it again, the pill could end up in your lungs and cause all kinds of nasty things. I don't really know a lot about medicine and therefore I was a bit surprised at first (this didn't seem to be that far fetched at all). Upon thinking a bit about it and googling I really couldn't find anything useful. A lot of articles talk about swallowing things you shouldn't (battery, etc.) and what to do then, but I really didn't find anything understandable about inhaling a pill. </p>

<p>So can this happen? Would you know that it happend? And is there an upper limit of how big the pill can be (I imagine that inhaling a pill of 2mm x 2mm x 2mm is a lot easier, if possible, than a 1cm x 5mm x 5mm or something the like). If it can happen, what are you supposed to do if it happens?</p>

<p>PS. Let's, for the sake of argument, assume that you are not a child or a extremely old person (or any other kind of group of people that could have problems with swallowing).</p>

"Lymph node swelling","<p>I'm sure that most of us had, at some point in their life, swollen lymph nodes (be it because of a flu or some other kind of not-too-serious illness) and there is generally no reason to panic if one finds a swollen lymph node on their body. Now, even if the swelling is often associated with something harmless in certain cases it can be dangerous and needs further checking by doctors. If you  google when you should see your doctor, one often finds lists like these.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if your swollen lymph nodes:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Have appeared for no apparent reason </li>
  <li>Continue to enlarge or have been present for two to four weeks</li>
  <li>Feel hard or rubbery, or don't move when you push on them</li>
  <li>Are accompanied by persistent fever, night sweats or unexplained    weight loss</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>(<a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-lymph-nodes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353902"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Source</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first and last point seem quite intuitive to me, or at least, I as a non-medic can check that. But the two middle points are somewhat confusing to me. </p>

<p>For example, <em>have been present for two to four weeks</em>, so does this mean, that if it isn't something serious, they should disappear in two to four weeks, and if it is something serious than they wouldn't disappear at all? Or would it take them longer than that to disappear and therefore the doctor couldn't determine what the problem is? The third point is something that seems completely indefinable for a non-medic. I'm mean, what exactly is hard/rubbery (any reference, like f.e. a rock, or more like a eraser). The same goes for the comment <em>don't move when you push on them</em>. What exactly should I expect when I push them? How far should I be able to push them? Does pushing inwards, not to the side, also count? What to do if they don't really hurt?</p>

<p>Of course, all of these questions are simply answered by calling your doctor and going, if something like this arises. But nevertheless it would be nice if someone could maybe clarify a bit what the two middle points in the quote from above exactly mean.</p>

"Race and bone marrow donor search","<p>I've heard the argument that race is not a real scientific entity several times. Despite what on the surface look like very different traits, humans share significantly more DNA with each other than there are differences between them. Furthermore, the genetic variation within the continent of Africa is greater than what the variation between a typical Nigerian or Norwegian could be. However, I recently heard of a campaign in Israel to find a bone marrow donor for a woman suffering from Cancer. The campaign asked for anyone of Yemeni descent to provide a saliva sample in order to find a match. </p>

<p>So my question is if race does not exist then why are people of Yemeni descent more likely to be better bone marrow matches? What do you call the fact that they are more likely to be a better match if not race?</p>

"Consistency of fingerprint after an injury","<p>If the skin is completely abraised or otherwise removed, will the renewed skin have the same fingerprint?</p>

<p>About 8 years back, I was running an obstacle course and one of the obstacles was to climb up a vertical rope, reach the top and come back down. I climbed up no problem but I didn't know how to come down, so I slid down the rope at the expense of friction to break the velocity. The rope was made of jute. This resulted in the skin from my finger tips and parts of my palms to completely tear away. The tears were deep enough to reveal muscle.</p>

<p>It took about a month or two for the skin to completely come back. My question is, when such an injury occurs, is it plausible to assume that my fingerprints now are the same as they were before the injury? If yes, what mechanism goes into ensuring this? </p>

"Using farsighted glasses to counter nearsightedness?","<h3>Edit:</h3>

<p>I might not have worded my question well enough. A shorter and more direct version would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can nearsightedness be just a result of eyes getting accustomed to working at very close distances most of the time?</li>
<li>If so, can it be possible to revert that adjustment by wearing <em>anti-corrective</em> glasses to make those short distances seem longer?</li>
<li>Can wearing <em>anti-corrective</em> glasses potentially cause any long lasting eyesight damage?</li>
</ol>

<h3>Original question:</h3>

<p>I had pretty much perfect eyesight till about 13 years, at which point I started using computers <strong>a lot</strong>. Since then my eyesight seems to have been degrading slowly, which is probably related. By the age of 18 I had about 1.0 nearsightedness. However, after the following 7 years of university and a very computer-bound job, I think it hasn't even reached 1.5, even though I was using computers much more than before. It's like it degrades just enough to accommodate for regularly staring at a screen, not even half a meter away at times.</p>

<p>That made me wonder. Sitting further away from monitors just isn't practical most of the time, even though I can see everything fine from at least twice the usual distance, but what if I started wearing farsighted glasses in front of computer instead? The screen would look like it's further away, so logically my eyes should not have to get used to looking at such close objects.</p>

<p>Does it even make sense? Am I missing something? Can trying that hurt my eyesight somehow? It seems like it should work, but I could not find any related info.</p>

"Consistently high WBC, normal CRP in a post-cardiac arrest patient","<p>A patient had an elective coronary angioplasty which showed 80% blocked LAD. A stent was placed. She was stable and sent home. The next day she felt unwell and collapsed with LOC for a few seconds. She was taken back to hospital and was admitted to CCU for observation. She had sinus bradycardia around 40. That night she was bradycardic and went into bradycardia-induced VT leading to VF and full arrest. Fortunately, she was resuscitated and a temporary pacemaker (TPM) was inserted. They planned to insert a permanent pacemaker (PPM) within the next few days; however, her WBC count was 20 000, predominantly neutrophils. CRP was 19. Her baseline before angioplasty was within normal range. It's been 3 weeks since then, multiple blood and urine cultures have been negative, no fever, she seems to be improving physically. She has been on a multitude of antibiotics including piptaz + amoxicillin and now vancomycin. Each antibiotic initially reduced WBC count to a few figures but back up the next day. At the moment its hovering at 16K.</p>

<p>The initial TPM was removed and replaced with another a week ago in hope that it was likely TPM lead infection.</p>

<p>Why would she have a raised WBC count with no other suggestion of infection? Do post arrest patients have a high WBC count due to reperfusion injury? Or could it be a reaction to foreign body?</p>

"How are skills stored in the human brain?","<p>How are skills stored in the human brain? I understand the difference between STM and LTM (short/long term memory). However, remembering a fact is different than learning a skill.</p>

<p>Example: Let's take a 99% mental-only skill like Software Engineering.
You understand that IF this, THEN that, ELSE something-else. That's how you define a really basic piece of decision logic. There are many more complex forms of that which can become very abstract. At some point, you understand all of them (maybe even for dozens of languages) and you understand it so well, you subconsciously take a requirement and translate it into possibly hundreds of lines of code within seconds. This seems similar to the way people learn to read/write and speak multiple languages.</p>

<p>Is this simply a function of LTM which translates bits of code into actions / results? If so, how does that LTM become more readily accessible than other areas of LTM where one has to think harder to remember something? Or when it comes to learned skills (vs just facts), is this a different kind of memory entirely?</p>

"OBGYN wants to insert IUD (Mirena) to treat my painful periods, but should I be worried by all the recent lawsuits?","<p>My OBGYN could not officially diagnosis me with endometriosis without performing a laparoscopy (a surgery), and he wants to avoid that at all cost, and he says, even if I had endometriosis,  the treatment would still be the same. So he is  going to treat me as if I have endometriosis. Looking at my medical history (all the pain/vomiting/nausea/PCOS, but yet having a clear Colonoscopy and Endoscopic Ultrasound and no food allergies) in addition to pressing on trigger points on my abdomen and inside cervix, he believes I have endometriosis.</p>

<p>He believes that endometriosis may be contributing to my fatigue, extreme nausea, abdominal pain, migraines, digestive issues, etc. So to solve that he wants to insert an IUD into my uterus in two weeks. You can read about general IUDs <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrauterine_device"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Basically, it's a contraceptive that is inserted directly inside me. But it should help with all the symptoms associated with my period by getting rid of my period. It can last for up to 5 years. I can remove it (if I ever were to try and have kids). He thinks this is far superior to treating my pain than regular birth control. </p>

<p>The one he wants me on is called Mirena. You can read about it <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mirena/basics/definition/prc-20012867"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.

How common are the side effects of fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, etc?</p>

"Had Triple arthrodesis (reconstructive/bone fusions) surgeries 10 yrs ago, but now bad arthritis. Total Ankle Replacements the answer? Only 28. Help!","<p>I was born with congenital bone fusions throughout my body (feet, back, and feet), and have had numerous surgeries on all of the above. However, my feet/ankles have been suffering the most from my bone abnormalities insomuch that it became necessary at the prime of my youth 18 and then again at 19 to have <strong>Triple Arthrodesis (fusions of my ankle/ft bones together) surgeries</strong> on each of my feet respectively. To read more about this procedure, you can read it here: <a href=""http://www.aofas.org/footcaremd/treatments/pages/triple-arthrodesis.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Triple Arthrodesis"">http://www.aofas.org/footcaremd/treatments/pages/triple-arthrodesis.aspx</a>  (Yes, that means I attended my senior yr of High School in a wheelchair). It was a painful process, but for about 6 years or so I was much better able to manage the pain that I had previously experienced on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Now, being only 10 years later at the <strong>age of 28</strong>, X-rays show that arthritis has taken up residence in both of my ankles and <strong>the arthritis is continuously expanding because of the fusions due to the surgery</strong>; getting worse and worse. I have developed <strong>bone spurs on both ankles</strong> to compensate for all the stress put on my deteriorating ankles. But I didn't need an X-ray to reveal that. My joints swell like balloons and hurt to the extent that you can almost hear the bones rubbing against the other bones. <strong>This has severely limited my capacity to live a normal life.</strong> </p>

<p>When I was a bright-eyed 18 year old facing Triple Arthodesis there were vague warnings that sometime in the distant future (maybe when I was in my mid-fifties? Maybe older?) that I would have to address potential arthritis. And that I shouldn't expect to run marathons. None of that mattered to me -- that was too far in the future to concern me. But having to take a Tylennol 3 from just walking around Walmart at age 28 is not acceptable. <strong>How do I reverse the impacts of my Triple Arthodesis? Is a Total Ankle Replacement the answer for me?</strong> </p>

<p>I tried researching online, but all I can find was ""Triple Arthodesis vs. Total Ankle Replacements"" and how avoiding bone fusions (that decrease your range of motion is the last option), but unfortunately, Total Ankle Replacements weren't a thing when I was 18. <strong>But can someone who has had the Triple Arthodesis procedure done in the past benefit from a Total Ankle Replacement now?</strong> <strong>Or is it irreversible?</strong> Will the orthopedic specialist just write me off and tell to just wear a brace for the rest of my life and use a cane even though I'm so young. Is there anything that can be done?</p>

  Alzheimer's disease. Rather than drawing the clock face normally, the
  disease caused Cahalan to draw all of the numbers 1 through 12 on the
  right face of the clock, because the right side of her brain, which
  regulates the left side of the body, was inflamed. Najjar used this to
  help diagnose Cahalan and start her road to recovery. -Wikipedia link above ^^</p>

"Is dental floss really effective? According to studies, it is not","<p>Recently I had to go through a lot of ultrasound teeth cleaning because my gums suffered inflammations in the past. I am doing the dental cleaning every 3 to 4 months and every time the dentist says that the gum is getting better and better because I am flossing thoroughly. Before the inflammation, I never flossed so this is kind of a novel procedure for me. </p>

<p>So I empirically assumed that flossing is really the thing that helps to heal, as also acknowledged by the dentist. </p>

<p>The thing is... there are actually no studies to prove this statement. I have looked for articles and I found for instance <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/health-36962667"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""https://apnews.com/f7e66079d9ba4b4985d7af350619a9e3/medical-benefits-dental-floss-unproven"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""http://www.ada.org/en/science-research/science-in-the-news/the-medical-benefit-of-daily-flossing-called-into-question"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>. I understand from the articles that there is not sufficient proof to endorse the procedure. Despite this, the dentists still recommend flossing.</p>

<p>From one of the articles:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evidence for flossing is “weak, very unreliable,” of “very low” quality, and carries “a moderate to large potential for bias.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What should one understand from this? Is there someone here that works in this field or did some research on this issue? </p>

<p>The reason why I ask this is that I want to eliminate using the floss and replace it with WaterPik, which I find more comfortable, fast and less abrasive. But I have also seen articles in which they write that floss is better than WaterPik. So then I come back to the same issue...</p>

<p>I would also like to know if the dental ultrasound cleaning is actually the one healing me or is the flossing? Can anyone help me with this?</p>

"Glutamate substitute for ALS?","<p>I was just reading up on some ALS literature, and noted something on a newly diagnosed patient. The (current) assessment is that this particular patient's ALS symptoms are caused by a glutamate deficiency. What is interesting is that the patient is a Type 2 diabetic, which would hint at that as an original source for the deficiency, as glutamate is typically synthesized in cells from glucose. But glutamate can also be synthesized, in cells, from aspartate, as in aspartame. The patient claims to have stopped drinking sugar-free beverages about a year ago, for personal reasons, which roughly lines up with the onset of the symptoms. Could it be that the patient has been unknowingly substituting glucose-to-glutamate synthesis with aspartate-to-glutamate synthesis and the change in diet stopped that? And is it maybe possible to add aspartame products to the diet and get that work-around running again, to reduce glutamate deficiency symptoms?</p>

<p>I sadly lack access to ALS experts around here, so I thought this could be a place to ask.</p>

"Is eating too much cholesterol bad?","<p>I've been researching cholesterol a bit (my grandma is telling me off) and I've found some sites saying that eating cholesterol is not bad since you're body makes 75% of the cholesterol found in your body.

"What is the estimated monetary benefit (or cost) of annual checkups?","<p>I've been seen seeing the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foL9gfbfweY"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""TV Doctors"" commercials</a> recently from Cigna.  And it got me wondering.  Strictly from a financial sense, what is the estimated average benefit (or cost) of annual checkups.  Seeing these commercials run so heavily would make me think that they see this as beneficial to them financially.</p>

<p>Even if it is being done more to enhance their image than to directly make money, it would seem they've decided that the cost of annual checkups must be fairly reasonable for them.</p>

<p>So what is the estimated financial benefit of an average checkup?</p>

<p>Though I really have to imagine there has to be a wealth of data on this question out there SOMEWHERE, let's definitely try to simplify things in hopes of getting some kind of an answer by making the consideration of costs just strictly the net return for a patient paying all costs at approximate market value.  Obviously it probably changes by age, and seeing such fluctuations how would be absolutely brilliant, but an average value would be just fine.  And there's quite a lot of estimation and fluidity in such values, as costs and values change... so even old data would work great for me.  Just to get a rough idea with some support.</p>

"Why is acid reflux (allegedly) often confused with chest pain?","<p>I get irregular, sharp, short bursts of pain in my chest, on the left side, near my heart. Supposedly, heart and circulatory related pain is neither sharp nor short, so this pain may be muscle or lung-lining related. (I also haven't had any shortness of breath, nausea, or fatigue). </p>

<p>I've had plenty of acid reflux over the years (stomach acid gets into my throat and burns like crazy until addressed), and I just don't understand why, whenever I try to look for information about my mystery chest pain, I'm forced to hear about something as seemingly irrelevant as acid reflux.</p>

<p>It's like calling tech support and they ask you if your computer's plugged in. Am I missing something here? Can acid reflux cause actual chest pain, and not just esophageal pain? If it can, then how? I'm under the impression that the digestive system is a closed system, and that a stomachache shouldn't cause, say, shoulder pain or a backache.</p>

"Can I use take pills to prevent micronutrient deficiencies and not worry about my diet too much?","<p>There are several nutrients which I'm not getting enough of from food, in some cases hardly any, due to dietary restrictions. I <em>can</em> get the nutrients I need if I carefully structure my diet, but I don't want to. I'm really lazy. I'm still trying to eat a varied diet including plenty of fruits and veggies, I just know it's not enough. So I'm taking a multivitamin and a couple of other pills.</p>

<p>Pretty much all the information I can find suggests this is a bad idea, but none of it seems to directly answer why. The biggest apparent reason is that supplements are not absorbed as well as food. But I can't see any indication of how well supplements are absorbed. I know it depends on a lot of factors (including the dosage) and is probably hard to measure, but don't we have at least a rough idea in specific situations? If I take, say, 100% of the RDA of iron in a pill, is the amount my body absorbs probably more or less than 50%? How much do caffeine, vitamin C, calcium, etc. affect the absorption? The information always seems to be qualitative, not quantitative.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if a certain dosage won't be sufficiently absorbed to fulfill my requirements, why can't I just take more? I know that this leads to diminishing returns and high dosages can be problematic, but that doesn't quite explain it. The amounts found in supplements are generally on the order of 100% of the RDA, <em>much</em> less than the amounts which are considered risky which are more like 1000% (with the exception of calcium, where there are some concerns about supplementing around 100-200%). It's hard to believe that the cost of manufacturing the pills or the difficulty of swallowing them would significantly increase in many cases, especially when we're talking about adding a few milligrams or less.</p>

<p>Other than that, many of the fears seem irrelevant. Don't take certain dangerous supplements like the dirty dozen. Don't make certain combinations. Don't try to use supplements to treat diseases like cancer. And so on.</p>

<p>Is the problem uncertainty? Does it just seem safer to tell people to get their vitamins from food? Or perhaps do some people know what can and should be done but others are still catching up?</p>

<p>OK, that's a lot of rambling, let me try and make a coherent, SE style question:</p>

<p>Suppose I'm a healthy adult between the ages of 20 and 40. I don't know of any medical conditions that I have relevant to supplements. I am not currently deficient in anything. I can afford to buy as many supplements as I need, I remember to take them, and I don't mind doing so.</p>

<ul>
<li>For which nutrients can I safely obtain X% from supplements (where X is ideally 100 but can be as low as 50 if necessary), and under what conditions (e.g. don't drink coffee)? How much of the supplement should I take to reach this amount?</li>
<li>For which nutrients is it a really bad idea to lean on supplements, and why? Are there some supplements that just don't seem to work? Or are the risks too great?</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: it looks like I need to clarify. I'm vegan. There are several nutrients that I can't easily get from food, particularly B12, calcium, and vitamin D. My diet is generally fairly good - plenty of fruits, veggies, nuts, and grains - but that doesn't help enough with those nutrients. Yes some vegetables have calcium but I don't want to eat, say, 600g of kale every day. It seems safe to say that I need calcium in my body, so I want to know if pills work for that. I'm not suggesting living on junk food and pills.</p>

<p><a href=""http://accuratebloodpressure.com/blood_pressure.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://accuratebloodpressure.com/blood_pressure.html</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is an appropriate site [for a properly performed invasive measurement]? <strong>It has been shown by many investigators that invasive pressure is greatly influenced by the measurement site.</strong> Systole in particular changes as the site in moved from the aorta away from the heart towards the extremity. Usually it is a surprise to the newcomer to this field that systole increases as one moves down the arterial stream. This increase (systolic heightening) is caused by the reflection of the incidence waveform adding to the pressure. The amount of this increase depends on the transmission speed of the artery, which is affected by the arterial compliance. Hard arteries produce more heightening than compliant arteries.</p>
  
  <p>The pressure in the aorta is not much influenced by reflections, and may be the best indication of ""true"" blood pressure. Unfortunately this is a very difficult place to measure blood pressure except when undergoing cardiac evaluation or surgery, and there are no population studies to indicate the cardiovascular risk factors.</p>

  <p>Estimates range widely concerning the proportion of medical care in the United States that is based on, or supported by, adequate evidence [9-14]. However, <strong>given concerns about the extent to which this information may be generalized and the quality of the evidence that is used, some place this figure at well below half</strong>. Regardless of the precise level, there is no question about the need for improvement. Part of the challenge is the appropriate delivery of what has already been proven effective. Medical care is becoming more complex with the increase in multifaceted chronic diseases, the development of new interventions, and the pressures to reduce the time of patient-provider interaction in the face of greater administrative burdens. New care management approaches, decision support systems, and incentives will be required to help providers and patients work together to ensure that the care delivered is the care that is known to be most effective.</p>

"Can the human body switch to a ""starvation"" mode?","<p>I've heard on multiple occasions from less than credible sources that dieting by eating less (usually implemented by skipping meals, not smaller meals) will cause the human body to enter some sort of ""starvation"" mode where it hoards calories because it thinks it might not get more calories in the future. Most people also mention it can cause an increase in weight. The people I hear it from say it like it's common sense and widely believed so they never have anything to support it. ""That's just the way it is"" they claim.</p>

<p>There's a lot of variables at play here and I'm no biologist or nutritionist but I'm interested in knowing if there's any research backing this claim. Is there a starvation mode that your body can fall in to? If so, what triggers it? Has there been any research into how the body reacts to fewer feeding times and overall less calories? What are the long term (6+ months?) affects of a diet like this if a person can still ensure proper nutrient intake aside from calories?</p>

<p>I'm not talking about extreme fasting or starvation diets. I'm thinking diets with 1000-1500 calories a day in a consistent fashion (taking in roughly the same amount of calories at roughly the same time of day). Although I would be interested in studies or knowledge outside of these limits.</p>

<p>Even if we ignore starvation as a dietary method, if a person stopped eating would there be a distinct difference in how their body processes fats or expends energy in the starvation process?</p>

"Can a young person with hemochromatosis have normal iron levels?","<p>Hemochromatosis is a genetic disease that results in the body absorbing too much iron, leading to excessive iron in the body which can lead to organ damage.</p>

<p>Symptoms of hemochromatosis tend to occur after age 40, however, early iron overload may have no symptoms even though organ damage is occurring.</p>

<p>My question relates to how iron levels change in a patient with hemochromatosis over time.  Specifically, if iron studies are done in a young patient under age 25 and return a normal result, can we conclude the young person doesn't have hemochromatosis, or is it possible that they still have the disease and if we test them again in 10 years their iron levels will have increased?</p>

<p>If it is possible for a patient with hemochromatosis to have normal iron levels at a young age, is it possible for organ damage resulting from the disease to occur before iron levels are outside normal range or only after this?</p>

The detritus-filled tonsils are suctioned with a glass suction cup, thereby removing the debris and massaging the tonsils at the same time, which (according to the current viewpoint) promotes lymphatic drainage [140]. Then the tonsils are brushed or sprayed with disinfectant solutions. However, this method is more difficult to apply in children because the suction procedure is quite painful.   </p>

"Healthy way to become numb","<p>What can I do to enter a numb state of being so that I don't feel constantly dragged down, fatigue, stress, and all the other downs people experience? For years I've tried exercising, eating healthy, etc. It works to some degree. I get plenty of sleep. I believe the issue is mental. For example, this morning I have a truck load of science experiments to build, but as I sat down to start building them I was swamped with horrible feelings, making it feel like I was carrying a mountain on my shoulders. At least one issue is that I get stressed due to fear of failure. I would much rather spend my entire day thinking. To leave my inner world of thought and actually do physical stuff feels like climbing a tall mountain. It's painful. </p>

<p>Is there anything I can do to numb such sensations? Sometimes I want to be a robot who feels no pain. Perhaps coffee is the answer. Or meditation. Or electric shock therapy lol. Or hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Or joggers high. Or some kind of psychological therapy or hypnosis.</p>

<p>The reason I ask about becoming numb is that twice when life became incredibly horrible I suddenly had the most wonderful blissful sensation of numbness sweep over me. There are no words to describe how wonderful this numbness felt. It didn't last long, about 10 minutes, but during those 10 minutes I could do anything without pain /stress / sadness / fatigue / fear / feeling down. It would be great and more productive to be able to feel like that during my work hours. Thank you so very much for any help!</p>

"Umbrella terms for field of vision unawareness blindness spectrum conditions?","<p>I would like to know what the name is for the medical condition, whose severity could be categorized by a vision dexterity test possibly related to overall body / hand to object reaction time after hearing a sound, whereby someone may have a low degree of awareness about objects in front of them / in their surroundings.

<p>For instance, while in a car or other situation, someone could tell you ""look at that (sign or object)"", and you would be so slow locating it that it would pass by without you noticing.</p>

"The relation of weight loss speed and loose skin","<p>For the past week I have been hunting for the answer to the following question:</p>

<p>Does the speed at which you lose weight have any relationship with loose skin? And the real question, why or why not?</p>

<p>I've reached out to every doctor friend I have, and requested they in turn reach out to dermatologists and plastic surgeons. I've sifted through a plethora of online resources, watched videos, used other question submission sites, and every time I either get a ""Yes speed matters"" or ""No, speed doesn't matter"", but <strong>nobody</strong> has even bothered to so much as guess why their stance is right while the opposite is wrong. </p>

<p>I have yet to find a single piece of non-anecdotal evidence for yes or no. If losing weight slowly allows ones epidermis to adjust to the weight loss than why would that function cease if the weight loss was quick? </p>

<p>If the epidermis can ""shrink"" then, to me, it stands to reason the only variable is time. But the reality that we have invasive, expensive surgical procedures to remove loose skin flies in the face of this. </p>

There are few clinical papers on the use of nutraceuticals in tendon disorders, and their methodological quality is poor. Furthermore, in most of the studies more than one supplement was administered at the same time. This may bias the results, and the effect of each single component cannot be determined.

"Does marijuana inhibit cognitive functioning?","<p>There's a lot of conflicting information regarding this question and people have different agendas. I'm not a doctor, but from what I've read marijuana has been shown to inhibit healthy brain development in adolescents and lead to lower IQ scores.

<p>However, my question relates to adults that use it responsibly. If one is over 25 (brain stops developing), active, and only uses marijuana occasionally without smoking is it unhealthy? Does it cause cognitive decline in that population? I think smoking all day, every day is a horrible way to live. Those people have long forgotten what it means to ""feel their emotions.""

<p>Namely, I was told that before antibiotics were discovered, people with tuberculosis were being treated with… obesity. I don't remember the exact explanation, but from what I recall fatty lungs were supposed to be better able to resist tuberculosis bacteria. IIRC it was fatty tissue that was supposed to be helpful here.</p>

<p>IIRC people with active TB were first being fattened quite severely, to combat the disease, then they could loose some of the most excess weight but still had to remain obese in order to prevent relapse.</p>

"how does the immune system identify allergens? application: varenicline and lobeline","<p>I'm wondering if we know how the immune system identifies allergens. My biochemistry knowledge is basic so I apologize if I use concepts incorrectly! Specifically, I want to know about the likelihood of having an allergic reaction to something, given an allergy to something else... </p>

<p>I'll clarify the situation with the following example: </p>

<p>Say a person develops an allergy to some molecule, A. Another molecule, B, has a different skeletal structure. A and B are both thought to have a similar mechanisms for the treatment of some medical problem. If a person is allergic to A, are they more likely to be allergic to B?</p>

<p>To make this even more concrete, let's say a person is allergic to varenicline, a synthetic molecule used to treat nicotine addiction. Is that person more likely to be allergic to Lobeline (indian tobacco)? They have different skeletal formulas, but varenicline is an agonist on nicotine acetlycholine receptors, while lobeline is a mixed agonist-antagonist on these receptors. (Maybe this is not relevant?). </p>

<p>Does the fact that both molecules have similar neurochemical mechanisms of action on dopamine receptors, have any implications as to whether the immune system would identify the new molecule as an allergen? What about an allergen, physical or chemical, is it that the immune system is actually ID'ing or remembering?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I have an allergy to varenicline, and considered taking lobeline until i read they have similar neurochemical mechanisms. I'm not looking for advice, because I am not going to take lobeline. I'm just curious. Thanks in advance for any insight!</p>

"Why do some medications have HCl?","<p>I have seen a lot of medications including a few that I take for certain situations. 1 of the medications that I occasionally take is Benadryl. The main component of this is Diphenhydramine HCl. I have always wondered why this and some other medications have HCl mixed with the main ingredient. I mean, HCl can dissolve pretty much anything given the time and is why people with Achlorhydria(total absence of HCl in their stomach) have iron deficiency anemia. HCl makes iron better absorbed.</p>

<p>But why do some medications have HCl in them if the HCl could potentially dissolve all the medication and make it useless(chemical burn to get medication useless)? Is it to increase the amount that is absorbed just like it does with iron? </p>

"Why does prosopagnosia (face blindness) only affect recognition of faces?","<p>I read a short story involving <a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Prosopagnosia-Information-Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prosopagnosia</a> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosopagnosia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>), which harms or fully removes a person's ability to remember and recognize faces, and I've since been doing reading to better understand the condition. The precise causes, as I understand it, are not well-known, although it is believed to be related to damage in the right fusiform gyrus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prosopagnosia is thought to be the result of abnormalities, damage, or impairment in the right fusiform gyrus, a fold in the brain that appears to coordinate the neural systems that control facial perception and memory.</p>
  
  <p><sup><a href=""https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Prosopagnosia-Information-Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NIH</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I'm aware, the fusiform gyrus has functions beyond facial recognition and analysis - although my knowledge of how facial recognition in the brain works is limited. Therefore, my naïve logic is that damage to the region should also damage other (related) mental abilities, yet I can't find much information about other disabilities prosopagnosiacs may face, if any.</p>

<p>If prosopagnosia does arise from damage to the fusiform gynus, why are the effects merely limited to facial perception? If the effects are not this limited, are there any minor disabilities associated with the condition?</p>

"Mechanisms that causes prominent veins during physical exercise","<p>I have just read this article about why veins become prominent while exercising: <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-veins-pop-out-when/"" rel=""nofollow"">Why do veins pop out when exercising, and is that good or bad?</a> </p>

<p>I have some questions about this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The article mentions that the veins are pressed out to the skin by muscle contraction.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This makes sense. But how does one explain that athletes have often more bulging veins even when not exercising? Is this only due lower body fat percentages? Or is there also another mechanism acting?</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the forehead or temple area. One sometimes notices also bulging veins while exercising. I don't see how this can be explained by muscle contraction since the muscles in the forehead and temple area are small and usually not (actively) contracted while exercising. So what is the relevant mechanism in this case? May it be indirectly caused by muscle contractions in the trapezius? But if so, how does it exactly work?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The article also mentions that the diastolic blood pressure raises while lifting weights. So contrary to the statement of the article that bulging veins are not due to higher blood pressure while exercising this effect is not ruled out in weightlifing since there the pressure is indeed raised. So how significant is this raise in blood pressure while lifting weights in explaining prominent veins (in comparison to the muscle contraction thesis)? This effect my be depend on the breathing technique (for example using valsalva maneauver or not).</p></li>

I learned about biological half-life of medicines so I could predict how long it will take for drug to stop being active.</p>

<p>But then I read that my antihistamine drug is an irreversible antagonist.<br>
I’ve checked the definition, and if I understand it, this means that the receptors are permanently blocked through some reaction with this antagonist.</p>

<p>The question is:<br>
Does it mean that this cell which receptors are blocked is defective forever?<br>
And side effects will never go away because, in this case, cell needs histamine to work properly?<br>
Or we must wait for the cell to die and be replaced by new cell?</p>

"Are these studies about red algae reducing cold virus by 92% believable?","<p>I was using this spray meant to hasten recovery from the common cold. A study [1], sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that produces the spray, stated it reduced virus by 92% (this value only appear on the promotional material), and so shortens the duration of the common cold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a doctor told me that these kinds of things don't work.</p>

<p>I found some ""similar"" studies [2,3, 4, 5 ,6] but I lack the competence to assert their value.</p>

<p>Does someone have some perspective on this? Are these believable studies? Was it well designed, and has it been duplicated?</p>

"Need to exhale while holding breath","<p>Recently I tried holding my breath for as long as I could. I managed to hold it for almost 2 minutes, but after a bit more than 1 minute, I already felt a strong need to exhale some of the air. At the same time, I did not feel like I had to inhale again though. I ended up with two possible explanations:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> At the beginning, I took a deep breath of air which was about 20 °C in temperature. After this one minute in my lungs, the air warmed up (I assumed it warmed up to 35 °C). For the sake of simplicity, I calculated with the ideal gas law</p>

<p><strong><em>pV = nRT</em></strong></p>

<p>that the pressure in the lung would increase by about 5%. Ok, this is why I had to release some air. But wait...</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> From what I learned about physiology, I know that our body has certain chemoreceptors to determine the oxygen saturation in our blood. And there are such chemoreceptors for carbon dioxide as well. The concentration of CO2 in my blood reached a certain threshold and I experienced this strong need to exhale.</p>

"Why is the cost of health care so high?","<p>Can someone explain in simple but very concrete terms why medical services cost so much in the US?</p>

<p>By cost, I am referring here to the medical fees being charged prior to any adjustments or reimbursements by the insurance.</p>

<p>I understand it takes many years of hard work to become a doctor and they deserve to be remunerated for that hard work. I really do.</p>

<p>I do get that medical students come out of school with massive debts as well.</p>

<p>I do understand there are significant costs in operating medical facilities, purchasing high-end medical equipment, running a medical staff, and being insured against law suits perhaps.</p>

<p>With a stretch of my imagination, I may see how all this adds up so that a visit to the doctor is charged for $100-$200 even though the actual interaction with the doctor + nurse is usually on the order of 10 minutes per patient.  10 minutes for a few hundred $ = one hour for a couple of thousands $ to cover the salary of the medical staff, the rent, and amortizing the cost of medical equipment. That seems very high to my intuition but I can at least make some sense of it.</p>

<p>But then on top of the visit cost, there are often ""extra"" costs that seem completely disproportionate with what is being done.</p>

<p>From random personal experience:<br>
- a hospital charging ~$20 for one pill of ibuprofen<br>
- a dermatologist charging an extra ~$150 for ~10 second procedures such as spraying nitrogen on a foot wart<br>
- a few hundred bucks for spending less than a minute taking a skin sample for a biopsy (charge for the biopsy itself separate)<br>
- a visit to the ER for a very minor injury resulting in one stitch point on a finger and a medical bill >$1,500  </p>

<p>What is the reasoning behind these charges?</p>

<p>Could someone perhaps break down in simple concrete numbers the operating expenses of, say, a medical office, and a hospital and help me understand how this explains why an ibuprofen pill costs $20 in a hospital or why spraying nitrogen for 5 seconds costs ~$150 extra?</p>

<p>I also found some sites that mentioned that higher cholestrol resulted from people who were more stressed, but I believe there might be a confounding factor whereby people eat more unhealthy foods to compensate for stress.</p>

<p>Is it possible that reducing cholestrol would lead to a direct, causational decrease in cortisol production? I wonder, is there a precise biological mechanism whereby we can reduce stress by reducing cholestrol intake?</p>

"What happens to the heart during cardiac arrest?","<p>I am confused about whether the heart stops beating during cardiac arrest or not. The answer in <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/15130/what-really-happens-to-the-heart-during-cardiac-arrest-and-why-is-an-aed-useful"">this</a> question states, ""the heart does not pump blood sufficiently to sustain life."" Isn't that the definition of heart failure?
<a href=""https://gizmodo.com/why-shocking-a-flat-lined-heart-cant-get-it-going-ag-1376053985"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This</a> article states that a flat-lined heart can not be revived. However, in the case of cardiac arrest, the patient's heart can be revived. If this article is correct, then the heart does not stop beating aka flat lines when it is in cardiac arrest. However, in <a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/sudden-cardiac-arrest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article,  it is clearly stated that the heart stops beating during an ongoing cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>So, which is correct? Does the heart stop beating during a cardiac arrest, or no? If it does stop beating, how is that not the definition of death? Does a person have any consciousness in this time? Do they have an neurons firing in the brain? Since the brain doesn't die a few minutes after death, is the person able to hear, feel pain, think or feel any stimulus while they are in cardiac arrest? </p>

"The next generation of contact lenses","<p>My eyes have the problem of keratoconus and the last 10 years I live using rigid gas contact lenses. The last years piggy-backs. But I am not so satisfied with the precision and accuracy. To be more specific, I am not feeling that in our times this field is up to date. It is still in Machine Age. Nothing in harmony with the Information Age.</p>

<p>So I am wondering, I am kind of crazy to miss a contact lens with cpu and ram or something like that, being able to see other galaxies? On the other hand, these rigid gas ones are relatively cheap (100 - 200 Euro), and you can use them for 1-2 years but I can afford even 5000 euros every 6 months to have something better. But capitalism does not give me this opportunity. Hard and Scleral ones are on the same level, nothing completely serious.</p>

<p>My questions: Does this field really have problem of not being up to date? Why it happens? Or I have not understood something well? It is expected a new generation of contact lenses soon, and how it will be?</p>

<p>Thank you all for your answers.</p>

<p>Omega 9, again <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-9_fatty_acid"" rel=""nofollow"">according to Wikipedia</a>, seems to be non-essential (i.e. can be synthesized by the body), and it also seems to be present in commonly-used oils, so supplementation seems a bit pointless.</p>

<p>Upon altering the dose of lamotrigine from 400 mg to 375 mg, and then back up to 400 mg (split into two doses), I experienced violent myclonic jerks soon after administration of the medication, and noticed a numbness in my right palm, and a tremor I didn't previously have in my left. I also recall consuming alcohol and taking Valium that night.</p>

<p>Shaken by the experience, I begun to taper off the lamotrigine under my doctor's guidance. </p>

<p>Over the following few days, the numbness that I initially noticed in my right palm spread throughout the right side of my body. Although originally localized to my right side, this numbness soon presented on my left palm, and spread until  my capacity to perceive pressure, temperature, pain etc. was noticeably reduced throughout my whole body (including head).  </p>

<p>I also experienced frequent muscle twitches throughout the day, and continued to experience myclonic jerks following the administration of the night dose of the lamotrigine.</p>

<p>Now, having tapered off the lamotrigine, my body continues to loose sensation. I experience occasional muscle twitches, and have a tremor in my left hand that I did not previously.

"How do I confirm death and the need for CPR?","<p>How can I confirm that someone is dead <strong>with 100% certainty?</strong> 
I have read many articles about this issue but all of them have only what I consider superficial information. All of them focus about some essential points to confirm death:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To listen for lung sounds for 1 min.</p></li>
<li><p>To listen for heart sounds for 1 min.</p></li>
<li><p>To check the carotid pulse.</p></li>
<li><p>To assess the pupil reaction to light.</p></li>
<li><p>To assess the response to a painful stimuli.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My argument is that for points 1 and 2 above, the person might be simply obese or having a pneumothorax/pleural effusion or pericardial effusion for example and thus the heart/lung sounds can be very low and difficult to hear. For point 3, the person might have simply a hypotension, and even the carotid artery pulse can't be palpated. For point 4, the person might have an old CVA or blind for other reasons and the pupil reaction to light is absent. For point 5, if the person is in a coma, he might not respond to a painful stimuli. Other signs of death like cold extremities can't be relied on.</p>

<p>The other related question is when to start CPR. Of course in a hospital if the person has a cardiac arrest (recognized as absent pulse + unresponsive + difficult/absent breathing), we start CPR right away, but in the ED department or in a clinic (where we might not have an ECG machine), how can I tell whether the person is dead and there is no need for CPR or he/she is not and I should start CPR?</p>

"Did Gary Taubes prove that cholesterol levels between 200 mg/dl and 240 mg/dl are normal and healthy?","<p>I am now holding the original, Polish edition book called ""The Hidden Therapies - What your doctor won't tell you"" authored by Jerzy Zięba, who is widely considered to be a quack by medical authorities in my country. Nevertheless, the sheer amount of facts (or ""facts""?) and research papers cited by Mr. Zięba warrants some closer skeptical attention. </p>

<p>Among many other claims Mr. Zięba says that cholesterol levels between 200 mg/dl and 240 mg/dl are healthy. In particular, he cites Gary Taubes, who in an article titled “The soft science of dietary fat”, published in March 2001 in Science, supposedly proved that:</p>

<ul>
<li>No increased risk of mortality in women nor men was associated with cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dl to 240 mg/dl;</li>
<li>Cholesterol level of 240 mg/dl was associated with a reduced risk of mortality among women from heart diseases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Did Gary Taubes publish an article claiming these things?</p>

<p>Does this article indeed prove what Mr. Zięba claims it to prove?</p>

<p>The aforementioned claims come from: Ukryte Terapie - Czego lekarz ci nie powie by Jerzy Zięba, vol. 2, pages 107-112.</p>

"Machine learning for medical image scanning","<p>I'm searching for a topic of interest in the domain of machine learning and computer vision. More specifically, researching can computer vision be applied to classify medical image scans and/or predict the future state of a scan. I'm not a health care professional so in order to frame the problem into something that is attainable I'm aiming to research the topic of image scanning some more.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is : </p>

<p>What is the current state of the art of image scanning technology ?</p>

<p>What are it's weaknesses ?</p>

<p>I have many unknown unknowns and I'm unsure where to start to attain a basic knowledge.</p>

<p>Book recommendations are welcome, for example this book seems like a good place to start : 
For example the book ""Medical Imaging for the Health Care Provider: Practical Radiograph Interpretation "" : <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B01HUNOJPG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Imaging-Health-Care-Provider-ebook/dp/B01HUNOJPG</a></p>

<p>The dataset I'm intending to use for this research is 'DeepLesion'

<p>Update : this seems like a good place to start : <a href=""https://medicalsciences.stackexchange.com/questions/3709/medical-imaging-image-quality?rq=1"">Medical imaging - image quality?</a></p>

<p>Update 2:</p>

<p>I'm aiming to utilize image and annotated data from DeepLesion to develop an AI to diagnose future and/or present state of a scan. 'future state of a scan' refers to predicting the future state of scan attributes . The attributes are what is contained in the DeepLesion annoted dataset which includes lesion diameter, patient gender and patient age. So I will attempt to predict 1 or a combination of these attributes. </p>

<p>At this stage I'm not aiming for the AI model to perform a diagnosisis or prognosis but provide a prediction of attributes that aids the healthcare practitioner in performing the diagnosis or prognosis. Due to DeepLesion containing CT image scans the healthcare practitioner in this case is a radiographer. </p>

<p>Other type of more high level predictions/classifications I may consider are detecting liver, lung, kidney lesions.</p>

<p>The type of predictions are dependant on the type of data available. </p>

<p>Another research question I have is what type of predictions are of most value to the practitioner. This will help focus my research.</p>

"Can side effects on test drug be not fully disclosed and still ethical?","<p>Say a doctor invites a patient to test a new drug, because there is currently no effective drug to cure the illness. The patient says ""I trust that what you are doing is best for my benefit. I'll take it."" </p>

<p>But to avoid placebo/psychological effect, are they allowed to not fully disclose all side effects that the drug has, even when they know it? For example, they know ahead that the drug will make the patient nausea and body burning, but they just say that it will make them mildly dizzy. Is that ethical? The patient should have been informed all these effects before accepting the experiment – failing to do that breaks the trust they put on the doctor. But if telling their expectations to the side effects can distort the actual results.</p>

"The effects of heating and lighting using open flames on brain health?","<p>There are many sources that indicate that people are healthier and live longer than people 100 years ago. I have also seen studies that show IQs are higher by something like a standard deviation than those of our recent ancestors. </p>

<p>The latter is called the Flynn Effect and I think a major cause is supposed to be improved nutrition which sounds plausible to me. Air pollution being significantly less (elimination of leaded gasoline) has also been mentioned. But what I wonder is, how reasonable is it to attribute the differences to the prevalence of fireplaces and gas flames being used by people prior to modern heating and lighting? Is it possible that literally millions of people had chronic, low-level carbon monoxide poisoning, not to mention the effects of particulate matter that they were inhaling?</p>

I stand 300 cm away, the room is dark, and I cover one eye), I actually
see an ""8"" formed from double-vision where the lower ring is dimmer.  So,
I'd simply say that this lower ring is caused by a cataract.</p>

<p>To be honest, the ""cataract ring"" is not just lower, but also slightly right;
the off-vertical angle is roughly 20 degrees.  It's interesting that my other
eye also has similar downward double-vision (with a smaller 10 degree
rightward shift).  (I get even more cataract glare details when I focus on the
small dot to the left, instead of the ring, but I'm trying to keep this question

"Can a healthy baby / new born be carried longer when the weather is hot if carried skin to skin against its father's chest?","<p><em>First of all I'm not a medical specialist at all, but still I hope my question is precise enough to be answered.</em> </p>

<p>One day I asked a General Practitioner if a father could go outside with his baby / new born while the weather was hot (let's say around 30-35°C), carrying it skin to skin against the father's chest in a carrying scarf. The GP's answer was ""obviously the father shouldn't"". Unfortunately the GP could not explain me why the father should not.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer : This question intent is only theoretical, I don't plan nor recommend to go outside with a new born when it's hot, since I know it could be dangerous for the baby.</strong></p>

<p>So I wanted to know if in a carrying scarf (skin to skin against the father's chest) the adult's body could help the baby's one to regulate its temperature, throwing away the exceeding heating from the baby. Or put another way can the adult's body act as a heat exchanger to keep the baby's internal temperature around the adult's body temperature (~ 37°C) ? Or would it be worse and would the baby's internal temperature increases up to risky values ?</p>

<p>However, I've noticed that every single person I have ever spoken to who had dental work done has never heard of this procedure. It strikes me as odd because the procedure was quick, simple, and apparently with excellent outcome.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The lack of awareness of this procedure leads me to believe that it is not that common. If this is true, why is it so? Are there risks? Is the success rate not high?</li>
<li>The procedure seemed to entirely negate the need for a retainer, for me at least. Is this typical? If so, why would retainers ever be recommended over a fiberotomy? Are there only certain cases where the procedure is effective?</li>
<li>Is there any reason, related to the questions above, why the procedure wasn't done on my bottom teeth?</li>
</ul>

<p>Or is there perhaps some more modern alternative to both fiberotomies and retainers that has appeared in the last 20 years?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is Sleeping Without a Pillow a Good Choice? Yes, it is. Not only will sleeping with no pillow save your money, but it will also lead to less neck, back, and shoulder pain, higher quality sleep, and even fewer wrinkles! When you were a child, you could fall asleep anywhere without a pillow. The body is resilient and adaptable when we're young. Even as we age, our body, including heads and necks, is able to rest comfortably without the support of a pillow.</p>

  <p>While sleeping with or without a pillow is a personal preference, there are some medical experts that believe there are real benefits of sleeping without a pillow.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Spinal benefits: Some argue that sleeping without a pillow is the healthiest method of sleeping as it greatly benefits the spine.  Sleeping on your back without a pillow allows the spine to rest fully with the natural curves of the body.  When you sleep with a thick pillow it can displace the spine.</li>
  <li>Facial benefits: Others argue that sleeping without pillows can help reduce wrinkles and other often considered unappealing facial features.  This can be attributed to the fact that the face is not being squished against a pillow.</li>
  <li>Sleep benefits:  Some argue that pillows interfere with quality sleep, especially when people use the wrong pillow.  Sleeping without a pillow helps ensure quality sleep because the body is allowed to be at a normal level and not elevated like with a pillow.</li>
  <li>Neck benefits: The people that believe sleeping without a pillow is best for you, argue that sleeping with a pillow can be the main source of shoulder and neck pain.  It is still good to do stretches and use heat packs, but they say that the best way to alleviate neck pain is to sleep without a pillow.</li>

One section mentioned three experiments performed by Dr Paul Kenny in which rats were given their ordinary rat food plus and unlimited supply of:</p>

<p>Experiment A. Unlimited sugar</p>

<p>Experiment B. Unlimited fat</p>

<p>Experiment C. Unlimited sugar and fat mixed together (50:50)</p>

<p>The stated results were that in experiment A the rats did not put on any weight, in experiment B the rats put on weight but not much and in experiment C they put on loads of weight and would eat the 50:50 mixture to the exclusion of their ordinary food. I also remember the documentary said the 50:50 ratio was critical and if the ratio was shifted too far in either direction then the weight gain effect reduced sharply. It was postulated that the reason for the satiety error was that sugar and fat don't often occur together in nature so the rats (and maybe people too) haven't evolved the biochemical feedback mechanisms for determining when they are satiated from such a mixture.</p>

<p>Edit: (Dr Kenny's work seems to be related to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2326345"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this earlier paper</a>)</p>

"Sex as a generic medical treatment modality?","<p>Sex therapy (including <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_surrogate"">clinical, licensed sex itself</a>) is a treatment option for <em>sexual health</em> issues - when there are problems and goals pertaining to sex itself.</p>

<p>Sexual health tends to be studied from the angle of being on the 'receiving' end of health, merely being 'improved' as a benefit of good health, or hampered as a result of bad health.</p>

<p>But I wonder whether there have been examples of, any research on, or plausible basis for, sex (whether just orgasm as the common denominator, specific sexual techniques similar to Tantra, and whether solo or with a partner) being a 'medical treatment' mechanism for anything <em>non</em>-sexual in nature also.</p>

<p>In other words, considering the opposite - sex helping to not only improve health itself - but actually be a legitimate and studied <em>field</em> of (alternative) medical treatment for a whole range of scenarios whose goals have nothing to do with sex.</p>

<p>I have no collated research to offer up-front in the question, but only one particular angle of inquiry of my own, which is that sexual activity is part of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system"">parasympathetic nervous system</a> and that, given the involuntary and powerful nature of sexual function, perhaps it might assist in nervous system balance/repair/damage/even issues with PTSD/fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system issues (e.g. maybe it is the strongest way to activate and train the parasympathetic system where a patient has issues relating to it), if studied.</p>

<p>There are many studies that show sex (and especially intimate sexual activity with a partner) has many direct health benefits, proven mechanisms to relieve mental stress and certainly regulate hormones of the endocrine system which then has further beneficial domino effects itself.</p>

<p>But is there basis to suspect it could do more? (Similar to well-understood exercise and body movement therapies having massive positive and thus often healing effects on the body?) Has this been studied at all?</p>

<p>Obviously in our current society the principal reason for a lack of such study would be the cultural and 'moral' taboos associated with this idea - sex always being an end, but hardly ever a means.</p>

"Can the body be shocked into a faster metabolism?","<p>It seems to be a relatively well-known fact that sudden extended periods of caloric restriction <a href=""http://www.everydayhealth.com/weight/fewer-calories-stalls-metabolism.aspx"">will cause a severe drop in metabolism</a>. But I can't seem to find much research about the reverse process. So the question is, does it work the other way too?</p>

<p>The basic scenario I'm asking about is if one were to go from a lifestyle of plenty of exercise, and a high-calorie diet to compensate (if you need more detail, say the diet consists of plenty of proteins, decent fats, relatively-low carbs, so quite healthy) to a lifestyle of no exercise, half the calories, much more carbs, much less protein. Current evidence seems to indicate this would cause a significant drop in metabolism.</p>

<p>So what about the inverse scenario? Say after six months, our subject adds back the exercise, and doubles calorie consumption by switching back to a diet of plenty of proteins, decent fats, and relatively-low carbs. Say this change takes place over a single week, and remains afterward.</p>

<p><strong>Would this sudden change result in a rapid increase in metabolism, similar in magnitude to the rapid decrease caused by the inverse, and would it last? Is the body more conservative with increases in metabolism than with decreases? What would be the effects on the body?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I realize ""metabolism"" is non-technical shorthand for the convergence of thousands of chemical processes used by the body to essentially process energy, and that the changes above would result in complex chains of changes that can't be exactly predicted.

"What factors affect exercise induced nausea?","<p>I know a few people who would vomit after or during training (various running exercises). My trainer said it was due to the lactate level in the blood, though I can't find a source to corroborate this.</p>

<p>According to the reference from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise-induced_nausea"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia's entry on exercise-induced nausea</a> the duration of exercise and intensity (aerobic vs anaerobic) and prior food or drink consumption are the main factors contributing to this effect. I gather it is not a very common phenomenon. It seems like a basic reflex to get rid of food so the muscles and/or brain can get more blood.</p>

<p>So is a high lactate level and a non-empty stomach all there is to this? If so I think it would be more common. I'm guessing there is a psychological element too? Can anyone explain the triggers/causes better?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario: a group of 30 people of a similar age perform intensive exercise. 2 people feel really nauseous afterwards. Assuming that hydration is not a cause, what mechanism(s) explain(s) why these people feel sicker?</p>

<p>I think assuming that only pH is a factor is flawed. The wikipedia article I mentioned <em>explicitly</em> states that food intake affects nausea. I can also corroborate this with experiences of many of the people (friends/family) I asked.
The article also states that nausea is a consequence of bloodflow to the stomach/gut being restricted (implying the pH recepter does not directly induce nausea). So I'm guessing this flow restriction follows from the pH mechanism in the brain? </p>

<p>By piecing together this info I then get this order of events:<br>
 1 - Exercise reduces pH<br>
 2 - Brain pH receptor reduces blood flow to stomach<br>
 3 - Stomach receptors trigger nausea when blood flow is low (stronger signal if stomach is fuller)<br>
 This theory seems to cover both claims of pH (in the answer below) and food intake (in the wiki article). But it is just conjecture on my part.
 I could imagine a 4th step where a person has less nausea if they produce more endorfins during exercise, or more when they have a psycological tendency to throw up whenever nauseous.
 Or maybe I'm wrong about pH affecting blood flow to the stomach.</p>

<p>So, barring hydration-related causes, is it just blood pH and stomach contents that determine the nausea felt after some forms of exercise?<br>
And if pH is a factor (as stated by an answer), how much does sensitivity depend on 1)their fitness/condition to counter the pH decrease and 2) 
their physical response to a low pH--e.g. maybe a genetic factor makes some people more sensitive?</p>

"Do vitamins affect sense of taste?","<p>I like oranges. I <em>really</em> like oranges. But I go through cycles of eating them. When I start, they are <em>really</em> sweet. By my fifth of the day they have turned quite bitter.</p>

<p>Sensing a pattern I have performed an experiment.</p>

<p>The theory is that the more vitamin C I eat, the less I want foods that contain vitamin C. So, I stopped eating oranges for a month. I had one orange and it was really sweet - which validates the inverse of my theory (the less vitamin C I eat the more I want foods that contain it).</p>

<p>I then started taking vitamin C tablets for a week and had an orange, and it was bitter. To make sure it wasn't just a bitter orange I asked a friend to share it with me (without explaining why I wanted to share the orange with him). He said it was very sweet and enjoyed it loads.</p>

<p>I have been unable to locate studies or anecdotes regarding this sort of thing.</p>

<p>So, my question:</p>

<p>Do our bodies alter our taste buds based on what we eat in order to maintain a stable balance of nutrients, vitamins, etc? (by encouraging/discouraging us to eat food x because we need/don't need the nutrients/vitamins/etc)?</p>

<p>I have previously noticed a similar alteration in sense of taste for spinach for a little while. I assume I needed the iron? </p>

<p>From an evolutionary point of view this makes sense - as a way of encouraging us to eat what we need to stay healthy.</p>

"Is it possible to maintain my health during irregular sleeping patterns?","<p>I'm 23 years old lanky guy, and my health is below average. I believe it's also wise to mention that I currently have Tuberculosis in my lymph nodes around the neck area, for which I'm taking my medications. My past health issues were typhoid and recently pneumonia (February 2014).  </p>

<p>With that being said, I'm currently working two jobs out of necessity. First starting from 1pm till 10pm, and another starting from 11pm till 5am. So my routine is work from 1pm till 5am, and reach home by 6am and sleep till 12 noon, get ready and the cycle continues. This happens 5 days a week, and I get a full two days of rest.  </p>

<p>Now I've recently thought about taking a leave on my night job (11pm - 5am) every Wednesday, such that I'll get to have a good rest in the interval of 2 days (I hope you understand the pattern). By first thoughts, this feels like a good enough decision.  </p>

<p>But my concern is that I may worsen my health even more. I think I read somewhere that random changes on one's routine can confuse the body which will lead to serious health issues, and since this new routine is pretty random, I fear that I may fall sick all of a sudden, something that I cannot afford financially and health-wise too.  </p>

<p>So should I go ahead and follow this new routine? I know there aren't many options that I can choose from, but is there better routine that could follow?</p>

"Do infected family members need to be treated with antibiotics at the same time?","<p>When antibiotics become necessary I assume that the body can not kill the bacteria on its own and there are no useful anti bodies being built.</p>

<p>So in a case where the child is treated with antibiotics and the parents are sick too, isn't it necessary to treat the parents with antibiotics exactly at the same time?</p>

<p>Since the body can't cope with the illness without help, it won't develop immunity and could get infected by the same thing at any time after treatment.</p>

<p>So if only the child is treated, but not the parents chances are the parents are going to infect the child again after antibiotics treatment.</p>

"Which essential nutrient is the first that will cause debilitating illness if supply is insufficient","<p>While reading about the US requirements for food labeling <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/ucm274593.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(How to Understand and Use the Nutrition Facts Label</a>) about essential nutrients it became obvious that that label is far from complete.</p>

<p>Currently it is just required to list a small subset of vitamins, minerals etc., for example: Water, Energy, Protein, Fat, Cholesterol, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Sugars, Minerals, Calcium, Iron, Vitamin C, Vitamin A… </p>

<p>This is clearly a very rough, an incomplete list and compiled for almost entirely different reasons, I can only guess at. One guess would be trying to help to prevent, in the name of public health, those types of malnutrition that are most commonly seen over all in Americans, not those that would have the fastest onset.</p>

<p>Asking the world's favourite search engine for example ""first micro-nutrient to cause deficiency"" yields mainly  results applicable for plant growth, where people seem to have pondered this question more frequently in the past compared to human nutrition. Similiar search terms were equally unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>So I keep wondering, phrased  in a very naive way on purpose: what is the most ""important"" essential (the most limiting nutritional factor?) nutrient to be consumed regularly enough to avoid any type of deficiency (serious <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">malnutrition</a>)?</p>

<p>Obviously the essential micro-nutrients  are all important at least in the mid- and long term, hence their name. But which are really needed most frequently almost or really daily?</p>

<p>One isolated example is vitamin C and scurvy caused by a serious lack of vitamin C in a diet. Wikipedia for example claims that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Typically, scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet. <em>It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C before symptoms occur.</em></a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems quite a long time for relative malnutrition that will not cause concrete and visible or clinically relevant symptoms. But I seem to be unable to find such a list and I am even hampered in compiling a list of essential nutrients and the possible problems when 'time until the symptoms of malnutrition/deficiency  develop' is a central criterion to be involved. </p>

<p>For B12 it seems to take a very long time until symptoms develop, for fat-soluble vitamins it is similarly prolonged interval but my guess is that water soluble vitamins and some minerals would be less suitable to skip on while remaining healthy.</p>

<p>As evidenced by our human past, general energy deficiency causing starvation is not really part of this inquiry, since it presents a larger problem in itself. So it is not about water, energy, fats, protein or carbohydrates.</p>

<p>That situation in question would entail: all micro-nutrients (and macro) kept at recommended levels or above, only one single of the essential micro-nutrients deprived. Which micro-nutrient deprivation causes the first signs of malnutrition the fastest. This would be applicable for an otherwise and previously healthy and well fed adult, not necessarily for children.</p>

"How long do you have to take an SSRI for before PSSD becomes a risk?","<p>PSSD or Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction really worries me. This is when you carry on experiencing the sexual side effects of an SSRI for years after stopping taking the medication.</p>

<p>If you take a single pill and then stop, you may feel a few side effects including sexual dysfunction, but I find it very unlikely that you will carry on experiencing this side effect for years to come, from one pill. I think the same applies if you take an SSRI daily for 3 weeks. You will likely experience the side effects for the 3 weeks, and then maybe for a couple of weeks afterwards, but I do not think that 3 weeks of medication is significant enough to leave you with sexual side effects for years or forever. The brain is very plastic and can heal remarkably well.</p>

<p>But then you here stories about people who have taken SSRI's for months and then stopped, but then carried on experiencing sexual dysfunction for years or permanently.</p>

"Should a chiropractor be called if my neck is (moderately) out of alignment?","<h1>Let's not beat around the bush:</h1>

<p>~3 days ago, I was jumping on a trampoline. Being that I was jumping on a very good trampoline with a gymnast and a cousin or two of hers, I started endeavoring to do flips.</p>

<p>After trying to successfully land a front flip 1-2 dozen times (I only succeeded once -- Hey, it was raining. :D), I decided to try to do a <em>back flip</em>.</p>

<p>That, dear reader, is the crux of the problem. Inspired by my (almost) successes in the past, I jumped up, flipped 180 degrees, and landed on my head.</p>

<p>Naturally it didn't feel too good, so I climbed out of the trampoline and took a break. I didn't really figure it would turn out all that bad. I kept turning it from side to side to keep it loosened up, but the next day it was worse than it was when I first landed on it.</p>

<p>The day after my accident, you could feel where a vertebrate in my neck was out of alignment. Over the past couple of days, I've been treating my neck gingerly. (Partly due to that, perhaps, my shoulders are feeling sore as well.)</p>

<hr>

<h1>So:</h1>

<p>What's the correct thing to do in this circumstance (or a situation like it)? The way I see it, I have at least 3 choices.</p>

<p>First of all, I could <strong>ignore it.</strong> Arguments in favor of ignoring it would probably follow the lines of:</p>

<ul>
<li>People hurt their necks all the time. Don't get so worked up over it.</li>
<li>If you were a real man, you wouldn't let a <em>little bit of pain</em> bother you. Just <strong>deal</strong> with it, dude!</li>
<li>You're not crippled, <em>yet,</em> are you? (Said sarcastically.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Arguments opposed to ignoring it would probably sound something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>You only have one neck, Bro, take care of it!</li>
<li>It certainly won't hurt to have someone take a look at it. As Benjamin Franklin said, ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""<br>
<sub>A true disciple of wisdom would point out that to truly prevent an accident, I should've stayed off the trampoline!</sub></li>
<li>Since your neck hurts when you're checking <em>your blindspot while driving,</em> it's probably a good idea for you to get your neck checked out for <del>your</del> <em>my</em> safety.</li>
</ul>

<p>My second choice is <strong>to have a friend fix(?) it for me</strong>. I don't really favor this idea for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I only have one neck. I might as well take care of it.<br>
<sub>(You might remember this point from the points <em>against</em> ignoring the problem.)</sub></li>
<li>If one of my friends mis-adjusts my neck, I'll <strong>really</strong> have to go to a medical professional.</li>
<li>I don't trust my friends with my health ... :D</li>
</ul>

<p>My friends, of course, would point out the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>We</em> <strong>know</strong> what we're doing.</li>
<li><em>We'll</em> <strong>save</strong> you money, etc.<br>
<sub>Since I don't like parting with $$ (you don't either!), this point would have some weight if not for the second point against my friends adjusting my neck.</sub></li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, <strong>I could just go to a chiropractor</strong>. I was originally leaning very heavily to this option, but then I started reading about the risks of going to a chiropractor (especially with regards to neck manipulation!). The arguements for going to a chiropractor look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jeffrey, you should go to a trained professional. Better to get your neck adjusted now, than suffer the consequences later.</li>
<li>Your neck obviously isn't right. You should go to the chiropractor to get it adjusted properly.<br>
<sub>Won't it be great to be able to twist your head normally again?</sub></li>
<li>Your cousin went to the chiropractor when he injured his neck playing football. (His symptoms involved the fact that he was keeping his neck in a rigid position.) After three trips to the chiropractor, his neck recovered and he no longer has troubles with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The arguments against going to the chiropractor go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your father knows someone who was ruined for life by going to the chiropractor.</li>
<li>Your body will heal fine on its own.<br>
<sub>(See the points for ignoring it.)</sub></li>
<li>Adjustments to the neck are dangerous. (<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/stroke/news/20030512/neck-cracking-raises-stroke-risk"" rel=""nofollow"">Anyone eager to get a stroke?</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h1>And the question is ...</h1>

<p>In this case, what is the best course of action to take in regards to my neck? Should I ignore it, take a chance by letting a friend adjust it, or immediately go to a chiropractor? Should neck injuries, such as this, be taken seriously or should it be taken as a light matter? Can anyone shed some light on what they believe to be the best path to take? </p>

<hr>

<h1>Other:</h1>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I'm <em>not</em> using this site as the final health authority!</p>

<p><strong>PPS:</strong> I can get my neck within about 1-2 inches of my chest before it starts to hurt. I cannot comfortably twist my head around to either of my shoulders.</p>

"How to clean out all the earwax buildup in ears from hearing-aids if hearing-impaired? Q-tips are unsafe, right?","<p>I was born with congenital bone fusions in several places in my body, one of those places are in the set of three small bones (malleus, incus, and stapes) in both my ears. Because they are fused, they don't vibrate. I've had several ear surgeries, which have unfortunately only caused nerve-damage and scar-tissue so I'm hearing-impaired. Bottom-line: <strong>I've been wearing hearing-aids my entire life.</strong> </p>

<p>Growing up, I would always use a Q-tip to clean out the earwax buildup in my ears <strong>(hearing-aids are constantly in my ears so they don't allow my ears to ""breathe"" and trap in a lot of bacteria)</strong>. However, as research became more available as the years went by, audiologists and doctors alike have told me that Q-tips are not the best way to clean out your ears. In fact, they have the potential to cause further damage to your ears because you may just be jamming the earwax further down your ear canal, which can lead to infections/inflammations/loss of hearing, etc. </p>

<p>So the alternative method to cleaning out my ears with a Q-tip was to blow-dry them when I got out of the shower. I did this for a few years until the audiologists said that even though the blow-dryer doesn't sound too loud to me, I could be causing a lot of damage to my ear drums. </p>

<p>I don't recall what the alternative cleaning method has since been. <strong>How do I clean out my ears on a regular/daily basis?</strong> Yes, I am fully aware that a doctor can flush out the earwax, but I don't have the time nor the money to constantly be seeing the doctor since I have earwax everyday due to my hearing aids. I have a lot. </p>

"Safe and state-of-the art method of laser vision/eyesight correction/surgery?","<p>I have defective vision, particularly <strong>shortsightedness</strong>. Obviously, it is quite widespread phenomenon. I tried several times to get accustomed to contact lenses, but without success. It irritates my eyes. It is required to maintain cleanness of lens in order to prevent conjunctivitis or some other infectious eye disease. It is quite troublesome. I'm also not comfortable with wearing eyeglasses. </p>

<hr>

<p>If one considers the <strong>laser surgery/correction</strong> to recover sight, someone probably might be interested in the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is that true that laser correction/surgery for sight recovery can be performed only once in a lifetime. And if after surgery your vision has deteriorated back to poor condition then you won't be able to recover it again using laser correction procedures/technologies.  </li>
<li>What is the state-of-the-art and safest method of laser vision correction. I heard of such methods as LASEK, LASIK, RLE, LRI, PRELEX, etc. Which method is minimally invasive and can be considered state-of-the-art for the moment?</li>

"How to decide which painkiller to take?","<p>This is a dilemma I find myself in every time I'm in need of a painkiller: should I take paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen or aspirin?</p>

<p>I've come across several articles outlining the differences (most notably <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Pain/Pages/Whichpainkiller.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one by NHS</a> and <a href=""http://www.nps.org.au/topics/how-to-be-medicinewise/Medicinewise-questions/medicinewise-questions/treating-pain-and-fever-in-children"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one by NPS</a>) and, while a good overview, they don't really provide a clear mechanism to make the decision.</p>

<p>Specifically, my understanding so far is:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Aspirin and ibuprofen are NSAIDs and thus can be used to ease inflammation, unlike paracetamol</p></li>
<li><p>Ibuprofen and paracetamol are similarly effective in treating pain, while aspirin may be less so (however, <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3705"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other sources</a> claim paracetamol to be ineffective for some types of pain)</p></li>
<li><p>Aspirin should never be taken by those under the age of 16</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of adverse effects, ibuprofen may be a better option in comparison to paracetamol (according to <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4052/are-there-any-untoward-synergistic-effects-in-taking-a-combination-of-acetaminop"">this answer</a> at least)</p></li>

<p>In many cases, different sources provide different, very often contradictory information, especially in terms of effectiveness and side-effects.</p>

<p>To make this question less broad, here are a couple of specific questions (all of these assuming the person in question has no allergies or an existing condition which may limit his options in this sense):</p>

<li><p>When should you not take a NSAID? It seems the fact they ease inflammation doesn't seem to make them less effective in any way.</p></li>

<p>My friend and I were discussing and he thought that autopsies were performed on EVERYONE, unless the deceased's loved one's did not give permission, because the death certificate had to state the cause of death. But I think this is wrong; I know it's wrong. Because I know plenty of elderly people who have died in the hospital and did not undergo autopsies.

<p>Clothing Lice is a direct descendant of the head louse.

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Professor Peter Wheeler of Liverpool John Moore’s University says that the average human can lose heat at a rate in excess of 1 kilowatt, which is the amount of heat put out by a 1 bar electric fire.  If you have body hair, you can still lose heat by sweating, but the rate of heat loss will be reduced because the air flow across the body would be severely reduced which in turn would reduce the rate at which the sweat is going to evaporate.  Sweating into a fur coat would have been no use to our ancestors.

"Why does gas cause pain?","<p>If I have gas in my intestines, why does it hurt?  </p>

<p>The mayo clinic has a lot of words, that describe the how and why you get gas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anything that causes intestinal gas or is associated with constipation or diarrhea can lead to gas pains. These pains generally occur when gas builds up in your intestines, and you're not able to expel it. Most people pass gas at least 10 times a day. <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/basics/definition/con-20019271"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""></a></p>

<p>There are a few answers at <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/4505/methods-for-dealing-with-gas-pains"">Methods for dealing with gas pains?</a> talking about how to get rid of gas.</p>

<p>But why do some, health people feel pain when they have gas?  I can't imagine the gas bubble has a sharp point, so it's not like the gas bubble is poking your intestine. </p>

<p>Pain is <a href=""https://www.iasp-pain.org/Taxonomy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.""</a> so some mechanism must be turning the physical presence of gas in the intestine to pain.  What is that mechanism? </p>

<p>Clarify: this question is about a healthy persons normal daily gas causing occasional pain. </p>

"Which long-term effects can hypocortisolism have on behavior?","<p>Chronic stress can have a serious impact on our physical as well as psychological health due to sustained high levels of the chemicals released in the ‘fight or flight’ response.</p>

"What is the mechanism of eczema?","<p>I'm trying to link the <strong>signs and symptoms</strong> of eczema (especially atopic dermatitis) to its <strong>causes</strong>. In short, what is the mechanism of the disease?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/354/99"">an answer of another question about eczema</a>, @anongoodnurse has said (bolded words added by me):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Signs and symptoms:</strong> Eczema (or Atopic Dermatitis) is an incompletely understood skin disorder, in which the normal skin barrier function (permeability) is compromised, allowing the skin to dry out more than normal skin.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Causes:</strong> The cause of the dryness in AD is thought by some to be <strong>(1)</strong> a deficiency of a naturally occurring fatty substance in the skin called ceramide. Others believe it's <strong>(2)</strong> an abnormal or missing protein which causes the skin barrier to be compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to cause immune responses more easily, triggering the itch/chronic inflammation (this might explain the response seen with topical steroids). </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>If the cause is a deficiency of ceramide, what causes this cause? <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramide"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ceramides are a family of waxy lipid molecules</a>, so exactly which chemical is produced? Is it because the skin produces another kind of ceramide which has lower quality, or it does not produce enough?</p></li>
<li><p>If the cause is an abnormal or missing protein, what causes this cause? What protein it is? Is that something related to T cells (recognising antigens) or B cells (producing antibodies)? Is it a skin problem or an immune system problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Also, I heard from many sources that this is an immune system problem. And the source of this problem is the gut. <a href=""http://preventdisease.com/news/15/030615_All-Disease-Begins-In-The-Gut.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">They quote Hippocrates: ""All disease begins in the gut""</a><em>.</em> Is that true?

"How much hard liquor is safe for very small children?","<p>I live in a location where <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baijiu"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hard liquor</a> (48%-52% alcohol by volume) is frequently given to small children as young as two years old. This is usually not in large quantities, although a recent story in the local newspaper did report the death of a three-year-old by alcohol poisoning for consuming about 100ml in a short period of time. (This would be without water, as shots, and possibly on an empty stomach, per the local custom.)</p>

<p>Everyone knows that <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/355/what-effects-does-alcohol-have-on-underage-children"">too much alcohol has averse effects</a>, but I'd like to quantify this a bit if possible. Assume a healthy two-year-old child who weighs about 25 pounds; how much hard liquor would be unhealthy and why?</p>

<p>I'm looking for an answer that isn't <em>zero</em> for the sake of being zero (unless there's a true reason that <em>any amount at all</em> is damaging). Kids often taste it off the end of a chopstick or something similar, so dosages of &lt;1ml in an evening may be realistic in the common case, a couple of times per month.</p>

<p>In other cases, a child will be able to drink from the glass, and once at a wedding I've seen a three-year-old nephew-in-law drunk as a result. His dad is undoubtedly giving him too much, but too much by how much?</p>

The Question was ""<em>If the quantity is small, is it still a risk?</em>""; the Answer immediately sidesteps the question, asserts that 60ml is a small quantity, and then concludes by explaining that 60ml is not a small quantity.</p>

<p>The correct answer may be that the truth is intractable, similar to <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/465/713"">this fine answer</a>, but the situation here is different. I'm not seeing multiple conflicting studies; rather, I'm seeing very little research on this topic. My guesstimate, based on absolute air, is that it's somewhere in the vicinity of 5ml, but I'm hoping there's some real relevant research out there given how important the issue and how absolutely prevalent of a practice it is.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit for clarification:</em></strong>
For the purposes of this Question, I'm only interested in direct health effects and long-term damage, and not second-order effects like increasing propensity for alcoholism.</p>

<p>I'm really trying to understand how much physical machinery a two-year-old child has when it comes to processing alcohol, such that a few hours later they'd be just fine in the same way an adult is just fine after drinking a small amount of liquor.</p>

"How important is the amount of active ingredient in an ointment?","<p>I own a small tin of ""Dr Chase"" ointment that is probably 40 years old. This stuff is amazing. In my family we save it for particularly stubborn or difficult cuts and sores because it will heal anything. Recently, I had something on my leg that Polysporin was not helping - after a week of twice daily Polysporin I got out the Dr Chase and in two days it was better. It is a matter of family legend that it must contain radiation or mercury or something because it is just not like any other ointment. </p>

<p>As far as I know, it's not made any more. I would love to replace my tin and use it more often, but I haven't been able to find it. However, I can read the back of the tin just fine and it consists of:</p>

<li>Zinc Oxide, 18.6 % w/w</li>
<li>Phenol, 0.59% w/w</li>

<p>Zinc Oxide suspensions are easy to find (diaper cream) but they don't have phenol in them. I have turned up a Canadian ointment (how convenient, I am in Canada) called Ozonol that contains 0.18% phenol and 3.72% zinc oxide. How likely is this to be as good? The Dr Chase is a tiny little tin, 2"" across, and you use very little at a time of this very thick ointment - it's just like diaper cream. The Ozonal comes in a tube.

<li>Is there a way to promote POPs excretion instead of redistribution, and how can this be achieved?</li>

"To what degree does a Vitamin D course mitigate the effects of Primary Hyperparathyroidism?","<p>Primary Hyperparathyroidism, often caused by a parathyroid gland having an adenoma on it, increases the release of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the body.  This causes the excess release of calcium from bones into the blood, and the weakening of said bones.  A low Vitamin D level often accompanies hyperparathyroidism (or perhaps is a result of?) and while most calcium is excreted then through urine, some of it forms into kidney stones.</p>

"Effects of Garlic on Tacrolimus via CYP3A4","<p>Garlic is said to be an inducer of CYP3A4, Tacrolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4.</p>

<p>The list of drugs (and some foods) interacting with Tacrolimus is long but nowhere I found a note on garlic. Grapefruit juice is always mentioned, but regarding the fact that it is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 at least there would be no graft rejection when exposed.</p>

<p>Is garlic in this context not mentioned because it has <strong>absolutely</strong> no effect or because there are no studies available? Green tea for example is also not mentioned but according to current studies it may have an effect and the university of Munich for example advices transplant patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors to avoid it.</p>

"Definition of Prevalence","<p>I have been informed that <em>the prevalence</em> of chickenpox and smallpox in the general population are 10% and 0.1%, respectively. On the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevalence"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> page it is written </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prevalence in epidemiology is the proportion of a particular population found to be affected by a medical condition (typically a disease or a risk factor such as smoking or seat-belt use).</p>

"Values of Body Hydration Values to calibrate the readings of Galvanic skin response sensor","<p>I am trying to make a circuit to implement a Galvanic skin response sensor to measure the skin resistance and then use it to find the skin conductance. Then, I wish to calibrate these readings with some standard data so that the actual body hydration level can be calculated.
In order to do so, I used one of the reference designs of Texas Instruments (<a href=""http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDM-BIOSIGNMONITOR"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Link</a>). (The discussion related to this project is running on another TI forum with the link <a href=""https://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/msp430/f/166/p/760267/2846858#2846858"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HERE</a>.)

The circuit has been implemented using hardware and I am getting voltage values from the op amp output terminal.
The problem arises when I cannot compare these values with some standard data that is used in the Clinical labs for measuring body hydration level. So, the voltage values that I get cannot help in finding whether the person's body hydration level is high/low/some xyz value.</p>

<p>I need to calibrate these readings with some standard data so that the actual body hydration level can be calculated. 
Where can I get the standard data that I use for the calibration? OR is there some alternative approach to calibrate my readings?

Ah! </p>

<p>Of course, I've seen a few dentists about this and have tried a number of different mouth-guards.

<p>How comes these two are true at the same time? I have reactive arthritis and my feet are swollen after long days especially when I stand up or walk a lot. I've read that poor blood circulation causes this and shifting between cold and hot water improves blood circulation.

It didn't reduce swelling at all, it just made it worse. People also say that I should try compression socks for my swollen feet, but I am suspicious about it. If it increases the blood circulation it can't be good for me. Cold slows down the blood circulation and I know it is good for me.

"Is it a good idea to consume Soylent meal replacements (specifically containing potassium supplements)?","<p>The reason I am asking this is actually related to daily recommended potassium intake, which is stated to be around 4.700 mg daily. However, even if I concentrate all my meals on potassium intake, it's very hard to get near this number (I think around 14 bananas would suffice).</p>

<p>So searching for possible ways to increase intake, I noticed a number of ""meal replacements"" (like Soylent, but many of them DIY), which use potassium chloride or potassium citrate to provide the necessary intake.</p>

<p>For example, this <a href=""https://www.completefoods.co/diy/recipes/keto-chow-150-master-rich-chocolate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Keto Chow"" recipe</a> contains 6 grams of potassium citrate, and apparently perfectly provides all the nutrients:</p>

"Elderly Father Takes Prevacid for last 20 years, seems to do more harm, how to stop","<p><strong>Note: Requesting guidance on how to approach, not medical advice.</strong></p>

<p>My Dad is in his early 70s and has taken Prevacid once a day for nearly 20 years. </p>

<p>After eating food would come up after an hour. Nowadays my dad barely eats anything so very rarely something would come up.</p>

<li>Sodium 132 Lo (reference 135 - 147 mmol/L)</li>
<li>Chloride 93 Lo (reference 96 - 108 mmol/L)</li>
<li>C02 17 Lo (22 - 29 mmol/L)</li>

<p>The Internal Medicine doctor said these levels are so insignificant there are <code>no associated Pathology to treat these small ranges</code> and <code>on the physiological level they don't do anything clinical</code></p>

<p>Now I am questioning this. What if they are related.</p>

<p>Plus FDA (<a href=""http://www.everydayhealth.com/drugs/prevacid"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>) warn long term use of Prevacid </p>

  <p>If you take this drug for three months or more you may also develop
  low magnesium levels. This can be serious and may or may not come with

"What is excess blood from blood donations used for, and do we ever run out?","<p>I regularly donate blood, however, I am curious as to what happens to my blood after I donate.  Obviously some of it will go to people in emergency medical situations, as I intend.  However, I have never heard of situations where someone died because we didn't have blood to donate to them; which makes it sound as if we don't have a blood deficit.  That in turn makes me wonder what the excess blood is used for.</p>

<p>So I have two related questions.  First, do we ever <em>have</em> a blood deficit, situations where someone who could have been saved in a hospital dies because there wasn't blood to treat them?  Or specifically situations like that caused by a lack of donors, not some logistical issue getting it where it needs to be.  I have had the red cross call me and tell me that they have a 'deficit' many times, but frankly I hear it so often it leaves me questioning their definition of deficit.  How often do we really run out?</p>

<p>Related, if we don't run a deficit then what happens to my excess blood?  I assume that some blood is regularly thrown out, but they figure it's better to have extra and risk it expiring then to run out during an emergency.  However, if we have a high enough surplus do they do something else with it?  For instance is it used for medical research?  If we had say 5% fewer donors would it be our medical research which suffered, but not patients in the hospital?</p>

<p>I will continue donating blood regardless of the answer here.  I'm simply curious as to the result.

"Are platelet donations more needed then whole blood?","<p>A few months ago I showed up to donate blood and said I was willing to do any type of donation. I ended up getting dragged into donating platelets instead, which I admit I hadn't even realized was an option.  I'm trying to donate platelets more, now that I realize I can do it in between whole blood donations, though I admit I find the whole process far more annoying then whole blood.</p>

<p>However, what I find odd is how I've gotten far more pressure to come back to donate platelets then I ever did donating red blood, and the first time the clearly pushed me to donating platelets over whole blood even when I really didn't know anything about it and just going along to help out however they wanted me to.  </p>

<p>This last time I showed up I told them that I thought I was due to donate whole blood, and if so wanted to do whole blood since I didn't have time for platelets, but would donate platelets if I wasn't due for whole blood.  Again they seemed very eager to get me to donate platelets, to the point of seeming really disappointing when I ended up donating whole blood.</p>

<p>It's inconvenient, to say the least, to loose so much time multiple times a month, I'm happy to do it to help, but I'd at least like to have an idea of exactly how much I am helping when I do it.</p>

<p>So, is there a reason they seem so eager to get platelet donations?  Would it do more good to never donate whole blood and only ever do platelets?  Can anyone give me an estimation of how much good a platelet donation does <em>on average</em> (not the best case, but the average case of each donation from a B+ donor)? </p>

"how many 'lives' are saved from one donation of blood?","<p>The red cross claims that donating blood can 'save up to three lives'  That seems a highly exaggerated best case scenario.  I'm curious, how many lives are really saved from a unit of blood?  Specifically, what is the odds of one pint of whole blood producing a product which will be used to successfully treat an otherwise fatal injury/illness etc, and that if the donor had not donated that pint a death would have occurred due to lack of sufficient supplies, or being forced to use fewer resources of less computable ones?</p>

<p>What I would love is the ability to do get as nuanced and exact numbers as possible, as part of the motivation of this question is to have the numbers needed to address another question on Skeptics.  If an answer doesn't want to do the exact math pointing me to the resources I need for me to do the math would be fine as well; but I don't even know what products are produced from a whole blood donation much less how to calculate the benefit of any one of those products.</p>

<p>I know that blood type of the donor could play a factor here, but to address the question I'm interested in I'd prefer to know about the 'average' pint of blood, so in essence if all the donor of all the varous blood types in the US donated and you averaged all those various pings of different types together what would the average pint do?</p>

<p>Of course being B+ myself I would be personally curious to know what the B+ blood type does, it would be cool to calculate a 'statistical lives saved' ratio for myself :)</p>

"Does rubbing a nettle sting with a dock leaf actually help? How?","<p>From a young age we were taught that the treatment for a nettle sting was to rub it with a dock leaf. Conveniently, docks usually grow close to where there are nettles. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does this actually do something to help? </li>
<li>Is the effect entirely/mostly placebotic?</li>
<li>How does it work? (and what is the best technique to use)</li>
<li>Would washing/rubbing with water be as/more effective?</li>
</ul>

<p>As an adult if I get stung I have used the same treatment. It does seem to gradually calm the sting but it is difficult to say if the sting would be better without the treatment.</p>

<p><strong>The treatment especially seems to help kids.</strong> Looking around for dock leaves is a great distraction. Kids are really happy to be able to help and do something about the problem. I have also heard that getting stung with a nettle is ""lucky"" (think magic fairy type of lucky here - woo!) and also that it gives a boost to the immune system (now that sounds much more scientific!). These two things are another good distraction and comfort to kids especially. </p>

<p><strong>Physical action ?</strong></p>

<p>Does rubbing the sting with juice of dock leaf simple rub away the sting needles? And does the juice dilute the chemicals injected in the sting?</p>

<p>In the summer when the nettles are out and it is common to get stung I have found several times that no water is convenient (even in Ireland) so the best source of something cooling is a crushed dock leaf. </p>

<p><strong>Chemical action ?</strong></p>

<p>I believed nettles had an acid in the sting and that dock leaves had a base. And a simple acid+base=>salt+water neturalising reaction took place to calm the sting. </p>

<p>However, reading a bit more about this shows up different and sometimes contradictory information. It is hard to determine what are actual facts. What chemicals are involved depend on what article you are reading! </p>

<p>I think the facts on nettle sting are: Stinging nettles have sharp needles of silica(glass). There is a mix of chemicals which are injected by the needles. From wikipedia : several chemicals: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-HT (serotonin), moroidin, leukotrienes, and possibly formic acid.</p>

<ul>
<li>250g Tomatoes (40% of Vit-A DRI) every day </li>
<li><p>500g carrots(16 times DRI) once a week</p>

"What is the optimal weight within the BMI range?","<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BMI</a> is a commonly used measure to determine whether or not a person is at a healthy weight. A person is said to be overweight if they are above 25 and underweight if below 18.5. <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/q/3176/3258"">This question</a> asks what the scientific basis is for BMI ranges, but does not question the difference between the values within that range.</p>

<p>Between the upper and lower ""healthy"" limits is a rather large range of weights. Anecdotally, when I am at a BMI of 25 I still look and feel rather overweight (flabby, bulging belly, etc.). I've only ever been as low as around 21 or 22 BMI, at which point I am rather slim, and at the weight I'd need to be to achieve 18.5 I imagine I would be very skinny, too slender by my personal standards.</p>

<p>Is it really the case that someone at a BMI of 18.5 would be equally as healthy as someone at 21.75 (the midpoint) or 25? By healthy I mean equivalent risk of long term illnesses, early death, etc. (assuming other health-related factors to be the same).</p>

<p>If not, then is there a more accurate way to determine an optimally healthy weight (as opposed to merely a range of healthy weights)? Having been unable to find any information on this point, my target weight is a BMI of 21.75, but I would like to fine tune this if possible.</p>

"Current Theories on Ice vs. Heat for injuries","<p>So I will preface this by saying I've heard a couple of things that I will list out for legibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Ice should be used for Acute injuries and Heat for Chronic injuries""</li>
<li>""Ice restricts blood flow therefore slows healing while Heat enhances blood flow and immune response.""</li>
</ul>

<p>For the sake of argument lets say an Acute Injury is defined by the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sharp well-defined pain upon using or pressing area</li>
<li>Constantly present</li>
<li>Possible bleeding/bruising</li>
<li>Occurred within the past week</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets also say a Chronic Injury is defined as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dull pain upon using or pressing area that becomes sharp with prolonged agitation</li>
<li>Lasting longer than a week</li>
<li>Comes and goes depending on activity</li>
<li>No bleeding/bruising present</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at such cases what has research shown is the most effective way of tackling such injuries? I would guess that they are treated differently seeing as they are considered different types of injury. </p>

<p>If two patients sprained their left ankle in the exact same manner I imagine the one who sprained his yesterday will be treated differently than the one still experiencing problems from a month old sprain.</p>

<p>Since this is something that does cover a broad spectrum of issues I will coalesce it into four relatively specific questions of what I am looking for.</p>

<p>Are there studies/data showing that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Heat improves healing response for injuries, while Cold reduces it.</li>
<li>Icing acute injuries gives better outcome than heating or doing nothing at all.</li>
<li>Heating chronic injuries gives better outcome than icing or doing nothing at all.</li>
<li>The RICE method is truly effective.</li>
</ol>

<p>For simplicity sake consider the question of this post to be: ""Are there any conventional theories/study/data that prove whether Ice or Heat is better for injury treatment?""</p>

<p>EDIT: For clarity I should note I am not asking if pain is reduced but the underlying issue causing the pain. I am looking for studies/data showing what is the best <em>treatment</em> for enabling recovery.</p>

<p>Various treatments for these conditions include salt tablets and water intake, or regular home IV saline infusions.  These have to be done regularly, however, or healthy kidneys will eliminate the excess fluid.</p>

<p>Wouldn't a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_expander#Colloids"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">colloidal volume expander</a> like <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelofusine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gelofusine</a> or Albumin last longer, by maintaining the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncotic_pressure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">oncotic pressure</a>?</p>

<p>I recognize that unfortunately, it seems to be hard to get, as wikipedia explains in the article on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumin#Medical_uses"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">albumin</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For patients with low blood volume, there is no evidence that albumin reduces mortality when compared with cheaper alternatives such as normal saline, or that albumin reduces mortality in patients with burns and low albumin levels. Therefore, the Cochrane Collaboration recommends that it not be used, except in clinical trials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this research all seems to be about treating acute hypovolemia, such as in cases of blood loss or severe dehydration. In those cases, saline works just as well while being less expensive.</p>

<p>But for EDS patients, the problem isn't low blood volume, but inability to regulate that volume. Saline boosts the quantity of fluid while decreasing oncotic pressure, which is ultimately self-defeating. Maintaining oncotic pressure would, in theory, be ideal.  Perhaps we could find a colloid that the kidneys will not eliminate rapidly.</p>

This would be very beneficial to the health of many people. But is there any believable explanation for why your body burns more calories in a hot bath?</p>

<p>Thermodynamically I would expect the opposite, cold might slightly increase calorie burn as the body expends energy in order to maintain its temperature. </p>

<p>Of course for an engine the lack of a cold reservoir would make it less efficient (or not operate at all). Which might mean more energy needs to be expended to achieve the same effect. As far as I know however, there is no important 'heat to work' engine in the human metabolism (see <a href=""https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/59316/human-as-a-heat-engine"">https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/59316/human-as-a-heat-engine</a>  for instance).</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't want a hot debate and I will agree with whatever the powers that be on this StackExchange decide (I am grateful that people spend time moderating here), but I think I should at least say that clearly the issue of burning extra calories is a health issue. The majority of westerners would greatly increase their health and life expectancy if they could manage to burn more calories a day. The next issue might be that I'm not asking about a treatment but about why a treatment might work. Well if you are not allowed to ask why a treatment works because you believe these are biology questions then there is not much point to asking about the treatment itself either.

"Do sensibility to hot, cold, sweet, acid foods/drinks or air mean different levels of tooth decay?","<p>Usually a dentist would ask you if you're sensible to cold, hot, sweet or acid foods or drinks. The dentist may even expose the suspect tooth to compresed air, but what cues do this information give? for example: does sensibility to sweet mean a deeper cavity than to cold ? does any of them mean infection ? </p>

<p>Which is worst or do they all mean the same ?</p>

<p>Edit: 
For any sensibility to happen the emanel must let the substance pass throught the dentin. What I belive is that: hot or cold change the temperature of dentin which in turn change the presure around the nerve, but doesn't necesarily need to touch it directly, acid and sweet (that became acid thanks to bacteria) get to the nerve by the pores of dentin, while air needs a direct road to the nerve, thus making it the worst sign.</p>

"Why is 88% SpO2 considered a critical level?","<p>If I understand correctly, arterial blood is usually saturated to ~95% with oxygen, the oxygen being transported in combination with haemoglobin in a ratio of 4:1.</p>

"Assessing protein bars with artificial sweeteners for diabetics type 2","<p>In case of diabetes type 2, I have learned that it is recommended to find a low carb diet, possibly even low fat (to ease loss of weight) and to compensate instead with whole grain food, high amounts of proteins and fibers. </p>

<p>Particularly for the last 2 elements, I have found that there exist protein bars that are quite rich in both fibers and protein, while having minimal carbs/sugar. But these tend to be processed food and contain alternative sweeteners such as, isomalto-oligosaccharide, stevlol glycosides, sucralose, to name a few. One such protein bar, denoted to be purely vegan, has the following nutrition table:</p>

"Is tinnitus caused by brain damage?","<p>This question was asked in Psychology.SE with no answer so I thought I would try here.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is well known that loud noises can lead to hearing problems such as temporary hearing loss or tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and even permanent hearing loss. But this is the first time scientists have been able to identify damages to nerve cells as a result of noise exposure.</p>
  
  <p>The research allows us to understand the pathway from exposure to loud noises to hearing loss. Dissecting the cellular mechanisms underlying this condition is likely to bring a very significant healthcare benefit to a wider population. The work will help prevention as well as progression into finding appropriate cures for hearing loss"", said the lead researcher Dr. Martine Hamann, from the University of Leicester in the UK.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
  Maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization may contribute to the generation and maintenance of tinnitus. Because cortical organization can be modified by behavioral training, we attempted to reduce tinnitus loudness by exposing chronic tinnitus patients to self-chosen, enjoyable music, which was modified (“notched”) to contain no energy in the frequency range surrounding the individual tinnitus frequency. After 12 months of regular listening, the target patient group (<em>n</em> = 8) showed significantly reduced subjective tinnitus loudness and concomitantly exhibited reduced evoked activity in auditory cortex areas corresponding to the tinnitus frequency compared to patients who had received an analogous placebo notched music treatment (<em>n</em> = 8). These findings indicate that tinnitus loudness can be significantly diminished by an enjoyable, low-cost, custom-tailored notched music treatment, potentially via reversing maladaptive auditory cortex reorganization.</p>

Loss of the protective coating, called myelin, disrupts electrical nerve signals.</p>

<p>With both articles mentioning Dr. Martine Hamann from the University of Leicester, I found that she was involved with <a href=""https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/npb/people/dr-martine-hamann/publications"" rel=""noreferrer"">three studies in that year</a>.</p>

<p>The article which seems to be related is <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1116981109"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pilati, et al. (2012)</a>, which states within the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here we investigate mechanisms contributing to excitability changes in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) shortly after exposure to loud sound that produces hearing loss. We show that acoustic overexposure alters synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN in different ways. A reduction in the number of myelinated auditory nerve fibers leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells, which cannot be restored by increasing auditory nerve fiber recruitment. In contrast, a decreased membrane resistance of DCN granule cells (multisensory inputs) leads to a reduced maximal firing rate of DCN principal cells that is overcome when additional multisensory fibers are recruited. Furthermore, gain modulation by inhibitory synaptic transmission is disabled in both auditory and multisensory pathways. These cellular mechanisms that contribute to decreased cellular excitability in the central auditory pathway are likely to represent early neurobiological markers of hearing loss and may suggest interventions to delay or stop the development of hyperactivity that has been associated with tinnitus.</p>

<p>The following is also in the article:</p>

<p>Acoustic overexposure (AOE):</p>

<ul>
<li>induces hearing threshold elevations (shifts of hearing
thresholds of 20–30 dB sound pressure level were observed for frequencies above
the frequency used during the AOE protocol),</li>
<li>decreases fusiform cell excitability,</li>
<li>down-regulates auditory nerve (AN) and multi-sensory (MS) synaptic transmission to fusiform cells (FCs)</li>
<li>reduces FC maximal firing rate upon AN stimulations</li>
<li>decreases the number of myelinated AN fibres in the cochlea</li>
<li>reduces FC maximal firing rate upon MS input stimulation and</li>
<li>decreases granule cell membrane resistance</li>
<li>disables FC gain control by inhibitory synaptic transmission</li>

<p>Not having a background in neurology, I am wondering if altered synaptic transmission originating from the auditory and the multisensory pathway within the DCN equates to brain damage or is the altered synaptic transmission caused by information received from the damaged cochlea?</p>

<p><strong>In other words, has it really been found that the cause of Tinnitus is brain damage which can be repaired through playing sounds or music with a ""notch"" in specific frequency spectrums?</strong></p>

"Is there a common standard to assess the safety of medical procedures?","<p>Many medical procedures (which are less or more necessary) like LASIK, joint replacement, tonsillectomy or gallbladder removal are described for patients as very safe (usually with a high number of successful previous procedures taken around the world).</p>

<p>Are there concrete standard for the safety of such procedures? Number of deaths, for example, is not enough. A scale of severity of side effects would be more the direction. </p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>I hoped for something like the Injury Severity Score but it seems that there isn't. I understand the subjectivity of this question. But is there a way to classify medical procedures in a way so that a man that undergone a gallbladder removal will know that tonsillectomy is easier b/c the recovery is usually shorter + the probability of hematoma is lower etc? Or maybe the side effects vary so much that there is no way to compare procedures which are not very similar(e.g. one in dentistry and on in gastro). </p>

<p>A counter-argument I heard recently on the radio here in the UK (<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0002hnj"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on this BBC Radio 2 programme - section starting from 42min 40secs </a>) was that you can't say that when in some countries where cholera is high, you cannot safely allow children to play in the mud (from 46min 3secs).</p>

<p>When looking at the rise in food allergies, one area which I have been looking at is the constant changes in what should and shouldn't be eaten during pregnancy.  Expectant mothers are told not to eat nuts, shellfish, dairy products etc. in order to avoid allergy problems in the baby, yet when you look at the great long <a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/foods-to-avoid-pregnant"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of don't eats</a> provided by the NHS, they even point out that there can be conflicting information given regarding peanuts, because</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the government previously advised women to avoid eating peanuts if there was a history of allergy – such as asthma, eczema, hay fever and food allergy – in their child's immediate family.</p>
  
  <p>This advice has now changed because the latest research has shown no clear evidence that eating peanuts during pregnancy affects the chances of your baby developing a peanut allergy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also reports in places such as <a href=""https://www.parents.com/baby/health/allergy/food-allergy-facts"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this parenting site</a> where they say that it is fine to eat high allergy foods if you as an expectant mother are not allergic yourself.</p>

<p>What is the state of play within medical science regarding this?  What <strong>is</strong> the cause of the rise in allergies and food intolerance?  Is it purely lack of exposure to potential allergens early in life (including during prenatal development)?  <strong>Should</strong> expectant mothers avoid dairy, nuts, shellfish etc. which others are allergic to ""just in case""?</p>

"Why aren't fluoride mouthwashes with cetylpyridinium chloride labeled as both anticavity and antibacterial?","<p>I recall just a few years ago, there was a common <strong>misconception</strong> that fluoride interferes with the antibacterial activity of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) - in fact, I've often seen instructions on antibacterial CPC rinses specifying that you should thoroughly rinse the toothpaste (which they probably assume contains fluoride) out of your mouth before using them.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, I've also seen a rise in alcohol-free fluoride rinses with some amount of CPC, marketed as anticavity with the ""ADA Accepted"" seal of approval.</p>

<p>However, I found this article recently: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4546200/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4546200/</a> - a study that tested a rinse containing both common OTC mouthwash-standard concentrations of sodium fluoride and CPC - compared against fluoride-only, CPC-only, and placebo mouthwashes. In short: the study found that CPC doesn't significantly interfere with fluoride's anticavity properties, and fluoride doesn't interfere with CPC's antibacterial activity. </p>

<p>Additionally, fluoride and CPC both have different ways of making cariogenic bacteria miserable - for example, CPC breaks bacterial cell membranes (<a href=""https://www.dentistrytoday.com/articles-hygiene/7104-its-80-20-with-biofilm-update-on-oral-rinses"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.dentistrytoday.com/articles-hygiene/7104-its-80-20-with-biofilm-update-on-oral-rinses</a>), while fluoride inhibits important bacterial enzymes and reduces acid tolerance in bacteria that would otherwise thrive in a low pH (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7497353"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7497353</a>).</p>

<p>Despite all this information readily available in academic journal articles, I have yet to see a combined fluoride/CPC rinse labeled as both anticavity and antibacterial. For some unknown reason, the cetylpyridinium chloride is labeled as an ""inactive ingredient"". 2 examples: ACT Alcohol-Free Anticavity rinse, cinnamon flavor (<a href=""https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f2952ca5-c1c3-42fc-82a4-08662286be44"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f2952ca5-c1c3-42fc-82a4-08662286be44</a>) and a similar rinse by Crest (<a href=""https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=52232bad-90ce-4f59-8b26-ca4c674df836"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=52232bad-90ce-4f59-8b26-ca4c674df836</a>)</p>

<p>Several years ago I recall a Listerine fluoride anticavity rinse that also contained the regular antibacterial Listerine formulation (22% alcohol and antibacterial essential oils), yet the essential oils were listed as inactive.</p>

<p>Why the confusion and misinformation? If a product is both anticavity and antibacterial, it should be listed properly.</p>

"Hitler's physician Morrel prescribed a drug that contained e. coli -- was this unusual in those days?","<p>It is my understanding that Hitler's physician, T. Morell, who was essentially a ""feel good"" like Max Jacobson (although maybe still acting within accepted practice in the days when powerful drugs were very liberally prescribed or even available otc) was giving Hitler a ""drug"" call Mutaflor that was essentially e. coli extracted from human feces.</p>

<p>Today I think good results are sometimes achieved with fecal transplants and what I am wondering is if there is a relationship between the ideas of the 1930s and today?

</blockquote>

<p>And countless others.  It seems pretty solid.  </p>

<p>However, anecdotally, I've noticed a trend where my performance in activities that benefit from a low reaction time improve after I've had a few drinks (namely online FPS games).  I decided to investigate further and setup a small experiment.  </p>

<p><strong>The Experiment</strong></p>

<p>Every 20 minutes I would record my BAC level using a breathalyzer, take an online reaction time test (<a href=""http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime</a>) five times, and consume 1oz of 80 proof alcohol.</p>

<p>For reference, I also consulted an online chart estimating BAC levels (<a href=""http://bloodalcoholcalculator.org/bac-charts/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bloodalcoholcalculator.org/bac-charts/</a> - I'm male and ~160 pounds)</p>

<p>The results I saw are completely contradictory to everything I've ever been told.  Over the span of three hours, my reaction time <em>did not</em> increase.  In fact, it decreased!  Each point in the chart below is 20 minutes apart - and the estimated BAC level from the website.  And the test consisted of 10 measurements (and I dropped the 2 lowest, 2 highest and averaged the remaining).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dBGyC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/dBGyC.png"" alt=""BAC Drops over time""></a></p>

<p>The difference between ~270ms and ~230ms is pretty significant - according to the data collected by the Human Benchmark site I used in my experiment.  At 270ms, my reaction time is right in the most common range.  But as I drank, I ended up way ahead of the curve. </p>

"Do antibiotics contribute to bone healing?","<p>Two weeks ago I broke my tibia in an accident.

<li>Pantoprazole (Pantosel 40)</li>
<li>Diclofinac sodium with Paracetamol </li>
<li>Paracetamol</li>
</ul>

<p>The next day I went to another hospital in my home town, and they suggested removing the plaster to insert the rod. And so it was, I had a surgery to insert the rods.</p>

"""Complete nutrition"" in a crockpot?","<p>I recently embarked on an experiment with a product you may have heard of called ""Soylent"".  The idea appealed to me.  I don't eat as healthy as I should primarily because of the work involved (expense isn't helpful).  I'm a busy young professional and by the time I get home from work, I just don't want to cook.  It's super convenient to pour my dinner from a pitcher that took me 5 minutes or less to prepare the night before and I feel good knowing that I'm getting proper balanced nutrition.</p>

<p>But I just can't do the liquid diet all the time.  It was driving me crazy and I've reverted (mostly) to my old (unhealthy) ways.  It's not that I don't like the taste or anything.  It's actually pretty good after a few days' acclimation.  It's just boring eating (read: ""drinking"") the same thing all day every day and the lack of solid food seems to present a psychological barrier I wasn't expecting.</p>

<p>While munching on a delicious chicken dish, much like a casserole, that was made for me for my birthday recently, I began to wonder if there was a recipe for some sort of crockpot meal that might offer similar benefits, e.g. total balanced nutrition in a simple-and-inexpensive package.  Something I could dump in the crockpot and come home to perfect food in the evening with little to no effort.  Maybe even make up several days' worth in advance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my Googling has turned up nothing but ""dieting"" recipes.  ""Less than 299 calories per serving!"" etc.  I'm not interested in ""dieting"" per se.  Just a simple meal that takes little prep for a reasonable price and contains everything a dietician would like to see me eating.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of such a recipe?  Or multiple such recipes?  Thanks in advance!</p>

"Effect of Blood donation needles on skin","<p>I have donated my blood 3 times now...all three times at different hospitals.</p>

<p>The first time, a very fine needle was used...almost similar to the one usually used in injection or to draw blood for blood tests. </p>

<p>However, subsequently, much broader needles were used...by their looks, they seemed nearly twice as broad as the earlier needle. It also caused more pain than the first time. I guess they use the broader needle to draw blood more quickly.</p>

<p>However, I have noticed another phenomena...the subsequent blood donations have left a depression-type scar mark on my skin.</p>

<p>So I have the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Am I right in concluding that a broader needle would have been used to draw blood quickly?</li>
<li>Are the needles used to draw blood replaceable? Can I ask the nurses drawing my blood to replace the broad needle with a finer one? (I asked the nurse if it was possible and he said that as far as he knew, only broader needles came for blood donation.)</li>
<li>If the needles are indeed replaceable, then what are they called? How should I refer to them for the nurse to be able to understand me correctly.</li>
</ol>

<p>This information would help me donate blood relatively painlessly next time.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

"Do all very old people have heart failure?","<p>A 95 year old will probably not be able to do hard exercise, such as running fast for one hour per day. The heart of such a person won't have the capacity to pump the required amount of blood through its body. However, most 95 year olds won't visit the doctor complaining about not being as fit as they where at the age of 25, any complaints about feeling tired, lack of energy etc. will typically be considered to be normal for the age.</p>

<p>But one can ask if in fact the aging of the heart is equivalent to having (mild) heart failure. Suppose that when I'm 95 years old I disguise myself, making myself look 25 years old. I then visit some doctor complaining about not being able to exercise at a reasonable intensity. If all sorts of tests are done, would I be diagnosed with heart failure? And would treatment for heart failure for healthy 95 year olds allow them to exercise at an intensity that is much higher than what could be considered to be normal for that age?</p>

"Does free sugar intake before meals cause more adverse effects than after them?","<p>The WHO gives <a href=""http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/guidelines/sugars_intake/en/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sugar intake recommendations</a> in terms of percentage of energy intake. That, combined with some popular wisdom makes the think that it isn't the same if I eat, say a chocolate bar, before or after lunch.</p>

<p>From what I understand, the major problem with free sugars is that they cause an insoline production spike that our body is not quite prepared to deal with in the long run. If I were to eat some <em>not so unhealty food</em> (such as a regular meal), the insuline levels would rise at a normal pace until the free sugar intake and would drop less after the sugar processing, because there would still be the rest of the meal to digest, effectively reducing the insuline spike.</p>

<p>So, it is worse to consume free sugars before a meal than after? If so, how much worse is it? For the same ammount of adverse effects, can I ingest more free sugars after a regular meal than after a small one?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> please consider as meals something a nutricionist would recommend to an average, healthy adult person, a ""regular meal"" being the lunch, and the small meal the mid-morning break.</p>

"How much T4 increase do you get per mcg of levothyroxine?","<p>A normal starting dose of levothyroxine is 50 mcg per day. According to ATA, absorption is 60-80%. Let's assume 70% and let's assume 5 L of blood in the average human being.</p>

<pre><code>50 mcg * 0.7 / 5.0 = 7 mcg/L
7 mcg/L = 7000 ng/L
</code></pre>

<p>According to <a href=""http://unitslab.com/node/121"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this tool</a>, 7000 ng/L of thyroxine is 9000 pmol/L. Free T4 is usually 0.03% of total T4 so I'd at first expect the dose to contribute <code>9000 * 0.03 = 270 pmol/L</code> of free T4.</p>

<p>But a normal human range of free T4 is 10-24 pmol/L. Clearly I've made a mistake somewhere since the dose seems to be an order of magnitude too large.</p>

<p>What's the correct calculation? What is the expected average T4 increase when taking 50 mcg of levothyroxine?</p>

"Should I use salt supplements if my sweat is bland?","<p>Normally my sweat tastes salty.  But in hot weather it often gets bland.  I notice that when that happens I don't seem to retain water: I'll drink to the point that my urine is frequent and clear, but I'll still be thirsty.  And my perspiration rate will go up noticeably: I'll be dripping with sweat when I'm just a little hot, where in the same conditions with salty sweat my perspiration rate will be more measured.</p>

<p>I have long resorted to basically using the absence of salty sweat as a sign to supplement my salt intake, either by over-salting my food, eating salty snacks, or taking electrolyte pills.</p>

<p>I don't have a low-salt diet, and I don't work or exercise outside to the degree that many people do.  I'm in good shape and no blood or urine analysis has ever uncovered anything abnormal.</p>

<p>But I remember some time ago hearing that salt supplements were considered obsolete.  And nobody I know with more aggressive exercise routines supplements their salt intake.  In fact they all think the idea sounds ridiculous.</p>

<p>So am I misreading the signs of electrolyte imbalance?  Or am I responding incorrectly?  Could I have an above-average electrolyte ""metabolism"" or demand?</p>

"Should we rinse with water after brushing our teeth?","<p>I've heard that rinsing with water after teeth brushing lowers or negates the benefits that fluoride provides to our teeth, but I've also heard everything in between; from there's no problem with it, to rinse with as little water as possible, to mix water with toothpaste and rinse with it.</p>

<p>Example from <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/08/how-to-brush-your-teeth"">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/08/how-to-brush-your-teeth</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, should you rinse your mouth out with water when you have finished brushing or leave some toothpaste in your mouth? ""For children, I would say wash out, because if they still have adult teeth that have yet to come through, they may end up with too much fluoride in their body, which can damage their teeth. For adults, it's good to leave a film, but in moderation – you don't want a mouthful of toothpaste. I have a semi-rinse: I put a tiny bit of water in my mouth to brush away the toothpaste on my tongue.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I know this this is not common practice, but it is actually quite important! Fluoride, one of the active ingredients in toothpaste, doesn't spend much time in contact when your teeth when you are brushing. Thus, it is crucial to let it work after you have already brushed your teeth. According to dentist Dr. Phil Stemmer, from The Fresh Breath Centre in London, ""Rinsing washes away the protective flouride coating left by the toothpaste, which would otherwise add hours of protection."" If you are thirsty drink a glass of water before brushing your teeth!</p>

<p>In contrast, this article quotes <a href=""http://www.oralanswers.com/rinse-after-brushing"">http://www.oralanswers.com/rinse-after-brushing</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Previous studies have indicated that rinsing the mouth with a beaker of water after toothbrushing may compromise the caries reducing effect of fluoride toothpaste. It is concluded that post-brushing rinsing with water, under the conditions of this study, does not significantly affect the caries reducing effect of a fluoride toothpaste.</p>

"Boiling vegetables for an hour and retention of their nutrients","<p>I boil broccoli, eggplants, courgette/zucchini and okra for an hour on high heat before eating them, because I prefer them totally soft so that I don't have to chew them (for personal reasons, irrelevant here).

"Is Jicama root safe to eat every day?","<p>Is 4-6oz of Jicama root safe to eat every day?</p>

<p>According to the following website, Jicama root contains a fat-soluble organic toxin that is linked to the development of Parkinson's disease.  It then seems to contradict itself a little by saying peeled roots are safe for human consumption.</p>

<p>I think their point is that peeled roots contain much less of the toxin, but given that the toxin is <strong>fat-soluble</strong>, it seems that build-up could occur if a person eats enough of it regularly.  The question is: <em>How much is too much?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Safety profile</strong></p>
  
  <p>Jicama plant contains significant levels of fat-soluble organic toxin, rotenone. This toxin is concentrated especially in the leaf tops, stems and seed pods but at much lower concentrations in the roots. Several studies found that it linked to the development of Parkinson's disease. However, peeled roots are safe for human consumption, including in children. Rotenone works at cellular level inhibiting several metabolic enzymes like NADH dehydrogenase in the mitochondria. Outside, it used as environmentally safe broad-spectrum insecticide, piscicide (to poison fish), and pesticide.</p>

"Can a Solid Bone-Like bone ""extension"" be used?","<p>I've always wondered if instead of the silicon-based implants for some parts of the body, particularly the chin, could be substituted with a solid piece of material, maybe plastic or even titanium or harder metals, to create sort of a bone extension. I've no actual example of this exact idea working, but there are quite similar cases.</p>

<p>What I mean by Bone-extension, is that it would be used on people with functional bones but underdeveloped ones, such as missing-chin, weak bones and things like that, and would not serve the functionality of a prosthesis, as the prosthesis replaces the missing bones, while these ""implants"" would only add up to the bone preexisting structure. 
That would be something 3D printed based on the needs of the patient. </p>

<p>For example, this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrASOLP4Fg8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrASOLP4Fg8</a>
in which surgeons created the <em>missing</em> bone due to HMF, or <code>Hemifacial Microsomia</code> (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemifacial_microsomia"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemifacial_microsomia</a>) which leads to an underdeveloped part of the mandible (If I understand correctly). And to solve that, a titanium prosthesis was created to fit exactly the needs of the patient. </p>

<p>What I'm talking about is quite similar to the one shown in the video, but the purpose as stated below is not to replace a bone, but to enhance a pre-existing one. The material could be titanium like in the video or a more elastic one that wouldn't create many problems in case of a fall, for example (in which case it would absorb part of the impact and not deliver it completely on the fragile bone above) or in the case the ""prosthesis"" is fixed during a time in which the patient can grow. </p>

<p>To better explain what I mean I created this drawing, sorry if it's a bit creepy and unprofessional but I do not have a graphics tablet to draw on, so I had to adapt :'). I hope it is clear what is the purpose. If it doesn't or it's too ugly, comment it and I'll try to make a better one. 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V4oYZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V4oYZ.jpg"" alt=""bad self-made image to better explain the concept.""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the Red silhouette represents sort of a ""weak chin"". (to be clear and honest, I don't exactly know if it is exactly the skull-level cause of the weak chin. And I'm not completely sure it's the right term for it.) and the Blue one should represent an underdeveloped mandible. I tried googling weak chin skull but found no representation so I tried guessing it by the exterior appearance. As you can see (or at least I hope) the black part represents the ""prosthesis"", which would have the shape of the 3D labeled draw (sorry again for the ugliness), so quite like a denture? (sorta).</p>

<p>Anyway, I couldn't find much more from trustable and reliable sources, but it's to say that English isn't my main language, so maybe I'm not using the right word. I tried searching for ""3D printed chin implant"" as 3D printing is the technique I think would be the best to use. Or I also tried with ""titanium chin implant"" but I found not that big of an amount of articles or sources.</p>

<p>So, does anyone know if it's actually possible, and if it is, has it already been done or is it currently available?</p>

<p>If there is something unclear in my explainings, feel free to comment and I'll edit the question to fix it! Thanks for reading!</p>

"Earlier wake-up times in older people","<p>Many studies led to the conclusion that the internal body clock period (circadian rhythm) is actually closer to 25 hours; that is, the clock was thought to drift toward a 25-hour day unless it is set back an hour each day by exposure to morning light and to external clocks. This situation is blamed for a long list of sleep problems (<a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cromie, 1999</a>).</p>

<p>However, as Cromie (1999) points out, the most accurate measurements found that our internal clocks run on a daily cycle of 24 hours, 11 minutes &plusmn; 16 minutes (<a href=""http://ibo2013.org/webcontent/downloads/references/EES_DailyRhythm_Reference_Charles1999.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Czeisler, et al. 1999</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was both surprising and reassuring that the human clock runs with the same precision as that of other living things,” Czeisler comments. “But we did not expect to find that both young and old people have the same daily period.” (<a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cromie, 1999</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Czeisler, who is also <a href=""http://www.discoverbrigham.org/sleep-medicine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">director of circadian and sleep disorders medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston</a>, said that the reason these measurements were more accurate was because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Other investigators used elaborate procedures to shield subjects from time cues and the outside world. They even coiled copper wire around the rooms in which people were isolated to counteract natural electromagnetic fields. However, these experimenters allowed their subjects to switch on lights when they were awake and turn them off when they wanted to sleep. They didn’t think this would have any effect, but switching on electric lights resets the biological clock. It’s the same as resetting your watch (<a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cromie, 1999</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Have similar studies been conducted since 1999 with a larger test group and were the results the same?  What are the latest ideas to explain the earlier wake-up times of older people?</h2>

<p>This is especially when biological clock lore states that we drift to a later wake-up hour on weekends because we fail to reset the 25-hour cycle each morning as we go to work (<a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/1999/07/human-biological-clock-set-back-an-hour"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cromie, 1999</a>) and Czeisler also pointed out that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re not drifting, we’re pushing ourselves to a later time with our exposure to electric lights from sunset to bedtime. That resets our biological clocks.”</p>
</blockquote>

"What is the most modern strategy for treating middle ear infections in children?","<p>I am trying to wrap my head around the treatment of middle ear infections in children, since my toddler is having a lot of these, and there doesn't seem to be a clear cut solution. </p>

<p><strong>So far I have learned the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There was a time when acute middle ear infection (the type you don't expect will heal on its own) was mostly treated surgically by an incision in the eardrum and optionally tubes in addition.</li>
<li>In more modern times, antibiotics have gained popularity as a first-line treatment and surgery is reserved for cases, where antibiotics fail.</li>
<li>The main worry about middle ear infections, is permanent damage to the ear and hearing loss. However, data seems to suggest, that antibiotics treatment does not appear to statistically reduce this type of complication (I am not sure if this is actually true).</li>
<li>The second most important urgency factor is temporary hearing loss, which may hinder speech development.</li>
<li>Some data seems to suggest, that the ""tubes"" solution, doesn't appear to be very effective.</li>
<li>Antibiotics can be applied intranasally, via a cream or internally. Some doctors prescribe anti-viral nasal drops, while others don't. Some prescribe ear drops, others don't.</li>
<li>Some people believe, that using a ultra-red lamp may help with this condition.</li>
<li>Surgery is not a permanent solution, but only a solution to drain the ear. Future infections may require repeat surgical procedures.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I have visited a bunch of doctors, and have anecdotally observed the following patterns:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Old Scool doctors in economically underdeveloped neighborhoods seem to be quick on the surgery trigger.</li>
<li>Less old school, but in no way very forward thinking doctors seem to rely on internal antibiotics.</li>
<li>Private doctors, or doctors, who are on the ""cutting edge"" are more likely to prescribe an antibiotic cream and or ear/nose drops over internal antibiotics.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in conclusion, the therapy seems to have changed from routine surgery to heavy-handed use of antibiotics, to less heavy-handed use of antibiotics in combination with other remedies.</p>

<p>Since I am not a doctor, I may be completely wrong, and of course, every tool has its purpose, but I am asking about the general trend here.</p>

<p>What is the most current understanding, about how such infections should be tackled by physicians? What is the most ""cutting edge"" idea at the moment?</p>

<p><em>Copying from other question:</em> <hr /></p>

<p>What is the difference between eating a little bit of food at an interval and eating enough to be full at once?</p>

<p>I'm getting the same amount of calories/nutrition** regardless of when I consume it, so who cares? Why not just eat whenever you're hungry to the point of satiety?</p>

<p>Is that an overly-simplistic view?</p>

<p>** I suppose there could be a difference in the percentage of nutrients absorbed. If I get too much of a nutrient, perhaps my body will excrete it, so, in that case, it's better to consume it periodically when your body needs it.</p>

<p>The scenario is being stranded somewhere not knowing when rescue will come - so generally no activity.</p>

<hr/>

<p>** is the only counter argument I can think of, but then again, if you're hungry, that tells you that your body needs the nutrients, so maybe it's better to just eat now rather than wait.</p>

<p>Conversely, it sounds logical to assume that working on a computer without glasses will not change anything, but instead might ""train"" the ciliary muscle to shape the lens properly again over time.</p>

<p>Is this correct, i.e. is there research which deals with the question of whether one becomes more nearsighted when wearing correcting glasses and focusing on a close object? Does wearing glasses while on the computer accelerate the development of myopia or not?</p>

<p>Can someone provide an authoritative reference for whether and how the amount of bleeding from a wound affects the risk of tetanus? Does flowing blood have any flushing effect at all?

<p>Edit: as noted in the comments, I don't expect an answer to link to a study looking specifically at bleeding and tetanus risk. Just something more authoritative and relevant than what I have so far. It could be something about how good or bad bleeding is at flushing foreign material / antigens (tetanus spores or otherwise) out of a wound. I'm expecting there to be evidence that you can't rely on bleeding to prevent infection, but I'm not entirely sure.</p>

"What are the physiologic indicators of keto-adaptation as it becomes our primary metabolism?","<p>I understand that insulin prevents ketosis and glucagon prompts it. Aside from these antagonistic, pancreatic hormones, ketosis and keto-adaptation seems to emerge and establish itself through other metabolites and hormones that apparently provide fuel and epigenetic signaling... what are these?</p>

<p>I'm trying to understand physiologic indicators of a fully keto-adapted person, i.e. one that thrives on no-to-low carbohydrates (I'm not asking for dietary advice here, merely the evolving effects and adaptations of such sustained keto-adapted diets regardless their macronutrient composition and frequency).</p>

<p>My limited understanding is that the initial and early sequence of ketosis and keto-adaption is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Free fatty acids are mobilized from adipose tissue by glucagon in lieu of blood glucose and the prevalence of insulin (could be as a result of fasting, caloric restriction, intense exercise, whatever), </p></li>
<li><p>Metabolizing ketone bodies first appear by the liver (converting mobilized free fatty acids into acetoacetate) and then, after a period, the liver converts the acetoacetate ketones as a precursor into beta-hyrdoxybutyrate.  </p></li>
<li><p>The body can be observed initially shedding excess acetoacetate ketones through urine in early stages of ketosis (and acetone through respiration after adaptation occurs).</p></li>
<li><p>At some point beta-hydroxybutyrate production becomes sufficient enough to be the primary fuel for the brain, presumably causing a cascading series of epigenetic changes throughout the body, e.g. increased human growth hormone production, autophagy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>At some concurrent point mobilized free-fatty acids replace acetoacetate as fuel for skeletal muscles, which presumably is now conserved to the primary role of beta-hydroxybutyrate precursor.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is this accurate, are there other evolving aspects of metabolite, endocrine or any physiologic changes that are key and/or playing pivotal roles... and what about someone that spends years this way... what's the baseline conditions of sustained and fully evolved keto-adaptation?</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Through spot treatments I have been able to fell every single one of these spots, but only the ones <strong>on</strong> my face. I've been using a spot treatment with benzoyl peroxide in, which has worked really well for me. However, my issue comes here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are spots underneath my skin, I think. The areas where they come through are a bit red.</p>

<p>So, because there is still slightly red skin on my face, and I think this is causing my acne to constantly return. I need to stop this, and end my war once and for all.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Washing my face with a rag and sponge every day, three times a day</p></li>
<li><p>Changing my pillow case every day</p></li>
<li><p>Using a benzoyl peroxide spot treatment</p></li>
<li><p>Minimizing how much I touch my face</p></li>
<li><p>Not interfering with the spots with my fingers, not picking at them, not playing with them. Just letting spot creams eradicate them.</p></li>

"Why do so many people suffer from glossophobia (fear of public speaking)? How to overcome glossophobia?","<p>I heard the surely fake statistic that the number one fear in America is Public Speaking. Yes, second to death. While that may not be an accurate statistic, it demonstrates that degree to which <strong>glossophobia (fear of public speaking</strong>) is feared and dreaded. Some more than others. I know that I am numbered among the ones who have an extreme case of glossophobia. </p>

<p>As an individual born with a hearing impairment and struggling to hear all my life (with the help of my hearing aids) and undergoing speech therapy, I always had social anxiety... so when public speaking is something I need to do... I almost have a panic attack -- except in front of a large audience. </p>

<p>I am presenting my research at huge academic conference in a few weeks, and I'm losing sleep over it even now. I know that whenever I present anything, <strong>I cannot speak clearly (stammering-stuttering)</strong> or articulate my thoughts (I lose my train of thoughts, which perpetuates my fear and anxiety), <strong>I shake and tremble and nervously fidget</strong> as I hold my paper/script (which is distracting to the audience, and often causes me to lose my spot), and I <strong>my mouth becomes excessively dry</strong>... (often there will be a cup of water available at these things, but I'll go right through that), and then I feel like I don't have enough saliva to even speak and I'm worried I won't be able to speak. I also sweat a lot. My heart races. I cannot look up at the audience. It's like a <strong>surge of adrenaline overtakes me.</strong> How do I prevent this from occurring? </p>

"Fever lower limit ( 99.0 °F (37.2 °C) at armpit)... is it universal?","<p>Surprisingly, all professional doctors, school-textbooks and other resources, consider as armpit temperatures:</p>

<p><code>&gt;</code> 99 &deg; F (some-others <code>&gt;</code> 98.6 &amp;deg F) = Fever;<br>
 <code>=</code> 99 &deg; F (Some-others <code>=</code> 98.6 &amp;deg F) = Normal;<br>
 <code>&lt;</code> 99 &deg; F (Some-others  <code>&lt;</code> 98.6 &amp;deg F) = Less than normal. </p>

<p>But this doesn't match with my experience. I feel normal when I'm around 96 &amp;deg F (officially which is less than normal); and 98.6 &deg; F is clearly perceptible as fever to me. (and this is <em>not</em> based upon a single thermometer on single event; it is based upon many).  Similarly; my mother tells 98.6 &deg; F is much more than a low-grade-fever whereas her normal temperature is around or below 96 &deg; F. On the opposite end we have seen peoples (such as my father when was youth) who did not reported any feverish or tired or such at near 100 &deg; F. </p>

<p>So it is quite surprising to me, that 99 &deg; F (or 98.6 &deg; F to some other doctors) is treated-as-definition of lower-end of  <strong>universal</strong> standard. <strong>Is it really universal?</strong> or it is just an 'average' or 'consensus' that doesn't cause serious deviation if used as an overall standard. </p>

<p>P.S. 1:  Wikipedia tells; normal temperature can vary slightly from person to person and by day of time. But I could not find any such mention about fever.</p>

"Any scientific evidence that consumption of the placenta is nutrious for a new mother? Does it prevent postpartum depression?","<p>From what I understand, consumption of the placenta (placentophagy) either via capsule or actual eating, has become more common (although I believe it is still a fringe practice). I know that other mammals have been doing this after giving birth, but is there any scientific evidence that it benefits a human mother? I have read both those that say there are benefits and those that say there is no benefits so I'm confused. </p>

<p>I read that the possible benefits are that the placenta is obviously chalkful of vitamins and hormones that will help the mother to heal both physically and emotionally after giving birth. For instance, it could help prevent postpartum-depression? It contains oxytocin, which helps promote lactation for breastfeeding? It contains prostaglandin, which helps the uterus to revert back as much as possible to its smaller state? </p>

<p>But then I read that there is no evidence that it does either of these, and it's possibly just a placebo effect. That the placenta only benefited the fetus while in the womb. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Methylparaben is widely used as a preservative in women's cosmetics, such as skin creams and deodorants. This compound has been found intact within breast cancer tissues. Some researchers suggest that methylparaben may increase risk of breast cancer, or accelerate the growth of these tumors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but there is no link to any scientific study.</p>

<p>{1} reports:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Methyl paraben is not carcinogenic or mutagenic. It is not teratogenic or embryotoxic and is negative in the uterotrophic assay. The mechanism of cytotoxic action of parabens may be linked to mitochondrial failure dependent on induction of membrane permeability transition accompanied by the mitochondrial depolarization and depletion of cellular ATP through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Parabens are reported to cause contact dermatitis reactions in some individuals on cutaneousl exposure. Parabens have been implicated in numerous cases of contact sensitivity associated with cutaneous exposure; however, the mechanism of this sensitivity is unknown. Sensitization has occurred when medications containing parabens have been applied to damaged or broken skin. Allergic reactions to ingested parabens have been reported, although rigorous evidence of the allergenicity of ingested paraben is lacking.</p>

<p>but the study is 15-year-old.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Ingredients/ucm128042.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">US FDA seems fine with parabens</a> but don't cite any scientific study:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are parabens safe as they’re used in cosmetics? Are they linked to

  <p>FDA scientists continue to review published studies on the safety of
  parabens. At this time, we do not have information showing that
  parabens as they are used in cosmetics have an effect on human health.
  Here are some of the questions we are considering:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>What do published studies show about the possible hazards of parabens, and on the effects of parabens on human health? For example,
  do experimental findings with various parabens also happen in real
  life?</li>
  <li>What are the hazards and risks of not using parabens? If we stop using parabens to protect cosmetics and consumers from harmful
  bacteria, are there safer alternatives for preservatives?</li>
  <li>If there are paraben-related health effects that are scientifically supported and documented, how do these effects relate to the use of
  parabens in cosmetics?</li>
  <li>Do the different kinds of parabens act the same or differently in our bodies?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>FDA will continue to evaluate new data in this area. If we determine
  that a health hazard exists, we will advise the industry and the
  public, and will consider the agency’s legal options under the
  authority of the FD&amp;C Act to protect the health and welfare of
  consumers.</p>

"Why is predicted FVC calculated on height only (and not weight)?","<p>(please forgive me if this is a stupid question, as I have very little medical knowledge)</p>

<p>I've been found to have an unusally low vital capacity (about 65% of the predicted value) so I'm up for a series of tests. Naturally I'm worried.</p>

<p>However, it would seem that most methods for calculating the predicted VC take into account the age, gender and height, but not weight. Given that I have a very tall and slim build, it seems natural that I would have a lower VC if weight is not factored in.</p>

<p>What I mean is that most men that are as tall as me also have a wider ribcage. Many weigh as much as 20 kg more than me without being overweight (and that means they also need more oxygen).</p>

<p>So, is chest width meaningfully related to vital capacity? And if so, why isn't it taken into consideration when calculating predicted VC?</p>

"What causes tendon microinjuries to become painful in the case of a tendinosis?","<p>From <a href=""http://www.tendonpain.org/injury.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.tendonpain.org/injury.shtml</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tendinosis/tendinopathy is a chronic degenerative tendon injury that is usually brought on by repetitive motion. The repetitive motion is often associated with activities in the workplace or with sports. Microinjuries gradually accumulate faster than they can heal until the area eventually becomes painful. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From {1}:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The term “lateral epicondylitis” is a misnomer
  because, pathologically, this condition
  consists of mucoid degeneration
  with a paucity of acute or chronic inflammatory
  cells. The condition is, therefore,
  more appropriately referred to as “tendinosis.”
  It is believed that tendinosis is the
  result of repetitive trauma causing microtearing
  of the tendon. Scar tissue
  forms during the healing process, which is then subjected to further tearing with
  repeat trauma (1,3,7). Eventually, as the
  cycle of injury and repair continues, the
  patient will become symptomatic.</p>

<p>I wonder what causes tendon microinjuries to eventually become painful in the case of a tendinosis. I.e., how comes pain from a tendinopathy often suddenly appears one day even though the microinjuries accumulated over the preceding weeks didn't create any pain at the time.</p>

<p>I am mostly interested in the tendons that attach to the epicondyles of the humerus.</p>

"With orthotics, is there any objective way to know if your feet are being held in the right position?","<p>I've had flat feet for years, but unfortunately, my parents didn't really know that this was an issue until it was pretty much too late to correct it.</p>

<p>Now, as an adult, I've been trying to get back into running again, so I can lose some weight.  Unfortunately, my feet hurt terribly.  I have a Brooks pair of shoes that I know is good.  As well, I've gotten some custom orthotics.</p>

<p>However, the podiatrist I see insists that the orthotics are fine, and that my feet don't need to be pushed anymore into the right position than they already are.  I'm pretty sure he's wrong, but if he's not, I don't want to insist that my inserts be adjusted, only to find out that I was wrong.</p>

"On the mechanics of chickenpox immunity for newborns and breastmilk antibody transfer","<p>According to my healthcare provider, a newborn should not be affected by chicken pox if it has immunity thanks to his mother having had the infection as a child herself - this immunity is apparently womb gained and lasts roughly a year. Let's assume that the infant is also breastfed exclusively - apparently, this assists the immunity because the mother's milk contains antibodies the newborn can use for resistance to various infections.</p>

<p>It seems like there is thus a mechanism where antibodies can be acquired from the mother and used by an infant to fight a disease. I'm told that breastfed babies do not get sick as often as formula fed ones, because disease the mother is exposed to causes antibodies to pass from the mother to the baby in the breast milk. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>is it true? I've only received this information anecdotally from midwives, but has it been subject to scientific scrutiny? Are the mechanisms well understood? (It seems unlikely to me that eating someone else's antibodies helps a person fight disease; why are the antibodies not digested and decomposed?)</p></li>
<li><p>if true, does the newborn develop his own immunity from his own immune system, while it uses the mother's antibodies to fend off the chickenpox? Or does it replace his defence mechanism for a while (e.g the first year of life) to let him grow strong, but he will remain liable to contract illnesses like chickenpox later?</p></li>
<li><p>if I, as an adult who has never had chickenpox myself, were to consume the breastmilk would I also benefit from enhanced resistance to chickenpox or other diseases the producer is exposed to/can generate antibodies for? Or is this antibody transfer mechanism limited to mother and child?</p></li>

"For varicella zoster(chickenpox), when are vaccination / antiviral drugs effective?","<p>The UK does not routinely vaccinate its citizens against chickenpox though the info website of the chief healthcare provider acknowledges that vaccinations are available and there are also circumstances where antiviral drugs may be prescribed</p>

<p>I recently received advice from my doctor that there isn't much point in either vaccinating or prescribing drugs for chickenpox, and the consensus for adults who have never had chickenpox seems to basically be that you take your chances, suffer the infection should it be contracted and serious complications are unlikely though it's more unpleasant to contract as an adult than as a child</p>

<p>I'm thus confused as to why the NHS website would create one impression (steps can be taken for adults with no chickenpox immunity) and the doctor another slightly different impression (steps aren't taken..). While there isn't a direct contradiction, neither source has said when steps are taken, but the doctor implied that steps aren't taken because there is no point.</p>

<p>In what context would it make sense for an adult with no immunity to get vaccinated, or to take antiviral drugs?</p>

<p>I presume that vaccination would only be successful up to the point that said adult is exposed - walk into a party and be greeted by a child with full on chickenpox and it's too late for vaccination.. but what about antivirals? Could that adult go home, and start a course of drugs that would effectively kill any viruses they'd contracted, before developing a full blown infection of their own?</p>

<p>What about the situation where said adult lives with a child who wakes up one morning with a chickenpox rash? Given that the child is apparently contagious a few days before the first spot, is the adult likely too far along the infection timeline themselves for antivirals to have any effect? Is there a point of no return, beyond which AV drugs are ineffective, and for chickenpox this point is  so early that it's usually too late by the time anyone realises?</p>

  <p>There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, <strong>there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a <em>systolic goal</em>, or in those younger than 30 years for a <em>diastolic goal</em>, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg</strong> for those groups based on expert opinion.</p>

"Is my diet affecting my skin?","<p>So I am at my wits end with acne. I've got rid of <strong>all</strong> of the spots (like the physical spots that most people would want to pop) with the help of Lymecycline (a skin antibiotic) that the doctor gave me and a spot gel she gave me, but I still have red, inflamed skin. I change my pillowcase every night on a rotor, I stopped drinking milk, I'm doing <strong>every single thing</strong> I have read online and been told because I am incredibly, incredibly angry now at this.</p>

<p>I don't want to come across as a picky eater, but I really find it quite hard to eat a lot of foods, primarily vegetables like peas and green beans, because I can't stand how they feel in your mouth. I also find the act of eating quite disgusting and I really hate doing it so it's quite hard for me to incorporate new foods into my diet, but I have been trying to incorporate sweet potatoes because apparently they help acne.</p>

<p>This is what I eat:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Breakfast. I always have a bowl of pasta with tuna in. I wanted to be able to have carbohydrates to give me energy, but at the same time, I wanted to fight acne. Tuna apparently is good for acne. </p></li>
<li><p>Lunch. Some days I don't eat lunch because I really just, I just hate eating. But, when I do, I have plain cous cous and nothing else, every single day.</p></li>
<li><p>Tea. I live in England and tend to have those kinds of 'hearty' meals that are common like Sheperds Pie, Cottage Pie, meat, stuff like that. Dumplings. Curry. Those kinds of things. Often in these recipes you include carrots or parsnips but I leave these out because I don't like how they feel in your mouth.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So that's what I'm eating. I have no idea if my diet is what's giving me the inflamed skin so I have turned to Health SE for answers. I told my doctor I stopped drinking milk because it was bad for acne but she said my acne is completely hormonal and I should put milk back in because I used to have a warm glass of milk before I went to bed.</p>

<p>I have taken a picture of the problem so you can see it. Hang on, it's uploading.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlHdv.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/PlHdv.jpg"" alt=""Acne""></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why do I have this red skin?</p></li>
<li><p>What can I do to get rid of it?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I promise I will do whatever I'm told.</p>

"Has the calorie content of soda (in US) increased over the years?","<p>I recall reading, perhaps 25 years ago, one of those counter-intuitive factoids noting that milk had more calories than soda, ounce for ounce (but of course that this was offset by nutritional benefits of milk). I believe this was referring to skim milk, widely quoted (and presumably stable over time) at 90 calories per 8 ounces, or 135 calories per 12 ounces. And I think I remember noticing that it made sense because a 12-ounce can of (regular sweetened) soda was typically labeled as less than this -- the number I picture seeing is 120 calories.</p>

<p>But in recent times I see 12-ounce cans of soda labeled as at least 140 and sometimes 150+ calories, reversing the comparison that I thought used to be made. I am unable to find mention of lower calorie contents in the past or evidence of the factoid I recall (skim milk > soda). I know it is a bit ill-defined because of variation between brands/types of soda.</p>

<p>So: was a typical 12-ounce regular soda (Coke, Pepsi, etc.) 140-150 calories even 25 years ago? Has it increased (which I can imagine might happen gradually over time due to a stealth ""sweetness war"")?

"Meaning of ""potential pharmacogenetic characterisation might also be evaluated so that these syndromes are treated at an earlier age.""","<p>This could be offtopic because this might be just a case of sloppy phrasing and a case of ""asking to guess what the authors really meant"".

<p>Besides the fact that ""characterization"" cannot be ""evaluated"", I can't understand how assessing the pharmacogenetics of sapropterin or some other drug (?) could help treat the syndrome at an earlier age. What exactly do the authors mean? </p>

<p>My guess is that they mean that ""some drug used on the patient could cause this syndrome in some yet unknown way"". I base my guess on this passage from the text (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116226/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">free full text is available</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The metabolic profile reported here is unique to GTPCH deficiency or a defect in the GTP activator protein. While there is no known demonstrated defect in this protein, it would cause similar functional deficiency. Other enzymatic defects in the pterin synthetic pathway present with very different metabolic profiles. It should be noted that little is known about alterations or responses in this pathway with neuroactive metabolic agents. For example, there could be non-specific secondary changes mimicking deficiencies that are not clinically relevant. Alterations in the pathway could be related to a pathophysiologic process or <strong>even pharmacotherapy</strong>.</p>

  <p>Nora Miller was an avid, lifelong runner who had completed five marathons when she strained her Achilles tendon during the summer of 2014. Rather than abandon her regimen, Miller, a 42-year-old exercise physiology researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, pushed through the pain, hoping she could tough it out. But that only further inflamed the tendon, leaving her idle and frustrated with her inability to heal. ""I was desperate to get back to running,"" Miller says. (Try these 5 strategies to boost your spirits and heal faster when you've been sidelined by a fitness injury).</p>
  
  <p>She mentioned her plight to Janis Eells, a colleague in UWM's College of Health Sciences. Eells, a professor of biomedical sciences, suggested that Miller try using a handheld device that would expose her tendon to red light for 90 seconds a day, 3 out of every 4 days. ""I was scheduled to have a painful platelet-rich plasma injection in 12 hours, and I canceled it,"" she says. ""The way Janis described the research and how enthusiastic she was, I thought, Why not give it a try?""</p>
  
  <p>After 2 months of using the device and going to physical therapy, Miller began a walking program that incorporated some jogging. By October, she'd run her sixth marathon, eventually qualifying for the Boston Marathon. ""I don't have pain,"" she says, ""and I'm just as active as I was before the injury."" </p>

<p>For the second filling, the first injection of local anesthesia didn't work at all. After I felt severe pain she did a second injection. This time I noticed some mild effect, but it still hurt severely. A third one didn't help.</p>

<p>We persevered and the filling was (painfully) completed. But I'm curious how common this is? and what are the possible causes? </p>

"Use of injection containing both insulin and glucose","<p>I'm not a medicine person (and not a chemist), and the question is mostly theoretical.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about how and why glucose and insulin are used and hwo they work, and I have several questions:</p>

<p>1) Would insulin and glucose react in a container? </p>

<p>From what I've found, they probably shouldn't, but googling is a bit difficult, as most results are about how they work together inside an organism.</p>

<p>2) Can an injection containing both insulin and glucose be used for rapid energy regain in case of physical exhaustion?</p>

<p>Here's what I found so far:</p>

<p>IV Glucose solution is used in china for energy regain, but actually has same effect as drinking sweet water (can be administered if drinking isn't posible though).</p>

<p>There's been some research of use glucose together with insulin for ketotic cows (looks promising, though there were only 12 cows in the experiment).
<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8436669"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8436669</a></p>

<p>IV Glucose solutions are usually 5 or 10 percent (at least what I found), and it's mostly used for drips, not injections (sorry if I messed with terms, but I hope you'll understand). As far as I understand that's because injecting too much glucose too fast would be bad (lead to hyperglycemia?). This leads to the next question:</p>

<p>3) If glucose is administered together with insulin, could it be done as an injection and with a higher concentration?</p>

<p>I'm sorry if those are newbie questions and anyone who's been to any kind of medical school knows the answer. I've tried googling in different ways, but couldn't find an answer.</p>

<p><strong>UPD:</strong> I am totally NOT going to inject anyone with anything. I'm writing a book and need to know if this could work (after thorough calculations and tests and everything).</p>

<p><strong>UPD 2.</strong> Some details of the story:</p>

<p>There are people who can go berserk (and be stronger, faster, etc than usually). The effect is similar an adrenalin rush, but can last for a while and can be induced and cancelled at will (after some training). Physiologically these berserks are no different from regular people (or at least not in a way detectable by modern medicine). My guess for now is that they just somehow can control (at least partially) existing system of stress response.</p>

<p>This berserk state drains energy a lot (yeah, the description would match worldbuilding.se better, that is why I didn't want to post it here) and it's crucial to restore energy as quickly as possible after. My idea is that you can inject 50% (or maybe even more) glucose solution, but I doubt you could drink it, so volume is much less, which is good. Also, if something didn't go exactly as expected, the berserk might pass out on exiting the berserk state, then drinkable treatment is definitely not an option.</p>

<p>For sure, the treatment is complex and contains other things that need restoring. It might be not glucose+insulin, but I thought it might be an interesting solution, as it allows creating substitute treatment given access to any drug store.</p>

<p>Total misunderstanding of human physiology might also be the case. Then I'm sorry to have bothered you.</p>

"Exercise-Induced Asthma Daily Medication Use Short and Long Term Effects?","<p>I have Exercise-Induced Asthma.</p>

<p>I only feel satisfied when I'm either exhausted or when my muscles won't push any further.
In general I don't like medication, I've always at least tried to have my body cure the disease, and at this point I almost never get sick.
But Asthma is a chronic disease so there's no way around it.
I've been given medication, which I have not been using, despite all the headaches, chest pain, and all around unpleasantness.
But I can't reach my limits, and my thing isn't really building muscle, so I need to be able to train. A lot.
I've decided it'd be best to take medication, otherwise I'm not getting anywhere.</p>

<p>What I want to know is whether there are any long term usage secondary effects.
I know from experience there are short term ones - I feel some chest pain while training and if I use it daily (because I have tried it in the past, when I was diagnosed), whenever I stop using it, I feel the effects of Asthma a hell of a lot more. I did it for a week and when I stopped, I found that the next day I felt breathlessness simply getting out of bed.</p>

"What happens if a regular person is given osteoporosis medication (Bisphosphonates)?","<p>Osteoporosis is a condition in which bones become weak and brittle, and lose mass/strength. So medication for osteoporosis increases bone mass and makes them stronger. </p>

<p>My question is: what happens if a regular person with perfectly fine bones is given osteoporosis medication (Bisphosphonates)? Is their bone density going to increase or is the body going to simply ignore it and pass it out?</p>

<p>(Part of the below has been included into the question from the comments)
Every adult person (normal or sick) has two ongoing processes in their bones - resorption (older bone tissue gets absorbed) and regeneration (new bone tissue gets created and added to bone structure). </p>

<p>Osteoporosis occurs when the rate of resorption is greater than the rate of regeneration - more bone being absorbed than is being created, thus leading to lower bone mass/density. This typically occurs in older patients whose bodies' regenerative capacity is starting to decrease. </p>

<p>Bisphosphonates (osteoporosis medication) are supposed to act by inhibiting the resorption of bone tissue. (If the mechanism is different, please do clarify in the comments or an answer.) Is there any reason this should happen only in a person with an already reduced rate of regeneration (something like the action of a catalyst which depends on the relative ratio of something and not on the absolute number)?. </p>

<p>Or, is the action of a bisphosphonate simply to reduce the rate of resorption (so that the new rate of resorption matches that of the naturally reduced rate of regeneration)? </p>

<p>In case it is the latter, is it not to be expected that the chemical will do the exact same thing (reduce the rate of resorption) in a normal person (whose bone regeneration rate is still the same) as well as a patient? Could this, in a healthy person, lead to the bones becoming more dense/massive than is normal?</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>1 Neosporin®</h1>
  
  <p>Neosporin is a combination of 3 different topical antibiotics-Neomycin
  Sulfate, Polymyxin B and Bacitracin Zinc.  They say you should use it
  on “every cut, every time” and claim that it will heal cuts and
  scrapes in half the time.  There are two reasons why I have banned
  Neosporin from my house.</p>
  
  <p>First, non-infected wounds don’t heal any faster with Neosporin than
  with vaseline, at least not in any credible study that was performed
  by a 3rd party instead of a drug company.  When it comes to simple
  wound healing, washing the wound with soap and water and then keeping
  it covered with Vaseline is king.  Many products claim faster wound
  healing, but there aren’t any randomized controlled trials that show a
  better response than vaseline.  Can you think of an easier study to
  do?</p>
  
  <p>Second, Neomycin sulfate was allergen of the year in 2010.  Bacitracin
  was allergen of the year in 2003.  With repeated usage, about 10% of
  people will develop allergy to either of these topical antibiotics. 
  Using them on open wounds on the legs is particularly prone to cause
  allergy to develop.  When allergies to these antibiotics occur,
  patients develop a poison ivy like reaction on areas where they use
  them (like what you see in the photograph featured in this blog post).
  In addition, some patients with bacitracin allergy have developed
  anaphylactic shock.  Patients with severe neomycin allergies are
  unable to receive some vaccines.</p>
  
  <p>I never use Neosporin and see no reason to ever use it.​</p>

"Why are we being advised to eat large breakfasts and small and early suppers?","<p>The common advice is that people should eat large breakfasts (that are supposed to support energy for the whole day), medium-sized dinners and lunches, and to reduce supper to only a snack and eat it no later than a few hours before going to bed (late or large suppers are accused for causing obesity and reducing sleep quality).</p>

<p>To be honest, I fail to understand this advice. My thinking is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Digestion isn’t instant; early and small suppers will fail to provide energy for the mornings, and the body will only be able to use energy from the breakfast after a few hours, so however large the breakfasts are, following this advice will make you powerless in the mornings (and put you in need to drink a lot of coffee);</li>
<li>For the same reason (that digestion isn’t instant) late and large suppers will not make you fat, but instead will provide you energy for the morning.</li>
<li>As the ancient Romans were saying, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/29e2g8/plenus_venter_non_studet_libenter_and_its_meaning/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">‘plenus venter non studet libenter’</a>. Indeed, being full makes many people, me including, very sleepy. Following this advice would make it necessary to ignore the signs your body sends to you.</li>
<li>Conversely, it is very hard to fall asleep when hungry. And even if I manage to achieve this goal, I often tend to wake up far too early, because my hunger wakes me up.</li>
</ul>

<p>And, most importantly,</p>

<ul>
<li>This advice seems to oppose natural instincts: both little children and animals sleep when full, and wake up and become active later on. Unlike human adults, little children and animals follow their insticts and do what the ‘nature’ or evolution ‘wants’ them to do. Following this advice means that one has to force themselves to do the opposite; it would seem that doctors who advice to eat large breakfasts and small and early suppers want to be ‘wiser’ than the evolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where am I wrong? Why does the advice to eat large breakfasts and small and early suppers advice hold?</p>

<p><sub>Disclaimer: I am actually <em>not</em> advocating here that we should eat large and late suppers and small breakfasts. I understand that in spite of my way of thinking and my feelings <em>it still may be the case that eating small and early suppers and large breakfast is most optimal</em>. It is just that when my thinking leads me to results that may apparently be wrong, I would very much like to see where my error lies.</sub></p>

"Nature vs. Nurture: Is there any truth behind an ethnicity being predisposed to alcoholism? Is it really in my ancestral genes?","<p>My maternal grandfather was 50% Cherokee, and struggled his entire life with alcoholism, and died from the liver damage he had done from the excessive alcohol consumption. His son, my maternal uncle, is also an alcoholic and has had his life completely destroyed from this terrible addiction (ruined two marriages, none of his children will talk to him, lost his job, his home, and many friends, etc). My siblings and I don't have never touched alcohol due to religious reasons, but <strong>can one be predisposed to be an alcoholic?</strong> Looking at my family line, though from my vantage point (because of limited knowledge of my ancestral line), it seems to be from my maternal side... so I was wondering if it's in my <strong>mitochondrial-dna?</strong> </p>

<p>I know that the Native Americans often have a bad reputation in regards to their interaction with alcohol, but I know that there are many, many different reasons (beyond medical) that contributed to that, which... is truly unfortunate. But I don't want to go down that road (History Exchange). However, <strong>I have also heard that there is something in certain Native American genes that predisposes us to becoming alcoholics.... but how true is this statement?</strong> Is it just a racist statement based on history? <strong>How much of it is based on nature and how much is based on nurture?</strong></p>

"Do children with Willam's Syndrome (WS) skip the the phase of ""stranger-anxiety""?","<p>Stranger anxiety is a normal phase in the developmental process of an infant, which reaches its apex, more or less, between 6-12 months in age (though it may certainly linger longer). While as parents,we often get embarrassed when we bring the in-laws, best friends, coworkers, and neighbors around and our children are screaming their heads off out of fear -- the ""stranger-anxiety"" phase is very typical, and assumingly an evolutionary trait that we as humans have kept because of the proverbial ""stranger-danger"" sentiment. </p>

<p>However, <strong>I was wondering if children who have been diagnosed with Willam's Syndrome (WS) skip the ""stranger-anxiety"" phase all together?</strong> Yes, William's Syndrome has a long list of physical and mental abnormalities, but <strong>they are also known for being excessively (abnormally so) friendly and social... so are they developmentally delayed in the sense that they skip the ""stranger-anxiety"" milestone?</strong> OR do they not start becoming more extroverted until they are older?

"Chronic tonsillitis after tonsillectomy","<p>A topic is rather strange right? Tonsillitis is an inflammatory condition of tonsils and there is pretty much nothing after the conventional tonsillectomy. Nevertheless this is what it seems to look like.</p>

<p>The case. My gf, 22, had been suffering from chronic tonsillitis since childhood. Lacune samples always showed presence of Streptococcus Aureus. Antiseptic treatment by a wide range of local antiseptics (including the Chlorophyllipt, and rather uncommon Brilliant Green) in best cases gave temporary relief, in most cases there was no effect. </p>

<p>A year ago she underwent Tonsillectomy without any complications, however the pain remained. Moreover, something similar to tonsillar lacunae started to form where the tonsils used to be (abscess?). </p>

<p>I'm no medic, but considering inefficiency of antiseptics, I strongly suspect an autoimmune reaction. To support this idea, she had Pityriasis rosea in anamnesis a couple of years earlier which had been symptomatically treated with local steroids.</p>

"Claustrophobia in the Pyramids of Giza: Does height play a role in who is more likely to suffer from Claustrophobia?","<p>I'm an archaeologist, but I am not the Indiana Jones type (tall and brawny) -- but rather, a very petite female (4'9"" to be precise). One might say, that I lack the muscle tone and strength to do all the physical labor one would expect from an archaeologist, and they are certainly accurate. But what I lack in physical strength, I make up for in my small stature (and brains -- at least in terms of archaeology). For instance, I am often the only one on the team able to fit and crawl into tiny tomb openings and document the archaeological site lurking underneath the surface, or slide down into a tight pit and document an artifact, or squeeze inside an ancient chamber and able to report back to the rest of the team what I have discovered. Tight spaces have never been an issue for me. </p>

<p>However, on a day-off from excavating in Egypt, myself and a few crew members went to the Pyramids of Giza, of course. We had the opportunity to enter and all of us fared the ""Ascending Passage"" with ease, though my <strong>tallish coworker</strong> started muttering complaints about how tight it was (but no one thought anything of it because it was indeed tight... but we all expected that... and none of us really cared all that much because we were in the FREAKIN' PYRAMIDS). But as we continued to ascend it got dramatically hotter and humid (less ventilation) and although we reached the Grand Gallery, where it's more spacious than the ""Ascending Passage,"" the optical allusion is such that the <strong>walls are closing in on you.</strong> It is here, in the heart of the pyramid, that my coworker must have been feeling a ""<strong>fight or flight"" instinct</strong> because she requested that we return around that instant. She was afraid that she <strong>couldn't breathe</strong>. Though we are archaeologists in the most iconic Wonder of the Ancient World, we are not soulless and we would gladly accompany her out (and just come back in without her afterwards). However, because the ascending passage is so tight... it is systematized in a way that you can't go backwards (there's a huge crowd of people behind you, which I think only increased her fears). We had to go all the way to the top (King's Chamber) and wait for the designated time to then descend and exit the pyramid. There in the King's Chamber, she started <strong>balling</strong> and exhibiting what appeared to be a full-blown <strong>panic attack</strong>. She felt like she was <strong>suffocating</strong>. We all tried to keep her calm, but we didn't know what to do... we were literally trapped in the tomb with her. </p>

<p>Eventually, when we did exit the pyramid, she admitted she suffered from <strong>claustrophobia,</strong> but that she put it aside because she is an Egyptologist and it had been her lifelong dream to enter the pyramid. She was really embarrassed about it. And I kept telling her not to feel embarrassed about it (because to be fair, it was a very humid, dingy, crowded, tight atmosphere -- we were literally <strong>trapped in a tomb</strong>). </p>

<p>I never did ask her the cause of her claustrophobia (I don't even know if she would know), but:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>How common is claustrophobia?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What are the causes?</strong> Naturally, <strong>classical-conditioning</strong> would be one
(having had a bad experience of being trapped in a tight place
before), but <strong>is something in the amygdala transmitting these fears??</strong> </li>

"Proportionate Dwarf, Little Person, or Short-Stature? Adult Female: 4'9""","<p>Today I recently divulged in a previous question that I am a <strong>4'9"" female adult.</strong> I think everyone can agree that I'm certainly short, but <strong>how do you diagnosis ""dwarfism""?</strong> </p>

<p>I was born with <strong>congenital bone fusions</strong> thanks to a <strong>rare bone deformity</strong>, <strong>klippel-feil-syndrome</strong>, and have undergone <strong>15 surgeries</strong> in my lifetime. While I've always been extremely short to my classmates growing-up (it took me a long time to even get on the height chart at the pediatricians), no one ever suggested or gave thought to growth-hormones because it seems my body was short because of all my bone deformities (I'm missing a few vertebrae in my spine and neck, etc) -- also, it was the 90's. Additionally, <strong>my body is proportional</strong> so <em>I don't think anyone has ever seriously considered the fact that I may indeed be a dwarf</em> -- a <strong>proportionate dwarf.</strong> </p>

<p>I have been teased my entire life for my height. For instance, I can't sit in any chair without having my feet dangle, I cannot look in a peep-hole in a door, I cannot take my clothes out of the laundry machine without a step-stool and a long pair of prongs, I am too short to drive go-carts (but can drive a real car), I'm too short to ride a bike -- I can't touch the ground, etc. But these are merely nuisances -- not critical problems -- except when it comes to walking. I simply cannot keep up with anyone even though I'm walking at twice or triple the speed of everyone else (which often wares me out and causes resentment on whoever is with me). </p>

<p>Besides all this, I have come across time and time again that adult females under <strong>4'10""</strong> are considered dwarfs, which I a fall under <strong>(I'm 4'9"")</strong>-- even if barely. </p>

"Pneumothorax first aid","<p>I've heard a questionable advice about open pneumothorax first aid from a school nurse and would like to ask if it is legit. I do see the reasoning behind it but it seems like attempting such thing could go horribly wrong.</p>

<p>When i googled about pneumothorax first aid it just says that you should cover the hole (wound) with something that would not allow air to go through while the injured person has his/her chest compressed (breath out). So that when he/she tries to take a breath in the lung will be open by decreased pressure in the chest instead of sucking air through the hole.</p>

<p>However the advice i've heard was to go a step further and create an improvised valve that would let air out but not inside. This is achieved by placing some material that does not let air go through over the hole but only fixing the top side of it.</p>

<p>So when the pressure inside injured person's chest is lowered this bandage would be pressed onto the hole by the air outside and close it.</p>

<p>But when the air/fluid wants to escape through the hole it would go freely.</p>

<p>And in case of absolute emergency and lack of better options she said we can use a credit card for it (as a flap).</p>

<p>The question is:</p>

<ul>
<li>could it theoretically work?</li>
<li>if it could work at least theoretically, how much better would it be than ordinary airtight bandage?</li>

  <p>What is Percussive Massage?<BR/>
  Percussive massage is a breakthrough treatment for soft tissue pain.  Percussive massage accelerates the growth and repair of tissues by providing concentrated, rapid, short-duration pulses deep into the tissues of the body.  This heavily increases blood flow to the area causing pain relief and an increasing range of motion and function.  Percussive massage also provides a gentle stretch to the muscles and connective tissues improving responsiveness and performance.</p>
  
  <p>What are the Benefits of Percussive Massage?<BR/>
  Percussive massage and muscle stimulation are beneficial in a variety of medical and cosmetic applications, including:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Relaxing of thickened connective tissue and fascia.</li>
  <li>Breaking down of adhesions and internal scar tissue, present after injuries or surgery.</li>

"Did I catch a cold from eating unwashed fruit?","<p>Recently I caught a cold in presumably an amazingly short period of time (~6h). From prior infections I had the experience to have 24 to 48 hours ""left"" being a bit ill, before being forced to stay in bed. Observing my disease I asked myself what went different this time. In general I don't get ill too easy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Morning: got to work as usual feeling reasonably well</li>
<li>12pm: ate some sushi bought from a supermarket</li>
<li>~3 pm: ate a bowl of strawberries - unwashed</li>
<li>6pm: already felt a scratchy throat</li>
<li>9pm: having a Skype call planning some event, starting to have a headache </li>
<li>11pm: falling to bed really exhausted</li>
<li>I did not have contact with
visibly ill people during that day.</li>
</ul>

<p>My theory now is, that the unwashed strawberries carried the pathogen. Here are some thoughts that might support this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since I got hit so fast I'm assuming being exposed to a high number of bacteria.</p></li>
<li><p>The pathogens where possibly passed by an ill harvester.</p></li>
<li><p>Strawberries being sweet, moist and un-chilled seem to be the perfect fertile ground for reproduction.</p></li>
<li><p>The incubation period of colds is usually a lot longer (2-5 days). Does a higher number of bacteria result in a shorter incubation period?</p></li>
<li><p>Washing the strawberries would have helped. The bacteria was just on the surface area, since the vessels of the strawberries of course where not alive anymore.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Am I right with my assumptions or did I miss something? I'd like you to confirm or debunk my theory of getting ill.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

"Coffee for solving sleep problems?","<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/q/16279/6492"">In this post</a> I asked whether Coffee use could cause an increase in adenosine levels as a result of the body’s adjustment to lower adenosine receptor activation. An answer stated that coffee use increases adenosine receptors in the long term. </p>

<p>This got me thinking: If someone has sleep probems, whether due to <em>insomnia</em> or due to <em>stress</em>, could this problem be solved by drinking coffee <em>in the morning</em>?</p>

<p>This would cause adenosine receptor activation to go down in the day, causing reduced drowsiness during the day, and cause a long term increase in receptors, so that when the coffee wears off in the evening, there should be an increase in drowsiness at night. </p>

<p>This combination of increased night-time drowsiness and decreased day-time drowsiness seems to be precisely what people with sleep problems need, and yet sleep professionals always seem to advice against using coffee for people with sleep problems. </p>

<p><strong>Is my hypothesis correct? How does this square with sleep professionals advice against coffee?</strong> </p>

"Is hydrothorax considered as edema?","<p>In _Robbins Basic Pathology 9<sup>th</sup> ed., edema is defined as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[E]dema is an accumulation of interstitial fluid within tissues. Extravascular fluid can also 
  collect in body cavities such as the pleural cavity (hydrothorax), the pericardial cavity (hydropericardium), or the peritoneal cavity (hydroperitoneum, or ascites).</p>

<p>Though hydrothorax is mentioned here in relation to edema, it is not mentioned explicitly whether it is actually a subtype of edema or not. I also looked into multiple sources for edema definition; “accumulation of fluid in the interstitum”; interstitium refers to the tiny spaces between cells which is not the case for hydrothorax since pleural cavity is not interstitium (right?). So is hydrothorax considered as a subtype of edema?</p>

"What procedures do dentists use for cleaning teeth, is there variation, and what is the rationale?","<p>I am curious if there is a standard regimen that a dentist uses for cleaning teeth, how standardized it is, and what is the rationale for that process over say some other. </p>

<p>The process my dentist seems to use is to ask me to swig with peroxyl swish it around for 30 seconds and then spit it out. What's going on with that? </p>

<p>Then he/she tends to scrape up and down <em>between</em> the teeth as an inspection of how much tartar has been built up. Then with a water rinse he scrapes specific areas and uses a cavitron machine/water pick like thing, but I think there two he/she is mostly working in between the surfaces. This tool also has access to the back of the teeth.</p>

<p>Then finally does he apply toothpaste, and again he applies to the the back of the teeth as well as front. The time spent on this phase seems pretty small in contrast to the time with scraping the teeth either with a dental tool or the cavitron.</p>

<p>Is this standard? Any thoughts on why this process or another one?</p>

<p><strong>Notes regarding the accepted answer:</strong> </p>

<p>Although the accepted answer is informative and detailed, it focuses on the ""periodontal"" aspects, which doesn't cover the part at the beginning where the dentists asks me to rinse my mouth, sometimes with water or with some bluish stuff that when I asked was called peroxyl. Nor the part where he/she applies toothpaste. I believe most dentists as part of their routine do something with the swish at the beginning, and toothpaste. Also, dentists periodically take xrays to look for cavities.</p>

<p>The answer is also a little light on the benefit of each of the steps, or why things are done in that order if it matters. One can kind of read between the lines to infer why each step might be useful and why a particular step might be done before another. Part of understanding and improving such process requires a little understanding and introspection of what needs to be done, how each step achieves that, and what are the alternative ways to achieve the various goals.</p>

<p>There can be a bit of fuzziness (if not a lack of critical thought) when it comes to dental processes and explanations. </p>

"Does boiling milk really make the nutrients in it less useful to the body when ingesting it?","<p>Does “denaturing” nutrients in milk by boiling it make them less useful, or actually more useful, as they undergo “denaturation” anyway during digestion?

At the same time, I've also read that because the nutrients in milk (and other foods) undergo ""denaturation"" in our body during digestion anyway, boiling it will not make milk less nutritionally valuable, and will actually help the body to more readily absord the nutrients in it into the bloodstream right after ingestion.

"How hot before someone gets heat exhaustion while running?","<p>I myself have gotten heat exhaustion once but that was while sitting still in a sauna. I knew to get out when I was dizzy. I gently collapsed onto the floor, still conscious. I noticed something odd happened. Well first off I repeatedly blinked slowly which I expected. But also, at first, even lifting my head an inch would make me dizzy. But as time passed, I could lift myself up further until an hour after collapse, I was back to normal.</p>

<p>But I was wondering, if someone is running to exercise and it is hot outside, how hot does it have to be before heat exhaustion sets in and they need to stop running? For me in the sauna, it took a temperature over 120 degrees Fahrenheit to make me dizzy and even then, the amount of time it took was 45 minutes between getting in the sauna and getting dizzy. But I know that exercise would lower the temperature and time needed. I think it would be closer to 100 degrees ambient temperature before it sets in and here is my hypothesis as to why:</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong> </p>

<p>So, assuming the person in question does not have a condition that prevents him/her from sweating and is hydrated and has snacks or has eaten a meal not all that long before he/she started running so that dehydration and hunger aren't a factor here, the sweating and temperature play a role. </p>

<p>Sweating helps initially because it cools the body. But while you are running, you emit heat from your muscles working. Running involves most of the muscles of the body so that is a lot of heat. This heat goes into the cooler air, up to a point.</p>

<p>At some point the ambient temperature right around you will be in equilibrium to the amount of heat from the muscles. This is when the heat will start building up. At this point, sweating isn't sufficient to cool down much, if at all. Once sweating becomes insufficient, it is only time before that person gets dizzy. </p>

<p>If that person gets dizzy and collapses in consciousness, that person has heat exhaustion. Becomes unconscious and body temperature rises, heatstroke. In either case, cooling down and more importantly getting out of the heat is a priority but heat exhaustion is less urgent than heatstroke is.</p>

<p><strong>So am I right about how someone would get heat exhaustion while running and also, am I right that near 100 degrees Fahrenheit would be the air temperature at which this will start happening?</strong></p>

"Elevated glucose right after waking up","<p>After a recent blood test that showed elevated fasting glucose (110mg/dl) and elevated triglycerides (~335mg/Dl), I got myself an Accu-check glucose tester and started regular testing to try to figure out where I'm at in terms of insulin resistance etc.</p>

<p>Several times now I've had a set of results I don't understand. Today for example, I tested my glucose level right after waking up and I got 106mg/dL.  Feeling this was a bit high (my average over the last 7 days is 100) I drank a bit of water (as I hadn't drank any overnight) and re-tested 20mins later. The second test result was 96mg/dL.</p>

<p>Same thing happened three days ago with 108 and 109 after testing twice immediately after waking up, then 97mg/dL 25 mins later (again after having a bit of water as I hadn't drank any during the night).</p>

<p>Which of these results is more relevant/accurate. Is the first one skewed by slight dehydration, or is the second one less relevant because of either the water or the ~20 mins of activity?</p>

<p>For context, I suspect that the elevated glucose and triglycerides stem from both my sedentary lifestyle and daily alcohol use. My diet on the other hand has been quite good and I've generally avoided sugars and high GI carb for almost 10 years now. For the last 10 days I've stopped drinking and am in the gym almost everyday alternating between weight training and ~30 mins on a stationary bike.</p>

<p>Edit 1: As Graham Chiu pointed out, water intake in the morning should not skew my results. Although, I'm unclear whether not drinking enough water on a given night could increase the result the following morning?</p>

<p>The other question is, can there be a ~10+% drop in blood glucose after 20-25 minutes of light activity in the morning? Or should I be chalking this up to coincidence and meter error margins (even though back-to-back results are quite consistent)?</p>

"In a house on fire, do children faint more easily than the adults?","<p>Might sound like a weird question, so here's a bit of context:</p>

<p>The story I'm writing is quite fantasy-driven (i.e. characters can seemingly ""create"" elements like thunder and water out of thin air). However, despite these fantasy elements, a lot of realistic moments occur which are often based in human unpredictability, so it's not like characters don't fear anything because they possess special powers or whatnot. Parts can easily turn into a killing/slaughter scenario <em>a la</em> ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", or even ""Attack on Titan"".</p>

<p>In a certain scene, an entire village was put up in flames. Amidst the confusion created by this, a man saves another fellow man from a house that is completely alit in flames. Upon his rescue, the half-burnt man asks his hero to save his daughter who's still in the house, to which he replies with the question: «How old is your daughter?». The other man is baffled by this response, not understanding where he's coming from, to which he backs up with «If your daughter is around 4 years old, there's nothing I can do».</p>

<p>My explanation is that this character is not risking his life if he knows the person-to-save would most likely die even after being rescued when other (possibly more important) lives are concurrently in danger.
So my question is this: If a house is on fire, are young children more prone to faint since they have a more underdeveloped body system than adults, <strong>or</strong>, due to their size, can they stay safe from smoke and large fires by sticking themselves into corners until their rescue arrives?</p>

"Are transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of any use for a tendinopathy?","<p>I wonder whether <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation"" rel=""nofollow"">transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</a> are of any use for a tendinopathy. I am mostly interested in the epicondyles of the humerus.</p>

<p>A Cochrane Systematic Review (1) in 2008 concluded that evidence was missing. A more recent study (2) seemed to show TENS is useless but is quite inconclusive due to patients' adherence to the treatment. They also pointed to a few other studies, but all seem inconclusive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Comparison with relevant findings from other published work </p>
  
  <p>Two
  previous trials have evaluated TENS in patients with tennis elbow,45
  46 but these trials had different objectives, included small patient
  samples (20 and 12 participants per group, respectively), assessed
  very short term effects (24 hours and five days), and insufficiently
  reported details of the TENS intervention. Our study is the first
  adequately powered primary care study in which evidence based TENS
  treatment protocols were used. Hence, interpretation of our findings
  through direct comparisons with results from these previous trials is
  problematic.</p>
  
  <p>The results of Cochrane reviews are inconsistent in terms of the
  strength of evidence for the efficacy of TENS in musculoskeletal
  conditions, reporting either positive effects or inconclusive
  evidence.47 48 49 These reviews have been criticised for failing to
  give adequate consideration to the fidelity of delivering the TENS
  intervention within individual trials in terms of treatment frequency
  and dose. A meta-analysis of the use of TENS in chronic
  musculoskeletal conditions (38 studies; 1227 participants), which
  explicitly considered methodological rigour and fidelity of TENS
  application, reported highly significant reductions in pain with the
  use of TENS compared with placebo.21 Abundant laboratory studies also
  show identifiable and dose dependent physiological pain reducing
  effects of TENS compared with placebo, although the vast majority of
  these studies reported only very short term effects (1-24 hours).29 30
  31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Despite this support for efficacy of treatment,
  in our pragmatic trial TENS failed to show additional pain relieving
  effects even in the very short term, over and above the effect of
  primary care management alone.</p>

<p>I wonder whether there have been more conclusive studies published since then.</p>

"What happens when a person gets the wind knocked out of them?","<p>I asked <a href=""https://martialarts.stackexchange.com/questions/6396/why-do-boxers-huff-each-time-they-throw-a-punch"">a question on Martial Arts.SE about why many boxers combine each punch they throw with a rapid exhalation</a> (making a pronounced, sharp huffing or hissing sound).  Some of the answers say that one of the reasons for the exhalation is the expectation of being counterpunched, possibly to the body, which makes it desirably to preemptively empty the lungs to reduce the effects of having your wind knocked out.</p>

<p>This simultaneously makes sense and confuses me.  </p>

<p>If you've had the wind knocked out of you (as I have, more than once), you know that it isn't simply a matter of the lungs being emptied - if that were the case, you could simply take another breath and replace the missing air without any fuss.  Instead, having the wind knocked out of you makes it utterly impossible to breathe in for a fairly long time - in my experience, you start to take in a little bit of air after about 30 seconds, and can breathe somewhat normally after a minute or so.  </p>

<p>The reason having your wind knocked out is so panicky and terrifying is because your body seems to turn traitor and refuse to partake in the fresh air surrounding you, and which you so desperately need.  It doesn't seem to be a matter of the lungs merely emptying;  it feels like the diaphragm itself has stopped working.</p>

"Explanation of normal CRP during neutrophilia?","<p>Let us assume we have a patient with this history and let us try to <strong>explain his/her normal CRP values</strong> on the end of this post given the fact of commorbid <strong>high fever</strong> and <strong>neutrophilia</strong>.</p>

<p>The questions to intrigue are here</p>

<ul>
<li>If it is bacterial, how come CRP is not elevated?</li>
<li>If it is viral, how come there is neutrophilia?</li>
<li>If it is autoimmune, how come it is not autoimmune (ruled out by hematology and clinic)?</li>
</ul>

<p>The patient wrote this:</p>

<p>Here are some fact about my fever of unknown origin, the diagnosis is apparently unknown, I am waiting now for some more serology, blood tests, urine cultivation and throat culture results.</p>

<p>The illness had 4 onsets, connected by a ""feeling well"" periods, 3 of them were cured by ATB, the four is being left untreated for diagnostic purposes.</p>

<p><strong>First onset</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>before seeing a doctor:</em></strong></p>

<p>duration: </p>

<ul>
<li>one week</li>

<li>elevated temperature the rest of the week (37.7 Celsius)</li>
<li>violent unproductive cough</li>
<li>conjunctivitis (bloody eyes)</li>
<li>congested nose (not runny, just swelled)</li>
<li>sore throat</li>
</ul>

<p>therapy:</p>

<ul>
<li>rest, hot tea, sore throat and cough off-the-counter medicine</li>
<li>w/o medical attention</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>after seeing a doctor:</em></strong></p>

<p>diagnostics: </p>

<ul>
<li>CRP elevated to 33</li>

</ul>

<p>therapy: </p>

<ul>
<li>clarithromycin 500mg 2 times a day</li>
<li>some otc mucolytics and antitusics (not codeine like)</li>
</ul>

<p>duration: </p>

<ul>
<li>four days</li>
</ul>

<p>symtoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>resolved after 4 days, but on the 7th day on ATB, the sore throat returned</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second onset</strong></p>

<p>duration:</p>

<ul>
<li>three days</li>
</ul>

<p>therapy:</p>

<ul>
<li>azithromycin 500mg for 3 days once a day</li>
</ul>

<p>symtoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>resolved after 3 days</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Third onset</strong></p>

<p>After another 4 days being ok, I went to sauna to strengthen my immunity. The next day...</p>

<p>symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>high fever, used antipyretics when reached 39 Celsius</li>
<li>vomitting (due to fever)</li>
<li>violent unproductive cough</li>
</ul>

<p>diagnostics:</p>

<ul>
<li>referred to pneumologist</li>
<li>CRP elevated to 48</li>
<li>RTG of the lungs and hearth OK</li>
<li>stethoscope, lymph nodes, abdomine ok</li>
<li>the ""pulse oximetry and arterial blood gas test"" showed high pulse</li>
<li>blood: true left shift

<ul>
<li>leukocytes 18 (&lt;10)  </li>
<li>neutrophils 0.856 (&lt;0.7)</li>
<li>lymphocytes 0.091 (>0.2)</li>
<li>neutrophils# 15 (&lt;7)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>therapy:</p>

<ul>
<li>cefurixim (cephalosporines 2nd gen) 500mg twice a day for 2 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>duration:</p>

<ul>
<li>resolved completely in a day or two</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fourth onset</strong></p>

<p>After three weeks feeling healthy and one <strong>alright</strong> blood test (cell count+diff, antigens, CRP and biochemistry), I went into a hot shower after a train trip and ended it with a very short cold shower to strengthen immunity. The next day...</p>

<p>symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>high fever (39 Celsius)</li>
<li>vomiting (due to fever)</li>
<li>mild unproductive cough</li>
</ul>

<p>diagnostics:</p>

<ul>
<li>RTG of the lungs OK</li>
<li>lymphnodes OK</li>
<li>sthetoscope OK</li>
<li>blood: true left shift

<ul>
<li>bilirubin 24 (&lt;21)</li>
<li>ALT 1.04 (&lt;0.83)</li>

<li>sedimentation 1 (>2)</li>
<li><strong>BUT CRP NOT (much) ELEVATED 6.2 (&lt;5)</strong></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, the pneumologist was kind of stunned by these results and referred me to the hemmatology the same day. The test there were pretty much the same, except a bit elevated CRP (~20). Hematologist <strong>ruled out malignity</strong> and referred me to the infections diseases. They ruled out some viruses Eppstein-Barr, HIV, heppatitis and perhaps boreliosis and referred me to USG of abdomen and RTG of sinuses, which were ok.</p>

"How does sleeping chest-side down hurt the spine?","<p>I do not know the correct English term for the position, so I will just refer it to as ""chest-side down"". The following CNN page seem to call it the ""stomach position"", and they say it is the worst position to sleep.</p>

<p>They have listed the shortcomings of that position, but there is no detailed explanation. I do not feel any pain when I sleep chest-side down other than pain on my neck, but this is only because I have to turn my face to one side, and this can be fixed if I buy a special pillow (something used at a massage shop). </p>

<p>Is it really true that it causes back pain? We are mammals and almost all mammals live and sleep chest-side down. Dogs, for example, seem to love to rest their chest and head laid down on the floor. Do we have some special spines that need to be rested chest-side up, unlike other mammals?</p>

<p>And secondly, how does it cause more wrinkles than sleeping chest-side up?</p>

"Is prolonged use of melatonin supplements safe for a 3-year-old?","<p>Background:</p>

<p>I recently adopted a 3-year-old girl.  The first weeks in her new home, bedtimes were understandably difficult.  She had a lot of trouble falling asleep, and resisted going to bed.</p>

<p>My wife and I realized that a lot of this probably had to do with anxiety surrounding the sudden life change (she was given little warning or preparation about her move).  We tried all kinds of bedtime routines to help her calm down and be able to sleep.  Eventually we worked out a system that worked relatively well, and resulted in a minimum of tantrums and resistance.</p>

<p><strong><em>However, she still couldn't fall asleep.</em></strong> She would lie awake literally for hours.  She was calm and mostly non-interactive, but would just lie there staring at the ceiling, or talking softly to her stuffed animals, or playing with her fingers; finding ways to while away the time because she couldn't sleep.  When she finally did fall asleep, she would often wake again during the night, and then would have the same trouble falling asleep again, resulting in a severe lack of sleep.</p>

<p>In consultation with her doctor, we began giving her melatonin about 1/2 hour before we put her into bed.  We started with 1mg, and then, when that didn't seem to be enough, we upped the dose to 2mg (again, as per her doctor).
We have found that it works amazingly well, and gives her the ability to fall asleep quickly and to sleep through the night and feel well-rested in the morning.</p>

<p>We've been doing this for about 2 months now.</p>

<p>There have been a couple of nights where we forgot to give her the melatonin, or just decided to see how she does without it, and it's immediately right back to the hours of non-sleep, so there's little chance that she can sleep well without it, at least in the near future.</p>

<p>In researching melatonin online, it seems that there isn't a lot known about its long-term effects, and some websites warn that using it for children can cause problems for them later in life.</p>

<p>I want my daughter to be able to sleep well, but I also don't want to do anything that may harm her, now or in the future, so I'm a little concerned about continuing to use the melatonin, since it appears she may need it for a while.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Do I need to be concerned about continuing to give her the 2mg of melatonin every night?</em></strong> </p>
  
  <p><strong><em>Are there long-term effects I should be concerned about?</em></strong></p>
  
  <p><strong><em>If it's not recommended, are there alternatives to melatonin that might have a similar effect of helping her to get to sleep and to stay asleep?</em></strong></p>

"How fast is blood replaced in the body?","<p>I'm a writer, and I require some details for my writing. I've included the circumstances for my question below, in case they can help you answer the question. </p>

<p>In my current project, I'm dealing with a disease that slowly replaces the blood cells of the human body with its own infectious replicas. These cells serve the same purpose as red blood cells, with the distinct disadvantage that they keep the body infected. In all other aspects, they are essentially red blood cells. </p>

<p>In addition to this, the disease eventually works its way into the bone marrow, stopping it from manufacturing red blood cells altogether. Instead, the bone marrow is forced to create more of the replicas. </p>

<p>The only way to cure an infected person (that I can see) would be to somehow cure the bone marrow and get it to produce red blood cells again. It is my understanding that blood cells are constantly dying and being reproduced, so repairing the bone marrow would eventually result in the bloodstream being repopulated with red blood cells, and the replicas dying out. </p>

"Tiredness. Needs opinions about the gym","<p>Before going to see a doctor, I would like to get a few opinions here first. I am suffering tiredness since a few months now. Well, to be totally honest here, it usually comes and go and it's been like that for atleast 2-3 years now.
I feel my energy very low and I do not want to do anything. Related or not but a year and a half ago, I was not feeling so well and had a few appointment with a psychologist. I stoped seeing that specialist when the words ""pills to treat depression"" went out of her mouth. Either because the sides effects scared me or I thought that I could fight it myself with exercises.
For a while, I have been into exercise but recently, I have been so tired that I couldn't find the energy to hit the gym.</p>

<p>For example, last night I slept for about 12 hours and this afternoon I couldn't resist taking a 2-3h nap and the wake up was hard. I doubt my sleep cycles are really good. I never seems to have deep sleep.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I find my digesting system extremely slow: If I eat a good breakfast in the morning, I could skip the dinner without any problem. Having that fullness feelings following me all the rest of the day.</p>

<p>So yeah, after reading a lot of articles over the past few days on Internet, I found out that it could be either the depression phase that came back harder this time without the unbearable sadness part.</p>

<p>Some says that people have a hard time digesting carbs, it could explain why my digestive system is slow. It could drains me energy.</p>

<p>Lacks of Iron. I am not a huge fan of red meat. Maybe, once a month? And I don't get supplements.</p>

<p>Should I try to fight the tiredness and hit the gym anyway? If one of the above problem is true. Is it dangerous to drain my energy even more? If in fact I'm fighting a diseases maybe I do need the sleep.</p>

<p>My overall info is 32 y.o in 4 days. 5'5"" at 150 pounds. Muscular built but about 5% body fat over. Programmer with sometimes long workweek (60 h) and sometimes stressful.</p>

"Ice bath cryolipolysis?","<p>I've been hearing advertisements for a new fat reduction treatment called CoolSculpting, in which areas of fat are brought down to below the freezing point of fat but above the freezing point of water, causing the fat to freeze and destroy the fat cells while the non-fat cells remain unaffected.</p>

"Effects of microdosing alcohol on liver performance and the ability to metabolize toxins","<p>Has there been any research on microdosing of alcohol? I did a cursory search but it didn't yield any viable information.</p>

<p>Putting regular stress on various parts of the human body and its systems seems to have an overall strengthening effect. Working out builds stronger muscle, microdosing poison gets you some immunity to poison, bone microfractures lead to denser and stronger bone and so on, gradually and continuously working out various parts and systems of the body appears to have a beneficial effect on their performance.</p>

<p>So what would be the effect of subjecting the organism to continuous alcohol microdosing? And I don't mean ""drink a little once a day"" but adding a minuscule amount of alcohol to water and other consumed liquids, dosed according to the liver's performance so that the alcohol level doesn't exceed the legal limits you can drive a vehicle with, perhaps even significantly lower than that.</p>

<p>If poison microdosing builds up immunity to poison, and I am only assuming that it is being metabolized by the liver and thus improves its ability to metabolize poison, wouldn't alcohol microdosing too make up for a stronger liver?</p>

<p>I've also read about studies which show conflicting results, while some appear do indicate there are some benefits to drinking a little alcohol (but not microdosing), others claim that drinking any amount of alcohol is detrimental to the health, but again, that means drinking recreationally, not microdosing.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Now that the question gets input, it mandates a clarification be made, that I am specifically interested in liver performance and ability to metabolize toxins, in case it wasn't clean enough. And to clarify the need for this clarification:</p>

<p>There is a problem with mortality rates, due to the extremely uneven distribution of causes of death. When the bulk of deaths are not liver function related, it just doesn't seem like an indicative metric. Not that liver function related deaths are necessarily indicative. Just that mortality rate is a rather rough metric, and when less than 2% of deaths seem to be liver function related, and liver failure related deaths not really being indicative of the effects on ""strengthening"" the function of <em>healthy liver</em>, mortality rates don't really answer a question on ""effects of micro-dosing alcohol"", but a rather specific yet deprived of specific information question on ""effects on microdosing alcohol on mortality rates"".</p>

<p>It seems to me that such a metric would completely stifle say a 10% improvement of metabolism of toxins if the bulk of the test subjects die of unrelated conditions or even already deteriorated liver function, and that is such a case, mortality rates are about as indicative as the effects of microdosing alcohol on the chance of getting struck by lightning.</p>

<p>Maybe there are more isolated and focused studies that have tested liver samples from test subjects, or a study involving the introduction of toxins to the body and measuring the speed and efficiency at which they are being handled?</p>

"Why do we sleep more in certain countries than in others?","<p>I moved to Canada 6 months ago and as soon as I got here I noticed that my sleeping habits had changed dramatically. Indeed, I sleep much more than I used to. I've always been insomniac and so I used to get around 6 to 7 hours of sleep per night, but now I get at least 8 to 9 hours. However, I always feel tired whereas I used to not feel tired at all on a 6-hour sleep. 
I thought it may not have any connection with me moving abroad but at least 5 friends of mine who also recently moved from France to Canada told me they experience the exact same thing. They all reported sleeping at least 1 to 2 hours more per night since they got here. </p>

<p>So I was wondering, why is it that we sleep more in certain countries than in others? I don't believe it has anything to do with language since we all have been attending international schools where we would hear and speak more than just 2 languages daily. Any other plausible explanation ? </p>

"X is related posteriorly to Y","<p>I asked this question in the English language section but was advised to repost this question in this section instead.</p>

<p>So, if ""X is posterior to Y"" means ""X is behind Y"".</p>

<p>Then, if the statement is ""X is related posteriorly to Y"", does it mean:</p>

<p>""X is behind Y"" or</p>

<p>""Y is behind X""?</p>

<p>As for ""Posteriorly, X is related to Y"", does it mean:</p>

<p>""X is behind Y"" or</p>

<p>""Y is behind X""?</p>

<p>These sentences were written as such in several anatomy textbooks.</p>

<p>Eg 1 ""The iliopsoas is related anteriorly to the fascia lata and the femoral artery, and posteriorly to the capsule of the hip joint.""</p>

<p>Eg 2 ""Sigmoid and rectum are related anteriorly to the bladder.""</p>

<p>Eg 3 ""Medially, this muscle is related to the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae and vessels."" (My interpretation: The muscle is on the outer/lateral side whereas the vertebrae/vessels are on the inner/medial side).</p>

<p>In Eg 1, the usage of ""related anteriorly to"" in this sentence seems to imply that the iliopsoas is in between the fascia lata/femoral artery and the hip joint, whereas, in Eg 2, the sentence seems to mean that the bladder is in front of the sigmoid and rectum.</p>

<p>However, if ""related anteriorly to"" means the same as ""anterior to""/""in front of"", then these sentences would be wrong, wouldn't they? Eg 1 would instead mean the iliopsoas is in front of the fascia lata/femoral artery but behind the hip joint. Eg 2 would instead mean sigmoid/rectum are in front of the bladder.</p>

"Nasal congestion or fever as a mechanism to combat infection","<p>As far as I know, nasal congestion and fever are generally regarded as symptoms of many illnesses (e.g. flu), not as mechanisms that the body uses to fight an infection. Nonetheless, a lot of people still seem to abide by the rule that you should ""tough it out"" and not take medicine to reduce these symptoms. Some people seem to express the belief that they will actually get through there illness faster if they suffer through it. </p>

<p>Is there any evidence to support that belief? It seems to me that such an argument would only be valid if one could show that the body is actually using the fever or nasal congestion to eradicate the infection. I could imagine that there might be instances like the following: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>a certain type of microbe dies at a few degrees above body temperature, or the higher temperature significantly slows down reproduction</p></li>
<li><p>nasal congestion restricts the ability of the microbe to get to XYZ in the body, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the infection. </p></li>

"When leaded gasoline was prevalent why did more people not show acute lead poisoning?","<p>My understanding is that, for example, there are places where the surface soil was 5% lead (like on the sides of busy roads) so the amount of lead was significant.</p>

<p>So why did children in particular not develop signs like blue lines in their gums? And why was leaded paint considered (I think) a greater danger than leaded gasoline?</p>

<p>EDIT: One thought is, blue line in gums as I now understand it is not from systemic lead poisoning but from the action of bacteria on lead in the mouth. So eating lead paint or drinking from lead-glazed cups can cause this symptom; breathing fine particulate lead would not. (But eating contaminated soil might cause it.)</p>

<p>However, there are other acute lead poisoning symptoms that could have been seen. I don't know, maybe they were and were attributed to paint when in fact they came from gasoline or a combination of the two. There was also lead in newsprint (colored and kids who used Silly Putty to capture funny pages images and subsequently chewed on the Putty could have gotten lead exposure that way) -- let's face it, there was a lot of lead around and the powerful fossil fuel industry as well as the equally powerful car manufacturing industry plus the makers of the gasoline additive definitely fought for tetra-ethyl lead and would have argued that acute lead poisoning cases came from other kinds of exposure than car exhaust.</p>

<p>Immediately following the delivery, there is no cry. Baby is either taking shallow breaths or is reflexive breathing - otherwise needing assistance. </p>

<p>With no ventilation equipment (such as a bulb syringe or nasal/throat aspirator available) at hand, the father gives the child one or two small ""rescue breaths"" by means of pushing the air already in his cheeks into the mouth and nose of the child struggling to breathe.</p>

<p>What is the <strong><em>MOST REALISTIC OR COMMON</em></strong> reaction that the newborn would exhibit after receiving successful rescue breaths? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Does drug toxicity/overdose or even drug side effect due to action at cell surface receptor come under this category? (for instance in belladonna/atropine poisoning, the toxin/drug acts at muscarinic receptors in various organs). Logic tells that action at a cell receptor affects obviously chemical reactions inside a cell. And so drug/food poisoning are acquired metabolic diseases. But I need second opinion. </p></li>
<li><p>Is Toxin disease due to infection (eg: clostridium difficile infection) a metabolic disease?</p></li>
<li><p>Is hypoxia a metabolic disease? (as in shock)</p></li>
<li><p>Is malignancy/cancer a metabolic disease? (because I know a lot of intracellular metabolic pathways are activated abnormally inside a cancer cell)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>While logic tells me to include these disorders under metabolic disease, we don't commonly refer to them as metabolic diseases. Why is it so?</p>

"Ice vs Massage for swelling","<p>I recently sprained my ankle causing impressive/alarming swelling.  Dispite the swelling it was not significantly painful i.e I could bear weight with out problem and had reasonable movement without pain.  The ""standard"" approach seemed to suggest immediate treatment with ice.  My wife pratices Tranditional Chinese Medicine and suggested that massage would be more effective in place of ice and I ran with that.  With just a few minutes of massage the swelling reduced DRAMATICALLY - from really bloated alarmingly swollen to just swollen. I have never seen a reduction in swelling of this magnitude with ice.  The injury took a long time to heal completely but was not a massive discomfort.  </p>

<p>Overall, 7T MRI show some promising results, but I couldn't find any study focusing on tendinopathies:</p>

<p>(1) seems to say that 7T MRI have some interesting potentials, but the study is quite old (2011) and focuses on the brain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This review illustrates current applications and possible future directions of 7 Tesla (7 T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the field of brain MRI, in clinical studies as well as clinical practice. With its higher signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) compared to lower field strengths, high resolution, contrast-rich images can be obtained of diverse pathologies, like multiple sclerosis (MS), brain tumours, aging-related changes and cerebrovascular diseases. In some of these diseases, additional pathophysiological information can be gained compared to lower field strengths. Because of clear depiction of small anatomical details, and higher lesion conspicuousness, earlier diagnosis and start of treatment of brain diseases may become possible. Furthermore, additional insight into the pathogenesis of brain diseases obtained with 7 T MRI could be the basis for new treatment developments. However, imaging at high field comes with several limitations, like inhomogeneous transmit fields, a higher specific absorption rate (SAR) and, currently, extensive contraindications for patient scanning. Future studies will be aimed at assessing the advantages and disadvantages of 7 T MRI over lower field strengths in light of clinical applications, specifically the additional diagnostic and prognostic value of 7 T MRI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sweet spot of 7T likely will fall in the few gaps left by its 1.5T and 3T siblings. For example, surgical planning for temporal lobe epilepsy seems to be an unmet need. “Current clinical imaging, 1.5T and 3T MRI, is pretty good at finding the most common pathology for temporal lobe epilepsy in a general way, but not at showing the exact extent of pathology,” says Thomas R.

  <p>An ultra-high-field 7-tesla MRI scanner capable of detecting subtle abnormalities that are not detectable by conventional MRI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As is evidenced by the images presented
  here, unique information relevant to
  various disease processes is currently
  available at 7T. There has been some
  hesitation in the past about clinical use
  of 7T, given concerns about whether
  traditional clinical information remained
  available despite changes in contrast,
  signal inhomogeneity, SAR limitations,
  etc. Here we demonstrate for a neuroimaging
  protocol that, with appropriate RF
  coils, pulse sequence modifications, and
  imaging protocol optimizations, 7T scanners
  may be used without losing most
  of the key clinical information content
  present in traditional imaging protocols
  at lower field strengths. This means that
  unique information of new clinical value
  may now be accessed without sacrificing
  routine clinical information. After a
  period of exploratory development, a
  portfolio of robust commercially-avalaible coils is now available for 7T use.
  Availability of self-shielded 7T scanner
  designs should facilitate incorporation
  into hospital settings, and ongoing work
  on 7T body imaging should continue
  to expand the list of indications for 7T
  imaging.<br><br>
  In summary, the tool of 7T MRI has been
  carefully tuned over the past several
  years. And increasingly, when we are
  asked the question ‘When will 7 Tesla
  scanners be ready for clinical use?’ we
  may finally respond: ‘Bring on the
  patients!’</p>

<p>(3) is also quite old (2007):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High-field (3T) and ultra-high-field (UHF, 7T and above) systems are increasingly being used to explore potential musculoskeletal applications because they provide a high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), potentially higher resolution (spatial and temporal), and improved contrast. However, imaging at 7T and above presents certain challenges, such as homogeneous radiofrequency (RF) coil design, increased chemical shift artifacts, susceptibility artifacts, RF energy deposition, and changes in relaxation times compared to more typical clinical scanners (1.5 and 3T). Despite these issues, MRI at 7T likely will provide some excellent opportunities for high-resolution morphologic imaging and forays into functional imaging of musculoskeletal systems. In this review we address some of these issues and also demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring high-resolution in vivo images of the musculoskeletal system in healthy human volunteers at 7.0T. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2007.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(4) does mention the usefulness of high teslas for tendon analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MRI of tendons and ligaments benefits from high spatial resolution. Stronger magnetic fields lead to higher signal-to-noise ratios and improvements in image resolution; f<strong>or this reason, 3-T MRI may be more sensitive than 1.5 T for detection of partial thickness tears</strong> [26]. Alternatively, higher resolution may be achieved by using a local surface coil [27]. Imaging with shorter echo times improves sensitivity to tendon changes, although this may come at the expense of specificity [28,29]. T2 weighted images are helpful for identifying fluid signal in tendon or ligament tears (Figure 5) as well as for demonstrating changes in the surrounding tissues [30]. If the orientation of a tendon changes over its course, magic angle effects may be problematic; it may therefore be helpful to acquire images with a sufficiently long echo time to avoid these artefacts.</p>

"Suboccipital Muscle Strain Migraine Solutions","<p>I frequently lay on my stomach in bed to watch my TV. Because of this, my head is usually held ""backwards"". Lately this has been causing pounding, migraine-like tension headaches stemming from serious neck muscle pain. I'm looking for two solutions:
1.) Is there a quick way to relieve this? I'm trying 3-4x200mg ibuprofen and hot compresses from a microwaveable heat pack filled with some kind of straw. I also just tried adding a 200mg caffeine pill as well, as I read that can quicken the effects of the ibuprofen.</p>

<p>2.) Can anyone with working knowledge of the musculoskeletal system suggest a less physically demanding way to handle this activity?

<p>My question is how can this conclusion be empirically deduced from the observation that many HS sufferers are overweight?

"Digestion and absorption of large scale protein structures","<p>In school we learned that all ingested <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion#Protein_digestion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">proteins are digested</a> via denaturation and breaking up the larger macro-structure into peptides and amino-acids so small that they can be absorbed and which are then re-used by the body for what ever it needs these basic building blocks. This is supposedly the fate of all larger protein blocks and necessary as only small peptides and amino-acids can enter the blood stream.</p>

<p>While this may be the normal case for normal protein digestion, this model may turn out to be too generalised. For example, if we look at certain prion-diseases it seems possible that the causative agent for these diseases are <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006229"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">infectious proteins</a>. </p>

  <p>Scrapie modes of transmission have been debated for many years. Although experimental transmission can take several forms, the natural transmission of scrapie horizontally between individuals occurs through direct contact between animals and through contact with environmental contamination (reviewed in Schneider et al., 2008). Scrapie is predominantly acquired through the oral route, and the placenta and amniotic fluid are the most common sources of oral infection, although fetal parts, feces, and milk have all shown infectivity (see Schneider et al., 2008).<br>

"Severe asthma and autoimmune skin reactions with no relief","<p>I have lived almost my entire life in Ross County, Ohio, <a href=""http://scorecard.goodguide.com/env-releases/hap/county.tcl?fips_county_code=39141#rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">which is quite polluted</a>. I remember smelling the <a href=""http://scorecard.goodguide.com/env-releases/facility.tcl?tri_id=45601MDCRP401SP#maps"" rel=""nofollow"">paper mill</a> when I was young, I don't even smell it anymore, but people comment about it when they are in Chillicothe. Much of my childhood involved using wood stoves or kerosene heating in the winter. I remember the year 2000 when my father had plastic wrap up instead of a wall and used kerosene for heating. When I was young, I was never able to run like everyone else, and my breathing bothered me from time to time. By the time I was in high school I no longer participated in any sports. But it wasn't until a few years ago, when I joined the Army, that I was diagnosed with asthma. It meant I could never meet the physical requirements and I was sent home from basic half way through, since the inhaler didn't help enough. But since then, it seems to be getting even worse. Two years ago we partially heated the house with a clothes drier, since it was very cold and the heater wasn't working at low temperatures, and I ended up in the emergency room a few times for my breathing difficulties, I could hardly stand at times. The doctor believed the clothes drier caused it because of the extra particulate matter. </p>

<p>Last year I moved to Warsaw, Poland, to attend a university (it is far, far cheaper and the cost of living is extremely low, so I was able to afford it), but my breathing got so bad I had to return to the US. While in Poland, a skin issue started to appear. It appeared on my legs, arms, and especially on my hands. I just realized it is only the areas that are generally exposed (below the knees, near the elbow and lower). I saw numerous dermatologists, which proscribed me multiple fungal creams, antibiotics, and finally steroids. It seems to get better and worse, but it has never gone away. At its absolute worse, it would randomly bleed, appear red, and itch. The skin remains dry. I now have a powerful steroid (“Halcinonide Cream, USP 0.1%”). I have been using it for 5 or 6 months, off and on (when it gets better and worse), but it never goes completely away. Recently it has covered almost the entire top part of my arms, from a bit above the elbow, to my knuckles, and the front of my legs, from the knees to my ankles. I also have a lot of dandruff now, which I never had before. </p>

<p>I returned to Warsaw for the summer, arriving in early may, and I am about to fly back to the US. With the lower cost of living, and the very low cost of medical care, it actually saved me to come here for the summer. I also met the woman I love here, and we got married this summer, which is the primary reason I came back! I plan to come back in December and have two teeth removed (with airline tickets, it is still cheaper than in the US). In the US, I live with my mother, close to a busy road. In Poland, the road isn't too busy, but pollution is high, and there is a bus terminal along the building, and a lot of buses come and go (which I'm sure releases a lot of DPM).</p>

<p>My wife was recently told that our pet guinea pig likely exacerbates my asthma and caused my skin problem. We got him when it started getting cold (my breathing always gets worse at that time) and this is when my skin problems and breathing began to get worse. I ended up on strong steroid inhalers but it didn't help much. I constantly felt like I was drowning. In the spring, I stopped using the steroid inhaler because it wasn't helping all that much and I was back to my almost normal state. But I hate this normal state. I honestly can't remember the last time I didn't feel like something is stuck in my throat, like peanutbutter that won't go down. Sometimes I can't sleep and I feel tired for days. In the winters, I can hardly walk to my car without feeling like I'm suffocating. I didn't have heat in my car for awhile, which made things even more difficult. </p>

<p>I can't afford to move out of my mom's house. I don't know what else I can do about my breathing and my skin. I thought about buying a HEPA air filter, but they are very expensive, and I don't know how much that can help. I really don't know what more I can do, the doctors I have seen haven't helped much, and it is expensive and takes a lot of time I don't have. What options do I have? What should I try to do to help with my asthma and skin? (I almost never use the ""rescue inhaler"" unless I really <em>really</em> need to, but recently I need it more) Would the HEPA filter help me with this? </p>

<p>I just wish I could sleep and breathe</p>

"Psychosis while using prednisone: how long will it last?","<p>I am 29 years old, male, and for about a year I have been treated with prednisone for an Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemy; I started with 50mg/day; the dose was sistematically reduced (now I am at 5 mg/day), since the anemy got better and since the following things happened.</p>

<p>Already a few days (<em>now</em> I notice: I felt ""normal"" in that period) I was extremely agitated, I had few outburst and then I started to feel very confused, my head was blank and I also developed a maniacal behavoir (mostly of a political kind), but (and this is what really bugs me), when my mind was blank (on the bus, at the groceries store, in the office,..) images of sexual kind appeared in front of me and I <em>had to</em> describe the whole thing loud (I was somehow <strong>forced to do so</strong> by <em>it</em>; I am sorry: it is very difficult to explain, and I am not sure I understand it either). </p>

<p>I consulted a psychiatrist: his opinion is that the psychotic symptoms are a side effect of the prednisone; the hematologist confirmed and reduced the dose. </p>

<p>Now I can almost control <em>it</em>: when my mind goes blank I try to focus really hard on something till that feeling goes away. It doesn't work all the times, especially when I am tired, and it also gives me horrible head-aches. </p>

<p>Confusion, on the other side doesn't seem to get any better: sometimes I fell kind of lost, I barely understand what happens around me and what people are saying. So I wonder: how long will this torture last? If I stop taking the prednisone, will everything be solved?</p>

<p>Neither the psychiastrist, nor the hematologist could answer me (they warned me about the problem of stopping abrouptly the cure with prednisone). </p>

<p>I am worried that the prednisone triggered something that was hidden in my mind, something with which I have to learn to live, and it scares me.</p>

"What does the prevalence of low potassium (hypokalemia) in 21% of hospital patients really tell us and how is it being addressed?","<p>According to the National Institute of Health, <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">more than 1 in 5 hospital patients has hypokalemia (low potassium)</a> and often this is the result of a side effect of heart related medications (ibid.):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Insufficient potassium intakes can increase blood pressure, kidney stone risk, bone turnover, urinary calcium excretion, and salt sensitivity (meaning that changes in sodium intakes affect blood pressure to a greater than normal extent) <a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Potassium-HealthProfessional/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Severe potassium deficiency can cause hypokalemia, (serum potassium level less than about 3.6 mmol/L) [3,7,8]. <strong>Hypokalemia affects up to 21% of hospitalized patients, usually because of the use of diuretics and other medications [30,31], but it is rare among healthy people with normal kidney function</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Mild hypokalemia is characterized by constipation, fatigue, muscle weakness, and malaise [3]. Moderate to severe hypokalemia (serum potassium level less than about 2.5 mmol/L) can cause polyuria (large volume of dilute urine); encephalopathy in patients with kidney disease; glucose intolerance; muscular paralysis; poor respiration; and cardiac arrhythmias, especially in individuals with underlying heart disease [1,3,7]. Severe hypokalemia can be life threatening because of its effects on muscle contraction and, hence, cardiac function [5].</p>
  
  <p>...Hypokalemia is rarely caused by low dietary potassium intake alone, but it can result from diarrhea due to potassium losses in the stool. It can also result from vomiting, which produces metabolic alkalosis, leading to potassium losses in the kidneys. Hypokalemia can also be caused by refeeding syndrome (the metabolic response to initial refeeding after a starvation period) because of potassium’s movement into cells; laxative abuse; diuretic use; eating clay (a type of pica); heavy sweating; or dialysis [3,5,7,32,33]...</p>
  
  <p>Magnesium depletion can contribute to hypokalemia by increasing urinary potassium losses [1,34,35]. It can also increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias by decreasing intracellular potassium concentrations. More than 50% of individuals with clinically significant hypokalemia might have magnesium deficiency [35]. In people with hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, both should be treated concurrently [7]...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what I understand from the article, though, this measurement is somewhat limited in that most of the potassium is stored in the cells of the body, not in the blood (ibid.) and that measurement is rarely taken because of the difficulty. If so then:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>is this percentage really a meaningful indicator of hypokalemia?</p></li>

  <p>Why exactly more pilots have skin cancer is not known (for instance it could be from cosmic radiation, changing circadian rhythms or from, say, spending a lot of time outdoors in the places they fly to). And to complicate matters, no one has done a scientific comparison of instances of skin cancer in frequent fliers versus non-frequent fliers, Dr. Spencer said.</p>

  <p>A 2012 study published in the International Journal of Preventative

"Why do tennis elbow (epicondylitis) mostly affect the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB)?","<p>It has been shown (1, 2) that tennis elbows (epicondylitis) mostly affect the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB). Why does it mostly affect this muscle, and rarely the other muscles attached to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus?</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from (1):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In lateral tennis elbow, the tissue most commonly involved,
  based on the experience of the senior author, is the origin of the <strong>ECRB (100% of the
  time)</strong>, the anterior edge of the <strong>EDC (50% of the time)</strong>, and <strong>occasionally the
  underside of the extensor carpi radialis longus</strong>. Radiographic identification of bony
  exostosis of the lateral epicondyle occurs in 20% of cases, but has no significance
  regarding indications for tendon surgery per se. If, however, the exostosis is
  prominent, or tender to palpation, removal of the exostosis is recommended as
  adjunctive treatment at the time of surgery. In this instance it should be noted that
  the majority of the lateral epicondyle and the origin of the extensor aponeurosis is
  not resected, only the exostosis. 
  <BR/><BR/> […]<BR/><BR/>
  The senior author’s experience with the described surgical techniques now
  exceeds 1300 cases (1000 lateral and 300 medial).</p>

"How long will it take for pink skin after the falling of the scab to return to normal colouration?","<p>About two weeks ago, I had a (minor) accident which thankfully did not result in any major damage to my bones or my joints, but which did leave me with a rather large wound near and below my elbow. It was after 9 days that the dark brown scab covering it fell off, some two days after a liberal dabbing of Soframycin (framycetin sulphate).Though the region looks and also feels infinitely healthier, the skin where the scab once was has turned pink and in some places is even almost reddish. </p>

<p>So I have three questions:</p>

<p>1) Is the pink pigmentation any cause for alarm or is it natural in skin after scabs?</p>

<p>2) Is the colour going to return to normal naturally or I get it treated (if there is a treatment) by a dermatologist?</p>

<p>3) Is there any cream/lotion/other medication that could encourage and/or speed up the process?</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>DR. CONGENI: You want the medical term? It’s called tendinopathy or
  tendinosis. It means now it’s not just tendinitis anymore. If you
  looked under a microscope at your tendon, instead of being a nice
  shock-absorbing tendon tissue, it’s got all this junkie scar tissue as
  the body tries to heal this overload injury.</p>
  
  <p>HORNER: Once you have it, do you always have it?</p>
  
  <p>DR. CONGENI: No. The good news about it is there’s this thing called neovascularization, and what that means is new blood vessels go into the area and repair the tendon. It repairs itself, but it takes a long time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The occurrence of a neovascularisation in the area with
  tendon changes, demonstrated with colour Doppler examination
  simultaneously with ultrasonography, has been
  shown to possibly be correlated with pain in chronic midportion
  Achilles tendinosis[13]. In that study, it was demonstrated
  that passive dorsiflexion of the ankle stopped
  the flow in these vessels (area with neo-vascularisation)
  (Fig. 1a, b)</p>
  
  <p>[…]</p>
  
  <p>In a recent pilot study on patients with chronic midportion
  Achilles tendinosis, sclerosing the area with neovascularisation
  outside the ventral part of the tendon cured
  the pain in the majority of patients [14]. The results of this
  study indicate that the area with neovascularisation (neovessels
  and accompanying nerves) might be the source of
  pain in the chronic stage of this condition</p>
  
  <p>[…]</p>
  
  <p>Four patients (four tendons) did not wanted to participate
  in the follow-up.
  At follow-up after treatment (mean 28 months, range
  3–48), there was a good clinical result (no tendon pain
  during loading) in 36/41 tendons, and a poor result in 5/41
  tendons.
  In 34/36 tendons with a good clinical result of treatment
  there was an ultrasonographically more normal tendon
  structure, and in 32/36 tendons there was no remaining
  neovascularisation (Fig. 2a, b). In 4/36 tendons with a
  good clinical result from treatment a minor neovascularisation
  remained, and in 2/36 tendons there were remaining
  structural abnormalities. In 5/5 tendons with a poor
  clinical result there was a remaining neovascularisation in
  the tendon, and in 2/5 tendons there were remaining structural
  abnormalities.</p>
  
  <p>[…]</p>
  
  <p>The results from the current study indicate that there
  might be something in the eccentric training regimen that
  affects the area with neovascularisation. It is difficult to
  explain exactly how the eccentric exercises have influence
  on the area with neovessels, but using dynamic ultrasound
  and colour Doppler examination we have demonstrated
  that during the heel-drop the flow in the neovessels
  is stopped, whilst in the resting position there is flow
  again (Fig. 1a, b). Theoretically, if the flow is stopped 180
  times/day (the eccentric program consists of 180 repetitions/
  day), this might, directly or indirectly, hurt the neovessels
  and accompanying nerves.</p>

vessel, which results in sclerosis of that vessel):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sclerotherapy involves injecting a chemical into a blood
  vessel, which results in sclerosis of that vessel. Polidocanol
  was used as the sclerosing agent in all of the studies.
  Polidocanol is not FDA-approved although other sclerosing
  agents are. The rationale behind using sclerotherapy in
  tendinopathy is based on the finding that there is a proliferation
  of small blood vessels in areas of tendinopathy.
  Nerve fibers appear to travel in close proximity to these
  areas of neovascularization [24, 95, 97]. It is possible these
  nerve fibers are the pain generators in tendinopathy. In
  theory, injecting a sclerosing agent into the areas of
  neovascularization could not only sclerose the vessels, but
  also may eradicate the pain-generating nerve fibers.</p>
  
  <p><BR/> […]<BR/><BR/>Although polidocanol injections appear to provide
  pain relief, it is unclear what role they may play in
  tendon healing in tendinopathy. Intuitively, one would
  think sclerosing the neovessels of a damaged tendon
  would be detrimental to tendon healing and could possibly
  even cause more damage. Polidocanol injections do
  appear safe, however.</p>

"Formula for true Glycaemic index (GI) with varibles (mixing foods, cooking and portion size)","<p>Nowadays its considered good advice to inform people whom are tempting to lose weight to avoid high Glycaemic index (GI) foods as these cause the Insulin hormone to be produced at greater amounts and stall weight loss, and promote weight gain, which isn't something people want, or need for a healthier life style, unless your attempting to build muscle mass and strength then sometimes these spikes may be desirable at certain times of the day... pretty common knowledge nowadays.</p>

<p>It really sounds straight forward until you dive deeper and start to consider all the variables, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oats rolled have lower GI than Instant Oats </li>
<li>Oats have a lower GI when mixed with milk than water</li>
</ul>

<p>Other variables to be taken into consideration is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fibre, fat and other nutritions can lower GI.</li>
<li>Cooked and processed foods can make the GI higher.</li>
<li>Mixing foods with others foods can either lower or make the GI higher.</li>
<li>Even the size of the portion can effect the GI.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, its clear that GI is very complex and you need to consider all the factors, generally balancing high GI with low GI will offset the total GI, but what isn't clear is how they calculate this all.</p>

<p>Question(s):</p>

<p>Ideally, I'm looking for the formulas to be able to work out the true GI myself, Knowing the stand-alone GI is pretty useless for most people eating proper meals and not snacks.</p>

<ol>
<li>How do you calculate GI when mixing food? for example oats with milk vs water.</li>
<li>How is the GI portion size also calculated? this may already be on the site, please link</li>

"The ""gay bomb"" and medical aphrodisiacs","<p>Former Nobel laureates and other researchers at Harvard awarded the 2007 Ig Nobel Peace Prize to the creators of the ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bomb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gay bomb</a>"" -- a non-lethal military weapon under development intended to induce demoralizing homosexual behavior with aphrodisiacs. The Ig Nobel Peace Prize being a high profile award for a serious scientific development that makes you ""laugh and think"".</p>

<p>It seemed to me that, as ideas are truly a ""dime a dozen"", they must have conducted at least some research indicating promising candidate aphrodisiacs to use as the active ingredient of this weapon (?). However, this seems to conflict with what I know about the state of R&amp;D on medical aphrodisiacs.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, PT-141 is the only substance that has shown any promise in increasing libido, and that's only in the case of women with depressed sexual response. I have only been able to find a few brief scattered references in to copulins / pheromones and androstenone in conjunction with the ""gay bomb"". </p>

<p>Does anyone know either what may have been the candidate aphrodisiacs or if there's any evidence to suggest that copulins and pheromones increase sexual desire in men?</p>

<p>It's just a matter of curiosity. If some pheromone were effective in increasing libido in men then I would've expected to see a huge market for it and perhaps big pharma creating products that combine PDE5 inhibitors like ""Viagra"" with pheromones. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a small free radical that is generated by a family of enzymes called the nitric oxide synthases (NOS). There are 3 isoforms of NOS: endothelial NOS (eNOS), brain or neuronal NOS (bNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS). In experiments performed during the last 20 years, we have shown that NO is induced by all 3 isoforms of NOS after tendon injury and that NOS activity is upregulated in tendinopathy. In normal uninjured tendons, there is very little NOS activity. In injured rat and human tendons, NOS activity was found in healing fibroblasts in a temporal fashion. In animal models, competitive inhibition of NOS resulted in reduced tendon healing, whereas the addition of NO resulted in enhanced tendon healing. In cultured human cells, the addition of NO via chemical means and adenovirus transfection resulted in enhanced collagen synthesis. <strong>We performed 3 randomized, double-blinded clinical trials that demonstrated a significant positive beneficial effect of NO treatment on clinical symptoms and function in patients with Achilles tendinopathy, tennis elbow, and supraspinatus tendonitis. NO was delivered via glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches. We also conducted a 3-year prospective follow-up that demonstrated significant long-term efficacy of GTN patches in treating noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy. In a 5-year prospective comparison treating lateral epicondylitis, we found no additional benefits of GTN vs placebo at 5 years</strong>. The use of a new GTN patch, OrthoDerm, demonstrated no evidence for efficacy in treating chronic lateral epicondylitis.</p>

  <p>Tendinopathy is a broad term encompassing painful conditions occurring in and around tendons in response to overuse. Recent basic science research suggests little or no inflammation is present in these conditions. Thus, traditional treatment modalities aimed at controlling inflammation such as corticosteroid injections and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDS) may not be the most effective options. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the best treatment options for tendinopathy. We evaluated the effectiveness of NSAIDS, corticosteroid injections, exercise-based physical therapy, physical therapy modalities, shock wave therapy, sclerotherapy, nitric oxide patches, surgery, growth factors, and stem cell treatment. NSAIDS and corticosteroids appear to provide pain relief in the short term, but their effectiveness in the long term has not been demonstrated. We identified inconsistent results with shock wave therapy and physical therapy modalities such as ultrasound, iontophoresis and low-level laser therapy. <strong>Current data support the use of eccentric strengthening protocols, sclerotherapy, and nitric oxide patches, but larger, multicenter trials are needed to confirm the early results with these treatments.</strong> Preliminary work with growth factors and stem cells is promising, but further study is required in these fields. Surgery remains the last option due to the morbidity and inconsistent outcomes. The ideal treatment for tendinopathy remains unclear.</p>

"How to schedule bowel movements?","<p>I've had trouble sleeping for nearly 6 years now. I have had this lingering suspicion that maybe my sleep issues might have something to do with digestion but only recently confirmed it by keeping a sleep log. Every day I couldn't sleep, I ended up having a bowel movement within 2 hours. I guess there's some kind of nerve in the intestines that tells the body to wake up when it nears the exit.</p>

<p>I tried eating more fiber but it kind of exacerbated the problem because it increases the frequency of bowel movements, making it more likely that I'll wake up before I've had enough sleep. (Unless I'm doing it wrong? I eat a big bowl of lentils in the morning)</p>

"Does hyperthermia help treating a tendinopathy?","<p>I have read a series of randomized control trials and case studies by the same research group (1,2,3) that seem to indicate that hyperthermia helps treat tendinopathies.

generator with a maximum output power of 100 W). They used a ALBA Hyperthermia System (Restek
SRL, Rome, Italy).</p>

<p>However, I couldn't find RCTs from other research groups confirming or infirming these results. (4) seems to show on tenocytes that were isolated from rabbit Achilles tendon that hyperthermia upregulates tenocyte catabolism and downregulates anabolism:</p>

"Maximizing breathing: one long breath or two short breaths?","<p>As a general rule for physical exertion, continuous, rhythmic, and controlled breathing is essential. This includes short ""sprint"" type bursts of activity as well as long ""endurance"" periods of activity.</p>

<p>When it comes to ensuring or maximizing your oxygen intake, it seems more natural to take one long breath, although many athletes and depictions of athletes (entertainment) often end up using two shorter breaths to constitute a single intake of air.</p>

<p><strong>Which method provides the most efficient/maximum oxygen intake during physical exertion? Is there a better, alternative method?</strong></p>

  <p>Method 1:</p>
  
  <p><em>innnnnnnnnnnn</em> (one long, deep breath in)</p>
  
  <p><em>outttttttttttttt</em> (one long, pushing breath out)</p>
  
  <p>Method 2:</p>
  
  <p><em>innnn innnn</em> (two short, staccato breaths in)</p>
  
  <p><em>outtttt</em> (one short, quick breath out... although could be two, but I find typically one is enough)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note: the two methods seem to be at odds. One long breath feels like more intake, but takes longer and this can be difficult to maintain in some circumstances as exhaustion sets in. Two short breaths feels quicker, tends to encourage a rhythm, and seems to get the job done, but does it really give you as much intake?</em></p>

"What's caused by the chemicals, and what's caused by the smoke","<p>The great many downsides of smoking are certainly well-documented by now (to say the least), but something I've struggled to find an answer to is the following:</p>

<p>When looking at health risks of smoking, what's caused by the substance in question being absorbed and interacting negatively with the body, and what's caused simply by the act of inhaling smoke?</p>

<p>My assumption would be that most of the damage is caused by the inhalation of the smoke itself, especially any damage to the mouth, oesophagus, and lungs, smoke (any kind) simply being dangerously irritating to these parts of the body. Then, damage to the brain and/or other parts of the body are mostly caused by the specific substance being smoked... How much of this assumption is correct?</p>

<p>Perhaps it's misleading to try and separate the smoke from what's causing the smoke at all, as what's creating the smoke dictates how bad it is. However, if that's the case, doesn't that imply that some products for smoking, while still bad, may create smoke which is ""less damaging"" than others?</p>

<p>For ease of answering, feel free to just concentrate on tobacco products (possibly including any additional chemicals added to the final product) if you feel it's necessary to keep your answer from not being too long.</p>

<p><strong>In 1955</strong>, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the <strong>Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP)</strong>, an ambitious plan to eradicate malaria worldwide. The Programme relied heavily on two tools: the drug chloroquine for prevention and treatment of malaria and the chemical DDT for mosquito control. Over the course of the GMEP era, <strong>15 countries and one territory eliminated malaria</strong> (Table 1). A number of other countries succeeded in greatly reducing their malaria burden. But no major success occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and, in many settings, a failure to sustain the Programme resulted in resurgences of malaria. <strong>In 1969, GMEP was discontinued</strong>, but the longer-term objective remained unchanged.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>=== DISCUSSION / QUESTION: ===</em></p>

<p>In the first source, there is mention of the year 1948. The second source only mentions 1955 as the beginning of the GMEP-period. My question is (35 minus 16 = 19), which 19 countries and/or territories became malaria-free during the period 1948-1955, or (what I hypothesize) which one of these sources is wrong?</p>

"STI vs STD vs Sexually Transmitted Virus","<p>I am very confused as in <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/16484"">my answer</a> to <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/q/16483"">Why is HIV singled out from other STIs?</a> I agreed with the OP that HIV is an STI.</p>

<p>I have been led to believe the following definitions:</p>

<h2>STI</h2>

<p>Stands for Sexually Transmitted Infection — <strong>an infection</strong> caused by bacteria or virus which has been transmitted through sexual contact.</p>

<h2>STD</h2>

<p>Stands for Sexually Transmitted Disease — <strong>a disease</strong> caused by the infection of a bacteria or virus transmitted through sexual contact.</p>

<h2>With regard to HIV</h2>

<p>These definitions class HIV as an infection.  This is a fact to me because:</p>

<p>(bold emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over time, HIV can destroy so many of these cells that the body can’t fight off [other] infections and disease. These opportunistic infections or cancers take advantage of a very weak immune system and signal that the person has AIDS, the last stage of <strong>HIV infection</strong> (<a href=""https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/what-are-hiv-and-aids"" rel=""noreferrer"">HIV.gov, 2017</a>)<sup>*<br><br>*&nbsp;Website managed by the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services and supported by the<br><a href=""https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/smaif/overview"" rel=""noreferrer"">Secretary’s Minority AIDS Initiative Fund (SMAIF)</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HIV is a retrovirus, which is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a family of viruses that are grouped together based on how they are structured and how they replicate within a host. Besides human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS, there a two other retroviruses that can cause human illness. One is called human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and the other is called human T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-II) (<a href=""http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/retrovirus/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Minnesota Department of Health, n.d.</a>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is primarily transmitted through sexual intercourse or from mother to child (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075475"" rel=""noreferrer"">Paiva &amp; Casseb, 2014</a>) making HTLV-1 an STI in definitions I have been led to believe, and AIDS is an STD due to the fact that it is caused by HIV infection which <strong>in many circumstances</strong> is transmitted through sexual contact, although HIV can be transmitted through other means (<a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/a/16484"">see my answer</a>).  It cannot be an STI as AIDS is not transmitted.  It is a disease as a result of HIV infection.</p>

<h2>What creates a confusion?</h2>

<p>In the comments to my answer, @Jan stated that HIV is <strong>not</strong> an STI, but just a virus.  To make matters worse, when trying to confirm or deny his responses I have been trying to look up a definitive definition and found that in the key points of <a href=""https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/fact-sheets/26/98/hiv-and-sexually-transmitted-diseases--stds-"" rel=""noreferrer"">this factsheet</a>, it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HIV is an STD. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, and syphilis are examples of other STDs. (<a href=""https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/fact-sheets/26/98/hiv-and-sexually-transmitted-diseases--stds-"" rel=""noreferrer"">National Institutes of Health, n.d.</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So the question is: What is the difference between STIs, STD and ""just a virus transmitted through sexual contact""?</h2>

"Does elevated potassium lead to elevated cortisol?","<p>I came across <a href=""https://www.selfhacked.com/blog/need-know-cortisol-health-effects/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this statement on Selfhacked</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have high cortisol, you will do worse with a high salt diet and you will be potassium deficient in the long term (few people as it is get the RDA). But taking potassium supplements is not simple, because the deficiency is in your cells, not your blood.  Also, <strong>potassium raises cortisol</strong>, which isn’t good if you already have high levels. Cortisol is anti-inflammatory, but it can also cause arthritis by inhibiting collagen formation and also by lowering cell potassium. Cell potassium is always low in rheumatoid arthritis (R). The answer is to reduce stress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried searching for any proof of this, but haven't been able to find. Is this true? Does potassium really raise cortisol? Are there any published research articles confirming this? </p>

<p>Does it follow from this (if true) that a constant overdose of potassium-rich foods may cause a Cushing-like state? This sounds doubtful to me.</p>

"Thumb RCL reconstruction - Abductor Pollicis Brevis vs Palmaris Longus","<p>Tearing the Radial Collateral Ligament in the thumb seems to be way less common than tearing the Ulnar Collateral Ligament in the thumb and so I'm having trouble finding relevant information on Google.</p>

<p>I found the following journals suggesting that the Abductor Pollicis Brevis Tendon can be used for RCL reconstruction:</p>

<p><sup>Iba, Kousuke: <strong><a href=""https://www.jhandsurg.org/article/S0363-5023%2813%2900821-6/abstract?code=yjhsu-site"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reconstruction of Chronic Thumb Metacarpophalangeal Joint Radial Collateral Ligament Injuries With a Half-Slip of the Abductor Pollicis Brevis Tendon</a></strong>; Journal of Hand Surgery</sup></p>

<p>Another options seems to be using the Palmaris Longus for the reconstruction. I haven't been able to find any literature on how this compares to using the APB in terms of success rate, expected recovery time etc. I found a procedure called Camitz Transfer but I gather this is for carpal tunnel rather than ligament injuries of the thumb.</p>

<p>Are both procedures established reconstructions of the RCL? Which is preferable in what cases?</p>

"Why are certain drugs prescribed more often to either males or females?","<p>I have some original data on prescription frequencies of certain common drugs and I have calculated the gender ratio of patients for each. The list below contains Top 15 of the most commonly prescribed drugs in a major Western country.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vero8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vero8.png"" alt=""drug table""></a></p>

<p>I am more of a data analyst than a medic, so the reasons for this are not obvious to me. I have used Google/Wikipedia to find the main reason for the prescription of each drug, but my list is by no means exhaustive and I understand it some cases it can be quite nuanced. Could someone with a medical background shed some more light?</p>

<p>My broad generalisations are that men appear to be more often prescribed blood pressure and cholesterol lowering drugs (with a couple of exceptions).</p>

<p>An asthma treatment and an antidepressant are more often prescribed to women. And obviously a thyroid hormone supplement, which is used during pregnancy, is also prescribed much more to women.</p>

<p>Of the two commonest over-the-counter drugs, why is aspirin is prescribed more often to men and paracetamol to women?</p>

"Vitamin supplements with a balanced diet","<p>It is always said that with a balanced diet, all important vitamins and trace elements are supplied. It is also said that the body only uses the vitamins inside the fruit when its needed. But what would happen if vitamin supplements were added to a fully balanced diet where all vitamins and trace elements are already fully supplied?</p>

<ul>
<li>Would the body only use the vitamins from the supplements?</li>
<li>Would the body use both and overdose?</li>
<li>Would the timing of the supplement intake play a role? (On an empty stomach in the morning or in the evening after dinner)</li>

"Intermittent Fasting: Why is exactly *zero* calories special?","<p>Is there something special about exactly 0 calories vs 1 calorie?</p>

<p>When researching Intermittent Fasting, the ""magic"" seems to come from the body's response to insulin dropping and its response to secrete glucagon, causing glyconeolysis, catabolism, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis - the latter three becomes dominant once the liver runs out of glycogen.</p>

<p>One thing that's mentioned several times by online articles and books (such as The Obesity Code) is that ""reduced calorie"" diets do <em>not</em> cause the same effects. However, they rarely go into what effects specifically they're talking about, or how reduced is ""reduced.""</p>

<p>If you are fasting at 0 calories, does the addition of one calorie somehow cause the glycogen to stop causing the lipolysis, gluconeogenesis, and catabolism? What about 100 calories? 500 calories?</p>

<p>What happens in the transitional region between 0 calories (""fasting"") and 1500 calories (""reduced calories"")? If you're fasting for 16 hours, eat 100 calories, then fast 16 more, how significantly different is that from fasting 32 hours?</p>

<p>Is there a global recommendation about this? Should we eat before taking pain killers, or not? And more importantly, why should we consume painkillers on an empty stomach or vice versa? Many times when in pain, there's also no appetite so it's not trivial task to eat before taking them.</p>

"How much body fluid required to actually transmit a sexually transmitted disease (STD)?","<p>While reading about sexually transmitted disease, I always wonder how much body fluid is actually required to transmit some diseases, specially in the case of other kinds of sex (masturbation, hand job, fingering and genital contact).</p>

<p>For example, this website list chances of getting STDs: <a href=""https://smartsexresource.com/about-stis/know-your-chances-0"" rel=""noreferrer"">Know your chances - Smart Sex Resource</a>.
Specially the <a href=""https://smartsexresource.com/sites/default/files/Other-Sex-Table-v3.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">table about other kinds of sex</a> mentions that you can get gonorrhea and chlamydia from genital to genital contact, with sharing of body fluids. But exactly how much? Is there any literature on that?</p>

<p>I'm thinking in a scenario like: person A is fingering person B. Person B is infected with chlamydia/gonorrhea (easy to transmit). Person A has person's B fluid on his fingers/hands. Person A uses a towel to dry their hands a bit before engaging in ""self"" masturbation. What's the risk of person A getting infected?</p>

<p>I'm asking because anal/vaginal/oral sex without condom poses a clear risk, but sex isn't mechanical. People will kiss, finger and masturbate each other during sex and a tiny bit of fluid may be swapped.</p>

<p>Yet in a British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition Bulletin (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4288313"" rel=""noreferrer"">Spiro &amp; Buttriss, 2014</a>), it is pointed out that there are reports of inadequate vitamin D status in Europe and this may be a problem elsewhere because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the northern hemisphere at latitudes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_parallel_north"" rel=""noreferrer"">greater than around 40°N</a> (north of Madrid, see Table 1), sunlight is not strong enough to trigger synthesis of vitamin D in the skin from October to March.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could say that this can be reflected in the southern hemisphere at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_parallel_south"" rel=""noreferrer"">latitudes South of 40°S</a> in <strong>possibly</strong> the April to September months, due to the seasonal differences North and South of the equator.  The thing with that is that in the Southern hemisphere, it wouldn't affect a great deal of people in  comparison, as 40°S is between the islands of New Zealand and cuts off a small tip of South America.</p>

<p>What I am wondering is, that if Cancer Research UK has adequately proved that you can get enough vitamin D from a few minutes sunlight, has there been definitive evidence to suggest why there is an inadequate vitamin D status in Europe?</p>

"Is there any medical value when a care provider talk to his trauma patient?","<p>Is there any medical value when a care provider talks to a trauma patient to keep the patient conscious?</p>

<p>It's well known that in cases of trauma (in physical medicine) always the paramedic or physician would try to talk to the patient in order to keep him or her conscious. It's known also from movies as the sentence ""Stay with me, man!"" etc.</p>

<p>Is there any medical value to do that? While it doesn't seem to matter to talk someone that lost a lot of blood, if the patient will lose consciousness, they will lose it with or without conversation. The only medical value that I can think about, is just to observe and monitor the patient but not as a tool to keep them conscious. Is that right? </p>

<p>I would like to see any scientific reference that supports the claim that it helps actively to keep the patient conscious, if any. </p>

Some moths and other insects were flying around in the light it was emitting, but unfortunately I didn't think anything about this from a bat's perspective. </p>

I thought at first that it was a giant moth, but it was too fast for a moth, and besides, it flew away immediately.

I had no scratches, no blood, didn't feel any fluid when it hit me, and I washed myself well.</p>

"How do you monitor possible Lyme disease after a treated infection?","<p>A patient was diagnosed (through blood tests) with Lyme Disease after a tick bite and treated with first oral and then intravenous antibiotics, apparently successfully.  The patient saw the physician the day after the rash appeared; diagnosis took about a week.  The date of the bite was not known; the patient never saw the tick.  Treatment started with oral antibiotics but symptoms (joint pain, primarily) remained and the physician followed with a month-long course of IV antibiotics.  I do not know which specific drugs were used.  Total time from first visit to the end of the IV treatment was about five months.</p>

<p>At the time the patient was told by the physician that the blood test for Lyme looks for antibodies, which would ""always be there now"", which is why it was not possible to say with certainty that the disease had been treated.

"Does diffusion MRI (DWI & DTI) measure diffusion or osmosis?","<p>I am trying to understand the physical property which is measured in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

<p>My understanding is that <em>osmosis</em> usually refers to the net movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane from a region of low solute concentration to region of higher solute concentration. </p>

"Is being ""healthy"" an actual, overall provable term? Or is ""healthy"" just a loose assumption?","<p>Say you go to a doctor and they say -- more or less -- that you are ""healthy.""</p>

<p>What does this mean? Under what circumstances does one fall within these supposed confines?</p>

<p>And what would falling under these confines mean in a more deeper outlook? Like if I am ""healthy,"" does that mean I can't be healthier? If I am not healthy enough, could I get healthier then?</p>

<p>Many people vaguely use the term healthiness to define a set of rules that must apply to someone, like if someone is disease free or not overweight or etc. But is this just vague?</p>

<p>A doctor saying you are healthy doesn't mean you are of utmost health, because how would you know each individual's maximum healthiness potential, if it even exists?</p>

<p>I always strive to be as healthy as possible with being on the lookout for new supplements and solutions to any health signs of stresses and such. But what really makes me ponder is how we can confidently dish the term healthy around in an overall manner that isn't particularly individualized.</p>

<p>No two different people are necessarily as equally healthy as one another in all possible respects if they're both meeting a particular set of observable standards or tests/procedures/etc.</p>

<p>So it makes me think that one can envision health as a perpetually tested standard one must always be working to achieve or progress towards. I don't think anyone can be perfectly healthy or the inverse, but how healthy one can become is the big question. Many people have demonstrated massive differences in their feelings/well being from supplementation, homeopathy, herbs, antioxidants and many other potential undertakings not necessarily relating to consumption. I realize you can feel healthy and not be sometimes, but usually feeling really good and strong is a symbol of good health more often than not.</p>

<p>In a sense, does the term ""healthy"" mean that much? Is there always theoretical improvement of our health regardless, because there is no one size fits all or perfect health analysis?</p>

"Why do some people get purple stains on teeth from red wine, and some don’t?","<p>Drinking red wine, some people’s teeth, gums or lips will get a very distinct purple stain, while this does not happen at all for other people.</p>

<p>I have a few guesses as to why:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The smoothness of the outer layer of the teeth varies from person to person, and that leads to more “shadow” or surface for purple color.</p></li>
<li><p>It happens to everybody, but some skin tones provide a sharper contrast to the color.</p></li>
<li><p>It depends on how long the wine touches the lips and teeth:
it would happen to everybody if the same amount of wine stayed in the mouth the same amount of time.</p></li>
<li><p>It actually happens to everybody, but it becomes more visible as some people open their mouths wider when speaking.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>questions</strong> are: Why and on which part of the mouth (lips, gums, teeth) do the stains appear?
Why does it happen more for some than for others?</p>

"Could rectal prolapse and bloody masturbation in 4 year-old happen absent abuse?","<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I'm trying to find out more about some symptoms that could be signs of child sexual abuse - or could be naturally occuring. The case that brings the questions up <strong>has been reported to all proper authorities</strong> (including the police and the states child protective service). I'm not asking what to do in a case of child abuse. I just want more information on the symptoms.</p>

<h2>The question is what are the naturally occurring prevalence rates of these symptoms?</h2>

<p>The physical symptoms are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Frequent masturbation (with full erection)</li>
<li>Masturbation to the point of pain</li>
<li>Bloody penis (foreskin prematurely pulled back)</li>
<li>Rectal prolapse</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Why I'm asking the question:</h2>

<p>All authorities involved (police, child protective services, court appointed child attorney - aka guardian ad litem, and a judge) have determined that the symptoms are not indicative of abuse. This seems crazy to me - but I realize these symptoms (eg. a 4 year old masturbating) may not be as rare as I thought, so I'd like to understand for myself where they're coming from.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Here's what little I've found and estimated:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Frequent masturbation in 4 years old seems to occur less than 5% of male population. See <a href=""https://www.coachella.com/forum/showthread.php?57915-BOYS-ONLY-how-early-did-you-start-masturbating"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7664137"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> (or <a href=""http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A549468&amp;dswid=-2656"" rel=""noreferrer"">full-text</a>). I have no idea how many of that 5% are also related to abuse vs. naturally occurring.</li>
<li>Excessive/Painful masturbation: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7664137"" rel=""noreferrer"">Less than 1%</a>.</li>
<li>Prematurely forcing back foreskin: no idea.</li>
<li>Rectal prolapse: Not sure at his age, but this is supposedly most common in 0-2 years or 65+. Otherwise it appears to be about 2.5/100,000 based on this <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=16259169"" rel=""noreferrer"">study</a>. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Joint probability</strong> Experiencing symptoms (1) and (3) at some point would be 5/100 * 2.5/100,000 = 12.5/10,000,000 - it is likely that fewer than 1 in 1 million children would experience both of these symptoms at some point. Factor in the probability of them happening simultaneously and the odds sky rocket from there. Am I missing something here?</p>

<p>I'd particularly like links to reference-able studies if available. I've had trouble finding reliable sources myself, so the above estimates are based off some surveys and online information I could find.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I've completely reformatted the question to try and keep discussion on topic.</p>

"Can ""face pulling"" or ""bone pulling"" really move/remodel bones in adults?","<p>Face pulling is a technique some people use to try and move their maxillas/cheekbones/etc. more forward. It's basically biting on some object and slowly and steadily pulling with tension forward and upwards for long periods of time. Basically the teeth are like an anchor and are obviously part of the maxilla bone, which is connected to zygoma/etc.</p>

<p>So basically, is there any reason to believe this can work (non-surgically)? That the bones will remodel or something and will actually give the desired results these people seek? I mean they have these reverse pull headgear devices and other stuff for children (dentistry, orthodontics, etc.). Is it theoretically possible this can work in adults too?</p>

<p>Or in other words, can constant, steady, mechanical tension/force make bones adapt/remodel to pressure and give desired results (i.e., more tautness in face/bone projection in, say, people with bone recession or not so ideal bone structure in their faces for various other reasons)? This is related to bone biology. It would be amazing if this could be elaborated on.</p>

<p>Many people suffer from recession/bad facial bone structure and orthodontics are out of a handful of people's budgets. These techniques -- if proven useful -- can dramatically change a person's appearance and confidence + life quality..</p>

"Why are inflammatory arthritides worse at night and in the morning?","<p>In general, inflammatory arthritides tend to be worse at night and in the morning.

<p>What makes the joint symptoms worse at night and in the morning? Is this related to mechanical factors (i.e. inactivity of the involved joints at night) - and if so why would that lead to worsening of symptoms?

"Can Manual External Defibrillators ""restart"" a heart?","<p>On TV it appears that every time a heartbeat monitor flat-lines they pull out the paddles of a manual external defibrillator (MED) and give a few shocks, often explicitly cranking up the output when an initial charge doesn't restore a heartbeat.</p>

<p>My technical understanding of this is that a MED is <em>only</em> indicated when the cause of the heart ""stopping"" is some form of fibrillation or arrhythmia.  Granted, maybe ""off-screen"" is an electrocardiograph the EMT is referencing.  But if not, would an EMT ever use a MED if the only thing he knew was that a person had no pulse?</p>

<p>Or, is it the case that a heart will <em>only</em> stop due to either fibrillation or arrhythmias that a MED can reverse?</p>

<p>What if a subject <em>does</em> have a steady heartbeat: Can a MED <em>stop</em> a beating heart?</p>

<p>I suppose that if a subject has no pulse one might argue that the MED can't <em>hurt</em>.  But is a MED a substitute for CPR?  E.g., if you had a MED and <em>no better information</em> on the patient would you apply both MED shocks <em>and</em> CPR, or what is the current best practice?</p>

<p>Back to TV depictions: They almost always show the subject of MED arching his back for roughly a full second when the charge is applied.  I've never seen a real MED application, but my understanding is the pulse is only supposed to last 12ms.  Also, since it is applied across the chest, the skeletal muscles most prone to contract would presumably be the chest and upper abdominals, which would (if anything) cause the exact opposite contraction, and only for an instant.</p>

"Mechanical cardio resuscitation for asystole","<p><a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/q/5874/843"">We have great machines for shocking a heart out of various malfunctions</a>.</p>

<p>But my understanding is that the only ""machine"" indicated for restarting a heart that has completely stopped (i.e., ""flat-lined"") is manual compression.  I.e., even if you're a patient in a Level 1 trauma center, if you flat-line then all the machines get pushed aside and one person is going to start pushing on your chest above your heart to try to get it started.  (And you might get a does of epinephrine.  Oh, and if you're really ""lucky"" and they have your chest torn open then they'll reach in and compress the heart directly.)  Is this accurate?</p>

<p>If so, isn't this weird?  Pushing on the heart through the rib cage to get it to spontaneously start seems like trying to rescue someone drowning by standing on the shore and poking them with a stick.</p>

<p>We can electrically stimulate every muscle to contract.  I understand that a functional heartbeat requires a <em>coordinated</em> series of contractions.  An electrocardiogram can <em>monitor</em> the sequence of contractions in a functional heartbeat.  Why can't it (or something like it) pump current back through its electrodes to <em>stimulate</em> a perfect heartbeat?</p>

<p>Or, if one could place arbitrary electrodes directly on a heart, could an electronic device force it to beat &ndash; indefinitely &ndash; when it has flat-lined?  Or is there some reason that is not technically or medically feasible?</p>

<li>Am I really allowed to eat as much lentils (for example) as I want, or should I stick to the generally recommended 2300 kcal for my age? Tim hammers on about making sure I eat enough, eating as much as I want, etc. and it sends a confusing message. Should I be counting calories or not? </li>
<li>As one of the common mistake he lists people eating too much almonds, peanuts, etc. But none of these ""domino foods"" are in the list of allowed foods. So I should not be eating them anyway, no!?</li>

"Orthotic inserts + athletes foot","<p>With athletes foot, it's important to keep the feet dry.  However, when wearing sandals, I can't use the ""super feet"" orthotic inserts that keep my feet from developing pain issues when I walk.  </p>

<p>I think this is a temporary need, so I would rather not buy special footwear just for this.  At work, I need to at least slip off my shoes while at my desk, but putting my shoes back on whenever I need to stand up for a meeting to to chat with a coworker seems silly.  </p>

<p>Sandals just aren't cutting it, though.  I have nice, gel-footed sandals, but I am still getting some pain issues in my feet because I am not using the best inserts I know about.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?  For example, is there a way to tie my shoes that would make them super easy to slip on and yet still provide enough support?</p>

<p>One idea I am considering is keeping an alternate pair of shoes at my desk which are tied extremely loosely and slipping them on when I need shoes--but I still feel a bit awkward about it all.</p>

<p>Any other ideas or suggestions?</p>

<p>Tags I can't create/add: podiatry, shoes, othotics, fungal-infections, etc...</p>

"What could be the reason for difference in adverse effects profile between original and generic Clopidogrel?","<p>I was consulted on the following clinical case:</p>

<p>An elderly woman (over 65 years old) on Plavix due to 2 CVAs in the last few years. Six months ago treatment was changed to a generic Clopidogrel product, and during this period she developed diffuse hematomas. With Aspirin she also had hematomas, but not with the original Plavix.
Therefore, her doctor recommended putting her back on Plavix. This, of course, seems like the right thing to do, and I'm not asking about that.</p>

<p>My question is: What could be the reason for developing hematomas on a generic formulation of Clopidogrel and not on the brand formulation?</p>

<p>A few points should be taken into consideration:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a generic drug, the manufacturer obviously proved bioequivalence, so we won't go there.</li>
<li>The dosage with both formulations was the same.</li>
<li>The inactive ingredients are very similar in both formulations. I won't elaborate about them right now, unless you ask for it in the comments.</li>
<li>I found two articles on that topic, without much help:

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1185/03007995.2015.1028912"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This article</a> says that ""The innovator product of clopidogrel (Plavix/Iscover*) is a hydrogen sulfate salt. [...] Following the expiration of the above name-brands’ patent, a number of generic clopidogrel salt formulations were developed and approved for the treatment of CVD patients. [...] it should be stated that even minor differences in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of various generic clopidogrel salts could have serious clinical consequences...""<br>
The active ingredient in Plavix is formally stated as <strong>Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate</strong>, whereas the generic is stated as <strong>Clopidogrel bisulphate</strong>. After some online research I found that these are two names for the same chemical composition. It did leave me with some confusion - are these two descriptions truly identical, or do we have here two different salts?</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233788890_Branded_Versus_Generic_Clopidogrel_in_Cardiovascular_Diseases_A_Systematic_Review"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This article</a> is a systematic review about branded against generic Clopidogrel in CVD. The conclusions section states that: ""There are a limited number of small studies comparing Plavix and generic clopidogrel in nonhealthy volunteers, reporting hard clinical end points. Taking these limitations into account, the available data <strong>did not suggest any difference</strong> in cardiovascular events, adverse events, and withdrawals among patients receiving branded and generic clopidogrel.""</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Any thoughts will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>edit: After some further research I found two more points that should be considered:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I stated that the generic formulation of Clopidogrel I found was essentially identical to the brand name in terms of active ingredient, since Clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and Clopidogrel bisulphate are two names for the same compound. However, I realized today that we have another generic formulation which contains a different salt, Clopidogrel besylate. According to the study I cited above, different salt formulations can affect the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the drug, so that's a new lead.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00392-009-0033-1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This study</a> attempted to compare the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate and clopidogrel besylate. According to its conclusion ""no overall significant difference in the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel hydrogen sulphate as compared to clopidogrel besylate [was observed]. However, it is important to note that besides high interindividual there is also <strong>high intraindividual variability between the two different clopidogrel formulas</strong>"".</p></li>

<p>Regarding the clinical case, I have yet to find out which generic formulation the patient received, but I wanted to update the question with this new information and ask if anyone witnessed this kind of clinical difference with different salts of Clopidogrel (sharing experiences with different reactions to different salts of other drugs is also welcome).</p>

"What can you observe from MRI noises?","<p>While in an MRI you hear a lot of different noises. The pitch changes, as does the pattern and rhythm. Sometimes there's one long noise, sometimes a beep-beep-beep then a pause and the same set of beeps again, and so on. At times a pattern repeats without change for many minutes, while at other times the noises vary more frequently. CBC Spark had <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/289-music-and-tech-week-1.3109376/video-i-hear-music-in-the-mri-1.4124448"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an item</a> comparing it to electronic music.</p>

This can be done by partly closing the glottis while exhaling, or by firmly exhaling through the mouth with lips slightly open, as if one were whistling. Unlike the definitions above, the patient does not have a fully closed airway and is still taking in oxygen. But subjectively, this kind of breathing feels like it's raising intrathoracic and eustachian pressure in the same way as Valsalva. </p>

<p>Does forcefully exhaling against resistance have similar physiological effects to the Valsalva maneuver? Are there differences caused by the fact that the patient is still breathing, or by the fact that this maneuver can be maintained and repeated for much longer than a ""strict"" Valsalva?</p>

"I'm OK with chilis and any kind of oil. But I can't take any chili oil. Why?","<p>I started eating Asian food rather frequently about 3 years ago.<BR>
I like hot and spicy dishes. I have no problem eating for example a Vietnamese Pho with lots of chilis in it. Also, I love to prepare my own food (of any origin) using lots of different types of oil.</p>

<p>However, if I only get to eat one drop of chili oil, my body starts to take it seriously.<BR>
It started when I first made chili oil myself and put a good amount of it in my meal. A few hours afterwards, my heart started beating fast and strong and that did not stop until about <strong>60 hours</strong> later! It felt like it was pounding during an adrenalin rush, maybe not as strong but without end. I could hardly sleep. No relaxation technique helped.<BR>
Also, my stomach didn't do too good, but it was not bad. The problem was my heart and the unrest it caused me.</p>

<p>This was as bad as it ever got. Since then I got the occasional unintentional load of chili oil in restaurants. The symptoms are the same, but weaker and shorter (12-20 hours maybe). I assume in those cases it is just not as much chili oil as it was at the first time.</p>

<p>Maybe a quick explanation of how chili oil is made. It is really simple. You put several sliced red chilis (with seeds) into olive oil and let it steep for a few weeks. That's all. Afterwards you use the oil directly from the container it was made in.</p>

She was telling me about the procedure and explained that that the doctor gave her an injection of something into both breasts which somehow stimulates growth of natural breast tissue?

Her results are permanent (well long term at least...she says that after child birth they may return to a sort of ""normal"").</p>

"What is the ideal oxygen air percentage for longterm health?","<p>I'm working on a science-fiction story, and a recent scene deals with someone tampering with the O2 levels of a ship's recycled atmosphere.  I find myself wondering, <strong>what is the ideal oxygen level for longterm health in humans?</strong>  In other words, what were the ship's O2 levels set to before they were changed?</p>

<p>According to my research Earth's air generally runs around 20.8-21% oxygen, and can be dangerous if it dips below 19.5% or so.  The ISS, for example, uses a basic sea-level air mixture of about 21%.  On the flip side, many athletes spend time in oxygen-rich environments to improve their training, and I know many scuba divers who use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrox"" rel=""nofollow"">Nitrox</a> tanks with up to 40% oxygen to give them energy and increase their focus, etc.  However, I also know that using enriched air like that can lead to long-term issues and oxygen toxicity at certain levels.</p>

<p>So my question is, <strong>are there oxygen mixtures more beneficial to longterm human life than the Earth-standard 21%?</strong>  If you could control the air mixture of a ship, would it be more beneficial to set it at 25%, or 30%, etc?</p>

<p>And just to be clear: I'm looking only for the longterm effects of the oxygen mixture on human health, and not other practical considerations (like chance of combustion, decompression, etc).</p>

"Why would a junkie have a grand mal seizure during withdrawal?","<p>On the television show <em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>, one of the main characters is a heroin addict.

<p>According to <a href=""http://www.addictionsandrecovery.org/withdrawal.htm"">this</a> website, heroin withdrawal alone doesn't cause seizures: </p>

"Why are antibiotics and ear tubes the primary treatment for chronic ear infections rather than improving normal drainage through the Eustachian tube?","<p>Ear infections are not contagious, and most resolve without antibiotics. There are risks inherent with excessive antibiotic use as well as many allergies and negative side effects. Ear tubes require cutting into a healthy membrane, leave scars, have multiple side effects, and frequently don't solve the problem of chronic infections. The anesthesia required for the procedure carries its own risks. With these negatives in mind and knowing that the body already has a tube designed to do the same thing without the risks why are more efforts not made to improve their function?  Why is our current treatment standard despite the known risks, when other options are obviously still unexplored.

"Any studies on the tradeoff between losing weight and being less stressful?","<p>It is being constantly claimed, upheld and emphasized that being overweight or, even worse, obese, possesses many and severe health hazards. Overweight and obese people are being repeatedly urged to lose weight. That not losing excess weight is harmful for health seems certain.</p>

<p>However, there seems to be one more factor, which, admittedly, comes from my experience in the form of the observation of people surrounding me. Namely, I'd put a hypothesis that working to lose weight causes considerable strain on the psyche. I know a person who had been calm and happy… before she started dieting frantically to lose weight. She managed to lose most of her excess weight and works very hard to keep it that way, nonetheless seeing her as nervous and tired and humorless as she is now and comparing to how I remember her before makes me question if her efforts are worth it. Another example comes from a newspaper article (which, again, I can't now find to link it) about a talk-show host. The article snidely remarked that with her excess weight the host lost all of her funniness she had been esteemed for. Finally: I also read a newspaper article (which I, again, can't find now...) that seemed to confirm my anecdotal and intuitive observations: namely, it claimed that both hunger itself and conscious attempts to suppress hunger and restraining the urge to eat cause considerable stress and lower one's mood.</p>

<p>Still, in cases when both weight and stress are discussed together, it seems that it is usually in the context of excess weight causing stress because overweight people tend to have low self-esteem and they tend to be ostracized by their peers. I would, however, ask about this relationship from a different angle:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can working to lose weight, as opposed to neglecting this, cause considerable stress?</li>
<li>Since chronic stress is also widely recognized to be a health hazard, can the costs of being more stressed outweigh the costs of not losing weight? Assume absence of other egregious lifestyle-related risks – that is, our overweight person does not smoke, has some moderate physical activity, is not being bullied for being overweight, does not mostly eat junk food, etc etc.</li>

"Why are the estimates of obesity prevalence in England wildly different?","<p>I am not a health professional and am a little bit puzzled by this. There appear to be two ranges of obesity prevalence estimates (I am particularly interested in the rate in adults in England):</p>

This underpins the reports published by NHS Digital and Public Health England.</p></li>

</ol>

"Vitamin Supplements Frequency","<p>Most daily multivitamins have close to 100% of the RDA for each element in the vitamin, and I believe that the nutrients get into your blood in a short time frame.</p>

<p>For example, in Japan many vitamins are smaller and designed to be taken a few times over the course of a day. The one-a-day approach most Americans use seems arbitrary and makes me wonder, for example, why we don't take one bigger vitamin every three days (let me ignore the problem of forgetting the day on which we last took vitamins even though it is important here).</p>

"How to explain the theory of the influence of purine and alcohol on the incidence of risk for gout in light of contradictory evidence?","<p>A common thought is that  dietary restrictions are recommended for people susceptible to gout.</p>

<p>These restrictions often focus on fructose, purines and alcohol: if a food or beverage is 'high' in these, they should be avoided, but that theory seems to not really translate into empirical evidence when looking at actual levels of substances to avoid in food and beverages and the effect of actual food on the observable incidences.</p>

<p>Different sources may recommend different things, just following their 'school of thought'? But in the following text all these discrepancies are combined into one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several facets of the diet are important to the reduction of the risks of a gouty episode: meat and seafood intake, alcohol use, and obesity. Although many physicians still advise patients to reduce their dietary intake of purines, purine-restricted diets only reduce mean serum urate levels by 0.6 mM/l, and such diets are relatively unpalatable.</p>
  
  <p>For the moment, the best data related to diet comes from a recent study of 47,150 men over a 12-year period that shows meat and seafood increase the risk of gout. In contrast, dairy products, especially low-fat dairy products, are able to decrease the risk of gout in men. In addition to food, alcohol is another significant risk factor for gout. The relationship between gout and alcohol is more complex. Acute alcohol intoxication in individuals documents a higher plasma urate concentration when urate levels are measured after individuals have become sober. Such urate alterations may also occur as a result of not eating and the presence of ketosis. The latter state and its circulating ketones and lactate block urate excretion causing hyperuricemia. In normal individuals, elevated plasma levels of ethanol (> 200 mg/dl) cause a reduction in urinary urate levels [869, 870]. When moonshine whiskey was produced from lead-soldered stills, saturnine gout or lead-induced gout was a common occurrence in the southern part of the United States. </p>
  
  <p>Finally, beer contains a purine (guanosine) that can be metabolized to uric acid. Recent studies of 14,809 individuals in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) examined the role of beer, wine, and hard liquor in relation to uric acid. In this study, beer and hard liquor intake were positively correlated with hyperuricemia. It has been proposed that <strong>a glass of wine as a replacement for beer or hard liquor might reduce the incidence of gout.</strong> Both alcohol intake and obesity can cause an increase in urate production and a decrease in its elimination by the kidney. </p>
  
  <p>Although medications are usually the means by which recurrent gouty episodes are controlled, there are certain dietary restrictions that may be useful as well. It has been shown that meat and seafood intake are associated with an increased risk of gout. Meat including beef, lamb, and pork as well as bologna, sausage, salami, bacon, hot dogs, chicken, turkey, hamburger, chicken liver, and beef liver are the most well-characterized offenders as inducers of gouty episodes. Seafood associated with an increase risk of gout include tuna, dark fish, shrimp, lobster, clams, and scallops. <strong>There are also some purine-rich vegetables like peas, lentils, spinach, mushrooms, oatmeal, and cauliflower, but they <em>do not appear to increase the risk of gout.</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>Alcohol ingestion in excess and its association with gout has been known since antiquity. Beer has a special capacity to raise the serum uric acid levels and put patients at risk for gouty episodes since it contains guanosine, a purine that is easily converted enzymatically to uric acid. Finally, many patients will tell their physician that particular foods or alcoholic beverages will trigger an attack of gout. In these cases, physicians should heed the patient’s information and ask the patient to restrict their intake of the offending agent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How to properly explain the associations between diet and gout that is at the same time theory guided, simple and accurate?</p>

<p>It seems that 'purine-rich' is too simple, as purine-rich vegetables don't seem to count?</p>

<p>It seems that 'alcohol' isn't a factor at all, as since antiquity beer is known to be bad, but wine with a much higher alcohol content is noted as not being bad?</p>

<p>The practical guideline is just that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, the three foods/beverages that place patients at risk for gout are red meat, beer, and fructose, a sugar commonly found in sugar- sweetened soft drinks. Finally, patients with gout should decrease their use of hard liquor and beer with a substitution of wine if necessary.</p>
  
  <p>Quotes from David S. Newcombe: ""Gout. Basic Science and Clinical Practice"", Springer: London, Heidelberg, 2013. (9 Management of Hyperuricemia and Gout, 291–385, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4471-4264-5_9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DOI</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically for alcohol, which is sometimes even thought to be preventative if taken as wine in low doses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of individual alcoholic beverages on serum uric acid levels varies substantially: beer confers a larger increase than liquor, whereas moderate wine drinking does not increase serum uric acid levels.<br>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>How does one explain 'avoid purines in food' if purine-rich plant food isn't counting?</strong><br>
<strong>How does one explain 'avoid alcohol' if alcoholic wine seems fine?</strong></p>

<p>Is the above interpreted correctly? Is the theory wrong, incomplete or in need of modification?</p>

  in clinical trials and is largely based on extrapolation from the
  arterial system and an understanding of the venous system. Based on
  clinical data on stenting of chronic iliocaval occlusions, long-term
  warfarin is recommended in patients with long occlusions, underlying
  thrombophilia, suprarenal occlusions, and previous long-term
  anticoagulation and poor inflow on completion angiogram [43, 44]. With
  postthrombotic lesions being more prone to restenosis, the use of
  anticoagulants appears to be useful in this subgroup. Thus, although
  the use of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants has not been studied
  systematically, there seems to be a role for these drugs.</p>

"How much hazardous is cell site to our health?","<p>A telephone company is installing a cell tower (cellular base station-antenna) 40 meters from my house (right in front of my house). The first thing I am concerning about is its effect to our health. My neighbors are worried as well. So I'd like to know <strong>How much hazardous is cell tower to our health?</strong></p>

<p>I am not an expert in the field but I know enough to understand that magnetic field the antenna is going to generate will certainly expose some amount of hazard to our health.</p>

<p>I read at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health#Health_hazards_of_base_stations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> that World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and other sources as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"".

<p>""Effects studied"" section of the Wikipedia page addresses several issues like  <em>Blood–brain barrier</em>, <em>Cancer</em>, <em>Male fertility</em>, <em>Electromagnetic hypersensitivity</em>, <em>Glucose metabolism</em> which are really scary to read about.</p>

<p><strong>Can anyone answer if installing cell tower too close to population settlement creates hazard to health?</strong></p>

"Is a hyperventilation+hypoventilation breathing exercise (Wim Hof Method) more likely to prevent or promote cancer?","<p>Apart from exposure to cold, the core element of the Wim Hof Method is a breathing technique, which alternates between hyperventilation and hypoventilation (apparently similar to Tummo meditation). It consists of repeating the following steps for 3-4 times:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperventilation for 30 deep, strong breaths.</li>
<li>Breath hold after an exhalation for as long as possible.</li>
<li>Inhalation followed by another breath hold for ~10 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>The exercise seems to have a profound effect on human physiology, which has been discovered in 
<a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans</em></a>.
The focus of the experiment was to study the immune response after administration of an endotoxin while performing the breathing exercise.
The study revealed the following physiological reactions (see also <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2014/04/30/1322174111.DCSupplemental"" rel=""noreferrer"">videos in the supplementary material</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Increases epinephrine levels.</li>
<li>Suppresses immune response, i.e., decreased pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) and increased anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10).</li>
<li>Blood pH: Increases from ~7.4 to over ~7.7 during hyperventilation (respiratory alkalosis); falls back to ~ baseline during breath retention.</li>
<li>Oxygen saturation: At 100% during hyperventilation; temporarily drops to ~50% during the breath hold.</li>
<li>Arterial pCO2: Decreases from a baseline of ~4.5 kPa to below 2 kPa during hyperventilation. The breath hold recovers pCO2 but not fully to baseline level, which is why the minimum pCO2 seems to decrease with each hyperventilation.</li>
<li>Arterial pO2: Increases from a baseline of ~16.5 to kPa over 22 kPa during hyperventilation. During the breath hold pO2 can fall below 4 kPa, and the minimum seems to become lower with each repetition. pO2 stays slightly elevated post exercise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Looking at these physiologic reactions, I'm wondering how performing this exercise on a daily basis would affect the development of cancer?
I am a scientist, but not in the field of medicine or health, so it is difficult to make sense these effects.
Naively, I would think that some of the reactions like the more alkaline blood pH and a more efficient immune system should be beneficial for preventing cancer.
Also, a <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5266177/"" rel=""noreferrer"">2017 study</a> has found positive effects of breath training on respiratory cancer.
On the other hand, the exercise involves states of low oxygenation during both:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperventilation: As a result of the low carbon dioxide levels, haemoglobin binds oxygen (Bohr effect), leading to reduced tissue oxygenation.</li>
<li>Breath hold: The low oxygen saturation and arterial pO2 probably means that the body is in a temporary state of generalized hypoxia at the end of the breath hold.</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick research on the connection between oxygenation/hypoxia and cancer seems to indicate that hypoxia is something that should be avoided by all means, because it promotes malignant progression and metastasis, and increases resistance to therapy and mortality (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumor_hypoxia"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=""http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/9/suppl_5/10.full"" rel=""noreferrer"">2004 article</a>, <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17440684"" rel=""noreferrer"">2007 article</a>, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/oncsis/journal/v5/n1/full/oncsis201550a.html?foxtrotcallback=true"" rel=""noreferrer"">2016 article</a>).</p>

"How to assist an epilepsy sufferer in convulsion?","<p>I look after vulnerable people as a Security Warden supervising Homeless Hostels at night.

Is there any more I can do for them ?</p>

<p>[Addition After Posting: I have since spoken to an epilepsy sufferer and she has told me that during seizure her worst problem is a sense that the convulsion will never end, that she is stuck in it and cannot get out. She describes fighting against it to try and control it. She told me all she needs is for someone to touch her lightly on the shoulders, to look into her eyes and just to speak her name and reassure her that it will all soon be over. I know that in some cases seizures can be quite a physical thing but I am not aware they are ever 'violent' as such, so what she requests sounds, to me, quite reasonable.]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In skeletal muscle and tendon the extracellular matrix confers important tensile properties and is crucially important for tissue regeneration after injury. Musculoskeletal tissue adaptation is influenced by mechanical loading, which modulates the availability of growth factors, including growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which may be of key importance. To test the hypothesis that GH promotes matrix collagen synthesis in musculotendinous tissue, we investigated the effects of 14 day administration of 33–50 μg kg−1 day−1 recombinant human GH (rhGH) in healthy young individuals. rhGH administration caused an increase in serum GH, serum IGF-I, and IGF-I mRNA expression in tendon and muscle. Tendon collagen I mRNA expression and tendon collagen protein synthesis increased by 3.9-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively (P &lt; 0.01 and P= 0.02), and muscle collagen I mRNA expression and muscle collagen protein synthesis increased by 2.3-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively (P &lt; 0.01 and P= 0.06). Myofibrillar protein synthesis was unaffected by elevation of GH and IGF-I. Moderate exercise did not enhance the effects of GH manipulation. Thus, increased GH availability stimulates matrix collagen synthesis in skeletal muscle and tendon, but without any effect upon myofibrillar protein synthesis. The results suggest that GH is more important in strengthening the matrix tissue than for muscle cell hypertrophy in adult human musculotendinous tissue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The effects of ascorbic acid and various growth factors on the proliferation rate and collagen metabolism were studied in cells from the flexor retinaculum of individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome (FR-CTS) and without carpal tunnel syndrome (FR control) and in human dermal fibroblasts. Ascorbic acid and four growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factors, were used. Ascorbic acid stimulates type I collagen production more in FR control than in FR-CTS. Growth factor treatment resulted in the following responses by the cells: (1) a higher mitogenic response than in the control cells; (2) <strong>a higher stimulation of type III collagen production and a lower stimulation of type I collagen production in CTS cells as compared with control cells</strong>; and (3) more α2(I) than α1(I) collagen production in CTS cells, unlike in control cells. We concluded that cells of the FR from individuals with CTS are physiologically altered.</p>

"Does vaccination weaken the immune system ? Studies?","<p>A friend recognizes value in vaccinating in general - against major diseases - but with a caveat that they are opposed to the flu vaccine specifically.  </p>

<p>They claim that vaccines weaken the immune system, and reasoned that (in conjunction with the fact that flu vaccines may only offer ~40% (random example) efficacy against some strains, some given flu season) this weakening of the immune system actually <strong>increases</strong> occurrence and/or chance of illness. </p>

<p><strong>Is it true that vaccines ""weaken the immune system"" ?</strong><br>
Whether flu vaccines specifically, or vaccines in general. </p>

<p>I tried Googling this, but most results pertain to vaccination for those who are already immunocompromised ?</p>

<p>One source writes : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any evidence that vaccines do cause illness and immune
  system dysfunction?</p>
  
  <p>One answer came in a careful study of illness patterns observed in
  babies before and after vaccination, published in Clinical Pediatrics
  in 1988. If vaccines cause a weakened immune system, then we would
  expect to see a higher incidence of illness following vaccination. In
  that study conducted in Israel, the incidence of acute illnesses in
  the 30 day period following DTP vaccine was compared to the incidence
  in the same children for the 30 day period prior to vaccine. The
  three-day period immediately following vaccine was excluded because
  children frequently develop fever as a direct response to vaccine
  toxins. A total of 82 healthy infants received DTP, and their symptoms
  were reported by parents and observed by a pediatrician at weekly
  intervals. Those babies experienced a dramatic increase in fever,
  diarrhea, and cough in the month following DTP vaccine compared to
  their health before the shot.</p>

There is a clear lack of research looking at dose-response relationship between EMF exposure and a range of health outcomes.

It's hard to find this type of information on the web, esp given such limited research that tends to focus narrowly on specific set of outcomes.  There are paid services advertise to measure EMF in private homes but I have to wonder if such service is worth the cost and indeed reliable. </p>

In the former situation, UFC should not be chosen as a screening test.""  In the latter group of individuals, urinary cortisone and cortisol both increase, so that the effect may be more accentuated in immunoassays in which cortisone cross-reacts with the antibody. Thus, 2 ways of addressing this are to use tandem mass spectroscopy assays (or immunoassays with minimal cross-reactivity) and to ask patients to restrict fluids to 2 L/d.</p>

If it cuts off the blood till I decrease the pressure to the highest blood pressure, then shouldn't it cause serious problems? Even in simole words, heart attack is caused by the blockage of blood flow, isn't it? So is there any possibility that the measuring tool can be injurious?
I am not a medical student, just a curious learner. I just thought it would be wise to know everything about it before I actually measure someone's pressure with it</p>

"Are medical risks memoryless?","<p>In determining your current health risk, does it matter what your past medical statistics were, or only your current medical statistics matter?</p>

<p><strong>Thought experiment 1 (TE1):</strong>
If there are two twins A and B, A has high blood sugar his whole life and B has had low blood sugar for the first half of his life and high blood sugar for the second half of his life, do they currently have the same risk of getting diabetes?</p>

<p><strong>Thought experiment 2 (TE2):</strong>
If there are two twins C and D, C has had high cholesterol for his whole life but recently got it down to normal levels, whereas D has always had normal levels, who has higher risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) currently?</p>

<p><strong>Followup question:</strong> 
If past medical statistics matter, is it the accumulation or trend that matters? For example, in TE2, if trend matters, C has a better trend and hence lower risk of CHD. If accumulation matters instead, then C has a higher risk of CHD because of past unhealthy statistics.</p>

"Leg tightens/hurts when stretching in bed","<p>You ever wake up from a deep sleep, give your body a good stretch and think to yourself ""man that felt good!""? Well unfortunately for me, I've had the exact opposite happen a couple times in less than a week. This has also happened in the past but didn't think much of it, that maybe it was just a cramp.</p>

<p>The other night I awoke, stretched out my legs and my lower RIGHT leg tensed up so bad to the point it felt like the muscle just locked up. I tried to move my leg and foot around to alleviate the pain, which helped a little, but was hard to do so.</p>

<p>When I did get up a couple hours later for work, my lower leg was still very sore and hurt to put a lot of pressure down on it. Very similar experience this morning but it didn't happen as bad, I was able to feel the pain before it got too bad and stop myself from stretching. (You ever try to stop yourself mid-stretch in the morning? It's not fun...)</p>

<p>Anyways, I do have RLS so I don't know if that is adding to the situation. Although last night wasn't as bad as some nights. As well as an issue with my lower back with the muscle above my left hip. So I'm a little concerned on why this would happen. Do I maybe have a damaged muscle in my leg? It's never happened to my left leg, only my right. </p>

"How does variance in pH affect Candida Albicans?","<p>This is a topic on which I have observed similar arguments lead to precisely opposite conclusions.  Some people (health professionals/enthusiasts) claim that Candida Albicans (and similar species) changes from its yeast form into its harmful fungal form as a result of its environment becoming more acidic (lower pH), while others claim that it changes from yeast form into fungal form as a result of its environment becoming more alkaline (higher pH).</p>

"Fructose from the Seminal Vesicles","<p>I have been contemplating how chronic gut-originating infestations such as Candida overgrowth and Small Intestinal Bacteria Overgrowth (SIBO) link to symptoms in the male reproductive system, i.e., prostatitis, low libido, and poor orgasm quality (low ejaculation volume, low level of pleasure, etc.) (ED is <em>not</em> one of the symptoms in the picture).</p>

<p>I recently learned that the seminal vesicles produce fructose on a routine basis.  Obviously if bacteria or fungus are entering the reproductive system through large or small intestinal permeability, and are coming into contact with fructose, one would expect them to feed on it and become even harder to kill.  Is this a sensible hypothesis?  What is the intended purpose of the fructose produced by the seminal vesicles?  If the reproductive system was ""starved"" of this fructose due to bacteria and/or fungus competing for it, what symptoms would be expected (analogous to how, i.e., malnutrition can occur in SIBO patients due to bacteria stealing nutrients)?</p>

"What does the highest level science have to say about vegetarianism/veganism?","<p>In her 2010 book GAPS Gut and Psychology Syndrome, Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride offers a very strong criticism of the health impacts of vegetarianism (and to an even greater degree, veganism, hereafter implied).</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.spiritofhealthkc.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/VEGETARIANISM-A-Few-Words-About-Vegetarianism.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiritofhealthkc.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/VEGETARIANISM-A-Few-Words-About-Vegetarianism.pdf</a></p>

<p>Highlights include the claims that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Vegetarian children are more prone to health problems than children who eat meat, particularly to psychomotor impairment and diseases of the blood.</p></li>
<li><p>Vegetarians are prone to muscle loss and bone damage. They, on average, have lower muscle strength.</p></li>
<li><p>Misguided vegetarianism is rapidly becoming a major cause of mental illness in our young people. What these young people do not know is that plant foods are generally hard to digest and they are low in useful nutrition. Foods from animal origin are easy for the human gut to digest and assimilate and animal foods provide concentrated amounts of all essential nutrients for human physiology. As plant foods are hard to digest and as they contain a list of anti-nutrients, which can damage the gut, digestive problems are the first symptoms which appear in those beginner vegetarians. They usually develop IBS symptoms, such as bloating, indigestion, constipation, diarrhoea and flatulence. If the person already has a weak digestion, moving to a plant-based diet is positively dangerous. As the digestive system becomes more and more damaged, it is less able to nourish the person, and so nutritional deficiencies develop quite soon. Vitamins B12, B6, B1, B2, niacin, essential amino acids, zinc and proteins are the first nutritional deficiencies a beginner vegetarian usually develops.</p></li>
<li><p>Apart from causing malnutrition through the damage to the digestive system, plant foods are a very poor source of nutrients to start with. In a laboratory we can use all sorts of methods and chemicals for extracting nutrients from plants: methods which our human digestive system does not possess. Human gut has a very limited ability to digest plants and to extract anything useful from them. Nature has created herbivorous animals (ruminants) to eat plants and in order for them to be able to digest these plants, Nature has equipped them with a very special digestive system: it is very long with several stomachs full of special plant-breaking bacteria. The human digestive system is similar to the gut of predatory animals, such as wolves and lions: our digestive system is fairly short and we have only one stomach with virtually no bacteria in it. In fact, our human stomach is designed to produce acid and pepsin, which are only able to break down meat, fish and eggs. In short, our digestive systems have been designed to cope best with animal foods.</p></li>

<p>She references the book, <em>The Vegetarian Myth</em> by Lierre Keith.  She also goes on later in the book to list additional health concerns resulting from vegetarianism.  Needless to say, this contention is extremely controversial.  Many people still believe that vegetarianism, and even veganism, are healthy lifestyle choices if executed properly.</p>

<p>My question is, what does the highest level science have to say about vegetarianism/veganism?  Presumably individual studies have shown conflicting results, offering firepower for people on both sides of the debate.  Have there been any systemic reviews/meta-analyses outlining a high level picture of what we know about this subject from a scientific perspective, which would be more credible than a single study?  If there is a healthy protocol for vegetarianism/veganism, how does it address each of Dr. Campbell-McBride's concerns (psychomotor impairment, diseases of the blood, lower muscle strength, prone to bone damage, digestive problems such as IBS, lack of <em>human-usable</em> nutrients)?</p>

"Different reference ranges of thyroid antobodies","<p>This is related to the following thread:</p>

<p><a href=""http://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3312/tpo-thyroid-peroxidase-antibodies-reference-range-change"">http://health.stackexchange.com/questions/3312/tpo-thyroid-peroxidase-antibodies-reference-range-change</a></p>

<p>I have a question regarding the reference ranges of THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODIES and THYROID PEROXIDASE ANTIBODIES. A recent test of a one of my friend's gave:</p>

<ul>
<li>THYROGLOBULIN ANTIBODIES 3 IU/mL reference range less than 1 IU/mL</li>
<li>THYROID PEROXIDASE ANTIBODIES 19 IU/mL reference range less than 9 IU/mL </li>
</ul>

<p>I have found conflicting info about the reference ranges for the two antibodies, for example, <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2086819-overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Medscape</a>  shows the reference ranges are 20 IU/mL and 35 IU/mL respectively. </p>

<p>Let me take THYROID PEROXIDASE ANTIBODIES to ask the question: if the same blood sample is sent to two labs the same day with different reference ranges, one is 35 IU/mL, one is 9 IU/mL. 35 is about 4 times of 9, can I say that the result value of the THYROID PEROXIDASE antibody in the lab with range 35 will be roughly 4 times of the result value at the lab of reference range 9? For example, the result value of the antibody at the lab of reference range 9 IU/mL turns out to be 19 IU/mL, then the same blood sample tested in the lab with range 35 should be roughly 4 times of 19, which is about 76 IU/mL? That way, the ratio of the result value to the reference range will be roughly 2 for both labs, i.e. 19/9, 76/35 are both roughly 2. </p>

<p>Or, I am completely wrong, the result value at the two labs should be roughly the same value, in the above mentioned example, both should be approximately 19 IU/mL? But then there is a problem for diagnosis, because one lab says it is within normal range, one says it is beyond normal range.</p>

"Teenagers sleeping patterns and parents actions (force or let-go)","<p>My daughter (15 years old) is very active and full of energy until she hits the sac. After five minutes she's out. This represents the perfect behaviour for bedtime process. But, she does this at 1:00 AM and sometimes even 2:30 AM and pretty much every night. The fact that she has school the morning after does not change that behaviour. Her overall productivity is not impaired. She can study math at 11:00 at night with very good concentration. She does not feel the fatigue. </p>

<p>She plays competitive Basketball, Volleyball, does ballet and pretty much every activity school offers. She's a pretty busy bee and feels great about it. In the morning, she a bit grumpy and her overall respect for her parents is declining. But I would say, this is a general pattern in teenagers. </p>

"Does drinking water increase the risk of shock with an open wound?","<p>First let me explain the scenario:<br>
Someone received an open wound, lets assume from a cut so no blunt-forced trauma meaning no reason to suspect internal injuries. The wound is bad enough that serious blood loss occurs. This happens in a remote place, so medevac and professional health care, are if at all available, delayed by days. A good first aid kit is available, but nothing like IVs. Initial wound care has been done (this is not the part I am interested in here, assume it has been done correctly).</p>

<p>Obviously the patient will need hydration. The question is whether hydration should be delayed or not?<br>
Broken down: Does drinking water have any detrimental effect in terms of stopping the bleeding and chances to get into a state of shock?  </p>

<p>Typical unspecific first aid recommendations state to not give a patient anything to drink. If a reason is given for this, it is usually that the patient might need surgery. This is not an issue in this case. Also with food it is clear that it is a bad idea, as digestion ""needs blood"", same for water? There is a (seemingly dubious) <a href=""http://www.nairaland.com/1460146/dont-drink-water-bleeding-injury"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">discussion on Nairaland Forum</a> where someone states that it will ""only dilute the blood"" and it is again more directed at internal injuries.

"What can I do to minimize the chance of tooth pain?","<p>A tooth in the rear left of my mouth (I think it's my wisdom tooth) has temperature sensitivity; if I eat something very cold and I chew it with that tooth, it begins to hurt. </p>

<p>Due to some problems with my insurance, I can only get an appointment in mid February. From experience, I know that eventually the tooth will start to hurt by itself witouth any stimulus. My question is, what can I do to delay this stage of pain as much as possible? Should I brush my teeth an excessive number of times a day? Should I floss around that tooth often? Should I use mouthwash? Of course this is generally good advice, but I am afraid that since the cavity is so close to the nerve already, excessive brushing of teeth may help the bacteria dig towards the nerve faster.</p>

<p>EDIT: Perhaps I should mention, my tooth has had temperature sensitivity for 3-4 weeks already.</p>

"Eating egg shells: advantages v.s. disadvantages?","<p>I am an engineer and a scientist, but not in the field of medicine or health. Partial answers/comments are welcome.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4vi7H.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4vi7H.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Some of my family members start eating egg shells for the sake of obtaining nutrition like Calcium and minerals, once one egg a day before noon. By boiling the egg and microwaving the egg shells. Here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) Does eating egg help the consumption of <strong>Calcium and Minerals</strong>? And are they digestible in our body?</p>

<p>2) Is it <strong>clean, hygiene and healthy</strong> to eat egg shells? Concern that the Hen produces the egg and its metabolic waste through the same Anus? Can we get sick eating the egg shells, even if it has been boiled?</p>

<p>3)The egg shells are sharp, buy we can try to crush the shells through our teeth as much as possible. Once we consume the egg shells in the Esophagus and the stomach and intestines, more generally, in the Gastrointestinal tract, would the egg shells <strong>hurt or cut the organs</strong> by any chance? Would it be <strong>healed by itself</strong>, or would it potentially cause the <strong>cancer for any gastrointestinal tract</strong>? Also how likely it is a dangerous source of <strong>Salmonella / harmful bacterias</strong>?</p>

<p>4) How likely consuming the egg shells causes <strong>Kidney Stone and Renal Calculus</strong>? Say, if I am a young adult, or someone is a senior person?</p>

<p>5) There are known advantages of eating egg shells: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txtut6GS2NU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txtut6GS2NU</a>. But are there known disadvantages for eating egg shells, say if just consuming one shell per day, and fully cooked and boiled? Are there Clinical Medicine test for advantages and disadvantages? Anyone gets Cancers through eating egg shell? Kidney Stone and Renal Calculus?</p>

<p>Again, Partial answers/comments are welcome. Thank you.</p>

"How exactly can/do antidepressants treat ADHD?","<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"">antidepressants can treat ADHD</a>, not just depression. How exactly?</p>

<p>So far I know, ADHD is caused partly (primarily?) by a dopamine deficiency. Do antidepressants do something to address the dopamine deficiency? What is it? Is it in the same way that stimulants or methylphenidate address the dopamine deficiency?</p>

<p>Wikipedia describes how <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate"">methylphenidate treats ADHD</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Methylphenidate's mechanism of action involves the inhibition of
  catecholamine reuptake, primarily as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.
  Methylphenidate acts by blocking the dopamine transporter and
  norepinephrine transporter, leading to increased concentrations of
  dopamine and norepinephrine within the synaptic cleft. This effect in
  turn leads to increased neurotransmission of dopamine and
  norepinephrine. Methylphenidate is also a 5HT1A receptor agonist.[11]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikipedia describes <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant#Environmental_impacts"">antidepressants</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>most antidepressants function by inhibiting the reuptake of
  neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinepherine</p>

"What causes incessant scrotal sac movements?","<p>According to Wikipedia, scrotal sac movements are to serve the purpose of regulating the temperature of the testicles.

<p>But do incessant scrotal sac movements denote that this thermo-regulation mechanism has collapsed?

"What's involved in an extraction of palatally impacted teeth?","<p>I have two impacted teeth (some combination of premolars and molars) that are on my palate. They are fairly close to my ""normal"" teeth: generally, the only impact of them on my everyday life is a slight pressure I sometimes feel on the sides of my tongue.</p>

<p>However, my dentist has suggested that I get these teeth extracted, as the gap between them and my ""normal"" teeth is difficult to clean and they serve no real positive purpose, and if they decay, they may affect the function of my ""normal"" teeth. I am partly hesitant to agree to this because of memories of painful tooth extractions in my childhood. That's a personal issue, but I also don't know how much such a procedure would involve (and cannot ask my dentist at the moment), and having more knowledge might ease some of the distress about possibly getting the procedure done. Thus:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Would such an extraction be done in a fashion similar to extractions of teeth grown in ""normal"" areas of the mouth? If not, what would be different? I found this on <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/pulling-a-tooth-tooth-extraction"" rel=""noreferrer"">WebMD</a>, but it only refers to <em>impacted</em> teeth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the tooth is impacted, the dentist will cut away gum and bone tissue that cover the tooth and then, using forceps, grasp the tooth and gently rock it back and forth to loosen it from the jaw bone and ligaments that hold it in place.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>How much time would it take for the space in my palate to recover? Would I expect there to be any long-term ""scarring"" or similar side-effects, or would the tissue be able to grow back smoothly?</p></li>

In many cases, the patients do not have any symptoms or difficulties. Are there any studies to show that there is an advantage of closing such defects (either surgically or using devices inserted through the skin) when incidentally found in adults? Does closure improves longevity or reduces future heart-related illnesses? Thanks for your insight. </p>

"Can stem cell (msc) injections regrow damaged (articular / hyaline) cartilage if injected to joint?","<p>I have read that fixated stem cells (mixed with glue, growth factor and fixated in the cartilage defect under low oxygen conditions) will regrow into articular and hyaline cartilage with type II collagen.

"How often do I need to eat water-soluble vitamins?","<p>Preciser phrasing of the question:
Do I need to consume the daily recommended dose of water-soluble vitamins every single day? Or is it sufficient if my consumption averages to the daily dose over a longer timeframe (and what timeframe would that be)?</p>

<p>I am aware that:</p>

<ul>
<li>fat-soluble vitamins can be stored for a long time (months, possibly even years in some cases).</li>
<li>water-soluble vitamins can (with the exception of B12) only be stored for a short time.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I have not found any clear answer to how short the ""short time"" for water-soluble vitamins is (a single day? A week? Not at all?).
Answers I found are usually vague or inconsistent with each other (and also not sourced):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""it is recommended that you replenish your stores of water-soluble
  vitamins every few days"" [<a href=""https://www.sharecare.com/health/vitamins-supplements/how-water-soluble-vitamins-absorbed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a>]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Background: I am currently trying to eat healthier than I used to. One thing I want to track is my vitamin intake to ensure that I do not develop deficiencies.</p>

<p>However, I am not sure how granularly I have to keep up with <em>daily</em> recommended doses.</p>

<p>Example: The German Nutrition Society recommends 110mg of Vitamin C daily for me [<a href=""https://www.dge.de/wissenschaft/referenzwerte/vitamin-c/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">4</a>]. Does this mean that I actualy need 110mg every single day in order to not develop a deficiency long-term? Or is it sufficient if I track my intake, e.g., on a weekly basis (requiring 770mg per week)?</p>

<p>I am aware that there are also differing opinions about the actual amount per day that is needed (e.g., 110mg in Germany, 90mg in the US [<a href=""https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">5</a>]) but this is out-of-scope of my question.</p>

"What is the situation with CBD mixed with alcohol?","<p>CBD-infused shots, beers, and other alcoholic drinks have started to be produced and I have seen claims online that mixing CBD and alcohol can intensify each other’s effects, resulting in changes in mood and behaviour, yet it can help with alcohol addictions.</p>

<p>One study of 10 people found that when participants took 200mg of CBD with alcohol, they had significantly lower blood alcohol levels than when they consumed alcohol with a placebo (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/120541"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consroe et al. 1979</a>), however, combining alcohol with CBD caused significant impairments in motor performance and alterations in the perception of time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compared to placebo, alcohol and alcohol plus CBD, but not CBD alone, produced significant impairments of motor and psychomotor performances, overestimations of time production and subjective responses indicating an accurate self-perception of their intoxication and deficits. The combination of alcohol plus CBD resulted in significantly lower blood alcohol levels compared to alcohol given alone, however, there were few differences observed between the pharmacological effects of the two alcohol conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The point I am making is that the study found that although CBD being added to alcohol lowers blood alcohol levels the pharmacological effects of the alcohol remain the same as without CBD.</strong>  Although CBD does not have psychoactive effects on its own, it appears to me if I am interpreting the results correctly, that CBD speeds up the metabolization of alcohol, hense lower blood alcohol levels, yet the potency of lower blood alcohol levels is elevated too.  Which if you think about it could affect driver blood alcohol testing limits?</p>

<p>The last point I made about driver testing is beside the point (in a way), but what I am wondering is <strong>What is the scientific stance on addiction therapy with CBD?</strong></p>

"Why aspirin dose is reduced in gastric achlorydia?","<p>Aspirin remains in unionised form in acidic $pH$ but this unionised form is a diffusible form which is helpful in absorption across lipid membrane.  </p>

<p>My reasoning almost tries to contradict the statement and find a suitable answer to the question as to <strong>Why aspirin doses are reduced in gastric achlorydia ?</strong><br>
Here are some issues I need to resolve.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In gastric achlorydia there must be more ionic form of aspirin inside stomach so <em>shouldn't we increase the dose to get more diffusible form i.e unionised form of aspirin for absorption to reach a specific plasma concentrations level considering that absorption also occurs from stomach?</em>  </p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere it was also mentioned (in my textbook) that solubility of aspirin increases at higher $pH$ but I am not sure whether this is the reason for <em>why the dose of aspirin should be reduced in achlorydia?</em> cause some people suggested me that <strong>it was because of no ion trapping and hence more of the aspirin is available for absorption from intestine so dose must be reduced</strong>. In fact this question has got in my nerves and I don't know which is the correct answer/more significant one. The $pH$ of intestine is basic which might give more ionisable form so decrease in absorption according to me but still I am not pretty confident to rule out the reason (related to ion trapping).  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background</strong>  </p>

<p>I am adding this to tell how I came up with this question and ended up using this website.<br>
After I googled there was no such direct question mentioned above <em>why aspirin dose are reduced in hgastric achlorydia?</em>. This question was asked to us in practical classes and the answer given to us was that '...since in gastric achlorydia there is more ionisation of aspirin and hence no <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_trapping"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ion trapping</a> so more of drug is available for absorption through intestine hence we reduce the dose of aspirin to get a specific plasma concentration level.' Ionic form of aspirin is more better absorbed in intestine than in stomach relatively as given <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7288271/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.<br>
But on the other hand our book states  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aspirin is absorbed from the stomach and small intestine. It's poor water solubility is limiting factor in absorption: microfilming there drug-particles and inclusion of an alkali(solubility is more at higher pH) enhances absorption. However, higher pH also favors ionisation, this decreasing the diffusible form.<br>
  - Essentials of Medical pharmacology 7th edition, NSAIDS and antipyretic analgesics, Pharmacokinetics, page no. 196. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now here it mentions that the solubility is limiting factor so possibly it may increase available small aspirin particles for absorption at high pH in gastric achlorydia therefore enough to counter the effect of increased ionic form which decrease absorption.  </p>

<p>I don't know which is correct explanation or if both correct, which one is more significant.</p>

"Does the special kind of diet really matter, when making a radical change?","<p>Ok, so this might not be the most medically sound question, since I am a mathematician by training, but please bear with me.</p>

<p>The question originates from an observation I made from being confronted with many advocates for different types of diets (vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, paleo, gluten-free, sugar-free etc) and what baffles me is that no matter what the special type of diet is, there seem to be individuals that have very good success with less depression, less overweight, more vitality, less pills to take and so forth. These individuals are often presented by the respective advocates as good rolemodels.</p>

<p>This really struck me, since it indicates that it might not be the actual diet itself, but maybe something else. The only thing I could make out to be present across all individuals is the fact that these individuals got their life together at least with respect to their food intake. So could the correlation between a consequent and dedicated change of diet and the overall improvement of the individual be caused by psychological phenomena that stem from the new approach / mindest these successful individuals all share?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if active release
  technique (ART) significantly increases hamstring flexibility in
  healthy male participants.</p>
  
  <p>METHODS: Twenty physically active male participants with no current or
  previous history of lower extremity injury received ART on the origins
  and insertions of the hamstrings and dorsal sacral ligament. The
  sit-and-reach test was used before and after treatment to determine
  hamstring flexibility. Summary statistics were calculated, and pre and
  post hamstring flexibility scores were compared using a related
  samples t test.</p>
  
  <p>RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the pre- and
  posttest groups (mean pre = 35.5 cm, df = 19, SD = 7.56; mean post =
  48.3 cm, df = 19, SD = 7.07; P = .0015). All 20 participants increased their sit-and-reach scores following the application of ART.</p>
  
  <p>CONCLUSIONS: <strong>This study demonstrated that a single ART treatment
  increased hamstring flexibility in a group of healthy, active male
  participants.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Objective</p>
  
  <p>To determine if Active Release Technique (ART) protocols could be used
  as an effective way to influence strength and muscle inhibition in the
  quadriceps muscles of athletes with anterior knee pain.</p>
  
  <p>Design</p>
  
  <p>Pilot clinical outcome study.</p>
  
  <p>Methods</p>
  
  <p>The sample consisted of 9 athletes (4 male athletes, 5 female
  athletes) who were identified as suffering from unilateral anterior
  knee pain. A Biodex dynamometer and the interpolated twitch technique
  were used to determine isometric strength and inhibition in the
  quadriceps muscles, respectively. The treatment intervention consisted
  of the Active Release Technique treatment protocols for anterior knee
  pain. The experimental leg and contralateral leg were tested
  pretreatment and posttreatment, and the experimental leg was tested a
  third time approximately 20 minutes posttreatment.</p>
  
  <p>Results</p>
  
  <p>Knee extensor moments were calculated by multiplying the moment arm by
  the forces measured by the Biodex dynamometer. Percentage of muscle
  inhibition was calculated by dividing the interpolated twitch torque
  (ITT) by the resting twitch torque (RTT), that is (ITT/RTT*100). A
  repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare
  pretreatment and posttreatment values for strength and muscle
  inhibition for the experimental and contralateral knees. The results
  showed no statistical significance.</p>
  
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  
  <p><strong>ART protocols did not reduce inhibition or increase strength in the quadriceps muscles of athletes with anterior knee pain.</strong> Further
  study is required.</p>

"Should I tolerate passive smoking?","<p>I have a phobia against tabaco smoke. I constantly try to avoid smoke by holding my breath or distancing myself from smokers. It's a significant stress to me. As well as an inconvenience in social situations and daily routine. I am considering trying to tolerate it in crowded areas and while talking to friends.<br> As an amusing anecdote, I love winter as it's too cold around here to hold a cigarette :)<br><br>
In tram stations, I'd have to tolerate being within 1meter of a smoker for 20min a day.<br>
My friends take smoke breaks a few times a day, depending on our schedule. They smoke 1 cigarette or more. I am either on a crowded balcony where most students take smoke breaks, usually taking a leave of abscence from the conversation after a few minutes. Or in a yard trying to make myself heard without shouting.<br><br>Perhaps I can eliminate the stress and still avoid passive smoking.<br>
In which situations can I tolerate passive smoking, such that I avoid health risks?<br>
Also can you point me to any relevant scientific articles or government recommendations? I'm looking for an argument against passive smoking outdoors, if any.<br><br>
I am not satisfied with the answers I found as they are too general. I'm looking for an answer to my particular case. Certainly passive smoking is harmful in a closed space, but what about open space? My point is, risk varies by exposure.</p>

"Different types of nociceptors in muscle vs connective tissue?","<h3>TL;DR</h3>

<p>I'm wondering if there is any difference in the types of receptors that exist for muscles vs connective tissue. I ask because I compete in sports where I definitely strain/injure muscle, and I also occasionally strain/injure tendons, and the pain feels completely different.</p>

<p>Muscle pain is sharp, immediate and activates when I move the injured muscle, and makes the area sore to the touch (e.g. I try to massage it). As soon as I stop moving or touching the muscle the pain is gone.</p>

<p>Tendon pain is radiating, burning ""toothache-like"" throbbing pain that sets in and becomes inflammed about 2 or 3 minutes after I move the area that is injured and sustains for several minutes thereafter.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm an armwrestler (<em>yes</em> its a <a href=""http://www.walunderground.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">real thing</a> :-) ). Before that I played racquetball very competitively, and before that I was a gym rat/wannabe powerlifter, and in high school I was an alpine ski racer. I've also played soccer, baseball, football and for a short while wrestled in junior high. I've been in the gym pretty much my whole life.</p>

<p>I can say that no sport inflicts as much <em>unique</em> pain on the body as armwrestling. With armwrestling, after a single practice, your arms are throbbing; we call it the ""<strong>toothache pain</strong>"" because it feels just like the stabbing, throbbing pain you get from a bad toothache. Except instead of just a single, localized area (like a single tooth), its a deep, burning throbbing that starts in your shoulders and goes all the way down to your wrists. On both arms. For about 2 hours. Then it takes about 7 - 10 days to heal and not flare up again, and then you can go back to practice again.</p>

<p>This is a much different type of pain than the typical muscle soreness you get from gym lifting or even intense powerlifting. With gym lifts, even if you go extremely hard (1 rep maxes or just a few reps at very heavy weight) you'll get DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) about 48 hours later, and you'll be very sore, but no throbbing burning aching pain. It's very different.</p>

<p>I'm looking to understand <em>why</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>After talking to some more educated armwrestlers in the community, the predominant <em>theory</em> is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gym lifting, even lifting heavy, is still a <em>positive</em> exercise for your muscles. They contract, you lift the weight (quickly if its easy, slowly if its difficult), but your muscles are working and doing all the heavy lifting/work the entire time, throughout the entire range of motion for the exercise</li>
<li>Armwrestling, on the other hand, is mostly either a <em>static</em> or a <em>negative</em> exercise. If you're armwrestling someone who's near your level or capability, it may take up to a minute or longer to ping them. That means your arm and wrist aren't really moving all that much: they're static/isometric and holding on for dear life, all the while your muscles are under 100% maximum strain. Watch an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lypnvG3wafw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">armwrestling video like this one</a> and you'll understand why! Or, if you're going up against someone who's better than you, its a ""negative"" movement: your arm and wrist will fail against them as they pull your arm towards the pad, despite your muscles again working at 100% maximum effort.

<ul>
<li>In all cases, with armwrestling, your muscles are at 100%. They can't do any more work. They cannot contract, they're simply either holding in a locked position (static) or they are slowly failing as you begin to lose (negative).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The theory is that this is when your connective tissue (primarily tendons) takes over. Tendons hold muscle to bone. If a force is being exerted on the bone and the muscle is already at 100%, the force will start being applied moreso to the tendons that are no desperately trying to hold that muscle onto the bone and to not detach. This places enormous stress on the tendons, causing them to stretch and tear, just like muscles do when you lift weights at the gym like a normal human being.</li>
<li>As such the theory is that armwrestling aggravates both muscle and tendons. Since no other sport is really like this, none of us walk into the sport with tendons that are well-conditioned for it.</li>
<li>Tendons take longer to health then muscles, which is why most armwrestlers can take up to 2 weeks to fully recover from a single practice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So first, before I get onto the real core of my questions, I ask for either clarification or confirmation that my assumptions/theories are either correct, greatly misled, or somewhere in between!</strong></p>

<p>But assuming I'm more or less correct so far:</p>

<h3>My Question</h3>

<p>Again, I'm looking to understand the fundamental difference in the <em>type of pain</em> between armwrestling and normal gym lifting. When you exercise in a gym, your muscles get sore for a few days, heal and then you're good to go. While they're sore, it hurts to move them or exert them a lot, they can be sore or tender to the touch, etc.</p>

<p>With armwrestling, its literally a burning, radiating, throbbing toothache pain up and down your whole arm for several hours after practice. And then, for the next 7 - 10 days, if you try to exert your arms by any real amount (you have to shovel snow, mow your lawn, go swimming, etc.) the throbbing comes right back.</p>

<p>My theory is that there might be different types of pain receptors (""<em>nociceptor</em>""?) in the tendons and ligaments in your arms that are activated when injuries to your connective tissue occurs, and that perhaps the brain is just trained to interpret these receptors firing as a throbbing pain. Whatever pain you feel when you get a bad toothache might also be activated by similar receptors.</p>

<p>Is there any medical credence to this theory? If so, can someone explain it more in depth or point me to some decent reading? And if my theories are total junk, can you offer anything to replace it with? Thanks in advance!</p>

"Is it ineffective to drink cold water to cool down when you are warm?","<p>I have heard many times that drinking cold water when you are warm is not an effective way to cool down. </p>

<p>The most common supposed reason that I have heard is that the body needs to spend a considerable amount of energy to warm up the water because the cold water initially cools down your body very locally. The net effect should therefore be that your body gets cooler from room temperature water than cold water.</p>

<p>Is this true or just bogus? Is cold or warm water best when you are hot?</p>
"
"How does breastfeeding protect the mother's bones?","<p>Every time that I look up breastfeeding benefits for the mom I get these main 3 along with others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Decreased chance of breast cancer</li>
<li>Decreased chance of ovarian cancer</li>
<li><strong>Decreased chance of osteoporosis(put another way, increased bone density)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This seems counter intuitive though, not the cancer protection but the osteoporosis protection. Your body takes calcium from your bones when calcium is in increased demand. Typically a mom won't eat enough calcium to prevent this bone breakdown. In pregnant women this is significant because you have an unborn baby inside you whose bones are being ossified. </p>

<p>But it would seem to me that breastfeeding would also increase the bodily demand for calcium because an ounce of breastmilk contains 10 mg of calcium and a breastfeeding woman can produce up to a liter of breastmilk a day. That is 33.814 ounces or 338 mg of calcium for enough breastmilk to feed the mom's baby/babies. That is a lot of calcium just for breastfeeding. Not to mention that the needed intake for anyone between 18-50 is 1000 mg of calcium. This means with the calcium needed for breastmilk production, you get a net intake of around 750 mg of calcium. That is a net deficiency so you get bone breakdown.</p>

<p>So it would make sense then that the ideal calcium intake for a breastfeeding woman would be 1350 mg of calcium due to the amount of calcium in breastmilk and the fact that a woman can produce up to a liter of breastmilk in 1 day. That way you don't end up with bone breakdown.</p>

<p>So if up to 338 mg of calcium goes into making breastmilk, why do breastfeeding women with an intake of 1000 mg of calcium which is what is needed for the average 18-50 year old human, not get osteoporosis but instead increased bone density? Do oxytocin and prolactin somehow divert more calcium towards bone(like do they increase active vitamin D levels) to offset the fact that about a third of the calcium that is needed is diverted to the breasts for milk production?</p>

<p>Because I don't see how you could possibly end up with an increase in bone density when 1/3 of your required calcium is diverted into breastmilk for the baby.</p>

"Why do skin calluses not heal sometimes and remain tough until they fall off?","<p>Bar exercises such as pull-ups, toes-to-bar etc. usually cause skin calluses on one's hand, just below the place where the fingers are connected to the hand, e.g.:<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdXujm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdXujm.jpg"" alt=""picture""></a>.</p>

<p>So the skin in these areas hardens, but if you let it rest for a few days, these calluses disappear and the skin returns (more or less) to its original softness and flexibility.</p>

<p>However, I've noticed that if the tough skin is torn in such a way that it becomes sort of ""skin flap"" (i.e. attached to the palm only on one side of the callus), then it remains hard and does not revert to its original softness, until it falls off. <strong>Why is that? What makes a flap of skin to toughen irreversibly?</strong></p>

<p>P.S. It is still used in Russia. I don't think it's used for blood sugar assessment, I think it's more for the assessment of kidney function. I don't know much about kidney function or its assessment, and a doctor recently advised me to take this test because my urine had an extremely low specific gravity, so I started reading up. I wanted to read up on this in English, because there's usually more in-depth info on tests and their interpretation in English, but to my amazement I only found information in Russian, so I asked this question here. </p>

"How is moistness balanced with avoiding overgranulisation, in wound care?","<p><em>Assuming that infection, bleeding are taken care of, and/or for the purposes of this question can be ignored:</em></p>

<p>I am trying to gain an understanding of an aspect of wound care I don't yet really understand fully. This is roughly what I know that is relevant:</p>

<p>In a moderately serious wound, say to a limb or extremity, where some tissue was lost below skin level, the current advice is that moist healing will be faster and better quality than dry healing. The damaged tissue regenerates, and part of this process is the growth and vascularisation of granular tissue. Granular tissue can overgrow and lie proud above skin level, and may in some cases need to be cauterised or reduced if it does, so that epithelial healing and new surface skin can grow appropriately.</p>

<p>What puzzles me is, there is clearly a balance in wound management, as the tissue begins to regrow. On one hand, it must be allowed to heal in a moist environment, for quality and speed; on the other hand a moist environment promotes granular tissue which may then overgrow. </p>

<p>Presumably therefore as the regrowing tissue approaches or reaches natural ""skin level"", the wound environment must be modified slightly, so it's still moist enough to heal nicely, but no longer promotes any further granular development.</p>

<p>At this point, however, the healing wound may still be open flesh and vulnerable to dryness, UV, infection, dressing adhesion, and damage, and may even still be weeping/exuding in some cases. Despite this, the dressing and treatment must start to ensure isn't unconditionally moist. Rather, it must remain moist enough to heal nicely, <em>but ensure that the wound environment is no longer favourable to further granularisation, and instead begins to develop an epithelial layer</em>.</p>

<p>But how is this change achieved? What is required in wound care, and what must be modified in the wound dressings/environment, from that point onward, to encourage this?</p>

I'm not sure if this is even the right way to phrase this question, so I'll give an example. Say someone stays up to 3AM every day for a week.

"Salt and bad sleep","<p>I've been having more and more problems with salt for a few years, especially late before I'm about to sleep. Eating out, beers at a pub with the associated salty nuts and food or a barbeque at home will render a night of bad sleep, nightmares and constipation the next day. Cutting down on salt is an obvious answer and I cook most meals from scratch with no or very little salt, bake my own bread (most recipes calls for 2 % salt, I find it salty enough at 0.5 %) but many ingredients come very salty as is, cheese and soy sauce to name a few which are too much work to make from scratch. Cooking myself usually solves the problem most of the time but eating out can't be avoided sometimes.</p>

<p>I can reduce the problem by drinking plenty of water before going to bed, but I will wake up to pee in the middle of the night and the urine is very diluted so I assume I drank more water than needed to keep the salt balance (I've read 0.6 % blood salt concentration), but I can still very much feel the effect.</p>

<p>Otherwise I'm slightly overweight but do cardio for 6-9 hours per week (cycling, skiing or running) so I'm definitely working on it and my stamina is better than most people my age, have no trouble sleeping and almost never constipated.</p>

One and a half years since I posted this. Did see a physician who did take the time to do the blood work. Salt balance as in sodium to potassium balance was normal as was the overall salinity.

"Does wart treatment (such as freezing) kill the wart or only triger the bodies natural immune reaction?","<p>I’ve heard competing claims about (plantar) wart treatment. Some doctors say freezing it with liquid nitrogen is to kill the wart, while trying to minimize the damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Other doctors say it is just to irritate the body enough to stimulate the natural immune system response, and that’s what gets rid of the wart. Can the body’s own immune system be enough to get rid of the wart?</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantar_wart#Relative_effectiveness"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia article</a> has a small note, in a confusing section, that reads</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This last point implies that in the case of plantar warts it was
  likely the patients own immune system responsible for resolution and
  not the specific treatment.</p>

<p>I saw <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfR6bAXr-c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this video</a> discussing how/why OMAD works. If I understand this correctly, by only eating a single meal glucose/insulin levels in your body are allowed to drop, and ketosis is allowed to start providing more stable energy release throughout the day and to use up energy stored in fat cells. Is that a correct understanding?</p>

<p>Given that, is it advisable to eat a carb heavy single meal? I would imagine that would cause glucose levels to spike - does that then get stored back into fat cells thus preventing weight loss?</p>

Now in my fifties I'm beginning to have issues of backpain. The medical tests put it down to ageing but (now the question) could it be long-term effects of 
the childhood TB?
Lastly, as I have some training as a paramedic, could you direct me to some bibliography?
Thank you </p>

"Awkward: TWINS, but from DIFFERENT DADS? How rare is heteropaternal superfecundation (statistics)?","<p>This is not a Jerry Springer headline -- despite all the sizzling, implicit drama involved -- <em>heteropaternal superfecundation</em> is a fertilization term when a woman is successfully impregnated by different/multiple men in the same ovulation cycle. </p>

<p>We all know that kitten and puppies from the same litter can be fathered by multiple males (yay for a variety of breeds!)... And we don't typically associate human pregnancies in the same boat because... to be fair... this is quite rare. <strong>But how rare is it?</strong> Statistics?</p>

<ul>
<li>So the infants are <strong>fraternal twins AND half-siblings</strong>? Is there a <strong>term</strong> that comprises this relationship.</li>
<li>What is the <strong>history</strong> behind <strong>identifying this fertilization process?</strong> <strong>When was it officially documented?</strong> Did they have any suspicions before DNA (like if children born different races)? </li>

"Risk level of formaldehyde inhalation","<p>How do I estimate the risk level of inhaling a certain level of formaldehyde in the air?</p>

<p>I looked up the EPA's assessment, and they list <a href=""https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris/iris_documents/documents/subst/0419_summary.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this summary report</a> in their IRIS database.  (By risk, do they mean the risk of developing cancer, after a lifetime of exposure at that level?  Risk of death?  How would I tell?)  In Section II.C, it lists ""Inhalation Unit Risk — 1.3E-5 per (ug/cu.m)"" as the estimated cancer risk.</p>

<p>OSHA limits workers' exposure to an average of 0.75 ppm.  </p>

<p>I'm trying to calculate the risk level that corresponds to, based on the model in the EPA report.  If I understand correctly, I first have to convert 0.75 ppm to ug/cu.m.  Wikipedia lists <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollutant_concentrations"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a formula for this conversion</a>.  It appears the molecular mass of formaldehyde is about 30 g/mol, so at an ambient temperature of 72° F (22° C), 0.75 ppm apparently corresponds to 0.75 * 30 / (0.082 * 295) = 0.93 mg/m³, or equivalently, 930 ug/m³.  With the risk model listed above, this appears to correspond to a risk of 0.012.</p>

<p>So, if I understand everything correctly, it appears this model predicts a 1% risk of developing cancer over your lifetime, if exposed to formaldehyde at the OSHA's safe level continuously.  Did I do this calculation correctly?  Is that the correct interpretation?  This seems like a non-trivial risk level to accept, so I wonder if I'm interpreting everything correctly.</p>

This report is probably based on some EU-co-operation.), people that are HIV positive but on a correctly adjusted treatment are not contagious when having unprotected sex. The reason for this is that the viral load is very low.</p>

<p>How can that be?</p>

<p>Obviously the viral load is not zero because then they wouldn't be HIV positive and isn't it enough with just one virus particle being transmitted to infect someone?</p>

<p>I (think I) understand the basic statistics behind this. Hypothetically, if someone that is HIV positive but not under treatment transfer 1000 virus particles during sex and that leads to a risk of 5 % to be infected, reducing the virus load with 98 % so that only 20 virus particles are transferred during sex the risk should be reduced a corresponding amount, that is the risk is 1 ‰. Still 1 ‰ is not 0. And in the case with 1 ‰, after 100 intercourses the risk is ≈ 10 % while it after 1000 intercourses is ≈ 73 %. None of these numbers are negligable.</p>

"Breath-holding induced hypoxia and brain damage","<p>I am currently researching the ""Wim Hof Method"" a big part of which is hyperventilation and breath-holding induced hypoxia.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053942"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29053942</a></p>

<p>This study apparently demonstrates brain damage in free divers and the brain damage is proportional to breath-holding times.</p>

<p>Of course this study is small and has its limitations, but I am wondering what other data there is about voluntarily induced hypoxia and brain damage?</p>

<p>If done correctly, the Wim Hof Method should never cause you to faint, but doing it is on the edge of passing out. Some people suggest, that it is not possible to damage ones brain by breath holding, because before brain damage can occure the person faints and normal breathing resumes. However what data is there to support this claim? Surely, if you get yourself to pass out often enough it would lead to some kind of damage?</p>

<p>I have seen videos on youtube of people doing the excercise with an oximeter.</p>

<p>During the hyperventilation phase the saturation seems to be either stable or go up. At the retention (breath hold) phase the saturation sinks down to in some examples 50, which is right where one would expect to pass out.</p>

<p>What data is there, to help me understand if daily excercises like this are likely to cause brain damage?</p>

"What effect would a sperm containing XX have on a ovum and fetus?","<p>So this is just a random thought I had, while writing a story, but
I assume this is likely impossible currently, and likely in the far future aswell, but let's assume a scenario where the body that the sperm came from, was XX, instead of XY. Let's just assume through science, there were no other issues related to a different chromosome. (Maybe the organ was printed)
From what I understand, the sperm determines whether the resulting fetus is XX or XY, based on whether it carries X or Y from its creation in the original body.</p>

<p>Would a sperm producing body that has no Y, only XX (So no XXY or XYY), then essentially be incapable of producing XY children, with a XX ovum producing body?</p>

<p>Would there be other potential issues for the mother or the fetus/child?</p>

<p>I imagine with organ printing not being a impossible feat(at this level, and not yet anyway), this could be a hypothetical scenario for a FtM transgender in the future aswell, but mostly I was just curious on the conception of it.</p>

<p>TLDR: A XX sperm (whether possible or not), and a XX ovum, would only be able to create a XX fetus, and never a XY, yes?</p>

"How to calculate my ""approximate"" mortality rate while in ICU?","<p>To make a long story as short as possible for context, I was rushed to the ER while in cardiac arrest back in 2014. Heart stopped beating momentarily and lost oxygen to the part of my brain. None of the doctors were able to completely figure out the cause of what triggered the event, but I was ultimately diagnosed with two main illnesses which I want to focus on as they are the most significant to me in the calculation I want to get to, if that's possible.</p>

<p>I was primarily diagnosed with Sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. When I was discharged from the ICU, the ER doctor who treated me told me that when I was admitted, my mortality rate was over 80% (thank you so much to the amazing staff at my hospital, forever grateful!!).</p>

<p>I know he factored in the cardiac arrest and other issues I had when initially admitted, but I would like to know my likely/average/rough estimate/<em>I'm-not-sure-what-correct-term</em> (if there is one) mortality rate was, factoring in <strong>only</strong> the sepsis and ARDs. I read on Wikipedia (not the best source, I know...) that the mortality rate for sepsis ranges from 30%-80%, and ARDs is anywhere from 35%-50%. Is there a way to calculate some form of mortality rate from these two ranges? Or would it not make sense? I was 18 at the time, smoked ~half a pack of cigarettes a day, tad bit underweight (I believe I was around 120ish at 5'9"", curse you ADHD medication!), but otherwise was a healthy male for being 18yo and stupid, if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>P.S. For those wondering why I want to know some sort of figure for this, I'm writing a post asking those who are healthy and able to donate plasma to consider doing so, as I received a substantial amount of PRP treatments, as well as a multiple bags of donated plasma while in ICU. I knew I received this treatment, but I just read this <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5455304/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">research article</a> by the American Thoracic Society, which was published on June 24, 2014 - <strong>less than 3 months</strong> before I got sick and was treated with this therapy. I wonder if my Pulmonologist who treated me in the ICU came across this article during his research, as he stayed up many nights during my stay reading case studies, and his first treatment he requested permission from my parents was therapeutic hypothermia, which I know is considered controversial/ineffective by certain medical professionals, so considering the fact he was trying everything he could to save me, I'm not sure if this PRP treatment for sepsis resulting in ARDs was also considered new (admittedly haven't read the entire paper!).</p>

"Some clarity about HPV","<p>I have experienced two separate episodes of HPV as warts in my body; the fist one was on my foot sole, the second in my genital area. I had the one in my foot for months until it got inflamed due to too much standing and I had it removed in ten days with vinegar. I did the same treatment with the genital one, same outcome. I do not know how effective is acid on the virus. Certainly acid deteriorates the whole epithelial environment facilitating wart detachment. It would be interesting to extend this discussion also to the effects of acid on the virus. But this in not what I want to know. My questions are: is the virus limited to the area where it overtly manifest itself (warts) or once you get infected the virus spreads everywhere in your body? Was I free from the virus once I removed the wart?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HPV infection is limited to the basal cells of stratified epithelium, the only tissue in which they replicate.[95] The virus cannot bind to live tissue; instead, it infects epithelial tissues through micro-abrasions or other epithelial trauma that exposes segments of the basement membrane.[95]  (From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection#Hands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection#Hands</a>)</p>

<p>It seems the virus in limited to the skin.
It is rarely heard of HPV manifesting in different areas other than hands, feet and genitalia. Any particular reason? Does the immune system keep it limited to those areas? </p>

<p>My next question would have been: is there a cure?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is currently no specific treatment for HPV infection.[162][163][164] However, the viral infection, more often than not, clears to undetectable levels by itself.[165] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the body's immune system clears HPV naturally within two years for 90% of cases (see Clearance subsection in Virology for more detail).[162] However, experts do not agree on whether the virus is completely eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels, and it is difficult to know when it is contagious.[166] (From <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection#Hands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection#Hands</a>)</p>

  <p>The virus is unusually hardy, and is immune to most common disinfectants.

"Are there risks to long term use of IUSs?","<p>The IUS is similar to the intrauterine device (IUD), but instead of releasing copper like the IUD, it releases the hormone progestogen into the womb (<a href=""https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/contraception/ius-intrauterine-system/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NHS 2018</a>).</p>

<p>It thickens the cervical mucus, which makes it more difficult for sperm to move through the cervix, and thins the lining of the womb so an egg is less likely to be able to implant itself.</p>

<p>For some women, it can also prevent the release of an egg each month (ovulation), but most women continue to ovulate.</p>

<p>When looking at possible side effects of progestogen, WebMD states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The progesterone prescription products that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are <strong>LIKELY SAFE</strong> for most people when used by mouth, applied to the skin, applied into vagina, or injected into the muscle with the advice and care of a healthcare professional. However, progesterone can cause many side effects including stomach upset, changes in appetite, weight gain, fluid retention and swelling (edema), fatigue, acne, drowsiness or insomnia, allergic skin rashes, hives, fever, headache, depression, breast discomfort or enlargement, premenstrual syndrome (PMS)-like symptoms, altered menstrual cycles, irregular bleeding, and other side effects (<a href=""https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-760/progesterone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebMD, n.d.</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a concern that some progestogens cause adverse metabolic effects, including alterations in lipoprotein fractions and carbohydrate intolerance.

<li>Out of 100 obese people how many have a poorer diet than the average healthy, non-obese person of their age and gender?</li>
<li>Out of 100 obese people how many do less physical activity than the average healthy, non-obese person of their age and gender?</li>
</ul>

<p>By knowing these numbers governments would have a better idea how to fight obesity: e.g. should they promote food with fewer calories, or should they promote physical activity? (However, this is just an example, and in this question I'm interested in the numbers above rather than on the best ways for governments to fight obesity.)</p>

<p>I understand that obesity is caused by a combination of factors, and for helping a person become less obese, all factors should be considered personally for them. Nevertheless, I'm still interested in the numbers above.</p>

<p>I understand that even these numbers don't paint the full picture, because we don't know e.g. how many of them eat more calories and do less physical activity (at the same time).</p>

<p>I also understand that it's possible to eat (a bit) more and not become obese, e.g. if also doing more physical activity.</p>

<p>If there are similar factor breakdown numbers available publicly, I'm interested in them.</p>

"Does the delivery of BMP-12,-13,-14 (either in form of a gene or a protein) into an injured tendon help improve healing in humans?","<p>I have read that delivery of BMP-12,-13,-14 (either in form of a gene or a protein) into an injured tendon improved healing, but I haven't been able yet to find an in-vivo study in humans confirming it.</p>

<p>For example, the 2007 {1} study showed that BMP-14 gene therapy increases tendon tensile strength in a rat model of Achilles tendon injury:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The results of this animal study suggest that gene therapy with BMPs may improve the capacity of injured musculoskeletal tissue to heal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2001 study {2} was tested on chickens:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We conclude that BMP-12 gene transfer is a promising procedure for improving the tendon repair process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 1999 study {3} was tested on rats:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rats were killed after 2 weeks and the tensile strength of the tendon regenerate was found to be increased by both proteins in a seemingly dose-dependent manner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2019 study {5} was tested on rabbits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rotator cuff regeneration achieved by BMP-12-overexpressing BM-MSCs-loaded PLGA scaffolds may represent a novel approach for the management of rotator cuff defect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The 2017 study {4} was tested on humans but it  was in vitro:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BMP-12 activates tenogenic pathway in hASCs but also affects secretory activity and impairs immunomodulatory potential of this population that can influence the clinical outcome after cell transplantation.</p>

"What would a nearly-universal list of medical specialties look like","<p>I need to create easy to read universal list of medical specialties. This goal seems impossible if taking into account subspecialties - in most countries they are pretty different. Since there are no worldwide agreements on how to group specialties, I decided to group it by the medicine branch it belongs to. </p>

<p><strong>I need help clarifying what specialties and subspecialties exist, and how they are related.</strong></p>

<p>As a basis I took a list of medical branches from wikipedia:</p>

<pre><code>  Anesthesiology
  Cardiology
  Critical care medicine
  Dentistry
  Dermatology
  Emergency medicine
  Endocrinology
  Epidemiology
  First aid
  Gastroenterology
  General practice/Family medicine
  Geriatrics
  Gynaecology
  Hematology
  Hepatology
  Infectious disease
  Internal medicine
  Neurology
  Nephrology
  Obstetrics
  Oncology
  Ophthalmology
  Optometry
  Orthopaedics
  Otorhinolaryngology
  Pathology
  Pediatrics
  Preventive medicine
  Psychiatry
  Pulmonology
  Radiology
  Sports medicine
  Rheumatology
  Surgery
  Urology
</code></pre>

<p>Then I google a list of medical specialties and try to put it all together.
This is the first link from google:
<a href=""https://www.sgu.edu/blog/medical/ultimate-list-of-medical-specialties/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.sgu.edu/blog/medical/ultimate-list-of-medical-specialties/</a></p>

<p>Lets take a look on how do they group <strong>Surgery</strong>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Dy6v.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Dy6v.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>They put <strong>Paediatric Surgery</strong> into <strong>Surgery</strong>. Fair enough.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oSrlp.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oSrlp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> </p>

<p>Lets see <strong>Pediatrics</strong> group:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cwu0E.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cwu0E.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Almost all specialties constructed as two medical branches joined together: </p>

<p><strong>Pediatric Cardiology</strong>, <strong>Pediatric Endocrinology</strong>. Are there any unique specialties in Pediatrics? Why we don't put it into Endocrinology, Cardiology groups? What brach of medicine has more weight when grouping specialties? </p>

<p>As I understand, if you are Cardiologist, you can perform Pediatric Cardiology procedures also, and it should be your subspecialty. So for <strong>Surgery</strong> they did right grouping, but for pediatrics, we should leave only those specialties that are unique for this branch of medicine only.  </p>

<p>And the biggest issue. There are such branches as:</p>

<p><strong>Internal medicine</strong></p>

<p><strong>General practice/Family medicine</strong></p>

<p>Lets take a look at Internal Medicine</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zEL3p.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zEL3p.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Almost all specialties just repeat existing medicine branches.</p>

<p>Aren't Internal Medicine doctors are more generic? Seems like <code>oncology</code> requires Oncologist, which can have also different areas of expertise, but not Internal Medicine doctor. </p>

<p><strong>How can I better conceptualize how specialties and subspecialties are divided up?</strong></p>

"Safety of low dose testosterone therapy on biologically female individuals?","<p>With the raising awareness about gender identity and specifically the recognition of non-binary identities, new challenges are faced by medicine.
Specifically, there are individuals who don't feel comfortable with their own sexual characteristic but they don't desire a full transition to the opposite gender. 
In this case, many patients seek a low dose hormone replacement therapy(or ""microdosing""). </p>

<p>Testosterone replacement therapy is considered safe in transgender men, but there isn't any study about long term effect of a low dose on non-binary biologically female individuals(reaching serum testosterone levels above female range but not in the normal male range and without hormonal suppression of the ovary function with GnRH analogs).</p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has experience with this. There are many questions that arise for example: will the ovary over time diminish permanently their estrogen production?
Can this low dose therapy increase the risk of osteoporosis? Can it cause metabolic complications? etc.</p>

99% of GROUP M have survived.

"What things can trigger scintillating scotomas? Are they sometimes classified benign and not a reflection of a condition requiring further treatment?","<p>This is a different question than <a href=""https://psychology.stackexchange.com/q/21153/19214"">Are scintillating scotomas really caused by cortical spreading depression? If so, how is this known to be true?</a> asked almost one year ago in Psychology and Neurology SE, but I have copied most of the supporting material here.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What things can trigger scintillating scotomas? Can they sometimes be classified as benign and not a reflection of some condition requiring further treatment?</p>

<hr>

<p>I have read about a visual effect called a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scintillating scotoma</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many variations occur, but scintillating scotoma usually begins as a spot of flickering light near or in the center of the visual field, which prevents vision within the scotoma area. The affected area flickers but is not dark. It then gradually expands outward from the initial spot. Vision remains normal beyond the borders of the expanding scotoma(s), with objects melting into the scotoma area background similarly to the physiological blind spot, which means that objects may be seen better by not looking directly at them in the early stages when the spot is in or near the center. </p>
  
  <p>[...]The visual anomaly results from abnormal functioning of portions of the occipital cortex at the back of the brain, not in the eyes nor any component thereof, such as the retinas.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3RMyT.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a> This is a different disease from retinal migraine, which is monocular (only one eye).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a phenomenon that is believed to occur in the brain. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scintillating scotomas are most commonly caused by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_spreading_depression"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cortical spreading depression</a>, a pattern of changes in the behavior of nerves in the brain during a migraine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That article is short and includes an <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Santos_E_et_al_Neuroimage_2014_.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">impressive looking GIF</a> of an optical image of the brain showing a wave-like pattern of blood volume which seems to come from the YouTube video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td1EQ0WQAng"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spreading Depolarization viewed using IOS. Santos et al. Neuroimage 2014</a> which links to Santos, E. et al. <em>Radial, spiral and reverberating waves of spreading depolarization occur in the gyrencephalic brain</em> NeuroImage, 99, 1 Oct. 2014, pp244-255.</p>

<p>The first Wikipedia <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scintillating_scotoma"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> also says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Symptoms typically appear gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and generally last fewer than 60 minutes, leading to the headache in classic migraine with aura, or resolving without consequence in acephalgic migraine. Many migraine sufferers change from scintillating scotoma as a prodrome to migraine to scintillating scotoma without migraine. Typically the scotoma resolves spontaneously within the stated time frame, leaving no subsequent symptoms, though some report fatigue, nausea, and dizziness as sequelae.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't completely understand the language there; I am not sure if it means that scintillating scotoma is always associated with some kind of migraine, or if they also occur as isolated events.</p>

"Why would anyone use finasteride (propecia) over minoxidil (Rogaine) for hair loss?","<p>So as I understand it, there are two main solutions for male pattern baldness:</p>

<p>Finasteride and Minoxidil. </p>

<p>Finasteride works by reducing the production of some hormone that is damaging to the follicles, so already I am not a fan since it's a hormone treatment rather than an actual scalp treatment. On the other hand, Minoxidil is a pure scalp treatment. It actually is <em>about</em> your hair and helping it grow.</p>

<p>Finasteride is also quite expensive. Minoxidil is far cheaper, since you can buy 3 flasks that will last you several months, while 1 package of Finasteride pills only last 30 days. </p>

<p>Finasteride has many (serious) side-effects. There are sexual side-effects, possible risks of prostate cancer, and some men even get boobs. I know the last one is quite rare, but the sexual side-effects are worryingly common. I've read it happens to roughly 5 % of users ... that is <strong>a lot</strong>, in my honest opinion. On the other hand, Minoxidil's worst side-effect is probably some rash or something. </p>

<p>So with all this in mind, why in the world would anybody choose Finasteride over Minoxidil? At least one ought to try Minoxidil first, no, and then only go to Finasteride if Minoxidil don't work?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Race horses are especially prone to injuries of the tendon and ligaments. Conventional therapies are very unsuccessful in returning the horse to full functioning potential. Natural healing, guided by the conventional treatments, leads to the formation of fibrous scar tissue that reduces flexibility and full joint movement. Traditional treatments prevented a large number of horses from returning to full activity and also have a high incidence of re-injury due to the stiff nature of the scarred tendon. Introduction of both bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, along with natural mechanical stimulus promoted the regeneration of tendon tissue. The natural movement promoted the alignment of the new fibers and tendocytes with the natural alignment found in uninjured tendons. Stem cell treatment not only allowed more horses to return to full duty and also greatly reduced the re-injury rate over a three-year period.[78]</p>
  
  <p>The use of embryonic stem cells has also been applied to tendon repair. The embryonic stem cells were shown to have a better survival rate in the tendon as well as better migrating capabilities to reach all areas of damaged tendon. The overall repair quality was also higher, with better tendon architecture and collagen formed. There was also no tumor formation seen during the three month experimental period. Long-term studies need to be carried out to examine the long-term efficacy and risks associated with the use of embryonic stem cells.[78] Similar results have been found in small animals.[78]</p>

"Disinfectant spray in first aid kit for cycling and hiking?","<p>On a recent bike trip I slipped on a gravel road and got abrasion around the knee. The wound was dirty with gravel dust and I instinctively cleaned it with water from my drinking bottle. Then I went to a pharmacy and got it disinfected (Octenisept, wound disinfectant) and then covered with a sterile patch. A few days later I want to my physician and she did the same thing again.</p>

<p>There are a lot of affordable first aid kits available in outdoor shops and I want to get one for the next trip. All of them contain various bandages and compresses. Disinfectant spray seems to be missing, though. My experience now is that the essentials for abrasions are spray and some bandage to keep out the dirt.</p>

<p>While trying to research this, I found a <a href=""https://www.drk.de/hilfe-in-deutschland/erste-hilfe/erste-hilfe-online/wunden/verbote-bei-wunden/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">help page of the German Red Cross</a> stating that it is <em>forbidden</em> to (a) touch, (b) clean, (c) apply powder, creams, sprays, disinfectants and (d) remove foreign matter. Exceptions are just thermal and acid burns as well as rabis bite wounds. Any wound <em>must</em> be treated by a doctor as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If I apply that to my case, I would have taken a bandage from my (to be purchased) first aid kit and wrap it around the wound with all the dust still in it. Then I would have to go to the ER of the next hospital.</p>

<p>In contrast, the manufacturer of the spray <a href=""http://www.octenisept.de/octenisept/produkte/octenisept-wund-desinfektion/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">writes</a> that it intended for small wounds like cuts and abrasions that happen during sports. And it gives instructions for usage, so this implies that a layperson should apply it to wounds.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is also a legal issue? The Red Cross addresses the general public which tries to help but sometimes overdoes it. So they just state that one should be very conservative when helping. Say one applies the wrong kind of disinfectant spray and it makes it just worse. In Germany you are not liable if you just try to help (to some extent). Perhaps this waiver stops right where you apply things and not just a sterile bandage? So even though in this particular situation it would be the right thing, a layperson would not know and therefore the general advice is conservative?</p>

<p>Please excuse my medical naivity, but isn't applying water and then desinfectant spray better than just wrapping up the dirt?</p>

"Link between shaving body hair and weaker scalp hair","<p>I suppose this question can be addressed to both males and females, but it would be interesting to know if it varies between the two genders (hormones, etc).</p>

<p>I want to know if shaving body hair (chest, legs, armpit, etc...) or even facial hair (beard) has an impact on the hair in your scalp? Will it deplete the body of nutrients like keratin and vitamins that are needed in keeping a strong, healthy head of  hair? Will it <strong>accelerate</strong> existing hair loss resulting from androgenic alopecia (Male pattern baldness)?</p>

<p>Here is my hypothesis: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Human hair needs nutrients from the blood to keep the follicle
  healthy. If you shave body hair it will obviously  grow back, but this requires
  nutrients. The same nutrients could have been used to go towards the
  scalp hair and keeping it healthy and strong. But instead, more of the
  body's resources are going towards other hairs and as a result will
  deplete the scalp from nutrients and cause weak limp hair. And if you
  are already predisposed to hair loss (via genetics), then this will
  result in an accelerated rate of hair fall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am curious to see if anyone has done any research or if there are any studies on this. Obviously there are many <em>swimmers</em> or <em>cyclists</em> who shave their entire bodies and still have luscious strong hair which can only attributed to 'good' genetics and healthy active lifestyles. If anyone has done any research that either supports or disproves my hypothesis, do not hesitate to leave a response!</p>

"Why is there no toxoplasmosis vaccine?","<p>I assume there is some misunderstanding on my part about the vaccine-creation-process and which factors play a role in it.
Below is my current understanding.</p>

<p><strong>About toxoplasmosis:</strong></p>

<p>Toxoplasmosis is a disease that can infect both humans and cats. It doesn't have a lot of symptoms, i.e. if you have it, you might not even notice. After you have had it, you are immune to further infection because your body has toxoplasmosis-antibodies now.</p>

<p>Toxoplasmosis is dangerous in one situation: if a pregnant woman gets it, it may cause disabilities in the baby (even at later ages when he/she grows up) or even abortion. This can only happen if the woman has not had the disease earlier in life, because then she would be immune.
(It's also dangerous for people with a weakened immune system, such as hiv-patients, but you can't vaccinate them anyway so let's disregard them for this question.)</p>

<p><strong>About vaccines:</strong></p>

<p>Vaccines are weakened or dead virusses/microbes that cause a certain disease. The body recognises them as a threat, makes the appropriate antibodies and remembers these antibodies in case it encounters this disease again. When the non-weakened disease shows up, the body doesn't need the time to invent/create the antibodies anymore, so it can start to destroy the disease before it becomes too strong.</p>

<p>This only works for diseases for which your body can invent antibodies (given enough time), for which it will remember the antibodies and for which the pathogens don't evolve fast.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Why is there no toxoplasmosis-vaccine available? It seems toxoplasmosis is an ideal vaccine-candidate: the body can create antibodies and will remember them. The pathogen doesn't even need to be dead or weakened, since the symptoms for the disease are so low. It seems to me that this vaccine would be ""just"" inserting the toxoplasmosis-germs into the patients blood.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about a vaccine for women who are not pregnant. Obviously inserting toxoplasmosis into pregnant women is a bad idea.</p>

<p><strong>Possibilities that I thought of:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite, which may be too big of a difference with virusses/mirobes to create a vaccine out of? But why would that be harder?</p></li>
<li><p>Toxoplasmosis may have annoying pathogens, that don't want to survive and reproduce in a lab, so you'd have to hunt the parasites down in ""the wild"" for every vaccine, which doesn't seem to be feasible.</p></li>
<li><p>Something causes such a vaccine to be too expensive for the hasstle.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody wants to fund research to create such a vaccine, because other diseases are more dangerous.</p></li>
</ul>

"Safety of radiation from baby monitor","<p>I have always assumed baby monitors and all wireless technology to be completely safe and have been informed by a 'friend' that I have been endangering my children by using them.</p>

<p>We used an RF detector to measure exposure and it amounted to a constant level of 10mw/m2 in the crib, whereas, for comparison, my cell phone at 30 cm distance measured occasional peaks of 1mw/m2. More advanced wifi monitors measure up to 100mw/m2.</p>

<p>There has been a 60-fold increase in ASD in recent years, which cannot be accounted for by improvements in diagnostic methods and can only be explained by changes in the environment. This increase corresponds in time to the proliferation of mobile telecommunications, Wi-Fi, and microwave ovens as well as extremely low frequency fields from household wiring and domestic appliances. We can now explain at least some of this in terms of electromagnetically-induced membrane leakage leading to brain hyperactivity and abnormal brain development. Dr. Andrew Goldsworthy, former lecturer Imperial College London [1] Andrew Goldsworthy, The Biological Effects of Weak Electromagnetic Fields, MCSA NEWS, VOLUME seven, ISSUE 7, JULY 2012</p>

<p>And also...</p>

<p>Wireless radiation emitted by baby monitors, mobile and cordless phones, wireless modems (Wi-Fi) etc.:inhibit the formation of abnormal electromagnetic activity of the brain, which is stabilized at around age 12, which explains the increasing incidence of hyperactivity and epilepsy in children ages according to Dr. Gerard Hyland, biophysicist at Warwick University and 2 times nominated for the Nobel Prize of Medicine [3] cause the creation of many random and useless neural connections, which explains the usually larger skull of autistic children, according to Dr. Andrew Goldsworthy, former assistant of Imperial College London [4] Detunes the initial calibration of the brain networks and the mirror-neuron system in newborns, leading to autistic behavior patterns (Thornton [5]) and are a possible cause of the contemporary increase in cases of autism (Kane [6]) ""The adverse effects of electrosmog may take decades to be appreciated, although some, like carcinogenicity, are already starting to surface. This gigantic experiment on our children and grandchildren could result in massive damage to mind and body with the potential to produce a disaster of unprecedented proportions, unless proper precautions are immediately implemented."" Paul Rosch, professor of medicine at New York Medical School [7]</p>

<p>These mainly rely on evidence as reviewed in the Bioititiative Report, which I know is widely critisized.</p>

<p>I googled and found this mention of escitalopram in <em><a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1586/17446651.2014.887985?needAccess=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pheochromocytoma: pitfalls
in the biochemical evaluation</a></em> (Dobri et al., 2014): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although tricyclic antidepressants are known to increase NE/NMN levels, newer classes of antidepressants which inhibit NE neuronal reuptake are potentially associated with falsepositive results. Clinicians need to inquire about the use of
  serotonin NE reuptake inhibitors (venlafaxine, duloxetine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, <strong>escitalopram</strong>) and NE DA reuptake inhibitors (bupropion). Neary et al. reported a patient with plasma NMN > fourfolds ULN while on venlafaxine, which returned to normal 2 weeks after discontinuation of the drug [64].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this article cites only one case report, and that is not for escitalopram but for venlafaxine, which is not an SSRI but SNRI. Are there reports of escitalopram drastically affecting urinary metanephrine/normetanephrine levels?  </p>

  <p>Frank's sign is a diagonal crease in the ear lobe extending from the tragus across the lobule to the rear edge of the auricle. The sign is named after Sanders T. Frank.

"Does eating/chewing honey help prevent gingivitis, periodontal disease and dental caries?","<p>Does eating/chewing honey help prevent gingivitis, periodontal disease and dental caries?</p>

<p>The studies have found so far tend to say yes but it needs to be confirmed by other studies.</p>

<p>From {2}:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract:
  Research has shown that manuka honey has superior antimicrobial properties that can be used with success in the treatment of wound healing, peptic ulcers and bacterial gastro-enteritis. Studies have already shown that manuka honey with a high antibacterial activity is likely to be non-cariogenic. The current pilot study investigated whether or not manuka honey with an antibacterial activity rated UMF 15 could be used to reduce dental plaque and clinical levels of gingivitis. A chewable ""honey leather"" was produced for this trial. Thirty volunteers were randomly allocated to chew or suck either the manuka honey product, or sugarless chewing gum, for 10 minutes, three times a day, after each meal. Plaque and gingival bleeding scores were recorded before and after the 21-day trial period. Analysis of the results indicated that there were statistically highly significant reductions in the mean plaque scores (0.99 reduced to 0.65; p=0.001), and the percentage of bleeding sites (48% reduced to 17%; p=0.001), in the manuka honey group, with no significant changes in the control group.</p>
  
  <p>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there may be a potential therapeutic role for manuka honey confectionery in the treatment of gingivitis and periodontal disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From {1}:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Within the limitations of the study it can be concluded that topical application of honey can modify the pH, reduce bacterial counts, and inhibit bacterial growth. These data suggested that topical application/chewing of honey might help prevent gingivitis and caries in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. Further studies will be required to substantiate these preliminary observations.</p>

"Peak effect of edible marijuana 11 hours after ingestion; how is it possible?1","<p>The chocolates I've been having currently typically take about 5 hours to peak, and the last time I used them, it was literally 11 HOURS later. I ate one dose of about 4mg (I think... I lost the label but it was from a dispensary). I am sure I did not eat any other edibles in between. There's also the factor that I now drink moderate alcohol throughout the high. But can alcohol really cause the high to be so much more delayed/prolonged? Or is it something else? </p>

<p>It's also very high percentage THC and almost no CBD if I remember correctly. </p>

<p>P.S. The amount of chocolate I eat is extremely small. I usually eat literal crumbs. And this time it was a solid 1/4th chunk of a chocolate square, but still very small. So right now my working hypothesis is that there's so much dosage in so little food that there's a high amount of randomness in how it passes through my body?

"Sanity checking airplane advice re DVT: walk every hour, 2-3 hours? OK to sleep?","<p>Long plane flights carry a risk of DVT. It is easy to find advice on preventing DVT by being active:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/dvt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CDC</a> says ""walk around every 2-3 hours"" and mentions that you should do this when traveling by car also. This article also mentions that you are at higher risk of DVT if you have active cancer or are receiving chemotherapy. It recommends compression socks, too. </li>
<li><a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352557"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mayo clinic</a> says ""If you're traveling a long distance by car, stop every hour or so and walk around. If you're on a plane, stand or walk occasionally.""</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/dvt/tc/preventing-deep-vein-thrombosis-from-travel-topic-overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WebMD</a> says ""If you are traveling by car, stop every hour or so. Get out and walk around for a few minutes. If you are traveling by bus, train, or plane, get out of your seat and walk up and down the aisle every hour or so. ""</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these mention the possibility of sleeping on the plane. Are they suggesting you should not sleep? We all lie down for 8 hours or so every night, and yes, we can toss and turn a little more freely in a real bed, but I find it hard to imagine this advice means ""don't sleep, stay awake so you can walk around a lot.""</p>

<p>Further, there is a big difference between ""every hour"" and ""every two or three hours"" - and that's not counting good old ""occasionally"". None indicate whether wearing compression socks means it's safer to go for a longer interval between walks. </p>

<p>So, if a person with at least some risk factor for DVT is going on a long (11 hrs) flight, wearing compression socks, in business with a lie-flat bed, is lying flat in that bed and sleeping actually as dangerous as sitting awake in economy? What about a 13 hour flight in economy, still with the socks, is sleeping for part of that flight dangerous? This is normal sleep without the aid of Ambien or even alcohol, and thus there will be tossing and turning.</p>

<p>Why I'm asking: I have those flights in my future and a doctor told me emphatically to get up ""every hour"" on the plane and walk around. I didn't think to ask about sleep time, and I have no problem getting up once an hour while awake. But this same doctor knows that I drive two to three hours to and from my appointments, and has never said to pull over the car and walk every hour during a drive. Yet DVT isn't related to altitude, just to sitting still. So I feel the ""every hour"" is probably a little overcareful. But I am interested in what the studies show, and specifically on the matter of sleeping, in business and in economy. I am not asking for a diagnosis or to override my doctor's advice. I just want to sanity check it since we didn't discuss economy vs business and lying down to sleep. A study showing the effects of following various advice regimens (and that includes overnight flights where people slept or stayed awake) would be great.</p>

"Are generics tested for side effects?","<p>I have been reading about generics vs brand-name drugs.  I've learned that generics go through extensive testing for bioequivalence (both rate of absorption and total absorption of the active ingredient).  The statistical testing regime sounds pretty substantial to me, as far as testing of effectiveness goes.</p>

<p>Are generic drugs tested to ensure their risk of side effects will be roughly equivalent?  Or, are there reasons to believe their side effects ought to be equivalent, in magnitude and likelihood?  I understand that generics may have different inactive ingredients.  Could this cause the risk of side effects to be materially different between versions of the same drug from two different manufacturers?  Or is that super-unlikely?  Should I discount/ignore concerns about the potential for variation in side effects between manufacturers?</p>

<hr>

<p>(I do understand that there is a small risk that a patient is allergic to one particular inactive ingredient that's one formulation but not in another, but for purposes of this question, let's ignore that.  Apart from that, could there be noticeable, reproducible differences?  Or is this unlikely?)</p>

I know enough statistics to understand why claims that ""generics can be up to 45% different in effectiveness"" are highly misleading.  I've read about studies indicating that the average difference is more like 3% or so, and is probably similar to or smaller than the range of variation among different batches from the same manufacturer.  But those seem to be measured by absorption into the blood, and I'm not sure what that implies for the risk of side effects.)</p>

<p>I know every woman is different, but is it possible for a woman to feel the rupture of the follicle/release of the egg, and essentially know which ovary contributed to that month's ovulation/menstruation? Like can she tell if it was the right or left ovary? (The ovaries switch off each month, right?) Is it common or rare? </p>

<p>I know chronic high blood pressure can cause pulsatile tinnitus, but my question is directed at non-pulsatile tinnitus.</p>

<p>I see multiple possible explanations:<br>
1: High blood pressure elevates the intracochlear pressure. This might cause hearing cells to be compressed to death.</p>

<p>2: High blood pressure restricts the blood flow to the hearing apparatus, which would cause insufficient oxygen supply.</p>

"Sensitization and Ischaemia","<p>In Acupuncture, Trigger Points and Musculoskeletal Pain (3rd Edition), Baldry advances the following:</p>

<p>""When the Myofascial Trigger Point nociceptor-sensitizing substances bradykinin and prostaglandins are released into the tissues as a result of trauma-induced inflammation, they give rise to the development of both vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability.<strong>The effect of this is to cause oedema to develop with compression of veins and resultant tissue ischaemia.</strong> As a consequence of this a vicious circle is liable to be created because the ischaemia then leads to the release of still more MTrP nociceptor sensitizing chemical substances.""</p>

"Altitude Sickness & Brain Damage","<p>I stumbled on an <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-cells-into-thin-air/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> about altitude sickness and causing permanent brain damage; is there validity to this for less extreme mountaineers?</p>

<p>It is common for Colorado front rangers to ascend up a 14,000+ ft peak in one day starting from Denver @ ~5,500.</p>

<p>I myself just this last weekend went from Colo Springs (~6,100) to Monarch ski resort and summited on Murkwood Point which is 12,500 feet, thus doubling my elevation in one day.</p>

<p>It seems the difference between the climbers outlined in the article and weekend warriors like myself are that most of us don't sleep up at these altitudes. We go ski or hike and come back down that same day, spending no more than 6 hours above 12,000 feet; the article says you can contract brain damage even if you don't feel symptoms... </p>

<p>I'm curious if climbing to <em>lower-high altitudes (8,000 -13,000)</em>  is enough to trigger brain damage; in more detail, is someone coming from sea level up to 8000ft equally as bad as someone going from 8000 to 16000 (since it is 8000 altitude gain either way)? Or does it get exponentially worse the higher you get?</p>

<p>Just want to be careful, because like I said above, it is <em>very common</em> for people to ascend 6,000 - 8,000 feet in a day, e.g. doing 14ers in Colorado and in my mind, this isn't work risking your brain permanently... however, I wouldn't mind if the symptoms go away when I descend.</p>

"Why are neck and shoulder pain a common symptom of Computer Vision Syndrom (CVS)?","<p>I was learning about <a href=""http://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/protecting-your-vision/computer-vision-syndrome?sso=y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS)</a> and I noticed that it said that one of the symptoms was ""neck and shoulder pain"". What confuses me is that CVS (or digital eye strain) seem to be a problem experienced by the <strong>eyes</strong>. However the neck and shoulders don't seem to be muscles very related to the eyes but rather it seems that discomfort in these would be caused by bad posture rather than anything to do with the eyes. If that is the cause how does eye strain causes discomfort in the shoulders or neck or visa versa? </p>

<p>As anecdotal experience (I know its not scientific evidence but it might be the cause of my confusion), whenever I've personally experienced digital eye strain the major discomfort for me has been from the upper part of my eyes or headaches. I think my neck has felt a bit stiff but I find it hard to believe that there is actually some causation between the two, specially because the neck pain is an order of magnitude smaller. </p>

<p>Does someone with more knowledge on this can explain this phenomenon? If the relation between eye strain and neck pain is real it seems that if I were to look down say and bend my neck for a prolonged period of time, that should cause eye strain or if I over use my eyes (by looking at the same thing for long time, say a screen) then my neck should hurt. But it doesn't seem that any information travels from the eye to the neck to the brain (rather more directly to the brain). </p>

<p>So essentially with my mental model of how things work, it seems that neck/shoulders issue are more common accompanied to computer vision syndrome due because people that look at screens a lot might also have bad habits of posture but it doesn't seem there an actual causation of one to the other. Am I right in this?</p>

<p>I could imagine a few different scenarios:  </p>

<ul>
<li>All activity during such an episode is damaging, or preventing healing of existing damage, and should be avoided even if it does not cause discomfort</li>
<li>The body ""knows"" when the activity is damaging, and discomfort is a good way to judge how much to do</li>
<li>There is no lasting damage or episode prolonging due to activity. The patient can decide how much discomfort he is willing to endure without fearing any side effects. </li>
<li>There is no lasting damage through activity, and complete rest can be detrimental, e.g. by making the patient more sensitive/susceptible to future events. </li>
</ul>

<p>Which scenario comes closest to the truth? How can a patient decide on his activity level? What signs are there that there is too much or too little activity? </p>

<p>Also, if activities should be reduced: is there a difference between types of activities? Is an activity which relies on listening or balance worse than an activity which does not rely on them (e.g. listening to a lecture vs. taking a walk vs. sitting in a chair and reading)? Also, is an activity which is known to be irritating to either hearing (e.g. being around persistent noise) or balance (e.g. being driven in a car on a mountain road with many turns) worse than other kinds of activity? Are physical and mental activities similarly good/bad during such episodes, or is there a difference?</p>

<ul>

"What causes optical floaters to be more or less visible?","<p>When I first started getting floaters in my eyes (several years ago), my opthalmologist told me that they don't go away but over time your brain learns to ignore them/filter them out.  This seems to be largely true in my case; what, at onset, was very invasive is now mostly not a problem.  But sometimes they become more prominent again, usually for a few minutes at a time.  Is this a difference in <em>perception</em> (something is causing me to notice them more) or a difference in <em>placement</em> (they've moved into the center of my field of vision for some reason and are thus harder to ignore)?  How do floaters ""work""?</p>

<p>If this is caused by the floaters moving into particularly inconvenient spots within the eye, is their movement affected by any external factors like posture?  This morning I had a particularly bad attack of this while I was looking down and reading something, and I'd like to avoid a recurrence.  (It was a public reading and I couldn't move what I was reading from -- it had to be flat on the reading desk.)</p>

<p>In case it matters, my floaters were not caused by eye trauma or retina problems; I was told this is just part of the aging process.</p>

<p>I am not asking for a personal diagnosis.  This is a physiology question -- what's going on in the eye (or brain) when floaters are active?</p>

"Does having one's skin pores closed or open affect its health?","<p>I've stumbled upon a long marketing post about better shaving techniques and instruments, which briefly mentions that ""You should close your skin's pores after shaving by splashing your face with cold water"", but it doesn't describe how it helps anything. The goal of that post was to sell some fancy shaving tools and not really educate people about how to care for their skin (face and the rest of the body). The post however mentioned that one should soak skin in warm water before shaving, so that would mean opening the pores, which even if just for easier shaving, would also result in some additional effects on skin.</p>

<p>So what does it matter if your skin's pores are open or closed? Do you have a better chance of keeping acne off your face either way?

  <p>Sexuality and health educators often warn individuals that pre-ejaculate might have sperm in it and thus could cause a pregnancy.</p>
  
  <p>Theoretically this is true, as there might be sperm that are still “left over” in the urethra from a previous ejaculation earlier that day or earlier in that same sexual session (either because of masturbation or sexual activity with a partner). Thus if sperm are “left over” in the urethra and then a man’s Cowper’s glands release pre-ejaculatory fluid, and it comes forth to the tip of the penis during arousal, then there is a chance that some sperm could be carried in this fluid and get into his partner’s body, if they are having intercourse without a condom.</p>

"HOW and WHY does blushing occur when one is embarrassed? Linked to fight or flight primal instincts?","<p>Blushing -- that thing that happens when you get your first kiss or something embarrassing happens and the spotlight is on you -- <strong><em>WHAT</em> is it exactly? And <em>HOW</em> does it happen? And <em>WHY</em> does it happen?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>HOW?</em></strong>
We know when it happens, but what is the <strong>physiological cause</strong> of blushing? </p>

<ul>
<li>How does our body rush <em>blood to our cheeks (specifically)</em>? Is our
body really blushing everywhere, but is it because our cheeks are so
thin that cheek skin is more easily to pink up?</li>
<li><em>What is the physiological difference between blushing and flushing?</em> Like a blushed face and a flushed face? Is it because flushing is caused my physical stress of the body, where blushing is caused by emotional stress, and the body has different reactions that somehow look different?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WHY?</strong>
Most the time our body seems to react due to a physical situation, but blushing  seems like a social response that is triggered by a form of social anxiety.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Is blushing a part of the fight or flight mechanism?</em></strong>  <em>Does/Did blushing serve social or physiological benefits in a Fight or Flight scenario or was it just the results of being in a fight or flight situation?</em>

<ul>
<li>Benefits?: Is there a primal instinctive benefit that humans once had of turning red in the face in a dangerous or intense situation? Did blushing somehow scare off predators? Or it attracted a mate more in a romantic setting? </li>
<li>Result?: Whatever the reason for the fight or flight scenario, is blushing the result of being in a stressed environment? Like does the rush of blood to our brain rams up our metabolism to run? </li>

You start with full fat milk, you add some other lactic bacteria, you get quark. Which is now magically, naturally fat free? How so? Where did the fat go? Is the whey that is drained out in some versions of quark full of cream? Hardly.</p>

"What exactly is fever?","<p>Pyrexia (or fever) is mostly considered just high temperature, most often caused by infections. Especially in this time of the year, influenza infections that cause fever are quite common.</p>

<p>I would presume that the body heats up in order to kill off bacteria (similar as to why we boil water, and cook food). This doesn't really make much sense when it comes to viruses, as they do not have a similar metabolism. 
Still, one symptom of influenza is pyrexia, so I conclude that pyrexia is triggered in some part of the immune system which does not differentiate between a viral and bacterial infection. I imagine pyrexia to be the body's standard response to an intruder of any kind.
Am I right here?</p>

"Is the macro-nutrient difference between white and brown rice really that significant?","<p>I've often heard/read that brown rice is a better choice over white rice, because it contains the germ and the bran and so has higher levels of fibre, protein, fatty acids and so on... Unfortunately it takes quite a while longer to cook and doesn't really go well with some of the foods I like to eat with rice, so I usually stick to either basmati or parboiled rice... and feel guilty (I don't really, but it makes for a better story).</p>

<p>So I go into the shop and pick up three varieties of rice of the supermarket's own brand, i.e. all similar packaging/labelling, easily comparable nutritional information (all values per 100g as sold, i.e. dry, uncooked), take a photo of the nutritional information, and I find this:</p>

<p>Basmati rice:   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fat 0.9g of which saturates 0.3g<br>
  Carbohydrate 76g of which sugars &lt; 0.5g<br>
  Fibre 1.5g 
  Protein 8.6g<br>
  Salt &lt; 0.01g  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parboiled long grain rice:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fat 1g of which saturates 0.2g<br>
  Carbohydrate 77g of which sugars &lt; 0.5g<br>
  Fibre 1.7g<br>
  Protein 7.2g<br>
  Salt &lt; 0.01g  </p>

<p>Long grain brown rice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fat 2.8g of which saturates 0.7g<br>
  Carbohydrate 81g of which sugars 1.3g<br>
  Fibre 1.9g<br>
  Protein 6.7g<br>
  Salt &lt; 0.01g  </p>

<p>So this brown rice, which everybody knows as being high-fibre, contains just under 12% more fibre than parboiled rice? And a whopping 27% more fibre than basmati rice, which is about the whitest looking rice you can find? Is that it? It also seems to have the lowest protein content of all the rice varieties looked at here, how is that? I'm really confused by this. I can see a few explanations here:</p>

<ol>
<li>The difference in fibre really is that significant, although I can't see it, especially since the absolute values aren't very high either. </li>
<li>The numbers are wrong. Well, I would like others to repeat this ""experiment""/investigation in their area to see what they come up with.</li>
<li>Brown rice really isn't any better for you than white rice, with regards to fibre intake.</li>
<li>The are differences in the nutrient content of different varieties of rice that are more significant than just the mere brown/white distinction</li>

"What benefits for more EKG leads?","<p>It seems that the 12-lead EKG is the gold standard for diagnosing many heart problems, but they're limited to fairly short samples (e.g. 30 minutes). Its possible to send a patient home for several days to be monitored with a 3-lead Holter Monitor, or a Zio patch, which clearly does better at detecting transient heart issues, but is limited by the number of leads (?).</p>

<p>Putting aside the additional differences in the monitoring period, what might you hope to be able to diagnose with a 12 lead EKG vs, the single or 3 lead ambulatory monitors?</p>

"When would estimates of renal function based on serum and urine measurements differ as greatly as one being normal and the other suggesting CKD 3b?","<p>Renal function (GFR or creatinine clearance) as estimated by serum creatinine and 24-hour urine collection should in theory closely correlate.  </p>

<p>However, I have run into a case where they differ greatly.  The serum creatinine was measured twice at two separate labs and were in normal range at 0.89 and 1.0 mg/dL, yielding a calculated CrCl of 115 and approx 90. However, the 24-hour urine creatinine clearance results yielded 38 ml/min and 5 ml/min, which would be either acute kidney injury / acute renal failure, or chronic kidney disease / failure (CKD stage 3b and CKD stage 5 respectively).  The test was again repeated a third time and again resulted in 1.0mg/dl but this time a CrCl 70 mg/dl.</p>

<p>This is a huge difference with large ramifications in terms of diagnosis and treatment.  The question is: </p>

<h2>What could be the reason for this, and <strong>which measurement is the more reliable one?</strong></h2>

<p>I've read several studies that concluded that the serum creatinine alone was actually a better predictor of GFR than urine creatine clearance over 24, 4, and 2h. Every cohort study I found online shows an upper margin of error of around 30% where predicted values from serum creatinine fall and measured clearance levels.  </p>

<hr>

<p>There are various factors at play here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The GFR to serum creatinine is a hyperbolic relation which is a bad function for estimating values greater than 60 ml/min and even as low as 45 ml/min: 
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZmeBU.png"" alt=""hyper]([![enter image description here"">]<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZmeBU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a> As you can see the entire range of values for GFR is estimated over a small fraction of .5 mg/dl difference whereas values lower than 30 range over 20 mg/dl serum creatinine.</p></li>

"Is it possible for a specific brand of a vaccine (for Leptospirosis in dogs) to cause hepatic side effects?","<p>I am a veterinarian in Europe and I am facing an unusual case.</p>

<p>Within the last month, I have seen two different young dogs (3 years and 4 years old) to whom I administered a tetravalent vaccine for Leptospirosis (commercialized since 2012). These are inactivated vaccines which are administered yearly.</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the two dogs was previously using a similar vaccine from a different brand.</li>
<li>The other dog was administered the same vaccine last year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both dogs had no signs of disease at the time of the vaccination.</p>

<p>After about 2 weeks from the date of the vaccination, both dogs developed jaundice and anorexia and signs of hepatic failure in lab tests.</p>

<p>In subsequent ultrasound and x-rays, we observed microhepaty in both dogs, the cause of which (congenital vascular defect or chronic) is at present unknown.  Given the age of the dogs, we believe that the microhepaty is congenital; in this case, it is possible that this condition is initially asymptomatic but appears as the animal ages.</p>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>could the signs of hepatic failure be seen as a side effect of the vaccine (compounded by the preexisting microhepaty)?</li>
<li>could the brand (or the batch) of the vaccine have a role?  Note the batch numbers for the two vaccines are different in one digit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Further notes:</p>

<li>we and other colleagues have been administering the same vaccines regularly with no similar findings for years</li>

<p>Being inundated with all kinds of 5G health statements, (for &amp; against), I noticed a weird trend - <strong><em>the absence of cumulative radiation studies</em></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Question:</h1>

<p><strong>What are the health risks of low-frequency radiation, in I.T. edge cases</strong> where there is a far more significant amount of cumulative exposure? - that is, coming from many different sources at once for prolonged periods.</p>

<p><strong>Case:</strong> I.T. professionals surrounded by 2.5GHz, 5GHz, 40GHz, signals, etc., in addition to 3G, 4G, 5G, etc.  But, the distinction here is that these I.T. professionals are often, (as in the case of Q.A. teams), surrounded by hundreds of these devices at once.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Background:</h1>

<p><strong>According to the NY Times:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/science/5g-cellphones-wireless-cancer.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The 5G Health Hazard That Isn’t</a></strong> - Human skin blocks the even higher frequencies of sunlight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But, the LA Times mentions this:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Is 5G technology dangerous? Early data shows a slight increase of tumors in male rats exposed to cellphone radiation</strong> - The rats were exposed to nine hours of radiation daily, in 10-minutes-on, 10-minutes-off intervals, over their whole bodies for two years. The researchers found increased incidences of rare brain and heart tumors starting at about the federally allowable level of cellphone radiation for brain exposure, with greater incidences at about two and four times those levels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it seems that there is at least some sort of potential for 5G to be dangerous in certain unusual edge cases.</p>

<p>But, what are the radiation health risks for I.T. professionals who are certainly in those edge cases - and much, much, more exposed?</p>

<p>While trying to find this study online today, I realized that while there are many ways to evaluate ""hydration"", from simple (thirst, urinary output, urine specific gravity) to complex (serum osmolality, isotope dilution, neutron activation analysis (?), bioelectrical impedance, and others), I am only familiar with a few of these.</p>

<p><strong>Edited to clarify my intention with this question:</strong> I'm not asking about people in obvious need of fluids and how to measure success of rehydration. I'm asking more about average healthy people who know the benefits of hydration and therefore try to stay hydrated. Is there a best way to measure that they are, indeed, optimally hydrated?

"When taking antibiotics, does every single germ have to die?","<p>When I get sick and need to take antibiotics, I get admonished to carry the treatment until the end, otherwise I am breeding antibiotic-resistant superbugs.

<p>I think I understand the mechanism. When I take the antibiotic, the germs do not like it, but are not killed immediately. They suffer and suffer in the course of days. The weaker germs die first and the die hard ones, those who already possess some resistance due to random genetic mutations, die last. Therefore, the overall average antibiotic resistance of the germs in my body is <strong>rising</strong> in the course of the treatment and then suddenly drops to zero as all the germs are dead.

"Does light pollution affect sleep quality while already asleep?","<p>Many articles on internet write about melatonin and its effects (making you tired). A ton of articles also point out how the use of devices before going to bed in modern times possibly decrease the melatonin production. Therefore, (I assume) likely making it harder to fall asleep. But this is all about the process of getting to sleep, before we actually sleep.</p>

<p>A recent Harvard Medical article<sup>1</sup> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>High exposure to bright, artificial outdoor lights during the night may result in sleepless nights for older adults.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Referring to a publication on Nov. 15, 2018 in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.</em></p>

<p>Since many people use their mobile devices in bed up to a few minutes before actually going to sleep and considering the fact that modern cities have street lights that are always enabled at night.</p>

<p>If we ignore the melatonin that is used in the process of getting to sleep but only focus on the sleeping time, during the actual sleep cycles.</p>

<p>Does a darker room with less or no light pollution (by the use of curtains or disabling all artificial lights in the room) improve sleep quality (with all associated health benefits)? In other words does light pollution, while asleep worsen the sleep quality or does it only make a difference during the “falling asleep” stage?</p>

<p>I wasn't able to find any studies or information regarding sleep quality in relation with light pollution during sleep. Were such studies performed? Also, I wonder if there are specific moments when the light pollution affects sleep quality the most, for example during REM-sleep or in a specific phase?</p>

<p>If they are avoiding weight on their injured leg and mainly using their contralateral leg, shouldn't they experience some cartilage deterioration in the contralateral as well due to the gait asymmetry? Is it because they did not have cartilage damage from the injury in that leg?</p>

<p>I am an engineering student studying biomechanics, but I am trying to understand the importance and relationships between ACL reconstruction and development of OA.</p>

<p>While we're here, also the injured leg experiences decreased knee flexion angle after injury. Does this affect cartilage deterioration if you are applying less forces from the flexion?</p>

"How many people die due to various substance (illegal ones/legal/dangerous ones) per user?","<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gi9FM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/gi9FMm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>It says 88000 people die from Alcohol related causes</p>

<p>What I want to know is the number of people that die compared to the number of alcohol users.</p>

<p>Then I want to compare that with the same ratio for</p>

<ol>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Cigarettes</li>
<li>LSD</li>
<li>MDMA</li>
<li>Meth</li>
<li>Heroin</li>
<li>Cocaine</li>
<li>Crack Cocaine
How many death per users per year?</li>
</ol>

<p>Is death per user increase or decrease in places where those are legal/criminalized?</p>

<p>How do I get that data? Anyone studying this?</p>

<p>It's a simple statistic. </p>

<p>If I did some research I often see graphs like this</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c5FVD.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c5FVDm.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The graphs are too subjective. One is made by lancet I think. I forget the rest. I will find some sources. However, I am just pointing out that the graphs are too subjective.</p>

<p>The lancet source is this
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse</a></p>

<a href=""https://rollsafe.org/mdma/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://rollsafe.org/mdma/</a></p>

<p>However, this may not convince many skeptics.</p>

<p>The graphs simply say MDMA is less dangerous than alcohol. Danger is subjectively defined.</p>

<p>So I tried something objective.</p>

<p>How many people that use MDMA will die due to MDMA.</p>

<p>I will also take into account that MDMA are less addictive. So yes. We will be comparing those who use MDMA like once every 2 months with heavy smokers. It's still a fair comparison because cigarettes are addictives and MDMA isn't.</p>

<p>I wonder if such research have been done?</p>

<p>Another thing I want to examine will be dangerous that doesn't lead to death. Things like permanent IQ decrease, for example. However, this question ask about something whose meaning is obvious. Death.</p>

<p>Another useful stats is usage vs <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_potential_life_lost"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_potential_life_lost</a></p>

<p>I wonder if there is any research on that.</p>

<p>This one says that there are 600 death due to MDMA usage <a href=""https://drugwarfacts.org/node/3484"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://drugwarfacts.org/node/3484</a></p>

<p>However, it doesn't tell how many people use MDMA in US. So I can't compute the ratio and compare the ration with cigarettes.</p>

<p>Sample of good answer will be something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://thedea.org/mdma-risks-science-and-statistics-technical-faq/mdma-molly-ecstasy-use-and-death-rate-statistics/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://thedea.org/mdma-risks-science-and-statistics-technical-faq/mdma-molly-ecstasy-use-and-death-rate-statistics/</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The death rate for MDMA, assuming that there really were about 60
  deaths directly caused by MDMA in 2000, would be roughly 2 in 100,000
  users. The death rate from smoking, by contrast, is on the order of
  400 per 100,000 users. Even alcohol, America’s official “it’s not
  really a drug” drug, nets about 50 deaths per 100,000 users each
  year:<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/lS4gQm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FPnua.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FPnuam.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I just want more complete pictures for more popular drugs.</p>

<p>I repeat that again</p>

<ol>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Cigarettes</li>
<li>LSD</li>
<li>MDMA</li>
<li>Meth</li>
<li>Heroin</li>
<li>Cocaine</li>
<li>Crack Cocaine</li>
</ol>

<p>So we already got 3. Alcohol, Cigarettes, and MDMA. I want more numbers to around those 8 I think?</p>

<p>If it's too broad, then I just want MDMA, Meth, Heroin, Cocaine, and LSD, and Weed.</p>

<p>Partial answer is good enough. So if you know the ratio for weed, then that's good enough. The best answer will be the one that show more.</p>

"""Humans can actually subsist healthily on a diet of potatoes...""","<p>In the article ""The Columbian Exchange:
A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas"" by N. Nunn &amp; N. Qian, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives—Volume 24, Number 2—Spring 2010—Pages 163–188, there is a claim made that a diet of potatoes and dairy is sufficient for healthy subsistence. The references for the claim are from the 1960s. </p>

<p>Excerpted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The New World crop that arguably had the largest impact on the Old World
  is the potato. Because it provides an abundant supply of calories and nutrients, the potato is able to sustain life better than any other food when consumed as the sole article of diet (Davidson and Passmore, 1965, p. 285). Humans can actually subsist healthily on a diet of potatoes, supplemented with only milk or butter, which
  contain the two vitamins not provided by potatoes, vitamins A and D (Connell,1962; Davidson and Passmore, 1965). </p>

<p>To what extent is this claim true given our current understanding of nutritional necessities for healthy living? If the claim is invalidated by newer findings, is there some limited sense in which it can be made? </p>

"Is fainting more common in young men during blood lettings, and if so, why?","<p>I recently underwent a blood test, and during the third vial I passed out. I awoke just as the sixth was being finished and could not immediately stand. The vials were small, only 5ml each if I remember right, and the blood letting was at an NHS hospital, UK.</p>

<p>In the few minutes after this, I discussed it with the nurse, only ever having fallen unconscious once (having hit a nerve cluster in my right knee). She noted that young men tend to fall unconscious far more than another demographic, although could not recall the reason why. I professed no prior knowledge of the subject, although prodded some weak ideas about height being a factor more than gender (I am ~190cm, or 6 feet 3 inches).</p>

<p>Only one semi-satisfactory answer has been offered so far, and it's more a combination of answers than anything. Seeing as full blood donations are never done by children, data is only really available from adults, another nurse I know personally offered from her experience that more nervous patients tend to pass out more often, but that they too tend to be men. It was then theorised that since the nervousness is known to move blood away from the brain and towards muscles, this would accentuate the blood loss, causing unconsciousness. She also said young men were likely more nervous due to inexperience with any meaningful amount of blood.</p>

<p>Is this a simple, personal observation, perhaps even a white lie so as to keep a weakened patient calm, or is this backed by any statistical data? Is any reason commonly attributed to it?</p>

"Need help with Dementia Hackathon Idea (Professionals experienced with dealing with Dementia patients appreicated!)","<p>Me and my team are planning to go to a Dementia based Hackathon early March and since this is our first actual hackathon we were wondering if you could provide some advice regarding our idea. Here's some background on our team and idea.</p>

<p>Our Team: It consists of four people, three of whom are second year Computer Science students and me. We are all beginners - novices at programming and can somewhat use python. Only one of our friends is comfortable enough with Java so we won't be able to use an android app.</p>

<p>Our Idea: To create a game for dementia patients where we help them retain their memories and cognitive function by asking them to select the right picture of something. For example, if they would like to remember what a traffic light is we would get a couple of pictures from google images (one which is the actual traffic light) and ask them to select the right picture. In our theory this will help reduce the regression of cognitive function by helping patients retain their memory through a fun game and possibly stimulate neurogenesis.  Since only of one of us knows Java we are planning to create a Web based game instead of an android app.</p>

<p>Some Issues: We are wondering on what basis we should be asking the questions ( For example, how would we know that most dementia patients need to remember what a traffic light is?). Another thing is I was wondering if we could somehow collect the data from patients playing the game and do some analysis or show it to a professional so they can assess their cognitive function. However, would that be too advanced for us programming wise (we are only beginners programming wise)?</p>

<p>Note: Since this stack exchange is mainly based on health just providing some advice on our idea would help a lot (like how good it is, some tips to make it better, etc.), although if you have some experience with programming and would like to give us advice as well that would also be great. Although I think I will go to SO after to get programming specific advice.</p>

"""Cuddle"" Parties boost oxytocin? To what degree does it help with pain management and sleep?","<p>Tis the Valentine Season, and I suppose that's why I was invited to a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuddle_party"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Cuddle"" Party</a> the other day. Haven't heard of one? Neither had I. I didn't go because it's not my thing, but  it's becoming more and more popular in urban landscapes in this ever increasingly isolated world. </p>

<p>The basic concept is that a group of people get together and participate in human contact (in a non-sexual way), and this not only elevates the mental health of the participants, but it has a physical health benefit as well -- thanks to the ""love drug/hormone"" or ""cuddle chemical"" known as oxytocin. </p>

<p>Previously, all my knowledge regarding oxytocin concerned mothers and their newborns (examples: regulates labor &amp; breastfeeding), but it plays a role outside of a mother-infant relationship. Oxytocin is released through social interactions and has manifold benefits, some of which are sleep and pain. This <a href=""http://www.livescience.com/35219-11-effects-of-oxytocin.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Live Science: 11 Intersecting Effects of Oxytocin</a> article ascribes that one of the benefits is sleep:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Oxytocin released</strong> in the brain under stress-free conditions naturally
  <strong>promotes sleep</strong> , according to a 2003 study in the journal Regulatory
  Peptides. Ellison said this link makes sense because oxytocin counters
  the effects of cortisol, which is the known as the stress hormone. ""It
  has a calming effect,"" she said. ""It leaves you feeling tranquil and
  loving, and certainly that helps our path to sleep.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In articles elsewhere, it mentions that <strong>Oxytocin also is anti-inflammatory and can help with pain management</strong>. Thus... I was wondering: </p>

<li><p><strong>Just how much ""cuddling"" is needed in order to garner enough oxytocin for:</strong></p>

<p>By chance I just stumbled over the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">WHO's list of essential medicines on Wikipedia</a>. 
It lists a lot of important medicine, as far as I understand, but also ""duplicates"" of medicines for the same conditions, but for migraine it only has standard pain medication (and a beta-blocker). Standard pain medication is like taking sugar pills for me during a real migraine. This does not sound like effective migraine medication.</p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43292/1/WHO_TRS_933_eng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> article stating that at least one triptan was planned to be included already in 2007. But obviously this did not happen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Committee also recommended that a full application for inclusion of a 5HT1 agonist (triptan) for migraine be submitted at its next meeting in 2007.</p>

I would have been fine with the other mentioned drugs being listed as pain killers, but listing migraine and then not listing triptanes seems strange to me.</p>

"Did I get Lateral pelvic tilt from left leg overuse?","<p>Almost 2 years ago I got a knee injury (ACL and meniscal tear) which left me with a mechanically locked knee for more than a month. I could still walk normally without much instability. Fortunately, my doctor suggested physiotherapy which got back the original knee movement and restored part of the muscle strength (not full strength though)</p>

<p>Right after that, I got a scholarship to a PhD program in China so I didn't do anything to it at first. Last year I rechecked with 2 doctors in somewhat reputable hispitals in Xi'an China, both of them concluded after checking my MRI results and performing physical tests that surgery isn't needed (or that it is not worth it) but I will have to stay away from competetive sports.</p>

<p>Now my concern is mostely related to my healthy knee, which hurts me when I put weight on it or if I do activities like jogging. </p>

<p>So to get to my question : 
is it possible that my injured leg got a bit longer (maybe caused by weak muscles or loose ligament)?
Or is it that I relied on my left side for too long until its muscles became tight which developped a lateral pelvic tilt?
If that's the case, should I see a doctor? Or someone with other profession (could you offer an exact name of the profession, so I try to translate it to Chinese)</p>

<p>Recap :
- Injured right knee with weak muscles.
- Left leg feels shorter (or right leg longer) which causes pain in healthy (Left) knee.
Question : who should I check with? (Should I visit another hospital, somekind of physiotherapy place, bodybuilding coach,..)</p>

"False eyelashes: eye candy for onlookers or just eye candy for bacteria?","<p>Catch someone's eye -- don't catch bacteria for your eye.</p>

<p>A few of my friends don on false eyelashes -- some do it for special occasions, others almost wear them everyday. I have never asked them, because I didn't want to appear to disapprove of their decision to do so (if they are cool with it, then hey... fine), but <strong><em>aren't there a lot of health risks involved with wearing false eyelashes?</em></strong> </p>

<p>Personally, just being very sensitive to <strong>adhesives,</strong> I get all <strong>itchy</strong> just thinking about having false eyelashes glued to my eyelid. And I know if I had it done, that I would constantly be <strong>rubbing my eyes,</strong> which would <strong>introduce more bacteria to them</strong>, leading to things like <strong>trachoma, stys,</strong> etc. <strong><em>But is this not a common side-effect of wearing false eyelashes?</em></strong></p>

<p>Also, I would be afraid that all the false eyelashes would put pressure on my natural eyelashes when I blink, and would result in thinning or loss of my natural eyelashes. <strong><em>Does thinning or loss of natural eyelashes result because of false eyelashes?</em></strong></p>

"centric occlusion vs maximum intercuspation","<p>I have found it very confusing that in the dental and orthodontic literature, it is often stated that ""centric occlusion"" (CO) and ""maximum intercuspation"" (MIC) are synonyms (for <a href=""http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v191/n5/full/4801151a.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>), despite the fact that there is tons of research on the <em>discrepancy</em> between CO and MIC (for <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022391367800337"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example</a>). How can CO and MIC be considered synonyms, and yet also be different (and in fact, the difference between them is of interest to dentists?).</p>

<p>Further adding to my confusion, according to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_intercuspation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>, MIC ""used to be referred to as <em>centric occlusion</em>"", but there isn't a reference to back up this specific claim.</p>

"Doing Sports while having Mono","<p>Terribly sorry to bother you with this.</p>

<p>I'm a 28 year old bloke &amp; last week I was diagnosed with infective mononucleosis. However I barely show any symptoms and I feel pretty good. I only went to visit the doctor because my throat was soar en my lymph nodes enlarged.
I had <strong>NO</strong> fever,joint pains, extreme fatigue.(I did feel slighty more tired the last couple of weeks). And my sports performances were going in a downward direction for the last month before the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Being very sportive (running and cycling), I didn't perform any sports for 2 weeks. However I actually feel good. A little bit more tired but not incapacitated.So I want to restart doing sports a soon as possible. I hoped to start next week with some light training (30 - 40km on the bike or running (max) 7 km at an easy pace).</p>

<p>I contacted my doctor(s) and they gave the green light. They said I should mainly listen to my own body. If it feels good, then I shouldn't hesitate to do some light activities.</p>

<p>However I did some reading. And some people said that...</p>

<pre><code>If you start with sports too soon then the body won't fully recover. You 
might relapse a few months later. Or even worse, you won't ever fully 
recover! And the Mono (&amp; slight fatigue) will remain lingering in my body
till the end of my days.
</code></pre>

<p>I contacted my doctor, sister (doctor aswell) &amp; brother in law (sports doctor). they couldn't confirm this claim. They all said sports will increase the recovery time. And I should keep a close eye for an enlarged (more sensitive) spleen &amp; liver. Does anyone here have any insight in this matter? Or can anyone debunk (hopefully) this claim?</p>

"The Common Cold - what does the name refer to?","<p>My mother, a school science teacher, is of the opinion that the common cold gains its name from the fact that you can acquire a cold virus more readily when you yourself feel cold. For example, in her view, if you were to spend a day in a cold temperature with inadequate clothing, or spend a long time standing in a rainstorm, you'd increase your chance of catching a cold.</p>

<p>I can see the potential for this to be true - if your body is at an inadequate temperature, it might be more susceptible to catching a cold (or anything for that matter) as your body is busy trying to keep you warm rather than protecting you from disease.</p>

<p>I argue with her, however, as I understand the name of the Common Cold to be referring to the most common symptom of it, in that it makes your body feel cold, causing you to wear extra clothing.</p>

<p>Could someone please enlighten me as to how the Common Cold actually takes its name, is it one of the above alternatives, or something else entirely? As a bonus, is there actually any merit to my mother's logic - is it actually easier to catch a cold when you're physically colder than your body would prefer?</p>

"Do painkillers cure headaches or just stop us from feeling it?","<p>I'm sorry if this is an obvious question. I frequently have migraine attacks, and have to take some pills to stop the pain. Now my question is, does a pill stop the source of an attack, or does it just stop my brain from feeling it?</p>

<p>Let's make a clear example:</p>

<p>You have a broken bone, you take a very powerful painkiller (or maybe even injection), so you can't feel the pain in your broken arm anymore. But still, if you apply pressure on the bone, it will still damage the body, regardless of feeling it or not. So it's not curing the bone, it's just preventing you from feeling it.</p>

<p>Now when i have these attacks, i need to stay in dark and rest (as you already know what is a migraine attack), and if i still continue to (for example) use my computer, it will hurt more and more with each second passing. This is an alert from my brain: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stop doing what you are doing and rest!!</p>

"Repairing skin, fat, muscle tears","<p>I have a basic question. I have seen videos of wound treatment, where the doctor induces bleeding around the edge of the wound... to create granulation tissue... then suturing the wound.</p>

<p>I have the same question with regards to muscle, fat... if there's a situation where fat or muscle has torn and needs to be sutured together... does bleeding always need to be induced at the tear to promote reattachment. Or can reattachment happen if the tissues are just sutured together?</p>

<p>For example, titanium + nickel (self-expanding stent).</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I clarified the question: what percentage of the different types of effects contribute to stent fragmentation: vessel pulsation, mechanical bending, blood flow?
What percentage (1%, 10%, 90%) of stents breaks down into fragments from mechanical stress (arterial pulsation, ...), and what percentage (1%, 10%, 90%) of stents breaks down into fragments from blood flow (corrode/dissolve) <strong>after 10-40 years</strong>?</p>

"Is it possible to live on a diet of only inanimate/non-living sources?","<p>One possible reason for adopting a vegetarian/vegan diet is the desire not to have to cause the deaths of living creatures in order to survive, where sufficiently-nutritious alternatives exist.

<p><strong>Is it possible to survive on a diet that comes exclusively from non-living sources?</strong></p>

"What is the cause of the vaping-related outbreak of lung injuries?","<p><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">According to the CDC</a>, there are reports of more than 1000 patients in the US with vaping-associated lung injuries, and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/nyregion/vaping-death.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">23 deaths</a> have been confirmed. The median age of deceased patients is 49.5 years, while the median age of patients overall is 23 years. The first reported death occurred in Illinois August 23rd 2019.</p>

<p>Do any of the following three explanations for this outbreak have factual support?</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no outbreak. After the first death attributed to vaping, patients with lung disease were asked about their vaping history, whereas before they were not. This explains the rapid rise of reported cases in the last two months. There were similar cases all along, but hospitals changed the questions they asked.</li>
<li>Vapers changed the vaping parameters after watching videos like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syccl7rd3Lk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a> (8 of the 10 most watched vaping videos on youtube are about vape tricks). During the hot summer months vaping outside, the viscosity of e-liquid was lower, introducing a second change that increased the substance intake through the inhaled aerosol.</li>
<li>The onset of the outbreak was so rapid that no change in products, buying behaviour or vaping behaviour could explain it because these things happen over months and years, not weeks. The cause of the outbreak was a firmware upgrade in the vaping devices that led to a change in vaping conditions resulting in harmful substances created while vaping (for example in a vape dry hit).</li>

"How to evaluate the results of diagnostic studies: how to prove that new method is better than gold standard?","<p>I understand how to evaluate <em>therapeutic</em> studies: basically you compare the results of two groups that were chosen randomly. One group gets the new drug, the other group gets the placebo (or the drug against which the new drug should be tested). Neither the physicians nor the patients know in which group they are (double-blind testing). You can clearly see the results and test the statistical significance (e.g. with a t-test, depending on the study design).</p>

<p>I have a problem understanding <em>diagnostic</em> studies. My problem lies in the fact that you do not know ""the truth"", i.e. whether a patient really has the condition which should be diagnosed. Therefore you use the so-called ""gold standard"", i.e. the best diagnostic method so far. There is no problem when the new diagnostic method is worse than the gold standard. Yet I think there might be a problem when the new diagnostic method is <em>better</em> than the gold standard! Why? Because the results will be <em>different</em> which would be interpreted as <em>inferior</em>.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example: Let's assume that a patient really has some form of cancer, yet the gold standard is not able to detect it. The new method is able to detect it and therefore both tests disagree. Because the gold standard is taken as the <em>reference</em> the new method would get a minus point here... although it was right in the first place!</p>

<p><strong>My questions</strong><br>
Is my thinking correct? If yes, how do handle this problem in practice? Is there a common term for this kind of problem? If no, where lies my misunderstanding?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
Perhaps another (more extreme) example is in order: Let's say the gold standard has an accuracy of 50%, i.e. the toss of a coin. If you had a new method with an accuracy of 100% (so the results of this method and ""the truth"" are the same) and tested it against the gold standard this new method would get an accuracy of only 50% (i.e. the accuracy of the gold standard against ""the truth"").</p>

"How to do laundry to kill and prevent athlete's foot fungus?","<p>As you may know, one of the reasons athletes's foot and jock itch fungus are so hard to kill with OTC medicines like Lotrimin and Lamisil is because after you treat it, it is extremely difficult not to reinfect yourself with the fungal spores by re-wearing the same clothes and sleeping in the same bed sheets.  Doing laundry properly is of paramount importance.</p>

<p>I've read on certain sites that in order to kill athlete's foot fungus spores on clothes, you need to wash your laundry with ultra-hot water (140 degrees Fahrenheit).  I have some clothes and a fleece blanket so washing them with hot is not an option because I don't want them to shrink.  So assuming I can't use hot water, what is the best combination to kill the fungus?</p>

<ul>
<li>Bleach (?) - I've read that bleach will kill fungus such as athlete's foot on hard surfaces, but when used on fabrics it doesn't always penetrate deep enough into the material to completely kill the fungus roots.  I've also read a post where the guy made the following comment:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bleach removes fungus and mold but also promotes it’s later development... Fungus thrives in high PH environments caused by Bases like bleach... If you must use bleach you should neutralize it with a post acid rinse like vinegar or lemon juice. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Borax Laundry Booster (?) - Some people have said that adding 20 Mule Team Borax to your wash cycle can kill athlete's foot on fabric.  But I've looked at the Borax product packaging and there wasn't any mention of this benefit so I'm a little skeptical.</p></li>
<li><p>Oxygen bleach (OxiClean ?) -This has also been mentioned, yet I see nothing on the product packaging that says it kills fungus.</p></li>
<li><p>Vinegar (?) - Vinegar has long been touted as a natural cure for athlete's foot on skin.  Will it work on fabric?  (Note to others: Do NOT mix bleach with vinegar as that can give off toxic gases!)</p></li>

"Are there any significant benefits to loud alarms in the ICU?","<p>I <a href=""https://www.physionet.org/challenge/2015/"" rel=""nofollow"">read</a> that the loud alarms in the ICU have a deleterious effect on patients' outcomes. Are there any significant benefits to these loud alarms? Otherwise, shouldn't they use some more discrete alarms(e.g. in their pocket/phone) instead?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alarms in the ICU can lead to a disruption of care, impacting both the patient and the clinical staff through noise disturbances, desensitization to warnings and slowing of response times [1], leading to decreased quality of care [2,3]. ICU alarms produce sound intensities above 80 dB that can lead to sleep deprivation [1,4,5], inferior sleep structure [6,7], stress for both patients and staff [10,11,12,13] and depressed immune systems [14]. There are also indications that the incidence of re-hospitalization is lower if disruptive noise levels are decreased during a patient's stay [15]. Furthermore, such disruptions have been shown to have an important effect on recovery and length of stay [2,10]. In particular, cortisol levels have been shown to be elevated (reflecting increased stress) [12,13], and sleep disruption has been shown to lead to longer stays in the ICU [5]. ICU false alarm (FA) rates as high as 86% have been reported, with between 6% and 40% of ICU alarms having been shown to be true but clinically insignificant (requiring no immediate action) [16]. In fact, only 2% to 9% of alarms have been found to be important for patient management [17].</p>

"How to find a good (or appropriate) doctor","<h1>General case</h1>

<li>Randomness</li>
<li>Mouth to mouth</li>
<li>Reading online reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>Randomness gives... random results.</p>

<p>Mouth to mouth is not necessarily better because often the friend/family that consulted has not much legitimity to evaluate how effective the doctor was. Often they will judge more the relationship to their doctor that the performance of the doctor. It may be appropriate for certain people but in my case I just expect the doctor to be good, kindness is just a bonus.</p>

<p>Reading online reviews: there's often not much available and it compares to mouth to mounth. Sometimes the doctor has a website and will display his show his research papers but it's usually not the case, and when it's the case that doctor is often expensive and unbookable before 6 months.</p>

Me and my wife underwent an IVF procedure last year and had an unsuccessful embryo transfer. We did the procedure in a country other than the one we live in. We're in Canada and it would've cost us close to 25K to do IVF here, but we managed to do it with less than one tenth of that!!
Now, we were wondering if there's any ways we could bring the rest of our frozen embryos to Canada so that we can try another transfer here at home?
Has this ever been done in the past?! Are the tubes (in which the frozen embryos are kept), similar everywhere? What are the requirements for moving a frozen tube?
Frozen embryos are currently kept in Tehran, Iran!</p>

<p>All advices appreciated.</p>

"What is the current standpoint on cooking with olive oil?","<p>Usually I make dishes by adding a <strong>tablespoon of olive oil</strong> to the meat or vegetables and just have them for some time on a <strong>teflon pan</strong>.</p>

<p>I know that <strong>frying</strong> is done on <strong>high temperatures</strong> and results in lots of <strong>carcinogens</strong>.</p>

<p>But now I've read that <strong>olive oil's burnpoint is lower</strong> than sunflower's. Around <strong>180 Celsius</strong> based on the refinedness. And at that point carcinogens arise as well, and this makes olive oil more unhealthy for ""warm"" cooking than sunflower oil.</p>

<p>Does this mean that even the cooking I described above should be avoided with olive oil? Or just frying?</p>

"Why do ergonomic chairs often not support the upper back?","<p>I have sat in too many chairs that provide a nice cushion for the lower back, and then leave the upper back without support, either by having a back rest that is too low, or one that tilts backwards such that the only way to touch it is to bend backwards. These chairs have always been unusable to me because my upper back tenses up to keep from falling backwards. 
How could such a huge design flaw be allowed in a product that is supposed to protect you from back pain?? Am I unusual in the discomfort this causes me and my desire for a chair that I can throw the entire length of my back at, or is this literally a case of cheap designs for users who don't know any better?

"Is a study of one research in the field of medicine?","<p>Medicine is not my field, nor do I have mesothelioma. I'm also not seeking any clinical trials or experimental treatment. However, sometimes I find myself trying my read medical papers, either out of sheer interest or if I have a serious complication. I want to stress that I don't think self diagnosis is a good idea, I just can't help myself sometimes.</p>

<p>I find that quite a few papers I get from PubMed appear to be a ""study of one"". Consider this paper <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/ejcts/article/41/6/1393/420831"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://academic.oup.com/ejcts/article/41/6/1393/420831</a></p>

<p>I'm not saying this is a bad paper, I have no idea. However, I am curious as to how common and accepted this type of paper is within the field of medicine.</p>

<p>On one hand, I can see that for pushing the limits of surgery, or any technique, it is interesting to see what people have had success with, even if it is just one patient. On the other hand, it is just one patient. How can anything be generalized from this?</p>

<p>Is there a difference between treatment with medications and surgical technique? I can imagine that surgical techniques can be replicated with far more accuracy than results from medication, which are plagued by placebo and unclear method of operation (I'm making this stuff up, so please correct me).</p>

<p>Again, I have no grounds of criticizing the work of either of the papers, they are just used as examples, and as mentioned, there are quite a few such papers. Indeed, if I do a search for ""we present a case of"", I get a ton of results for actual papers that lead with this. I'm sure there are many other, similar phrases that are also used for these single study cases.</p>

<p>My question is simply, what does the academic medical field think of this type of paper? Can such a paper, be a good paper? Is it usually considered a ""bad paper"", when compared to a paper that has e.g. many patients that received the same treatments, where variations and complications are discussed? Is this sort of paper simply part of the cutting edge of medical science, that all results are useful?</p>

"Why aren't superbugs weaker than their wild type?","<p>A superbug is a strain of bacteria that has become resistant to antibiotic drugs, according to Oxford Dictionary. The reason that it can resist the drug is because it has evolved in the environment which contains the drug. Only those that contain the drug resistant gene can survive and become the superbug.</p>

<p>But why don't they become weaker after the  evolution? </p>

<p>I have this question because I once worked with the resistance of HIV to lopinavir drug. There are mutants of HIV that can resist the drug, however, after the resistance, the structure of the virus itself is more fragile, hence they're weaker than the wild type. This seems logical because in its ordinary environment, the wild type of virus should be the strongest one. Any mutation of it is to fight back the drug, hence it is not the strongest one anymore.</p>

<p>I know that my only true for HIV, a <strong>virus</strong>, not bacteria. But I don't understand why this logic cannot apply to them. Based on the alarmed of many resources, superbugs are <em>stronger</em> than their wild type. Do you know why superbugs aren't weaker than their wild type?</p>

"Can GERD be caused by too little stomach acid?","<p>Ever since the book, <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/721913.Why_Stomach_Acid_Is_Good_for_You"" rel=""nofollow"">Why Stomach Acid is Good For You</a>, I've wondered if it is true that GERD can be caused by too little, not too much, stomach acid. Is it possible that too little stomach acid can cause GERD? If so, by what mechanism would this occur?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - After reading the answer below, I’d like to add a little more information.</strong></p>

<p>I don’t disagree with the fact that GERD is caused by a malfunctioning lower esophageal sphincter (LES), and I don’t disagree with known causes that would contribute to a malfunctioning LES, but what seems very likely to me is that low stomach acid is an additional cause of a malfunctioning LES. This reasoning behind this is that undigested food is putrefying and rotting, expelling gas within the stomach, then increasing pressure on the LES. It could even be possible that low stomach acid is the cause in a large majority of the cases of GERD.</p>

<p>There is an entire integrative medicine field, aka holistic health, that has identified in many cases GERD is actually caused by too little stomach acid (<a href=""http://drsircus.com/medicine/cancer-gerd/"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a>, <a href=""http://chriskresser.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-but-doesnt-about-heartburn-gerd/"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a>, <a href=""http://drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/Hypochlorhydria_-_lack_of_stomach_acid_-_can_cause_lots_of_problems"" rel=""nofollow"">3</a>). And while I am usually not one to ever listen to this field of medicine, they make some really astute observations.</p>

<li><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/cancer/features/esophageal-cancer-rise"" rel=""nofollow"">Esophageal cancer is on the sharp rise</a>, coincidentally in an era with the most robust acid reducing medication available.</li>

</ul>

<p>I realize this isn’t what the mainstream doctors believe, but the mainstream is being influenced by a 15 billion dollar industry. The PPI section in the store is huge. I’ve been to multiple gastro docs, and it’s like assembly line Prilosec prescribing. Two people who know our family, that have both been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, just happen to be taking Prilosec / Nexium for many years prior. Another friend had to have is colon cut out because of a bacterial infection, which could have been caused by the elimination of the body’s first line of bacterial defense (stomach acid).</p>

<p>All evidence pointing to low stomach acid seems legitimate, so why not give it proper attention.
So here I’d like to diagram what I believe to be the problem: the step-ladder catch-22 inflammation and putrefication snowball effect. Remember, all of this is on the basis that when it comes to low stomach acid, GERD is being caused by the rotting / putrefication of food in the stomach (due to the pyloric sphincter remaining shut) and the resulting gasses which bubble up past the 2-way LES causing GERD. Then, the rotting food causes <a href=""http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/gastritis/Pages/facts.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">inflammation in the stomach which results in the stomach producing less acid</a>, and the problem starts to compound. It basically goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eat Meal -> Low Acid -> Undigested Food -> Pyloric Sphincter Stays
  Shut -> Putrefying &amp; Rotting (GERD) -> Gastric Inflammation -> Next
  Meal -> Lower Acid -> Undigested Food -> Pyloric Sphincter Stays Shut
  -> Putrefying &amp; Rotting (GERD) -> More Gastric Inflammation -> Next Meal -> Lower Acid -> Undigested Food -> Pyloric Sphincter Stays Shut
  -> Putrefying &amp; Rotting (GERD) -> More Gastric Inflammation -> And So On…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you go down this step-ladder road for a few months, the avenue out of it is daunting, if not impossible. In my opinion, we could have millions of sufferers in our country, and for that reason I want to find out the truth.</p>

"Does gargling Hydrogen Peroxide or Listerine help combat cold/flu?","<p>More specifically, does gargling help prevent sickness when a person <em>feels</em> the early-stages of being sick? (That slight feeling of rawness in one's throat, for example, or a light, abnormal fatigue). </p>

<p>A friend of mine says that gargling during this stage has worked wonders to prevent oncoming sickness. The argument made is that one absorbs the offending bacteria/viruses via the respiratory tract—and gargling with an antiseptic kills off otherwise sickness-causing pathogens. For example, if wearing a mask helps prevent sickness by blocking pathogens from the throat, why wouldn't using an anti-septic on the throat directly similarly prevent sickness?</p>

<p>I think this is a biological oversimplification. I claim that, by the time a person feels <em>any</em> symptoms, said person is already sick and gargling won't help prevent further sickness.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(05)00258-8/abstract?cc=y="" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This</a> study claims that gargling with <em>water</em> as a <em>preventative</em> measure (i.e. - before feeling any rawness, irritation, inflammation, or fatigue) reduces the occurrence of respiratory tract infections.

"Weakness in a finger (pianist)","<p>I'm a professional pianist and have been playing for eight years now. I recently noticed a problem in my left hand: if we enumerate the fingers consecutively, 1 beeing the thumb, my fourth finger is very weak compared to the fourth finger of my right hand, and if I position my left hand completely open and try to bend only the third and fourth fingers, I can't manage to keep them together while doing this. Could I have injured myself from practicing too hard? </p>

<p>I'm especially worried, since when I was little I used to bend my fingers backwards really hard, to the point that some of my knuckles got bigger and stayed this way even after I stopped. What kind of injuries could this cause, and what type of doctor should I visit to get my hand checked? </p>

"Is there an immune deficiency disorder that fits this description?","<p>I've been trying to do some research for a writing project, but I need some advice to help me identify what specific things I should be researching, because ""immune deficiency"" in general brings up a kind of overwhelming number of possible directions to go in. Ideally, I'm hoping to identify a suitable specific diagnosis for a character, or at least narrow down my options, so that I can focus my research more effectively and improve my chances of an accurate portrayal.</p>

<p>The character is a girl in her mid teens, who's had health issues since before she started school. That's set in stone. Anything else is open to adjustment for accuracy, but here's what kind of stuff I had in mind;</p>

<ul>
<li>Primary rather than secondary immunodeficiency.</li>
<li>Severe enough for her to be absent from school fairly regularly</li>
<li>Not life threatening (at least for the time being)</li>
<li>She's had to be hospitalised enough times that she's pretty familiar with the process.</li>
<li>When she <em>is</em> in school her illness is rarely (if at all) totally invisible. There might be some restrictions on what she can or can't take part in, she might need some kind of medical equipment, she might display some kind of visible symptoms, maybe she just gets fatigued easily? Whatever it is, it's noticeable to her classmates.</li>
</ul>

<p>So. Anything in particular come to mind? Anything I should (or shouldn't) be focusing on? Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated, and could potentially save my brain from imploding after one too many pages of dense and technical medical literature.</p>

"Sweet Tooth: Healthier to brush before/after eating sweets? Fluoride protection effective if used right before?","<p>What is the <strong>optimal time-of-day</strong> (if one is to live a little and eat a sweet treat every now and then) for <strong>consuming a sugary goodie?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Before or after brushing teeth?</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong>After:</strong> I assume everyone one would say after brushing so you can brush all the sugar out of your teeth so it doesnt sit there all day and rot your teeth out, right? I think this too.</p>

<p><strong>Before:</strong> But I also hear brushing right after eating is bad for your enamel because when you eat -- your enamel is soft and you end up being rough on your enamel if you brush right afterwards. </p>

<p>PLUS, is fluoride more protective right afterwards? If I use a fluoride-based toothpaste right before eating a treat is it more effective in protecting my teeth from the sugar rather than adding that layer of protection on after the threat of sugar enters my mouth?</p>

"Calculate U.S. life expectancy for 2025?","<p>This is the hard data on incidence of specific diseases for the year 1995 and (projected) 2025. I have omitted chronic diseases as a group, although they are projected to increase from 90 million (1995) to 168 million by 2025.</p>

<p>The confluence of aggravators work too well together: quality of life, disposable income, percentage of those depressed, number of those with multimorbidities, and the fact that the incidence shows no signs of stopping.</p>

<p>We may be looking at a snowball effect: If the workforce is undergoing constant depletion and is being increasingly transformed into a burden, the economy will start to shrink, and this will hasten the process of depletion of the remaining workforce. Access to health care will begin to decrease, further hastening disintegration of health, economy and living standards.</p>

<p>I think it is abundantly clear looking at the chart below that life expectancy has no chance of increasing by 2025, but the question is how much will it decrease and how quickly?</p>

"Leg apparently slightly shorter after femur surgery","<p>In august 2016 i managed to fall off my bicycle and broke my femur bone (right greater trochanter). It was an accident and nobody else was involved.</p>

<p>Urgent surgery followed approx. 12 hours after the accident which left me with a 11x420mm Stryker titanium rod inside the right femur. More or less from the hip down to the knee.</p>

<p>Then, 2 weeks hospital care, then home recovery. This went well and i worked with a physical therapist which gradually introduced new exercises, etc. Then I moved to a normal gym which i am still doing after 7 months. I am now almost ok, climbing stairs and walking around, but there is a slight limping i am not able to get rid of.</p>

<p>Now during these 7 months there were a few intermediate checks with the doctor and his team. Two times they measured my hip-to-knee distance with a ruler and compared with the other leg, and it seemed to be ok. I didn't know what that really was about at the time.</p>

<p>Todays x-ray check showed the fracture well recovered, however the doctor finally concluded that my right leg appears shorter by 5mm. That there's nothing to be done at this point and i should keep doing recovery and possibly try wearing a foot silicone pad inside my right shoe. No more checks have been scheduled and i am free to move on with my life.</p>

<p>Now, the questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>is it normal to expect this ""alignment margin"" in this type of surgery? any statistics that says a broken femur is likely to remain slightly off after surgery?</li>
<li>is this something i could potentially never be able to correct either via exercising or possibly other kinds of medical intervention?</li>
<li>could the difference in length be more than 5mm, and they said that to sound ""optimistic""?</li>
<li>if the difference is real (and it feels like it could be, since i am still limping a bit) and i am never able to correct it in any way, what kind of side effects should i expect?</li>
<li>should i double check with another doctor?</li>
<li>what are my options?</li>
</ul>

"Why do non-sugary cereals contain twice the iron of sugary cereals?","<p>I've noticed a pattern that sugary and non-sugary cereals are typically enriched with the same levels of every vitamin EXCEPT iron, which is typically twice as high in the non-sugary cereals.   Here are some examples by percentage of adult-female iron  RDA per serving (double the numbers to get percentage of adult-male iron RDA).</p>

<li>Toasted oats, plain:  45%</li>

<li>Why the heck do the manufacturers do this?   Do they assume only female hemophiliacs eat plain cereals?</li>
<li>How large is the risk of getting too much total iron from diet when you eat these cereals, considering the tolerable upper limit is only 40mg and the average adult male gets 20mg compared to an 8mg adult-male RDA.

Benzodiazepines (namely diazepam or clonazepam) help my symptoms immensely and allow me to function <em>much better</em> in school, relationships, and other areas of life.

Others had some benefits that were outweighed by the side effects like (on an efficacy scale): Clomipramine > Venlafaxine > Escitalopram.  </p>

"What are the long-term consequences of binge drinking?","<p>The CDC has a somewhat confusing [for me] <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">page on alcohol</a>. First, they classify binge drinking as excessive drinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Excessive drinking includes binge drinking, heavy drinking, and any drinking by pregnant women or people younger than age 21.</p>
  
  <p>Binge drinking, the most common form of excessive drinking, is defined as consuming</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>For women, 4 or more drinks during a single occasion.</p></li>
  <li><p>For men, 5 or more drinks during a single occasion.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Followed by definition of heavy drinking (as a 2nd form of excessive drinking)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Heavy drinking is defined as consuming</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>For women, 8 or more drinks per week.</li>
  <li>For men, 15 or more drinks per week.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>One is in terms of peaks and other one in terms of average consumption.</p>

<p>Then they talk of long-term health risks for the combined category of excessive drinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over time, excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of chronic diseases and other serious problems including: High blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and digestive problems.
  Cancer of the breast, mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and colon.
  Learning and memory problems, including dementia and poor school performance.
  Mental health problems, including depression and anxiety.
  Social problems, including lost productivity, family problems, and unemployment.
  Alcohol dependence, or alcoholism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But looking at their references only three seem to be about binge-drinking</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7966895"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wechsler (1994)</a> about binge drinking in college</li>

<li><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12728126"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Naimi (2003)</a> about unintended pregnancies</li>
</ul>

<p>These three seem to talking about short-term problems like injuries or unwanted pregnancy. Ok, these could have more indirect long-term consequences, but seem in a different class than cancer, dementia, liver disease etc. Are any of the latter associated with binge drinking?</p>

<p>I'm aware of a review of animal studies <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/dec/29/binge-drinking-brain-damage-study"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">highlighted in the Guardian</a> some 10 years ago ""Regular binge drinking can cause long-term brain damage"".

"Demodex control with antibiotics: why and how?","<p>Wikipedia says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Demodex folliculorum is a microscopic mite that can only survive on the skin of people. Most people have D. folliculorum on their skin. Usually, the mites do not cause any harm, and are therefore considered an example of commensalism rather than parasitism. If D. folliculorum does cause disease, this is known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodicosis"" rel=""noreferrer"">demodicosis</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1203895-medication#2"" rel=""noreferrer"">treatment options listed on Medscape</a> include:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Medication Summary<br>
  Various treatments have been used to control Demodex mites. Most treatments involve spreading an ointment at the base of the eyelashes at night to trap mites as they emerge from their burrow and/or move from one follicle to another. A tea tree oil product (Cliradex) can be used. Terpinen-4-ol is the most active component of tea tree oil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And crucially:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Antibiotics    </p>
  
  <p>Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be comprehensive and should cover all likely pathogens in the context of this clinical setting.</p>
  
  <p>Erythromycin ophthalmic (Ilotycin)</p>

  Used for the treatment of ocular infections involving the lids, conjunctiva, and/or cornea caused by organisms susceptible to it.</p>

<p>That's all fine. But ""Used for the treatment … caused by organisms susceptible to it"" seems strange. Demodex mites are not bacteria. How are they susceptible to antibiotics?</p>

<p>This seems <em>not</em> to be used for prevention or treatment of secondary/bacterial infections:</p>

"Why is it not possible to get HIV by touching a contaminated surface?","<p>I was wondering if one could get HIV from basically touching a surface which has had viral DNA extract, serum, or blood on it; and then touching their (bleeding) pimple or acne, or any other open area of the skin. </p>

<p>From what I've seen, the answer is “no” due to the fact that the virus is not able to live (or “stay infective”) for that long outside the human body.<br>
<a href=""https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-08/how-long-do-microbes-bacteria-and-viruses-live-surfaces-home-normal-room-tem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Popular science: How long do microbes like bacteria and viruses live on surfaces in the home at normal room temperatures?</a> If I am not getting it wrong, the first paragraph states this fact clearly:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If the information is right, what I still don't understand is: why is it not possible for it to be infective since there will still be RNA present on the surface (even after the virus is dead or no virus left), getting in contact with skin, and eventually with the blood through an open area on the skin? Because the whole strain would still be there and would have gotten into the body. (Maybe even along with the ingredients in the dried fluids?)</p>

"Cardiovascular risk of light smoking","<p>What's the cardiovascular risk of light smoking? Does a light smoker only incur a proportionally small fraction of the risk of a heavy smoker?</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://www.bmj.com/content/360/bmj.j5855"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> meta-analysis, the risk of cigarettes smoked by day (CPD) isn't linearly correlated to cardiovascular risk, instead it follows a much steeper curve for low CPD and then flattens out.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Smokers who cut down the number of cigarettes they use can benefit from large reductions in the risk of cancer and some benefits on cardiovascular disease. However, smoking only one to five cigarettes per day is associated with a risk of coronary heart disease and stroke that is substantially higher than many health professionals or smokers recognise (as much as half the risk of smoking 20 per day). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That it is <em>that</em> nonlinear is a quite surprising result.</p>

<p>But, the problem is… there's also the famous INTERHEART study. And by this one, we find at least for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) a linear risk-CPD-dependency:</p>

<p><strong>Further to the answers given so far by @Narusan and @wolf-revo-cats along with further research I have conducted</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[E]-cigarettes don’t contain cancer causing tobacco. They do contain nicotine, which is addictive, but isn’t what causes the damage from smoking.</p>

<p>When looking at passive smoking and cancer, Domino et al. (1993) points out that 10g of eggplant contains the equivalent nicotine of passively smoking for 3 hours in a room with a ""minimum amount"" of tobacco smoke. 10g is not a lot of eggplant and passive smoking causes cancer (e.g. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/jjco/hyw091"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hori, et al. 2016</a>).

"Is there any health risk in cellular phones?","<p>Cellular phones are taking ever increasing part in our lives, and I keep hearing people saying they are harmful to our health.</p>

<p>Are there any scientific researches so far proving or disproving those claims?</p>

<p>I found couple of semi-scientific articles:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/cell-phones-and-cancer/faq-20057798"">Is there any link between cellphones and cancer?</a> which says:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The possible connection between cellphones and cancer is controversial. Many years' worth of studies on cellphones and cancer have yielded conflicting results<br>
  ...<br>
  In one study that followed more than 420,000 cellphone users over a 20-year period, researchers found no evidence of a link between cellphones and brain tumors<br>
  ...<br>
  Another recent study suggested a possible increased risk of glioma — a specific type of brain tumor — for the heaviest cellphone users, but no increase in brain tumor risk overall.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/834888"">Long-term Cell Phone Use Linked to Brain Tumor Risk</a> which says:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Long-term use of both mobile and cordless phones is associated with an increased risk for glioma, the most common type of brain tumor, the latest research on the subject concludes.<br>
  The new study shows that the risk for glioma was tripled among those using a wireless phone for more than 25 years and that the risk was also greater for those who had started using mobile or cordless phones before age 20 years.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>Though the second appears to conclude direct health risk, I'm pretty sure it's not yet any hard proof otherwise we would have seen huge lawsuits being filed all over the place.</p>

<p>If really  harmful, what factors are in place e.g. cellular phone model, signal strength, etc?</p>

"What is the cause of Type 1 Diabetes?","<p>Type 1 Diabetes, also known as ""Juvenile-onset"" diabetes (due to the fact that it's often diagnosed early in life) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by the body's inability to to produce insulin, the body's primary means of regulating glucose.</p>

"Why do I feel shaky after only a small amount of caffeine?","<p>I like coffee, but caffeine seems to 'wire' me much more extremely than most other people. I feel energized or even shaky after less than half a normal cup, and a whole 8 ounces will usually cause me to sweat or make my heart race uncomfortably. </p>

<p>Even decaffeinated coffee seems to have this effect, which seems strange to me (although I am aware that it still contains a small amount of caffeine). I typically drink green tea instead of coffee, since the effect is more mild.</p>

<p>Is this an indication that my body metabolizes caffeine faster (or slower?) than normal? What else can cause caffeine sensitivity?</p>

"For long-term use: Non-Alcoholic Mouthwash vs Saltwater","<p><strong>Foreword:</strong> Please beware that I ask this question only for mouthwash with NO alcohol whatsoever; so please omit alcoholic mouthwashes (which can cause cancer). </p>

<p>Since my grandmother continues to develop cavities, she  twice daily brushes, flosses, then flosses again with interdental brushes, and concludes with a   Crest mouthwash with 0 alcohol (see the footnote). She also abstains from any added sugar or sweeteners. </p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> How does saltwater compare with non-alcoholic mouthwash for daily lifelong use? Her dentist does not know of any relevant research, and only recommends saltwater for short-term use. So her dentist agrees with some of the claims <a href=""http://www.todaysdentistry.com.au/mouthwash-or-salt-water-rinse/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> by Dentist <a href=""http://www.todaysdentistry.com.au/about-us/meet-the-team/our-dentists/"" rel=""noreferrer"">David Kerr</a> (B.DSc (Hons) BSc (Hons), University of Queensland).<br>
<strong>Question 2:</strong> But is Dentist Kerr perfectly right in his criticism (of saltwater) below?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.todaysdentistry.com.au/mouthwash-or-salt-water-rinse/"" rel=""noreferrer"">How about using salt water long term?</a></p>
  
  <p>Longer term, the salt water is acidic, so there would be a problem if you were to use it every day, it could erode the teeth, but is not necessarily abrasive to the teeth. It is the acidity of the salt water that could eat away and soften the enamel on the teeth making them more susceptible to wearing, chipping and cavities.</p>

"How should ovo-lacto vegetarians compensate the lack of meat in their diets?","<p>An ovo-lacto vegetarian includes both eggs and dairy products in his diet, but meat is completely excluded. In a regular non-vegetarian diet, meat is very important and provides many benefits if properly consumed.</p>

"Supplements: When and how to take them to maximize absorption","<p>I switched to a vegetarian diet a while back, and I am now taking a few supplements consisting of common minerals, vitamins and omega-3's as a compliment to my regular diet.</p>

<p>Does it matter what time of day it is, and does it matter what else I have in my stomach at the time?</p>

<p>I have read that some vitamins are fat soluble – does that mean that they should be taken with a meal? If taken with a meal – does eating a lot of food reduce ""digestion efficiency"" of the supplements?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>What I have done, which is based entirely on my own thoughts, which are not based on any particular research</em>:</p>

<p>I have been taking my supplements during the afternoon a few hours before dinner. At around 5 pm, body metabolism is at a high, and I usually don't have a lot of food in my stomach. My thinking has therefore been that the body will be efficient at absorbing the contents of the supplements.</p>

"How are Sensitivity/Specificity determined for tests in mental health?","<p>Originally the question was <code>How are Sensitivity/Specificity determined for the first test available for a disease?</code> but I narrowed it down a bit since it seemed to be too broad. </p>

<p>Given that measuring Sensitivity and Specificity requires that you know in advance which people are positive or negative for some disease what's the general process if you develop a new test for a new disease where there's no existing test for the disease making it hard to actually reason about who has the disease and who doesn't. Similarily, if you have an existing test and develop a new test that is supposed to be more accurate, how are you going to tell who has the disease and who not because using the existing test to quantify that introduces ""unkown"" errors. </p>

<p>Similarily, how is this done for diseases that don't even have biomarkers available at that point. I.e. mental illnesses like depression. The way they are defined is by a set of criteria that define the illness and then people develop questionaires to screen for these mental illnesses but since the only way of knowing whether somebody actually has depression is to apply the criteria from the definition those criteria are actually what defines the test in the sense that hose criteria determine whether somebody has the disease, or not. In essence, doesn't this mean that you invent criteria based upon 'nothing' and then create a questionnaire for it but since the definition is actually arbitrary how does this gain you new insight or new information? In some sense, I could define 'hoarding' as well... 'excessively collecting/hoarding objects...' and then devise a questionaire that consisting of two questions 'do you hoard books' and 'do you hoard empty bottles' and if 80% of hoarders do one of these things I will have 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity but I might as well just use the criteria from the definition and do much better than that questionnaire. </p>

<p>You can't really make the argument that the criteria are set so that it fits people having the disease well... because the criteria is what defines the disease in the first place contrary to disease that are diagnosed based on an underlying known pathology and tests try to detect that pathology (or side-effects of that pathology) and the accuracy of the test depends on how good in can detect that pathology. </p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<p>I guess the way I'd do it is I'd just measure a lot of stuff and then see if I can find any significant correlation. Like I have 100 patients with similar symptoms and I check their blood and see that 80 of those patients have more copper in their blood than a healthy control group causing me to think that copper is involved in the pathology then I'd investigate that further and then I notice that their bodies don't process copper as they should and this sometimes causes in 90% of the people with that pathology increased copper blood levels, in 10% we don't see that and the other 10% of my patients turned out to have something that produces the same symptoms but the pathology is something completely different. So I devise a test around that that' measures elevated copper levels which 90% people (with that pathology) have but with some errors and due a cut-off level I have to put somewhere let's say I get about 88% sensitivity and 96% of specificity (because a few people have idiopathic elevated copper levels or something that produces a higher copper level). But I obviously can't really do the same for illnesses where I don't know the pathology because there's zero way of telling who has which pathology. Like depression. If I define depression as 'a.) has low mood on most of the days for at least 6 months' or similar and this is both the test AND the definition of the disorder I obviously get 100% sensitivity, but that's because the test and the definition is the exact same thing and there's no way of determining the specificity because everything that matches my criteria is by definition having this illness I just defined meaning it will match absolutely everything that provokes these symptoms regardless of the pathology so I can't really measure specificity unless I neglect the existence of other diseases producing the same symptoms, in which case I'd get both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity but this is obviously 'cheating' OR if I just define it as co-morbid to some other pathology in every case but that's basically also just a neat 'cheat'?
I could then add a little extra criteria 'b.) not due to some other disorder' but this at least scientifically looks like another 'cheat' because now you don't have a test for anything anymore to begin with. You have a definition, but no test. You can't use a questionnaire anymore. </p>

"What will happen if you keep running? What will eventually cause you to stop?","<p>A more specific form of my question would be, ""Barring mental barriers, what will lead to collapse after extended cardiovascular exercise?""  I was considering asking this in the worldbuilding SE, but I figured that I would get more detailed or realistic answers here.</p>

<p>When you do cardiovascular exercise for an extended period of time, the typical process (pretty much as roughly speaking as possible) is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do the exercise.</li>
<li>Make the conscious decision to stop doing the exercise once you're sufficiently exhausted or once you've exercised for a sufficiently long time.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can make the argument that there are some exercise routines that swap step 2 for ""Get to the point where you can't do the exercise anymore and stop there,"" in which case the decision to stop wouldn't exactly be a conscious decision.  I suspect, however, that even with an exercise routine like that, if someone pointed a gun to your head and told you to keep exercising, then you could probably keep going.  Those mental barriers are just too strong: at some point, your brain will say ""No more!"" before your body does and you will stop prematurely.</p>

<p>In stories that I write, I occasionally run into the scenario of characters in a ""run for your life"" sort of situation, where something is perpetually on their tail that they need to escape from.  They can't slow down or stop: they have to go as fast as they can for as long as they can in order to escape danger.  In this sense, it's like the hypothetical I described: a gun is basically being pointed to their heads and they're being forced to keep running.  At this point, mental barriers are thrown out of the window in order to prevent premature death, so they're not going to get in the way.</p>

<p>But something will eventually.  At some point, the hero will collapse, and I'm interested in knowing what's going on in the body when that point finally happens.  Do the muscles cease their functionality due to a deficiency of ATP?  Do you briefly black out or pass out due to lack of oxygen (or rather, a surplus of CO2) being distributed through the body?  Or is it <em>still</em> going to be a mental barrier that inevitably causes collapse (in other words, will something kick in the brain before other parts of your body fail that will force you to stop running regardless of external stimuli)?</p>

<p>We can assume that prior to the extended sprint, the character is well-rested and hydrated.  If different cardiovascular exercises are expected to yield different results, we can limit things to just running, since that's what I'm primarily interested in.  Also, since many people can jog pretty much indefinitely provided the jog is slow enough, we can assume that the character is continuously exercising at the peak of his or her capabilities.</p>

"Could the cerebral hypoxia caused by voluntarily hyperventilating for an hour (""breathwork"") cause brain damage?","<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> hyperventilating for 60 minutes for psychedelic/meditative/therapeutic effect: is this dangerous?</p>

<hr>

<p>Hyperventilation can lead to cerebral hypoxia, as hypocapnia (reduced CO2 in blood) causes vasoconstriction in the brain along with alkalosis which impairs the ability of the blood to deliver oxygen (Bohr effect). This is all pretty understandable and there's an extremely detailed breakdown of the mechanics and effects of hyperventilation in <a href=""http://www.anesthesiaweb.org/hyperventilation.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this excellent article by an anesthesiologist</a>.</p>

<p>As a result of the hypoxia and alkalosis, hyperventilation can have some pretty psychedelic effects (tingling, numbness, spasms, confusion, disassociation, hallucinations, generally altered state). Some New Age practices take advantage of this (under the term ""breathwork""[1] ), with a whole layer of pseudoscience and/or mysticism on top, but I've tried it once and the effect is real: hyperventilating for that long produces some crazy results!</p>

<p>Hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia is ""well tolerated""[2] but the only concrete info I can find about cerebral hypoxia is that you lose consciousness about 15 seconds after oxygen supply to brain is interrupted, and brain damage can start 4-6 minutes after that. On the one hand, hyperventilation won't even come close to cutting off oxygen supply. On the other hand, these practices can keep this up for an hour. The widely reported ""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choking_game"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">choking/fainting game</a>"" has caused injuries and fatalities, but has components that make it more dangerous - strangulation, pseudo-Valsalva maneuvers, and holding your breath.</p>

<p>How dangerous is this? From what I can tell, mild hyperventilation can cause noticeable mental effects without being dangerous (common in panic attacks for instance). But what if you take it really far? What are some sane limits on duration, and how could you identify that you're getting into dangerous territory?</p>

"Is drug-based liver damage usually traceable to free radical generation?","<p>From my fairly limited understanding, much of the time medications are said to be damaging to the liver, what is meant is that the process of breaking them down causes the formation of free radicals, which then attack the local liver cells. Is this usually the case?</p>

<p>For example, acetaminophen (paracetamol, Tylenol, Calpol, Panadol depending on where you live) is broken down in the liver through three pathways, glucoronidation, sulfation, and a third involving the cytochrome P450 enzymes. This third pathway entails breakdown chiefly by CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 through the intermediate NAPQI, which is a strong oxidizer. Too much acetaminophen, or a little over a long period of time, leads to a buildup of NAPQI, which causes oxidation of liver cells and subsequent liver damage. </p>

<p>Is it the case that <strong><em>usually</em></strong>, when drugs are known to cause liver damage under certain conditions (such as high dosage or extended use), it's because the drug is broken down in the liver into reactive chemical species that cause oxidative stress on the local liver tissues?</p>

"Correct english term for an urgent referral","<p>I am translating a Swedish text, and I am having problems translating the term ""akutremiss"" to British English. The term is commonly used in Swedish healthcare. It is basically a referral, of any type, where the medical issue is urgent. I have done some basic googling on some of the options, just to see which ones are the most commonly used. </p>

healthcare ""acute referral""
19 700

healthcare ""emergency referral""
95 400

healthcare ""urgent referral""
56 800
</code></pre>

<p>The clear winner is ""Emergency referral"". ""Urgent referral"" is the runner up. But I feel there is a big difference in the level of urgency between ""urgent"" and ""emergency"", with an emergency being <em>way</em> more urgent than something which is just ""urgent"", at least to my ears. </p>

<p>Note: I included ""acute referral"", mostly because it is a direct translation of the Swedish term, but it sounds really strange to me. I have never heard anyone use the word ""acute"" to mean ""urgent"". The pages I checked seem to be mostly about eye damage, so perhaps the term is eyes-only (pun intended). </p>

"Health I.D for diabetes - What is the preferred method of identification?","<p>Having <em>type 1 diabetes</em> for a little over a decade now I've never worn an identification to help others know of my condition especially in case of emergencies (<em>such as hypoglycemic attacks - paramedics giving me resuscitation instead of simply giving me glucose</em>).</p>

<p>The problem is that there isn't enough talk on this issue especially in the aesthetics of wearing one, as they look unfitting.</p>

<p>As far as best practices, I think a wristband is the most common method as it's effective (easy to locate). Either I proceed with a Do-It-Yourself initiative to create my own or find some cool looking ones to purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Things to consider:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How often does the ID have to be replaced?</li>
<li>Should it be waterproof?</li>
<li>What material serves best for long term use (if this is preferred)</li>
<li>Should the medical info be stylized as engraved or placed as an attachment?</li>
<li>It's hard to find ones that actually look <strong>cool/neat/practical</strong>.</li>

<p>What ever makes the <em>responder</em> identify the situation quickly enough will help in the worst case scenario or for an emergency. So, for my question what type of accessory would make it easier to identify this particular type of situation? <strong>Ideally a bracelet is the best option</strong>. Otherwise, if a bracelet can't be worn then it would be appropriate to use a necklace instead.</p>

<p>Just make sure the I.D.'s design isn't straying too far away from how medical logos are displayed. Since we are talking about a standard procedure the medical logo (<em>or the Snack-on-a-Pole / SOS</em>) must be visible to any peripheral vision.</p>

<p>Thanks to @PETE, I was now able to understand the <strong>importance of speed</strong> to acknowledge responders to take the appropriate action for person(s) in danger. This is because they were able to locate the information needed as-fast-as-possible without any fuss or delay.</p>

<p>Now, I just wonder if people ever considered using a Tattoo for this case....</p>

"Can a one year old safely follow a ketogenic diet?","<p>My daughter will be one year old soon and she is slowly adapting to eating 'normal' food.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I follow a ketogenic diet (I have been doing this for almost 3 years now and my girlfriend for almost a year). I would like my daughter to also follow a (somewhat) ketogenic diet. I don't intend to leave out all the carbs but where I live there is a big tendency to go really high on the carbs. Eating a lot of bread and drinking a lot of milk and have a lot of potatoes or rice or pasta with your dinner.</p>

<p>In The Netherlands you have 'checkups' on your child for the first four years in a (google translate) 'clinic'. These people measure and weigh the child and give advice on the next period regarding food and mental and physical development. They are now basically saying she should switch from formula milk to regular cow milk. I am not really a big fan of milk (partially to my ketogenic lifestyle) and I was wondering what is in the cow milk that she really needs and can they easily be replaced by other things?</p>

<p>The internet only seems to give me information on ketogenic diets for a child if they suffer from certain types of epilepsy. I do not want to take the gamble and cut out carbs if they somehow are very important to her mental and physical development.</p>

<p>My concrete question would be how can I keep the carbohydrates to a minimum while still making sure my child will remain healthy?</p>

"Can Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome be caused by medication?","<p>According to several medical resources, Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is congenital and caused by mutation, e.g.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene, the gene that codes for the enzyme DHCR7 that normally converts 7DHC to cholesterol in the final step of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. - <a href=""http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/949125-clinical#b5"" rel=""nofollow"">Reference</a> </p></li>
  <li><p>This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.  - <a href=""http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/smith-lemli-opitz-syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">Reference</a>     </p></li>
  </ul>

<p>A friend of mine, who is 4-month pregnant, recently took a medical test giving her a high probability (<strong>1 in 8 as the test paper says</strong>) of SLO Syndrome. She has mistakenly (not knowing she was pregnant) taken Diane-35 under her doctor's prescription for 21 days in her early pregnancy. Now my question is, given that no mention has been made of drug intervention relationship with the syndrome in the medical resources, at least in those I checked, and that she already has a successful pregnancy background, can SLOS be caused due to drugs? In case of abortion, how can she make sure whether she or her husband is carrier of the syndrome for future pregnancies?</p>

"
"Infant has a mastocytoma, any cause for concern?","<p>Our 8-month old son is doing very well so far, developing physically and mentally right in lock step with where the ""developmental miletstones"" say he should be.</p>

<p>At around 4 months of age we noticed he started developing a small red mark on his arm that kept getting a little bit bigger every few weeks. At his 6-month well visit the pediatrician said it was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastocytoma"" rel=""nofollow"">mastocytoma</a>, and that it was nothing to worry about. Furthermore, she said:</p>

<ul>
<li>It might get bigger</li>
<li>It might change color</li>
<li>He may have it for a long time</li>
</ul>

<p>I asked if there were any surgeries available to remove it and she stated that surgical removal often exacerbates them and makes them worse and/or more dangerous.</p>

<p>While this was all very reassuring, it has now almost doubled in size since that 6-month well visit, and is now roughly the size of a thumbtack, so it appears to be picking up ""<em>momentum</em>"".</p>

<p>If you Google mastocytoma, you get back a slurry of articles/blogs/etc. that give mixed information. Some coincide with what the pediatrician said and they state that mastocytoma is nothing to worry about. Others state that while its typically benign, it can become malignant and dangerous under certain conditions.</p>

<p>I guess I'm worried that the pediatrician is simply trying to relieve/placate us by telling us that ""it's alright"". Meanwhile, it's doubling its size every few months.</p>

<p>So I ask: <strong>what presentations in mastocytoma should be worrisome and warrant followup/further investigation?</strong> What signs/symptoms/changes take us from the ""definitely benign"" zone into the murky in-between zone? Would a trip to the dermatologist be a prudent next step?</p>

<p>Essentially, if this is a worrisome case of mastocytoma, I want to address it as aggressively as possible.</p>

"How much risk am I taking by joining my coworkers for smoke breaks?","<p>Several of my coworkers take regular smoke breaks outside the office a few times per day. I don't smoke, but I join them once or twice a day. There are a few reasons why I find it valuable to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>I enjoy the break, and the conversation</li>
<li>Spending time with these coworkers builds my rapport with them</li>
<li>Most importantly, valuable business-related information is often discussed</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm aware of some of the research around secondhand smoke. In particular, I'm aware that it's <a href=""https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/10026/is-there-no-risk-free-level-of-second-hand-smoke"">considered a no-threshold toxicant</a>, which means that the risk increases with exposure, and that even a small amount of exposure can be harmful. Furthermore, the effects of secondhand smoke are <a href=""https://health.stackexchange.com/questions/416/effect-of-cigarettes-on-passive-smokers"">well-known to be harmful</a>.</p>

"Why does icing work best when applied shortly after tendinitis symptoms appear?","<p>It is recommended to apply ice as soon as possible after tendinitis symptoms appear. Is icing quickly after the injury much more effective than after a while (e.g. a few days), and if so why?</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120319084321AAjvZRG"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo answer post</a> by Susan says :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apply ice in the first 48 hours following an injury is effective in
  that it will constrict blood vessels, thereby limiting fluid rushing
  to the area and reducing swelling. The cold can also be helpful in
  pain reduction. With an injury, a knee included, the R.I.C.E. method
  is best to employ- Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. Rest the
  area, apply Ice (15-20 minutes at a time, never directly on the skin
  and always allowing the skin to return to normal body temperature
  before reapplication- this usually means waiting at least 60 minutes
  between applications), Compression as in an Ace bandage or similar
  wrap and Elevating the affected limb on pillows or in a sling above
  the level of the heart. You can take Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen for
  pain relief with Ibuprofen being the better choice due to its
  anti-inflammatory properties. It is best to take it with food. </p>
  
  <p>Icing an injury will not stiffen a joint. </p>
  
  <p>The cons to icing an injury are leaving the ice on for too long a
  period of time or icing the injury beyond the first 48 hours. After
  the first 48 hours, moist heat should be used. </p>
  
  <p>If the patient is undergoing Physical Therapy, often the Therapist
  will begin the session with moist heat to relax and loosen the area to
  be worked and after going through exercises they may apply ice briefly
  in closing.</p>

"Right wrist pain from using computer mouse","<p>I'm Shimmy, almost 30ish, Male, 6', 158 lbs.</p>

<p>In seasons, depending on how heavily I'm sitting at my desk, I suffer from right hand strain and pain.</p>

"Can urinary tract infection be treated by inducing urination?","<p>Urinary tract infection causes dysconfort by giving the urge to urinate even with empty bladder. The one time I had the symptoms (blood in urine, urge to urinate again), I forced myself into drinking too much water so my bladder filled again in a few minutes, so I could urinate. I repeated the process during the course of a few hours, and each time the urine was clearer, and never again I had the symptoms (this was about 4 years ago). Today my girlfriend had the same symptoms, and she used the same procedure. She also went to the hospital, and due to excessive urination, the urine sample she collected for the examination was water-clear. Results came out with no indication of infection, so the doctor sent us home without antibiotics.</p>

"Odd leg swelling","<p>34 year old male. Had a long flight to Cancun Dec 2015, when I arrived my feet and lower legs began to get extremely swollen and red and put me out of commission for the first 3 or 4 days of my vacation.  I saw two doctors there and they couldn't identify it, they thought it was some sort of cellulitis.</p>

<p>Ever since that time, I started getting them regularly.  It started occurring monthly (mid=Jan 2016 was the next time) but around Sept '16 it's been daily.  My shoes hardly fit - I don't tie my laces anymore,  - this IS with compression socks warn each day.  The socks used to help, but now the swelling seems to just force the socks to expand, too.</p>

<p>I've gone through two primary care doc's in this time, and I had two docs in Cancun look at me.  I've had a rheumatalogist specialist look at it, I've had multiple ultrasounds and X-rays on my legs.  My PCP had me go to the ER in Sept for redness developing and I ended up being checked in for 3 days with bag after bag of different antibiotic IVs (at least 3 or 4 types) and then I was sent home with amoxicillin (which I discovered I was allergic to). Since then, I haven't had a single day where the swelling wasn't there. </p>

<p>I get intense leg cramps, my toes will get sharp pains and go numb/purple sometimes. </p>

<p>The various doctors keep suggesting Buergers and Cellulitis and maybe some other stuff, but I wasn't diagnosed with anything (why not?).  After some time with this and lots of reading, I don't think it's Buergers anymore.</p>

<p>I had extremely high IgA and ALT levels on my blood test results 3 times, then suddenly they were normal on the 4th test (not sure if this is anything related).  </p>

"Does photographic (eidetic) memory exist or is it a medical myth?","<p>I was always under the impression that photographic, aka eidetic memory (from the Greek word for ""form""), was a genuine, realistic condition.

<p>However, this idealized ""photographic"" memory has seem more and more of a myth. Sure, some are born with a keen sense of memory than others, but they aren't just born with a photographic memory, but that this is something that they have to train their brains to do (I'm not sure if their memory/brain exercises will ever reach the degree of ""photographic"" -- does anyone know)?

<blockquote>
  <p>Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public in East Asian countries to <strong>reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases</strong>; in Japan, it is common to wear a face mask whilst ill to <strong>avoid infecting others in public settings</strong>.

<p>My understanding is, if you only have, say, only 2 cold symptoms, it's better (or at least, <em>not worse</em>) to simply take the individual medications that treat the symptoms separately rather than some ""combination"" drug that also treats other symptoms you might not have.<br>
At best, that would seem like a waste of the drug, and at worse, it might have side effects.</p>

<p>To be 100% crystal clear, <strong>I'm assuming a reasonably intelligent layperson</strong> here who pays attention to the active ingredients and the dosages and who doesn't blindly mix and match. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm NOT asking about mixing e.g. Topcare Acetaminophen + Tylenol Cold, which would double-dose the acetaminophen and potentially cause liver damage. I'm assuming no overlap of active ingredients.  </li>
<li>I'm NOT asking about mixing 4 drugs at 2x the dosages that they would be found in a combination drug. I'm assuming the dosages are close to what they would be in the combination drugs.</li>
<li>I'm NOT asking about mixing Ibuprofen + Acetaminophen, or Ibuprofen + Dextromethorphan HBr for that matter. Again, this is because I'm assuming the combinations taken are already obviously found in existing OTC drugs on the shelf at similar dosages, and in this example they're not.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given these, am I correct that it's better (or not worse) to treat the individual symptoms here, or is it worse? For example, might I overdose on the <em>inactive</em> ingredients, or might they interact dangerously?</p>

Moreover, a sleep doctor I had once said that it's normal and healthy for the body to turn over several times while sleeping, if only to improve circulation and decrease stiffness. </p>

"Survival Cannibalism: extreme starvation lead to pica disorder then to cannibalism? What is ""edible""?","<p>Desperate times call for desperate measures. I've been reading a lot about the Donner Party who came to a screeching halt on the Sierra Nevadas when snowstorms and starvation killed the majority of the party, the first settlers of Jamestown who faced certain death due to starvation, and last, but not least, the rugby team aboard a Uruguayan flight that crashed into the Andes, and their desperate attempts to survive. All of these truly unfortunate atrocities have two things in common: <strong>starvation and cannibalism.</strong> </p>

<p>I have a number of questions relating to Survival Cannibalism (which is what the above incidents are about). In all cases, survivors tried to avoid eating their deceased counterparts at all costs, I'm sure, so I'm wondering...</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>did they first developed pica disorder, where they craved other items instead? Like leather shoes, fur jackets, wagon canvases,
etc?</strong> <em>Are those even edible?</em>  Or is it not considered genuine pica
disorder because ""desperate times  call for desperate measures,"" and
it's not like they were craving that over a nice hamburger and steak
fries. It's just that those were the only things available besides
their deceased loved ones?</li>
<li>When they eventually did start consuming their deceased friends and
family, <strong>what parts of the body were the most edible? Or the most
commonly consumed areas?</strong> (As I imagine that the survivors wouldn't
want to look at the face of the dead as they cut them as it would
exacerbate survivor's guilt all the more)?</li>

  <p>""My 16 year old son used to take weed, XANAX, and Adderall and I was easily able to tell when he was high on any of them. He somehow managed to get a medical marijuana prescription so now I just have to let go of the fact that he can smoke weed. </p>
  
  <p>""He recently moved on to methamphetamine and I have no way of telling weather he is high or not. I tried comparing Adderall reviews to methamphetamine and from what I garnered meth is the same as Adderall but without the side effects such as the speedy talking and weirdness, but much higher neurotoxicity.</p>
  
  <p>""We have a hidden camera in our kitchen and I saw him take meth on the kitchen table. When I came home I tried noticing any signs of him being high, but I couldn't find any. Unlike Adderall, he talked completely normally. He did all his homework and chores and even took pride in it, and on top of that studied math even when he didn't have to. He normally finds all of that boring and rarely does it. I didn't want to let him know we had a camera in the kitchen, and I didn't want him to think that the completion of his chores and homework was a sign of him using drugs, so I stayed quiet. He was up until 4am practicing for a test that he had 2 days later, and whenever I walked in, he wasn't playing any video games and actually studying. I have never seen him this way (working so hard without going behind our back to play games), but again, I don't want to make him think its a sign that he using meth.</p>
  
  <p>""His grades changed to A's and B's once he started using meth, but I know how neurotoxic it is, and that the long term effects are extremely terrible, and I hate to admit it but meth turned him into a better person, but only when he's on it, when he gets off it he is much worse then he was before.</p>
  
  <p>""Eventually I asked him straight-up if he was any drugs besides what I knew, and whenever he is on meth he is extremely honest so he admitted to his use. He claimed it isn't a problem and that he takes 40mg every 2 days orally and that he lets the comedown happen, but I know that meth is really bad long term so I don't want him taking it.</p>

"Which blood test results would most indicate further testing for cancer?","<p>As a member of the healthcare community, I've long been taught (as we have all) that test results are only valid in the context of symptoms and at the discretion of a healthcare professional.</p>

<p>That being said, preventative medicine has long suffered at the hands of treatment-based medicine, and at present the cost of routinely conducting tests for the most dangerous of medical conditions is prohibitive for most. In the interest of promoting preventative medicine, what if routine, inexpensive blood tests were used as a prescreening for further condition-specific testing, rather than strictly as an accompaniment to patient complaints of symptoms?</p>

<p>To zero in on one common and dangerous category of conditions in particular, which test results in common blood tests (CBC, CMP, etc.) would most indicate, with high sensitivity and irrespective of symptoms or whether the patient is even experiencing symptoms yet, further testing for potential cancer cases?</p>

"Is a taste test a reliable way to determine mineral deficiencies?","<p>I stumbled across a rather odd class of products online, dubbed ""trace mineral taste test kits"". I won't link to them because it'll probably trigger all the spam filter bots, but a typical product description is as follows (emphasis mine):</p>

  <li>Zinc </li>

  <p>To Test - Sip a small portion. Swish the liquid about the mouth, you may discard or swallow. The mg. Content of each mineral per taste test is insignificant. </p>
  
  <p><strong>You need this mineral if the taste is sweet, pleasant or no taste. You have an adequate amount of the mineral if you taste something. You don't need this mineral if the taste is so-so, you don't like it, or it's pretty bad.</strong></p>

<p>At a glance this seems to be a bit of pseudo-science to me. On the other hand I do know that e.g. food tastes better when I'm hungry, water tastes better when I'm thirsty, etc.</p>

<p>Is this based in truth? Are mineral deficiencies, at least the ones in that list, self-identifiable based on the ""pleasantness"" of the taste? I'm primarily looking for answers backed by concrete, peer-reviewed studies from reliable sources.</p>

"Are all Infants' Aquatic Instincts lost after 7ish months? Can they be maintained if skills are utilized often?","<p>Babies have extraordinary instincts upon their arrival just into this world. It just happens naturally. One of these is of the swimming variety as witnessed in this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mr47DJIuTc"" rel=""noreferrer"">Underwater Baby Divers</a>. Who knew!?! </p>

<p>The trait we just witnessed in this video is  described in this article,
<a href=""http://www.livescience.com/20802-newborn-baby-skills.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Life Science: 5 Incredible Baby Skills</a>, known as: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the <strong>""diving reflex,""</strong> also known as the <strong>bradycardic response</strong>; also
  exhibited by seals and other aquatic animals, the instinct may be a
  vestige of our ancient marine origins.</p>
  
  <p>It works like this: Infants up to 6 months old whose heads are
  submerged in water will naturally hold their breath. At the same time,
  their heart rates slow, helping them to conserve oxygen, and blood
  circulates primarily between their most vital organs, the heart and
  brain. The survival response keeps accidentally submerged babies alive
  much longer than adults would survive underwater.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another astounding video to watch is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU-LRUc8TSE"" rel=""noreferrer"">Babies Swimming</a>, but it is almost 4 minutes long and has uber cheesy music in the background. </p>

<p>A scientific/medically based article is found here: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12022304"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bradycardic response during submersion in infant swimming</a></p>

<p>Now these infants aren't engaging in synchronized swimming extravaganzas or anything of that nature, but what they are capable of doing just on instincts is incredible!!!  I imagine this is a vestige of a positive evolutionary trait. For example, if an infant slipped into a lake while mother was bathing nearby, etc. etc. etc. </p>

<p>NOW TO MY QUESTIONS: </p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Why do infants lose these instincts around 7ish months?</strong> </p>

<p>--- Is it because they are not <strong>as</strong> vulnerable?</p>

<p>--- Or that they are larger and have more strength and their reflexes don't work the same? </p>

<p>--- Or they simply forget because their minds are being filled with other important pieces of information?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> If under the watchful eye of a professional trainer, lifeguard, parent, etc., the infant <strong>utilized these skills frequently, would they be able to maintain their ""diving reflex"" beyond the 7ish month period?</strong> </p>

<p><sub> To be clear I do not advocate at anytime that these infants have advanced swimming capabilities to swim alone... so <strong>never leave a baby or child unattended near a body of water</strong> </sub></p>

"Why do we need a rabies vaccine after exposure?","<p>So I understand the need for rabies vaccination ""before"" exposure since the vaccine basically prepares the immune system, so that in the future should the same intruder enter the body again, the immune system already knows how to handle it.</p>

<p>What I dont understand however is the need of an immediate rabies vaccine for a person after he/she has been exposed to rabies virus (bitten, scratched by a rabid dog) , assuming he/she has not been vaccinated before.</p>

<p>The rabies virus is already in the saliva of the rabid animal right? and the immune system should already start making the necessary antibodies to counter it right? What's the purpose of injecting a weaker version of the virus if the immune system is going to create the antibodies anyway? </p>

<p>Is the immune system more effective, efficient and quick in creating a solution if it is introduced to a much weaker version of the virus? And after figuring out a ""fix"", it applies this to the original, strong version of the virus? </p>

<p>Or is the immune system not very responsive to the original virus and it must be ""triggered"" first to create the necessary ""fix"" by introducing a weaker version with which it is more responsive?</p>

<p>In any case, I'm quite lost on this.</p>

"Why does breathing stop during cardiac arrest?","<p>I've been reading about resuscitation, and found several suggestions that people don't continue breathing after effective heart function stops because the diaphragm quickly runs out of oxygen.  Is this correct?</p>

<p>As best I can tell, current conventions are to continue to attempt resuscitation so long as brain stem cells are likely to stay alive, which, at normal body temperature, seems to be somewhere around 5 minutes after loss of pulse.</p>

<p>But while the brain stem is alive, does the respiration center not continue to (try to) breathe?  If so, does the diaphragm really use all of its blood's reserve oxygen in just a few breaths, and simply not have energy to breathe?  If not, is there some other effect that impairs breathing when the heart is not pumping effectively?  I <em>suspect</em> it's the latter, since otherwise CPR would never include respiration, and effective CPR would be evidenced by the subject's breathing.</p>

"Did my dentist lie to me?","<p>I went to the dentist a couple of years ago for a diagnosis of my jaw clicking.

<p>now he told me to lift my arm. I did, and he was easily able to push my arm down. He told me my misaligned jaw meant that my muscles were off centre and therefore weak. He then moved my jaw until the top and bottom teeth were centered and made me bite onto a popsicle stick. Now he told me to put my arm out and when he tried to push it down he said he couldn't because i am much stronger now. He prescribed me a $2000 AUD pair of braces that i can put on and off, which will fix my TMJ. He said it could take a few months, he said it could take a few years, but it will eventually be cured. Back then i was still a kid living with my mum and I told her the TMJ joint disorder made my jaws lock when i opened my mouth and i couldn't eat so she ended up buying it for me. I wore it for about a week and it just felt like it was making things worse. so i stopped wearing it and after about 3 days it got better. 3 months after that i went to the dentist again who said i got much better.

"Food sanitation","<p>After getting ill due to bad sanitation of ingredients I decided to know a little better of the process of food hygienization.</p>

<p>It first occurred to me that a good first step would be to use lots of strong antibacterial products. Later on after reading I realised that most elements 'that-are-not-the-food-itself' (dirt &amp; etc) are either water soluble or fat soluble, that means if you apply water combined with soap most of the stuff will go away (suppose you had sugar coating the food and olive oil, they would be rinsed).</p>

<p>If you went one step further and used an antibacterial product chances are you would probably get rid of anything that could do harm to your health.</p>

<p>My question is</p>

<p>a) are there any other big group of components that aren't neither water nor fat soluble and could be hazardous?</p>

<p>b) talking about general food sanitation which is usually more effective?</p>

<ul>
<li>the chemical act of removing through soap and water</li>
<li>killing bacteria and other harmful organisms using antibacterial products</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other general thoughts about sanitation is appreciated since this is a very important question of notorious public concern and I couldn't find expert opinions on the subject</p>

Most common idea is what by practicing clenching of ones pubococcygeus (PC) muscle just before a point when the process of ejacuation begins, a male can achieve orgasm without ejacuating or rest/refactory period.
Question is: out of these options (or other which are not listed here) which is the true one?

2. The ejacuation still continues to the next available ""outlet"", i.e. the bludder?</p>

In the film, he briefly talked about people being blood tested in order to get some insights if they are vitamin and/or mineral deficient.</p>

<p>So I was wondering: When we as humans have to pretty much constantly get the vitamins our body needs to function right, can a blood test really give meaningful insights of a vitamin deficiency?</p>

<p>For example, if the day (or even week) before the blood test I eat less water-dissolvable vitamins like vitamin C than usual and than needed. Would that show a deficiency in the blood test thus leading to false results? Or would a deficiency only appear after a month, two, three? Or even half a year?</p>

Only found some forum posts or non-scientific articles of random people claiming things like ""Vitamin B gets flushed out like every day or so"", which is not really specific or backed up by any literature/study. I don't really have access to any physical literature or something similar.</p>

"Common to panic/have trouble breathing when an oxygen mask is placed over nose and mouth prior to surgery with anesthesia?","<p>I had my 17th surgery yesterday so it's fair to say I've been around the ""hospital"" block quite a few times and know what to expect on the patient side of things. </p>

<p>Everything went as expected up until I was on the operating table and they were administering the general anesthesia to put me to sleep, and they put a breathing mask full of oxygen covering my mouth and face.  (This was as expected too as I recall this happening prior to all my other surgeries). But this time, as soon as they put the oxygen over my nose and mouth, I felt like I couldn't breathe. I had a hard time breathing, and wanted to rip the mask off because I started panicking that I actually was not breathing (even though I logically knew there was an oxygen mask over me). But the mask made me hyperventilate instead, and my lungs started to hurt. Thankfully, this experience was only 30-40 seconds of panic before I drifted off to sleep.</p>

<p><strong>Why a mask of oxygen over mouth &amp; nose while general anesthesia is administered to knock one out for surgery?</strong> <em>Common to feel like you can't breathe when it's placed over the mouth and nose?</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is it because some patients may have trouble breathing during the first few moments of the induction of anesthesia? (Like the sensation of not feeling able to breathe was not the oxygen mask, but the general anesthesia entering the body, impacting breathing system). </p></li>
<li><p>Or do the oxygen masks contain so much oxygen that the body has a hard time breathing it. (Like the amount/% of oxygen being pumped in a LOT of oxygen in the lungs all at once, and the lungs start to hurt?)</p></li>
<li><p>Or... simply that mini panic attacks can ensue as instinct doesn't appreciate something over the nose and mouth and wants to throw the mask off. And this causes one to get anxious and hyperventilate?   </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Basically, why the need for the breathing mask at first? And is it common to find it harder to breathe?</strong> </p>

I must've read this article a year ago or so, and the article itself is likely even older. The article claimed that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Attempts were made to invalidate the J-shaped curve by pointing out that teetotallers' life expectancy is reduced by the presence of former alcohol addicts in this group;</li>
<li>The studies were repeated, explicitly removing former alcohol addicts from the group of teetotallers, and the J-shaped curve persisted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nonetheless, as we can see, nowadays we have multiple claims from medical authorities that alcohol is harmful in any quantities, that even moderate or light drinking does one no good and that to minimize risk, a consumption of 0g of ethanol should be recommended.</p>

<p>Isometric exercises involve contracting muscles without moving your joints or muscles. That means immobilized muscles can still be exercised.</p>

<p>Would they be enough to prevent a permanent loss of independence like in seniors who fractured their hips?</p>

<p>Is it possible that we don't aggressively and promptly push the exercise program because we're ignorant of the possibility of preventing a loss of independence?</p>

<p><strong>Possible challenges</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Patients may not know how to activate all of their muscles. At certain positions, some muscles may be easier to activate than others. For example, you may find it easier to flex your gastrocnemius muscles with your legs straight than with your knees bent.</li>
<li>Patients may need to be trained how to activate all of their target muscle groups at the right intensity. Even very sedentary individuals may have full recruitment at least for a brief time multiple times a day, possibly protecting against a loss of muscle mass.</li>
<li>The therapist may not be able to tell whether the right muscle groups were activated or if there was 100% muscle recruitment.</li>
<li>It's possible that the protection is limited to activated muscle fibres. That means if the exertion was at less than 85% of one rep max, the largest motor units could lose their satellite cells while those of the smaller motor units may be spared. This can decrease maximum strength since there's effectively fewer muscle fibres, and decrease endurance since larger motor units are recruited later in exhaustive exercises.</li>
<li>Patients have to consciously activate their muscles. For example, our foot muscles, and muscles that moves our legs and feet sideways subconsciously get used when walking but leg curls and extensions may not properly activate them. If those postural muscles are permanently weakened, it can increase the susceptibility to injuries through poor form, and cause balance issues.</li>
</ul>

Electrical stimulation at 20 Hz in mice for 3h can suppress satellite cell apoptosis when immobilized. This seems like isometric than concentric or eccentric exercise but much longer.

If the patient is in cardiac arrest OR cannot maintain airway or breathing they are to go to the CLOSEST hospital regardless if it is a trauma centre or not.</p>

<p>If patient is not in cardiac arrest and can maintain airway or breathing, physiological and anatomical criteria will be applied to decide if they need to go to a trauma centre. If they fit ANY of the criteria below, they will be transported to a trauma centre.</p>

<p>Physiological Criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>GCS &lt; 14</li>
<li>systolic BP &lt; 90</li>
<li>Respiratory rate &lt; 10 or > 29 per minute</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Flail chest</li>
<li>2 or more long bone fractures</li>
<li>amputation proximal to wrist or ankle</li>
<li>penetrating trauma to head, neck or torso</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The YouTube video is set to start at the relevant segment and is only about 3 minutes long</p>

<p>If you'd prefer a link to literature rather than a video clip, Rankin refers to Herbert Benson.

<p>My layman summation of Lissa Rankin's point: When a relaxation response is activated, mental stress in the body is reduced and chemicals like oxytocin, dopamine, and endorphins are released. Certain natural healing mechanisms flourish in this state. Placebo effects basically result from an activation of this relaxation response, but you can also do things like meditate or get a massage to tap into that relaxation response to some extent.</p>

In other words: are these ingredients in so small amounts in there so that they can't be harmful? </p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> some of the ingredients contained in modern toothpaste that cause the greatest concern for me are: fluoride, triclosan, SLS, glycerin, artificial color…</p>

"How can genital herpes be transmitted even with a condom?","<p>I have read from various sources that, although the use of a condom does reduce the risk of transmission, it does not completely rule it out.</p>

<p>Just how does that happen? Assuming that there are no open lesions and that a condom is worn, does the virus get transmitted through unbroken skin? How? Please back your claims with references as to the exact mechanism of transmission.</p>

<p>PS: I am specifically referring to HSV-2, not HSV-1. I am also not referring to the latest trend in the two strains intermixing due to unprotected oral practices.</p>

"Can Asthma lead to a Cardiac Arrest and thus require CPR?","<p>I recently read a story, in the story, there was a person that had a severe asthma attack. Another person came into his rescue and performed compressions and mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>It wasnt stated whether or not the victim of the asthma attack had his heart rate stop at all in the story.</p>

<p>My question(s):<br>
- why was it necessary to do compressions?<br>
- can an asthma attack stop heart rate if its too severe?<br>
(If yes then it would answer the previous question)</p>

"Insulin & break down of different nutrient groups","<p>I have been a type 1 diabetic for over 30 years. According to what I learned during my life from doctors and dietitians, for my age/height/weight, I should take around 6 bread units of carbohydrates per meal (=6*12g= 72g).</p>

<p>The carbohydrates are currently forming around 50-60% of my food intake.</p>

<p>Right now I am looking into increasing my protein intake at the expense of carbohydrates (so that carbs remain around 40% of the daily nutrients), while remaining on the same target calorie amount per day in meals.</p>

<p>As far I understand, insulin regulates <em>all</em> of the nutrient absorption:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Insulin] regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein by
  promoting the absorption of, especially, glucose from the blood into
  fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells</p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, whenever I was talking to doctors, they maintained that I only needed to count insulin needed for eating carbohydrates when planning how much to inject before a meal.</p>

<p>So the question is whether in general <em>less</em> insulin per meal is necessary when consuming more proteins at the expense of carbs? Will the proteins (and fats) be able to be absorbed and used by body without (or with less than usual) insulin? </p>

"Why Dydrogesterone is no longer available in US? Why dienogest is not approved?","<p>Dydrogesterone and Dienogest are very very helpful medications in treating endometriosis condition, and Dydrogesterone helps many women to become pregnant. They are widely used around the world and help a lot of women. </p>

<p>But in US Dydrogesterone was discontinued a long time ago. In US women have access to only a single type of progesterone - Norethindrone or Depo Provera, which is not good in helping with endometriosis or infertility. Dydrogesterone, Dienogest, Desogestrel - are not FDA approved. Why so? So many women suffer from endometriosis and Depo Provera (which is usually prescribed) has sooooo many side effects and fertility restored up to 2 years! Norethindrone or Depo Provera are the worst options for women, and they are the only option available in US. Why is it the case? Why Dydrogesterone was discontinued?</p>

"Effectiveness of blue light filters for preventing delayed and decreased melatonin secretion?","<p>The iPhone offers a ""night shift"" feature. Research indicates that blue light exposure decreases melatonin secretion (e.g., Ferguson, Melton, Li, Park, &amp; Tosini, 2008). </p>

<p>To what extent do built-in blue light filters on electronic devices decrease blue light emission? Is the software program, F.lux, any better? </p>

"Can the foods you have been eating be detected through blood tests?","<p>I know that things like sodium, cholesterol, and sugar levels can be found in blood (at least I think so.) But what about things like fruits and veggies? Can that be detected through bloodwork? Or would you only be able to see the chemicals/molecules that it has broken down into?</p>
